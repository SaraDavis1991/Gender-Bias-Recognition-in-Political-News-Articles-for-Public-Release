Fox News\u00a0Senior Political Analyst\u00a0Brit Hume offered up that assessment during an appearance on \"America's Newsroom\" on Tuesday, saying the former Veep's strong support might not last all the way into 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s ahead in the polls. He has held the most senior office of anybody in the field having been vice president,\" Hume said. \"So, he\u2019s going around acting like he\u2019s the nominee and is engaged in a general election campaign in the fall against President Trump. It\u2019s, I guess, nice work if you can get it. I don\u2019t know how long it can last. WARNING SIGNS FOR TRUMP AS NEW POLL SHOWS BIDEN, OTHER DEMS WITH 2020 EDGE TRUMP SLAMS BIDEN AS 'WEAK MENTALLY' AS POTENTIAL 2020 FOES STORM IOWA \u201cMy sense is he can\u2019t go on forever ignoring the rest of the Democratic field, but I don\u2019t blame him for trying to make it last as long as he can.\" Biden and President Trump will both duke it out in Iowa in separate speeches -- an agricultural state the president won handily in the 2016 election. This after he skipped an event with other Democratic contenders this weekend. A copy of Biden\u2019s prepared remarks in Davenport, Iowa,\u00a0was released to Fox News from a source at his campaign. He said farmers have been \u201ccrushed\u201d by the president\u2019s tariff war with China. Biden also says that the president makes the wrong choices and is \u201cmotivated by the wrong thing.\u201d \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s being tough. Well, it\u2019s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain,\u201d Biden said. CNN CRITICIZED FOR CHYRON CLAIMING BIDEN WILL 'EVISCERATE' TRUMP IN CAMPAIGN SPEECH BIDEN TO SLAM TRUMP AS 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' DURING DUELING IOWA STOPS On the way to Air Force One on Tuesday afternoon, the president called Biden the \u201cweakest mentally\u201d on the Democratic candidates, a \u201cdummy\u201d on China, and a loser. \u201cWhen a man has to mention my name 76 times, he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d he mused. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president predicted he would win Iowa, Texas, and Pennsylvania by \u201ca lot.\u201d He won Iowa in the 2016 election.

Baier referenced\u00a0Biden's time on the campaign trail in Iowa this week and said the former vice president shouldn't take anything for granted in a crowded Democratic field. JOE LIEBERMAN PRAISES TRUMP'S CHINA STRATEGY, SAYS BIDEN FLIP-FLOPS \"[Biden] is trying to be [the] nominee in waiting and sometimes that works.\u00a0Sometimes it does not as we saw last time,\" he said. \"And like President Trump did with Jeb Bush he's\u00a0trying to label him as you know -- low energy, sleepy, however\u00a0you want to call it. So Biden has to push back against that.\" Baier said Biden is trying to create a one-on-one matchup with the president to increase his overall media coverage and offer a boost to his fledgling poll numbers. JOHN SUNUNU ON JOE BIDEN'S LEAD SLIPPING IN IOWA: HIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 'A LITTLE BIT INEPT' \"He did have yesterday, the one-on-one and a lot of coverage just because of that. And he's looking for more, I think, of those days to happen so that he can appear to be the one candidate who's going head-to-head,\" Baier\u00a0said. \"I will say one thing about those polls early on, the head-to-head polls. You know, if you go back in history to really any incumbent that is facing a challenge, about this time you can see that the polls are 10, 11, 12 points for the opponent. And when push comes to shove to the election it doesn't turn out that way,\" he added. \"So we'll see what happens this time.\" Trump first referred to Biden as \"sleepy joe\" in May on Twitter, before adding photos of the former vice president getting up close and personal with various women. Trump also called Biden \"mentally weak\" as he departed the White House on Tuesday. Biden branded Trump a \"clown\" during\u00a0a South Carolina fundraiser last month after he was asked if he had a nickname for the Commander-in-Chief. \u201cThere\u2019s so many nicknames I\u2019m inclined to give this guy,\u201d\u00a0Biden said, according to Politico. \u201cYou can just start with clown.\u201d",

RYAN DOESN'T BACK OFF COMMENT THAT BIDEN'S 'DECLINING' Jabbing at Biden in early September, Ryan made headlines by telling Bloomberg News that\u00a0he didn\u2019t think the 76-year-old Biden\u00a0\"has the energy\" to be president. \"You see it almost daily,\u201d he said. Asked about those comments two days later at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention,\u00a0Ryan\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWe have got to have a very crisp, sharp, articulate message for the people going into the fall with Donald Trump\u2026.It\u2019s unclear sometimes when he\u2019s (Biden) articulating positions and I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d A few weeks later,\u00a0speaking with Fox News,\u00a0the 46-year old Ryan\u00a0highlighted Biden\u2019s age, saying, \u201cI think a generational change is what we need.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign spelled trouble for Ryan ever since the former vice president jumped into the race in late April. Ryan was a center-left candidate who touted his heartland heritage and his ability to connect with the white working-class voters in the Rust Belt who helped elect Trump in 2016\u00a0 by giving him crucial states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN But Biden also highlights his working-class roots and his ability to connect with blue-collar voters. And Ryan \u2013 struggling to gain traction and failing to make the autumn debate stage \u2013 ended his White House bid on Oct. 24. But even while he was critical of Biden during his campaign for the president, Ryan repeatedly noted that he greatly respected the former vice president. And in announcing his endorsement on Wednesday, Ryan spotlighted:\u00a0\u201cI know that Joe will be a voice for the many who are being left behind \u00a0\u2014 workers losing their jobs to automation, unions fighting for fair wages, small business owners trying to get ahead. Joe knows that working communities built America, and I know that Joe will go to bat for them as an increasingly globalized economy threatens the very work they do.\u201d",

Biden's sudden shift last night illustrates the party's growing intolerance for any moderate views on the hot-button topic. \u2026Biden announced the change during a speech yesterday at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s African American Leadership Council summit in Atlanta. The presidential candidate told the crowd that, in an environment where the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion is under attack in GOP-led states, he could no longer support a policy that limits funding. \u2018We\u2019ve seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws,\u2019 Biden said. \u2018It\u2019s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe.\u2019 \u2018Circumstances have changed,\u2019 he said. Biden was under intense pressure from abortion rights groups and nearly every one of his Democratic opponents in 2020, who want to erase the ban known as the Hyde Amendment.\u201d\n\nHow Biden\u2019s staff rolled him -\u00a0The Atlantic: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s aides knew the 2020 frontrunner was going to get ripped apart over his support of the Hyde Amendment... They were frustrated that the former vice president wouldn\u2019t change his stance, and that he wasn\u2019t initially receptive to their concerns. \u2026 This was a tense two days in Biden\u2019s D.C. headquarters. The candidate was caught off guard after an\u00a0NBC News story\u00a0published Wednesday morning attempted to nail down where he stands on abortion policy\u2014specifically Hyde.\u00a0Symone Sanders, one of Biden\u2019s senior advisers, confronted him, she confirmed to me Thursday night, telling Biden that he was missing how his position disproportionately affected poorer women and women of color without easy access to abortion.\u00a0Alyssa Milano, the actress who\u2019s become a major online presence on issues of women\u2019s rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager\u00a0Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change.\u201d\n\nVoters overwhelmingly back Roe and abortion restrictions -\u00a0NPR:\u00a0\u201cThree-quarters of Americans say they want to keep in place the landmark Supreme Court ruling,\u00a0Roe v. Wade, that made abortion legal in the United States, but a strong majority would like to see restrictions on abortion rights, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. What the survey found is a great deal of complexity \u2014 and sometimes contradiction among Americans\u2026 Almost two-thirds of people said they were either somewhat or very dissatisfied, including 66% of those who self-identify as \u2018pro-life\u2019 and 62% of those who self-identify as \u2018pro-choice.\u2019 \u2026 A total of 77% say the Supreme Court should uphold Roe, but within that there's a lot of nuance \u2014 26% say they would like to see it remain in place, but with more restrictions added; 21% want to see Roe expanded to establish the right to abortion under any circumstance; 16% want to keep it the way it is; and 14% want to see some of the restrictions allowed under Roe reduced. Just 13% overall say it should be overturned.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy has government been instituted at all?

Although\u00a0Africa Speaks\u00a0sounds undeniably like a Santana album, with Carlos\u2019 fiery guitar bursts and reedy-voiced singer\u00a0Buika\u2019s Spanish-language\u00a0exclamaciones, it explodes from the start with African rhythms and a unique freedom to the way the group plays the songs. \u2026 Fifty years after his \u2018Soul Sacrifice\u2019 made hippies\u2019 jaws drop all over Woodstock,\u00a0Carlos Santana\u2019s guitar playing remains a force of nature.

The group reportedly recorded some 49 songs over a 10-day session with producer\u00a0Rick Rubin\u00a0and picked 11 to finish off for\u00a0Africa Speaks; the record is just the songs they that moved them right then and there.

The economy added 75,000 jobs in May, marking the 104th straight month of gains, but pulling back from two months of stronger hiring, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate held steady at 3.6%, a near-50-year low. Wages were up 3.1% on the year in May. Annual pay gains appear to be stabilizing around 3% rather than accelerating in a tight labor market.\u00a0Manufacturers added 3,000 workers to payrolls, continuing a weak streak for a sector most tied to trade tensions and slowing growth abroad. But state and local government payrolls, domestic in nature, fell by 19,000, which could show these employers are having a tough time finding workers in a competitive job market.\u201d\n\nBlue collar jobs take the hit -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cManufacturing and construction saw anemic job growth in May with less than 5,000 jobs added in each sector, one of the clearest signs that Trump\u2019s tariffs are having a negative impact on blue-collar sectors the president has been trying to boost.\u00a0\u2018The slowdown is really coming from the sectors that are most susceptible to trade tensions like manufacturing, construction, mining and logging. That does make me worried,\u2019 said\u00a0Martha Gimbel, research director for\u00a0Indeed.com\u2019s Hiring Lab.\u201d\n\nTariffs have already wiped out tax cut savings for middle class -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars have already wiped out all but $100 of the average American household\u2019s windfall from Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law. And that\u2019s just the beginning. That last $100 in tax-cut gains could soon completely disappear -- and then some -- because of additional tariffs Trump has announced. If the president makes good on his threats to impose levies on virtually all imports from China and Mexico, those middle-earning households could pay nearly $4,000 more. Subtract the tax cut, and the average household will effectively be paying about $3,000 more in taxes through additional levies on the products they consume. \u2026\u00a0Here\u2019s how the math works. Middle earners got an average tax cut of $930, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The tariffs already in effect cost the average household about $831, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nBut bad news for workers is good news for Wall Street -\u00a0Fox Business: \u201cWall Street interpreted a surprisingly weak May jobs report -- 75,000 jobs added instead of the 185,000 expected -- as putting more pressure on the U.S. central bank to cut the federal funds rate. The Fed could act as soon as next month to cut interest rates and give the economy a boost. Besides topping 26,000, the Dow was on pace to break a six-week string of losses, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were on track to break a four-week string of declines.\u201d\n\nDNC DEBATE KERFUFFLE CONTINUES\u00a0\nWaPo:\u00a0\u201cThe Democratic Party announced Thursday that it would exclude specific polls from the qualification criteria for the first Democratic presidential debate in June, a change in the official rules that could exclude Montana Gov.\u00a0Steve Bullock. The requirements raise yet more controversy for a debate process that Democratic National Committee Chairman\u00a0Tom Perez\u00a0once described as \u2018open and transparent\u2019 but which has since fallen under intense criticism. Lesser-known candidates have said the rules are distorting the race by heightening the importance of certain campaign tactics and benefiting certain candidates, with one campaign adviser even threatening to organize rival unsanctioned debates this fall if too many candidates are excluded from the official proceedings. Some party members have also complained about being shut out of the process, which has been overseen by Perez, to qualify for events that are expected to be the highest-profile campaign gatherings yet.\u201d\n\nSecond tier candidates feel the heat -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cBut if Bullock does manage to qualify before next Wednesday\u2019s deadline, it could throw the status of other second-tier candidates into doubt, unleashing a complicated set of DNC-written tiebreaker rules that could leave another current officeholder high and dry.\u00a0In order to be eligible for the debates, candidates must cross one of two thresholds: earning 1 percent in three polls approved by the DNC, or receiving donations from 65,000 people, with 200 in 20 different states. Thirteen have met both thresholds and clinched their spots. But there are at least 10 credible candidates bidding for the final seven spots \u2014 a list that includes two sitting senators, three congressmen, a governor, a former governor and the mayor of New York.\u201d\n\nHarris adds to Iowa team -\u00a0Des Moines Register:\u00a0\u201cCalifornia Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0is scaling up her focus on Iowa, promising to bring on at least 65 paid staffers by July and launch a summer organizing push targeted at the precinct level. \u2018It's game on,\u2019 said Harris' Iowa campaign chairwoman,\u00a0Deidre DeJear.\u00a0 Harris so far has lagged behind some campaigns, which have sought to aggressively add staff in the state. In April, her campaign tallied just five paid staffers here while others, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had brought on nearly 50. She's also made fewer visits to Iowa than many of her competitors, holding 17 events over 7 days, according to Des Moines Register data. Harris canceled her most recent Iowa trip to ensure she could vote on the disaster relief bill in the Senate, and a previous trip was derailed because of snow.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nDOJ, Commerce Dept. rejected House Dems\u2019 subpoenas for census docs Thursday\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Politico\n\nPergram: \u2018GOP lawmakers avoid Mexico tariff drama with D-Day ceremonies\u2019\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nInvestigation finds Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar\u00a0violated campaign finance rules\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nReligious activists seek to scuttle Trump court pick\u00a0-\u00a0Politico\n\nAUDIBLE: HONEY BOEHNER DON\u2019T CARE\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Former Speaker of the House\u00a0John Boehner\u00a0said\u00a0at the Mackinac Policy Conference in Michigan on Thursday while sipping on a Bloody Mary.\u00a0\n\nANY GIVEN SUNDAY\n\nThis weekend\u00a0Bret Baier\u00a0will be in for Mr. Sunday.

Watch #mediabuzz Sundays at 11 a.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cI thoroughly enjoy your articles and have been an avid reader for several years. I particularly took interest in this article because my wife was one of those that fled the Soviets from East Prussia in early 1945.\u00a0 She has written memoirs of her fleeing as a 5 and 1/2 year old and also has a letter written by her grandmother about the period.\u00a0 What I wanted to point out was that your statement about the Soviets besieging Berlin 6 months before Allied forces landed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, is not correct.\u00a0 Also my understanding, from my readings, is that we made a decision to allow the Soviets to enter Berlin first. I fully understand that this one sentence was not the thrust and purpose of your article but I just wanted to point out that it is incorrect.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Russ Hoxie, San Diego\n\n\n[Ed. note: Quite right, Mr. Hoxie! I was stretching on my tiptoes to make my point about the Soviet advance. The siege of Berlin by air had been underway for months by Allied bombers, but that\u2019s not the same as being besieged by the Soviets. I\u2019m sorry for the error and it has been corrected online. Thanks for reading and for sharing part of your wife\u2019s remarkable story. And yes, the Allies agreed to let Stalin\u2019s troops take the city. But it would have been very different if the Atlantic powers wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to have done so if need be. Magnanimity is the province of the powerful.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cChris, I think that is probably the best Halftime Report you have written yet! Reagan\u2019s speech epitomizes everything great about good people and our Democratic governments. In a historical sense, the greater we can keep those ideals, the longer our country will last. Rome was 1000 years, ours is only around 250. We have much work to do. Sadly, I feel my generation (x), and those behind have forgotten the history of that day and what it means\u2026 what it turned out to be, and what could\u2019ve been. I\u2019m glad it turned out as it did. Thank you to the Boys of Ponte Du Hoc, and all the Veterans who helped turned the tide to VE and VJ Day.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Andrew Witt, Morgan, Wis.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Witt. But I would also say that the members of what many call \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d would have probably much rather avoided the rise of fascism, two world wars, a global depression and the Spanish flu. The astonishing peace and prosperity of the past three generations has meant that history has not taken the full measure of our generation or the ones that have followed. We have no way to know how we would measure up, and I pray that a merciful God continues to protect us. But I tend to think that we\u2019re made of sterner stuff than you think.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nHE\u2019S GOT YOU THERE, SHERIFF\nWRTV: \u201cA 19-year-old Indianapolis man was arrested and charged with reckless driving after he drove the wrong way on the interstate Wednesday afternoon. Captain\u00a0Robert Harris\u00a0of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department said\u00a0De'Ante Parrish\u00a0was not impaired when drove a black Chevrolet Camaro the wrong way on Interstate 70 east of Greenfield. Parrish told officers at the scene he thought it would be faster if he drove on the other side of the interstate. Harris said Greenfield Police Department Sergeant\u00a0Michael Schwamberger, Hancock County Sheriff\u00a0Brad Burkart\u00a0and Chief Deputy Major\u00a0Robert Campbell\u00a0were returning from a meeting when they saw Parrish and they were able to stop him before any crashes occurred.

      "subtitle": "Biden seeks to bar Giuliani from TV news, after Trump lawyer alleges possible Biden corruption",
      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " Joe Biden's presidential campaign requested in a letter on Sunday\u00a0that major news networks not invite President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China. The Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News\u00a0and CNN to voice \"grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,\" according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter. The memo, drafted by Biden aides Kate Bedingfield and Anita Dunn, continued: \"While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\" GIULIANI WASN'T WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE Should a network choose to book Giuliani, the Biden campaign called for \"an equivalent amount of time\" to be provided \"to a surrogate for the Biden campaign.\" The letter noted Giuliani was not a public official, but Trump's lawyer and personal advisor. Responding to the request, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted: \"Can we request the removal of Democrats on TV that push hoaxes? Wait, but then who would do the interviews?\" Hours earlier, Giuliani made the rounds on several Sunday shows, including \"Fox News Sunday,\" to\u00a0argue that evidence of Biden's possible corruption has been hiding in plain sight for months. Biden\u00a0has acknowledged\u00a0on camera\u00a0that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured\u00a0Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating\u00a0the natural gas firm\u00a0Burisma Holdings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0where son Hunter Biden had a\u00a0highly lucrative role\u00a0on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. \"Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden\u00a0joked at a panel two years after leaving office. Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while\u00a0critics charged\u00a0that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work. REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER\u2019S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE In a combative\u00a0interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed\u00a0Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired. \"I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,\" Giuliani said. \"The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was.\" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had\u00a0pressured him into resigning\u00a0because he was unwilling to drop the case. Later, Giuliani added: \"I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.\" After anchor\u00a0George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back:\u00a0\"How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won\u2019t be [investigated], because they\u2019ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.\" When Stephanopoulos called it \"not true\" that Hunter Biden had taken more than $1 billion from China while the U.S. was negotiating with the country, Giuliani again said the former Clinton administration official was being too dismissive. \"There's evidence that they got $1 billion directly from China, specific date, 12 days after they returned from a trip to China,\" Giuliani asserted. \"There's evidence that another $500 million went in, and there are three partners.\" Giuliani went on: \"Can I -- can I make a contrast? Can I just make a slight contrast with the so-called whistleblower? The whistleblower says I don\u2019t have any direct knowledge, I just heard things. Up until two weeks before he did that, that wouldn't even [have] been a complaint, would have been dismissed.\" That was a reference to an explosive report in\u00a0The Federalist showing that the intelligence community recently changed its form for reporting improper conduct. Earlier this year, the intelligence community's form for whistleblowers explicitly stated that complaints based on secondhand information were not actionable. SCHIFF: AGREEMENT REACHED FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY But, that admonition was removed sometime afterward -- around the time that an unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint, based on secondhand information, alleging misconduct in the White House. Although there has been no strict legal requirement for whistleblower complaints to contain only firsthand information, the previous intelligence community form made it clear that such secondhand complaints would not be investigated as a matter of procedure. Twitter user Stephen McIntyre originally spotted the change in the whistleblower form. Trump and top Republicans called for answers over the weekend as to when and why the form was changed -- and whether the change was made specifically to allow the whistleblower's complaint to proceed. Before Giuliani's interview, former Trump Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert criticized Trump's communications with Ukraine, but said he did not see any evidence of an impeachable offense. Giuliani said Bossert was wrong to imply that Giuliani had ever alleged Ukraine directly participated in the hacking of Democrats' servers in 2016. Speaking separately to Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque. \u201cThe pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,\" Giuliani said, \"which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know\u00a0and when did he know it?\" Giuliani referred to a December 2015\u00a0New York Times\u00a0article about Hunter Biden, Burisma\u00a0and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message. \"The question is,\" Giuliani asked,\u00a0\"when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'\" Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0officials, and President Trump\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid, Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace reported\u00a0on \"Fox News Sunday.\" In addition to Giuliani, Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working \"off the books\" -- not\u00a0within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work. In a tweet Sunday, Toensing called the report \"false\" and embarrassing.\" Wallace, in a statement, responded, \"We stand by our reporting.\" WATCH: GIULIANI\u00a0COMPARES BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS TO ALLEGED CLINTON FOUNDATION 'PAY-FOR-PLAY' For his part, Giuliani insisted he\u00a0\"didn't work with anybody to get dirt on Joe Biden,\" again saying that the information \"was handed to me by the Ukrainians.\" Giuliani stated that so far House Democrats have not subpoenaed him to testify about his work with Ukraine, but if they did he would have to run it by Trump first. \"I'm his attorney, there's something called attorney-client privilege,\" he said. \"That has to be considered even if they don't think he should have attorney-client privilege.\" Democrats have focused on the\u00a0whistleblower's complaint, released last week, which\u00a0cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to secure\u00a0Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration\u00a0reportedly\u00a0began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository only after anonymous leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017. Trump\u00a0suggested during a phone call with Zelensky that Ukraine look into Biden's boast about firing Shokin, after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after\u00a0Trump separately requested as a \"favor\" that Ukraine\u00a0help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the U.S. later released the aid to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians\u00a0were unaware\u00a0the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure from Trump during the phone call to do anything. The whistleblower complaint contained\u00a0several apparent factual inaccuracies, prompting some Republicans to call for an inquiry into the whistleblowers' sources -- and why they didn't make the complaint themselves.

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0told reporters on Wednesday that he was not going to apologize for invoking his ability decades ago to work with two segregationist southern senators to \u201cget things done.\u201d A Fox News camera was rolling when Biden was asked if he was going to apologize for his remarks. The 2020 Democrat hopeful answered,\u00a0\u201cApologize for what?\u201d Biden faced scorching criticism Wednesday from his primary rivals including\u00a0two of the three black candidates running for the White House -- Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California \u2013 who raised serious concerns after Biden highlighted his ability to work with the segregationist senators. BIDEN SLAMMED BY DEM RIVALS FOR HIGHLIGHTING ABILITY TO WORK WITH SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS Booker\u00a0said in a statement he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d Biden had yet to issue an \u201cimmediate apology.\u201d \u201cCory should apologize,\u201d Biden said in response on Wednesday. \u201cHe knows better. Not a racist bone in my body. I've been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period. Period. Period.\u201d Biden made the comments as he was arriving at a fundraising event in Bethesda, Md., on Wednesday evening. Appearing on CNN later Wednesday night, Booker said, \u201cI was surprised he didn't apologize.\u201d He added, \u201cI know that I was raised to speak truth to power and that I will never apologize for doing that. Vice President Biden shouldn't need this lesson and at a time when we have from the highest office in the land divisiveness, racial hatred and bigotry being spewed he should have the sensitivity to know that this is a time I need to be an ally, I need to be a healer, I need not engage in usage of words that will harm folks. And so, this is deeply disappointing.\u201d When asked how he felt about rival Democrats saying he had issues talking about race, Biden answered, \u201cThey know better.\u201d Booker said Wednesday, \u201cVice President Biden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\u201d Harris told Fox News while riding an elevator on Capitol Hill that \u201cit concerns me deeply.\u201d BIDEN HOLDING TOP-DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS AMID ATTACKS FROM RIVALS She continued, \u201cIf those men had their way, I wouldn't' be in the United States Senate and on this elevator right now.\u201d Biden, the clear front-runner in the race for the Democrats' nomination, initially brought up the names of Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia while speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday in New York City. Eastland and Talmadge, two senior members in the Senate when Biden arrived in the chamber in 1973, were firmly opposed to desegregation efforts. \u201cI was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,\u201d the 76-year old Biden said as he briefly imitated the late senator\u2019s southern drawl. \u201cHe never called me boy. He always called me son.\u201d And, he called long-deceased Talmadge \u201cone of the meanest guys I ever knew.\u201d But, discussing the \u201ccivility\u201d in the Senate during the 1970s, Biden said: \u201cWell guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn\u2019t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you\u2019re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore.\u201d The comments were part of Biden\u2019s repeated warnings against Democrats who said it was not worth trying to find compromise with Republicans on the numerous divisive issues that have brought Washington to a standstill. When asked for his reaction to the criticism from his fellow Democrats, Biden said, \u201cWhat I was talking about, I could not have disagreed with Jim Eastland more. He was a segregationist. I ran for the United States Senate because I disagreed with the views of the segregationists [sic] in the Senate at the time.\u201d He added, \u201cAs I led the Judiciary Committee, I was able to pass, what I was talking about was The Voting Rights Act, I was able to pass the voting rights act while, when I was a young senator, when he [Eastland] was still the chairman, he voted against it and we beat him in The Voting Rights Act.\u201d He continued, \u201cSecondly, when I was chairman I extended The Voting Rights Act for 25 years not five years. In addition to that, I made it very clear by the last time as I was on that committee I was chairman of foreign relations but I was a lead Democrat. We extended it another 25 years and we got 98 out of 98 votes for it.\u201d The Voting Rights Act of 1965\u00a0aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote. \u201cThe point I\u2019m making is, you don\u2019t have to agree. You don\u2019t have to like the people in terms of their views. But you just simply make the case and you beat them,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou beat them without changing the system,\u201d he added. Later Wednesday, Biden spoke about the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the guy who got me on the Judiciary Committee, we served from years and years. And we had to put up with the likes of Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cAnd the fact of the matter is that we were able to do it because we were able to win-- we were able to beat them on everything they stood for.\u201d\n\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe in fact detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest.\u201d Biden then brought up The Voting Rights Act once again. \u201cAnd because of Teddy letting me become chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1982, when he moved on to take on Health and Human Services, we were able to do so much. We restored The Voting Rights Act, we did it, and over time we extended it by 25 years not just five years.\u201d Booker, in his statement on Wednesday, emphasized that you \u201cdon\u2019t joke about calling black men \u2018boys.\u2019 Men like James O. Eastland used words like that, and the racist policies that accompanied them, to perpetuate white supremacy and strip black Americans of our very humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have to tell Vice President Biden, as someone I respect, that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together,\u201d Booker added. \u201cAnd frankly, I\u2019m disappointed that he hasn\u2019t issued an immediate apology for the pain his words are dredging up for many Americans. He should.\u201d The political spotlight on Biden\u2019s comments came on Juneteenth, an American holiday that commemorates the June 19, 1865, announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas. The holiday more broadly also marks the emancipation of those held in slavery throughout the Confederacy.

Biden highlighted his work\u00a0with Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia during a fundraiser\u00a0in New York City on Tuesday and said he was able to see past their beliefs for the good of the country. Scarborough\u00a0played a clip of Sen. Kamala Harris D-Ca, criticizing Biden's comments and calling them \"misinformed and wrong.\" She also declined to say if Biden should apologize for his remarks. \"First of all, Kamala -- I\u00a0love Kamala. But Joe Biden didn\u2019t coddle any\u00a0segregationist in anything that he\u00a0said. In fact, I think he called one of them\u00a0one of the meanest people he\u00a0ever met,\" Scarborough said. BETO O'ROURKE: JOE BIDEN WOULD BE RETURN TO THE PAST: 'WE'VE GOT TO BE BOLDER' BIDEN SLAMMED BY DEM RIVALS FOR HIGHLIGHTING ABILITY TO WORK WITH SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS He then compared Biden to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and said bipartisanship, in any form, is usually a good thing. \"If that\u2019s coddling, please stay away from me Joe. Don\u2019t hug\u00a0me, don\u2019t coddle me. That's not coddling.

Now, who was it that says -- was it Rumsfeld that says, you fight on the battlefield with the enemy that's presented to you...\u00a0\u00a0Well, guess what, FDR -- the brilliance of FDR was he could work with Yankees from New England and he could work with segregationists and racists from the south. \"And you know what happened when FDR did that? He\u00a0passed Social Security. He passed\u00a0the New Deal.

He also said the 60 vote threshold in the Senate is the only way to actually change American policy and is\u00a0seldom achieved without some type of unpleasantness. \"FDR didn\u2019t sit\u00a0there and go, 'you know what -- I\u2019m not going to\u00a0deal with the racists in the south.\u00a0Eleanor and I are going to just\u00a0sit here and have tea and we\u2019re\u00a0going to have radio broadcasts\u00a0where we speak in self-righteous\u00a0indignation all day.

Biden made the controversial comments at a fundraiser on Tuesday while speaking on the importance of \"civility\" in politics and the necessity to work with others regardless of their beliefs. The former vice president spoke of the ability to \"get things done\"\u00a0with Sens. James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, both staunch segregationists. Rep. Lewis, a civil rights hero himself, came to\u00a0Biden's defense on Friday while speaking with reporters. He noted that in the Civil Rights Era, he too worked with people who opposed his rights. \"I don\u2019t think those remarks are offensive, they\u2019re in the height of the Civil Rights Movement,\" Lewis said.\u00a0We worked with people,\u00a0and got to know people - there was members of the Klan, people who opposed us, even people who beat us, arrested us and jailed us. JOE BIDEN SAYS CORY BOOKER 'SHOULD APOLOGIZE' FOR SLAM OVER WORKING WITH SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS \"We never gave up on our fellow human beings \u2013 and I would not give up on any human being,\" he continued.

Lewis is not the only one to attempt to quell the criticisms of Biden in light of his comments - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Congressional Black Caucus also spoke out in support of the 2020 presidential candidate. Pelosi described Biden as \"authentic,\" while Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., spoke on his own experience working with President Trump, who represents an administration he disagrees with. \u201cI think we here in the House Democratic Caucus have ourselves taken the position that sometimes you have to work with the opposition to the extent they\u2019re in power without compromising your values if you can get things done,\" Jeffries said. BIDEN DEFIANT AS RIVALS SLAM REMARKS ON SEGREGATIONISTS: 'APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?' Others, however, have spoken out against Biden, including some of his 2020 competitors. Sen. Cory Booker called Biden's approach \"not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\" Former New York Mayor and presidential candidate Bill de Blasio said it's \"past time for apologies or evolution\" from Joe Biden.

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden has raked in millions since leaving office while upgrading his lifestyle substantially, according to a new report -- details that could challenge his 'Middle Class Joe' public persona. Biden, who was never one of the wealthier members of Congress during his decades as a senator, has seen his fortunes turn considerably since the Obama administration thanks\u00a0to speeches and book deals, according to The Washington Post. The Post reported, citing public documents, that Biden was paid as much as $200,000 for some speeches. The former VP\u2019s campaign told the newspaper Biden has given fewer than 50 paid speeches.\u00a0The ex-vice president also got some pricey perks as part of his speaking gigs, including chartered flights, town cars and professional drivers, luxury hotel suites, and reimbursements, according to the report. BIDEN WARNS AGAINST DEMONIZING THE RICH DURING FUNDRAISER: 'RICH PEOPLE ARE JUST AS PATRIOTIC' Meanwhile, Biden has moved into a sprawling mansion outside Washington since leaving the White House. \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d now resides in a 12,000-square-foot home in McLean, Virginia, that comes complete with \u201cfive bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, marble fireplaces, a gym and a sauna,\u201d the report stated.\u00a0The Bidens are renting the home, according to the Post, from multi-millionaire Mark Ein. Zillow estimates rent on the property would set Joe and Jill back almost $20,000 a month. According to property website Zillow, the mansion -- which was owned by President Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, Alexander Haig -- is worth almost $5 million. BIDEN SLAMMED BY DEM RIVALS FOR HIGHLIGHTING ABILITY TO WORK WITH SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS In 2017, the Bidens also purchased a beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for almost $3 million. Fox News contacted the Biden campaign for comment but has not received a response. The report came after the former vice president last week seemed to challenge the narrative building among some in his party when he argued it wasn't always appropriate to \"demonize\" rich people. \"I mean, we may not want to demonize anybody who\u2019s made money,\u201d Biden reportedly said during a New York City fundraiser with wealthy donors. According to Bloomberg, Biden seemed to knock Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., inclination toward\u00a0\"revolution,\" saying that it wasn't the right way to improve economic well-being. DONALD TRUMP JR BLASTS JOE BIDEN, ASKS WHY HE DIDN'T 'CURE CANCER' IN LAST 50 YEARS \u201cWhen you have income inequality as large as we have in the United States today, it brews and ferments political discord and basic revolution,\u201d he said.

A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed 20 percent of voters support\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., followed by 19 percent supporting South Bend, Ind., Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, 17 percent for Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\u00a0and\u00a015 percent for Biden. The poll has a 4.5 percentage point margin of error.

Fifty-two percent of likely Democratic voters surveyed said they could still change their minds before the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic\u00a0presidential primaries, while 46 percent of voters said their mind is already made up.

Biden, the current front-runner\u00a0in the nomination battle, appeared on Friday evening to take a jab at Sen. Kamala Harris of California over a lack of straightforwardness on her support for Medicare for All. At the same time, he singled out Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0for being honest about the ramifications of implementing the single-payer healthcare plan. BIDEN FACES PROTESTS DURING NH CAMPAIGN STOP OVER OBAMA-ERA DEPORTATIONS \"Bernie's been very honest about it. He said you're going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it's going to end all private insurance. I mean, he's been straightforward about it. And he's making his case,\" Biden said after an impromptu gaggle with reporters following a stop at an ice cream shop in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in the White House race. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination, has long pushed for Medicare for All. Sanders touts that under his proposal, premiums, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses would be eliminated, but admits that taxes would increase. Biden is the only one of the top contenders who opposes the plan, in which all Americans would obtain their health insurance from a government operated program like Medicare. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN When asked if other Democratic White House hopefuls are as straightforward about their support for the single-payer system, the former vice president answered, \"well, so far, not. So far, not. They may.\u201d Asked specifically by reporters if Harris has been honest about whether her version of Medicare for All would end private insurance, Biden answered, \"I'll let you guys make that judgment.\" Harris has said her plan would allow private insurance to continue to exist. But during last month\u2019s first round of presidential primary debates, she raised her hand when the candidates were asked whether \u2013 if elected \u2013 they would eliminate private insurance. She later explained that she had misheard the question. In the pivotal moment of that debate, Harris went on the attack against Biden, as she criticized recent comments by the former vice president spotlighting his ability to find common ground during the 1970s with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed, and over his opposition decades ago to federally mandated school busing. Harris has seen her poll numbers soar in the wake of that nationally televised showdown, while Biden\u2019s once big lead in the national and early primary and caucus voting state surveys has started to slip. At those debates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts showcased her strong support for Medicare for All. Warren, along with Harris and two more White House contenders \u2013 Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York \u2013 co-sponsored the 2017 Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders. But Biden has issues with the plan. \"I'm not saying that people will necessarily vote against it,\" he told reporters. But he added: \u201cI think it gets hard to explain it and indicate how you're going to be OK; there's going to be nothing missing, as my mother would say, between the cup and the lip.\" Earlier, at a campaign event in nearby Dover, New Hampshire, Biden emphasized he would prefer to keep the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, but expand it by giving people an option to buy into a Medicare-like program. \u201cKeep Obamacare. Restore the cuts that have been made, and add a public option,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cIf you like your employer insurance, you get to keep it.\u201d Biden, who served eight years as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, infamously called Obamacare a \u201cbig f\u2014king deal\u201d during the bill\u2019s White House signing ceremony in 2010.

BIDEN PUSHES BACK AT BOOKER OVER MASS INCARCERATIONS And asked by Fox News on Thursday if he\u2019ll be more aggressive in next week\u2019s showdown, Biden smiled as he simply teased \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d Biden already has started taking swipes at Sen. Cory Booker's record as Newark mayor, and pushing back at criticism from Sen. Kamala Harris.\u00a0This, after Biden's once large polling lead over his 2020 rivals\u00a0deteriorated following his less-than-stellar performance a month ago at the first round of Democratic presidential nomination debates, when he was cold-cocked by\u00a0Harris. In the defining moment of that debate, the California Democrat criticized recent comments by the former vice president spotlighting his ability to find common ground during the 1970s with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed, and over his opposition decades ago to federally mandated school busing. Biden told reporters following his appearance on Wednesday at the annual NAACP convention that he \"was probably overly polite in the way I did respond to an attack\" in the first debate. The former vice president was anything by \u201coverly polite\u201d this week, as he forcefully pushed back against repeated attacks by another rival \u2013 Sen. Booker of New Jersey \u2013 over Biden\u2019s role as a senator from Delaware in crafting the landmark 1994 crime bill. That\u00a0legislation has been blamed by Booker, Harris, and many other Democrats for contributing to the mass incarceration of black people in the United States. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN After Biden earlier this week unveiled a new, wide-ranging plan to reduce the country\u2019s prison population, reform the nation\u2019s criminal justice system and eliminate racial and income disparities in sentencing \u2013 which would reverse the stricter sentence\u00a0terms for crack versus powder cocaine that were implemented by the 1994 law \u2013 Booker took aim at the former vice president. The senator slammed Biden for being \u201cthe proud architect of a failed system\" and argued that the crime bill \u201cput mass incarceration on steroids and so I'm disappointed that it's taken him so long to own up to that.\u201d But Biden punched back at Booker's claim that he was the\u00a0mass incarceration\u00a0\"architect,\" telling reporters \"Cory knows that's not true.\" The former vice president then jabbed at his rival's record -- criticizing the stopping and frisking of black men by Newark police during Booker's tenure as the city's mayor. He added that during his years as vice president, \"the Justice Department took action against them, held the police department accountable. He (Booker) objected to federal interference.\" Booker disputed those allegations. Biden also turned up on the volume on his criticism of Harris over her support for \"Medicare-for-all.\" BIDEN TARGETS HARRIS OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL At the same time, he singled out another leading 2020 rival \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00a0for being honest about the ramifications of implementing the single-payer health care plan. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination, has long pushed for \"Medicare-for-all.\" Sanders touts that under his proposal, premiums, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses would be eliminated, but admits that taxes would increase. But Harris has said she would implement the plan without raising middle-class taxes. Biden \u2013 who\u2019s the only one of the top contenders who opposes the plan, in which all Americans would obtain their health insurance from a government-operated program like Medicare \u2013 on Wednesday questioned her truthfulness. \u201cI find that people will say they\u2019re for Medicare-for-all but they're not going to tax the middle class because we don't need to do that. Come on. My point is this is a fantasy world here,\u201d Biden emphasized. \"I think we should have an honest debate. Look, you can't go out and you can't run for president and beat Donald Trump without leveling with the American people about what you're going to do and how you're going to pay for it. I'm anxious for that debate,\u201d he added. Biden won\u2019t have to wait long. He'll be standing center stage on Wednesday night, surrounded by Booker on one side and Harris on his other side. Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, noted that there\u2019s a lot on the line for Biden next week. Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hilary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said that \u201cBiden needs to rebound. Biden needs to show people that last time was a fluke.\u201d Biden's new aggressiveness on the campaign trail is a shift from the first two months of his campaign, when he rarely engaged with his rivals. Asked in early June if he would return fire, Biden told Fox News: \u201cI think the worst thing we could do is get into a match where we\u2019re going after each other in the Democratic Party. So I\u2019m going to try my best not to be negative relative to my opponents.\u201d And he said that \u201cjust like I\u2019m not going to go down to Trump\u2019s level when he starts his attacks, I\u2019m not going to go down to anybody else\u2019s level when they start attacks.\u201d But he added he would respond at times to \u201cset the facts straight.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ll respond to assertions. I\u2019m not likely to go and point out what they\u2019re doing.\u201d",

I don't really know his character but he's been in the public eye, Sandra, for so long that for all of a sudden the timing of this, it just seems very convenient,\u201d Trump said on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d \"If I were already in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination I probably would not like to run against Joe Biden.\u201d A number of women have accused Biden in recent weeks of inappropriate, unwanted touching. BIDEN SAYS HE'LL BE 'MORE MINDFUL ABOUT RESPECTING PERSONAL SPACE' SANDERS TEAM DENIES PUSHING BIDEN ACCUSER ALLEGATIONS Biden attempted to tamp down the controversy with a video in which he\u00a0vowed to be \"more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.\" Trump told \"America's Newsroom\" she feels Biden needs to do a little more explaining but believes the former VP should receive the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI take everything with a grain of salt these days because I know what it's like and our family knows what it's like better than anyone to have things said about you and you be accused of things and maybe it's not the full truth,\u201d Trump said. She also addressed the president\u2019s tweet featuring an edited video that poked fun of accusations against Biden. \u201cWe can always count on the president for a little comic relief and a little humor. I think he's having fun with it,\u201d Trump said. When asked by co-host Sandra Smith if the accusations should disqualify Biden from running Trump left that up to Democratic voters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI'll leave that up to the Democrat voters and they can decide,\u201d Trump said. Fox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

Trump was\u00a0responding to mistakes made by Biden on the campaign trail Thursday when he told a crowd in Iowa that \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.\u201d Biden quickly corrected himself after some applause from the crowd at the Asian & Latino Coalition PAC, and finished, \u201cwealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids.\u201d His campaign was also quick to respond to Trump\u2019s zinger with one of its own on Friday. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s deck is all jokers,\u201d a campaign aide told Fox News. Trump has delighted in making fun of Biden for what he sees as Biden\u2019s declining mental capacity. Earlier this week, responding to Biden comparing his rhetoric to that of former Alabama Gov.

But the Suffolk University survey for the Boston Globe released Tuesday also indicates a slip in support for Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0of California when compared with polls conducted prior to the debates. Biden stands at 21 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire according to the survey, with Sanders at 17 percent, Warren at 14 percent, and Harris at 8 percent. Biden stood at 23 percent in an average of the two live operator surveys \u2013 University of New Hampshire/CNN and Saint Anselm College \u2013 conducted in early to mid-July, before the debates. Warren averaged 18 percent, Sanders 15 percent and Harris 14 percent.\u201d\n\nAugust heat will melt Dem field -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cWith two sets of debates and six months of fundraising finished, a new stage is opening in the Democratic presidential primary: The summer slog. For six weeks until the next debate, in mid-September, candidates will shift their focus more completely to the early primary states, grinding through a ritualistic run of picnics, forums, and party fundraisers: The Wing Ding, the Iowa State Fair, the Summer Sizzler, Londonderry\u2019s Old Home Days.\u00a0For the frontrunners, the rigors of a month full of intimate, often less scripted public appearances will present a significant test. But the weaker contenders will also come under considerable pressure. Some will likely begin running out of money or will fail to qualify for the next set of debates, culling the now-sprawling field.\u201d\n\nHarris and Booker attended church where previously called gay sex a sin -\u00a0The Mercury News:\u00a0\u201cPresidential candidates Kamala Harris and\u00a0Cory Booker\u00a0attended services this weekend at a Baptist church led by a pastor who\u2019s called being gay a sin \u2014 \u2018enough to send you to hell\u2019 \u2014 and Bernie Sanders held a town hall at the church last month.

Fowler Sr.\u2019s position on homosexuality when they campaigned at Las Vegas\u2019 Victory Missionary Baptist Church, but his views are hardly a secret: A 2017 Las Vegas Review-Journal column about his perspective on gay rights shows up on the first page of results for a Google search of his name. \u2026 The visits to the church illustrate potential hazards as Democrats vie for voters in battleground states with more conservative views.\u201d\n\nDem candidates compete to give away billions in taxpayer money -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cCandidates like Cory Booker,\u00a0Marianne Williamson\u00a0and Andrew Yang\u00a0are among those pitching cash handout plans this election cycle.

The Twitter account affiliated with Gravel's campaign on Saturday thanked staffers and supporters who had helped the 89-year-old former senator from Alaska raise his profile and eventually draw more than 65,000 donors to his campaign. \u2018Of course, the true key has been the #Gravelanche itself, our incredible supporters and donors.

But he believed, rightly, that a world in which people were free to pursue happiness would be one in which liberty would slowly spread, until all could benefit from it. What seemed evident to him would not have seemed remotely plausible to any educated person before the English Civil War. In 1690, [John Locke\u2019s] arguments were still peculiar and pioneering; by 1776 they had become, as they still are for us, self-evident. \u2026 But there is an important difference between us and the founding fathers. They saw life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as the alternative to despotism and intolerance. We now can see that a society devoted to self-gratification may, in the end, destroy the conditions of its own existence.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 42.4 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.6 percent\nNet Score: -11.2 points\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0down 2.8 points\u00a0\n\n[Average includes: IBD: 40% approve - 56% disapprove; Gallup: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% approve - 53% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

OFFER SUPPORT FOR RED FLAG, BACKGROUND BILLS\nPolitico: \u201cA shaken Sen.\u00a0Rob Portman\u00a0on Tuesday spoke out against white nationalism and expressed support for red flag laws, after horrific mass shootings over the weekend in Texas and his home state of Ohio. The Republican's endorsement of limited gun control comes one day after President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0called for such laws, which allow police and family members to block access to firearms for people who are an imminent threat to others or themselves. Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham\u00a0(R-S.C.) said Monday he would introduce legislation to encourage more states to adopt red flag laws\u2026. Sen.\u00a0Pat Toomey\u00a0(R-Pa.) on Monday vowed to renew efforts to pass legislation with Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin\u00a0(D-W.Va.) that would expand background checks after Trump called for similar legislation via tweet, though the president didn\u2019t follow up on the call during a televised address several hours later. The Manchin-Toomey proposal failed in 2013 and 2015 and has little Republican support.\u201d\n\nNRA infighting leaves group weakened -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cFresh calls for gun control following massacres in two U.S. cities over the weekend are testing the resilience of the National Rifle Association at a time when the nation\u2019s largest gun lobby is riven by leadership clashes and allegations of reckless spending. The NRA, which has\u00a0blocked\u00a0proposed restrictions after past mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., has lost key veterans in recent months, including lobbyist\u00a0Christopher Cox, who back-channeled with the White House and lawmakers during previous political crises.\u00a0The NRA\u2019s longtime advertising firm, which helped craft its hard-edge responses to past gun violence, is battling the organization in court. Last week, three NRA board members\u00a0resigned, saying they were sidelined after demanding audits of the organization\u2019s\u00a0spending. Rank-and-file members are urging changes,\u00a0while other gun rights groups are seeking to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on the NRA\u2019s struggles.\u201d\n\nDavid Brooks: The other-ism -\u00a0NYT: \u201cFinally, pluralism is the adventure of life. Pluralism is not just having diverse people coexist in one place. It\u2019s going out and getting into each other\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a constant dialogue that has no end because there is no single answer to how we should live. Life in a pluralistic society is an ever-moving spiral. There are the enemies of pluralism ripping it apart and the weavers of community binding it together. There is no resting spot. Its change, fluidity and movement all the way down. The terrorists dream of a pure, static world. But the only thing that\u2019s static is death, which is why they are so pathologically drawn to death. Pluralism is about movement, interdependence and life. The struggle ahead is about competing values as much as it is about controlling guns and healing damaged psyches. Pluralism thrives when we name what the terrorists hate about us, and live it out.\u201d\n\nMISSISSIPPIANS HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR PRIMARY DAY\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cIt's primary day in Mississippi, where voters will head to the polls to pick nominees for governor \u2026 The Democratic side is fairly straightforward: There\u2019s more than a handful of candidates on the ballot, but state Attorney General\u00a0Jim Hood\u00a0is considered the prohibitive favorite. But the Republican primary is more competitive. Three candidates \u2014 Lt. Gov.\u00a0Tate Reeves, former state Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Bill Waller, Jr.\u00a0and state Rep.\u00a0Robert Foster\u00a0\u2014 are all vying for the nomination. A recent Mason-Dixon poll in the state highlights the uncertainty: Reeves leads the other two men, but sits at 41 percent, below the simple majority required to avoid a runoff election. Waller is in second with 31 percent, and Foster is at the back of the pack at 13 percent. If no one clears 50 percent, there will be a runoff in three weeks. \u2026 [Despite Reeves many] endorsements \u2014 and a massive fundraising and spending advantage favoring Reeves \u2014 Waller is still hanging around.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nJon Huntsman\u00a0resigns as ambassador to Russia\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nSen.\u00a0Ben Sasse\u00a0announces 2020 re-election campaign\u00a0-\u00a0Roll Call\n\nEmbattled Rep.\u00a0Duncan Hunter\u00a0draws top-tier primary challenger\u00a0-\u00a0Politico\n\nAUDIBLE: TONI MORRISON, R.I.P.\n\n\u201cShe is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order. It\u2019s good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Author\u00a0Toni Morrison\u00a0(Feb. 18, 1931-Aug. 5, 2019) writing the dialogue of\u00a0Sixo, a character in her 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u201cBeloved.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cYou let the other, and equally important, side of the story of Charlottesville out of your otherwise outstanding synopsis of White Nationalism. Black Lives Matter and Antifa militants were approved by the Charlottesville authorities to stage a counter protest several blocks away from the White Nationalist rally. It was the BLM/Antifa group that ignored their lawful permit and left their designated area to engage the White Nationalists in racial combat. Had they cared about civility, they would\u2019ve stayed within the area reserved for them and Charlottesville would\u2019ve been an ugly local news footnote like Fountain Square in Cincinnati and numerous other places where the Klan, Aryan Brotherhood and others have marched and faded away. But, of course, it didn\u2019t happen that way. The racial arsonists and the anarchists fought their battle. All three groups got their twisted need of coverage filled. Trump fumbled away his opportunity with a poor choice of words and the Left had a new clarion call. Because, in today\u2019s polarized environment, these tiny, fringe of the fringe political movements are driving the narrative. They may represent .001% of our population but their influence is magnitudes greater. Expression of thought isn\u2019t hate but translate the thought into action and it\u2019s a crime against civility. Perpetrators of these crimes need to be fairly prosecuted to the fullest without the lens of left-right politics. Perhaps, if we can get the Country back to \u2018fair and equal,\u2019 then all the people can again believe they live under the best system on the Planet.\u201d \u2013Steve Aue, Brock, Texas\n\n\n[Ed. note: You make a worthwhile point about the cycle of attention seeking, Mr. Aue. But our discussion Monday was about white nationalism, not its competing radical ideologies. That was the topic because a white nationalist in El Paso, Texas slaughtered 20 Hispanic people in the name of that cause. I could have explored the back and forth between attention-seeking extremists, but I rather think that would have obscured the point and would have risked diluting the blame for the murders. Yes, there is a symbiosis between these militant groups, but that doesn\u2019t lessen the moral judgement against white nationalism as a cause or mitigate the actions of the killer. On Monday, we were exploring how a media fixation on the president\u2019s responses to murders by white nationalists obscures a more useful discussion about the movement itself and the roots racial violence in America today. I don\u2019t think tarrying over the lack of civility by counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville would have been at all elucidating.] \u201cIt took you 20 paragraphs of regurgitation to get to the bottom line and tell America that our national illness can only be fixed from the bottom up. Indeed, Trump is a reflection of our problems, not the cause, yet you managed to regurgitate every negative you could to attribute white nationalism to him: YOU put fuel on a fire.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Linda Harward, Crawford, Texas\n\n\n[Ed. note: As I perused your note, Ms. Harward, I had just finished\u00a0reading\u00a0about the Democratic outrage over a headline in today\u2019s NYT: \u201cTrump urges unity vs. racism.\u201d The freak out was pretty remarkable, even for these freaked out times. The headline was certainly accurate, even if one doubts the president\u2019s sincerity. It may have been too simplistic for a complicated story, but that\u2019s life in big-league journalism. Not every headline is a winner. But the response was just, well, wild. One presidential candidate even suggested the Times was complicit in murder and another let fly with a string of obscenities about media coverage. Really profoundly stupid stuff. There is a powerful temptation to conflate coverage with causality in these polarized times. There is an even stronger impulse to shut out points of view that challenge our own worldviews or make us feel uncomfortable about our political choices. All of us, not just politicians, are obliged to resist these temptations.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhen the NRA has the [Senate majority leader], Mitch McConnell, in their pocket from the $1.2 million USD they have spent on his elections AND the [Senate majority leader], Mitch McConnell, refuses to let 2 Bi-PARTISAN gun reform bills that passed in the House 5 months ago get a vote on the Senate floor - it's really, really hard to believe it's a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 problem! The \u2018it's us, not them\u2019 suggestion doesn't hold water in this particular instance!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jill Rackiewicz Henderson, St. Paul, Minn.\n\n\n[Ed. note: It is true that the House did pass two bipartisan firearms bills. One would extend the waiting period from three days to 10 days for weapon sales when the federal background check system fails to deliver (as it sometimes does) another would require all firearm transfers to be subject to background checks, including private sales, family gifts, etc. A couple of thoughts here: Both bills have the same problem as many proposed in the wake of mass murders. Neither would have prevented the massacres to which they are offered as responses. That makes it harder to get lawmakers to back bills that come at a political cost. But also: How do you think McConnell\u2019s constituents in Kentucky feel about gun control? Your suggestion here is that McConnell would back these bills or at least bring them out for a vote if it wasn\u2019t for the donations of the National Rifle Association. I doubt it. The NRA is very powerful, or at least was until it its recent crack up, but that power isn\u2019t from its contributions. McConnell will never want for money in any race, but he would face serious problems is the organization\u2019s millions of members declared him an enemy. What makes the gun-rights activist community powerful isn\u2019t its money but its members. I\u2019m not suggesting that there is no federal part to play in addressing these killings. But I do believe that it is up to Americans to form a new consensus on these issues rather than partisan blame casting. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for 30 years and it has gotten us exactly nowhere.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you able to explain how the President is able to willy nilly make up new tariffs and screw with the entire economy without the consent of the Congress, please? Why is the legislative branch so weak when it comes to this area? Thanks!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Katie Hacker,\u00a0Evington, Va.\n\n\n[Ed. note: It\u2019s pretty simple, Ms. Hacker: Congress gave away the power. In various pieces of legislation, particularly the\u00a0Trade Expansion Act of 1962\u00a0and the Trade Act of 1974 and its successor legislation, Congress ceded its own authority to set tariffs to the executive branch. For example, when the president threatens new taxes on cars made by foreign manufacturers \u2013 including those assembled here \u2013 he is citing the 1962 legislation that grants him such power in order to protect \u201cnational security.\u201d To Trump, winning the trade wars is a national security issue so, blammo, he\u2019s got the power. This anguishes many Republicans, but they are deathly afraid of Trump, who has demonstrated his power repeatedly to punish dissent in his party. Many Democrats, meanwhile, secretly admire Trump\u2019s protectionism and are unlikely to pipe up. The lesson for Congress, is that power is much more easily surrendered than reclaimed. Any decent custodian of Congress\u2019 constitutional power should think first how a power ceded to the executive could be abused before considering how it might be used.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nWHEN YOUR GUILT KETCHES UP TO YOU\nNY Post:\u00a0\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t cut the mustard as a hardened criminal.

During a\u00a0campaign fundraiser in his home state of Delaware, the former vice president\u00a0was referencing a speech he had made to a group of 275 people, in which he accused\u00a0 President Trump of \"fueling a literal carnage\u201d\u00a0in the country through his rhetoric.

Whether Biden had Democratic rival\u00a0Bernie Sanders -- a former mayor of Burlington, Vt. -- on his mind was not immediately known. GAFFE-PRONE BIDEN SHOULDN'T BE CLOISTERED, OBAMA AIDE SAYS: 'HE EITHER CAN CUT IT OR HE CAN'T' The mistake was the latest in a series of gaffes the 76-year-old Biden has made that have caused concern among some Democrats that's he's too old and prompted President Trump to say he isn\u2019t \u201cplaying with a full deck.\u201d Last week in Iowa, Biden said \u201cpoor kids\u201d are just as smart as \u201cwhite kids,\u201d and last weekend he mistakenly said he met with survivors of the February 2018 Parkland, Fla.,\u00a0school shooting while vice president -- even though he had left office more than a year before the attack. He has also confused former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for\u00a0Theresa May twice since May. Biden\u2019s press secretary told CNN the focus on Biden's blunders is a \u201cpress narrative, not a voter narrative.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The candidate himself, however, appears to take his verbal slip-ups in stride. \u201cI am a gaffe machine, but, my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can\u2019t tell the truth,\" according to The Washington Post. Some Biden allies have suggested limiting his appearances due to the mistakes, the Examiner\u00a0reported.",

      "content": " Well, Joe Biden didn't exactly clear the field. I don't think it matters much that Biden waited until Thursday\u00a0to become the 20th Democrat vying for the nomination, even though it exposed him to weeks of attacks while he seemed to be dithering on the sidelines. A much greater warning sign, in my view, is the largely negative tone surrounding his debut. He is, after all, a former vice president, highly praised by Barack Obama, who has consistently led in the early primary polls, and is beating President Trump in head-to-head matchups. Yet much of the press is acting like he's an old codger and it's just a matter of time before he keels over politically. This is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that the vast majority of journalists and pundits know and like Joe Biden and his gregarious personality. The reason is that Biden, after a half-century in politics, lacks excitement, and the press is magnetically attracted to novel and unorthodox types like Beto and Mayor Pete. You don't see Biden on the cover of Vanity Fair, and a grind-it-out win by a conventional warrior doesn't set journalistic hearts racing. JOE BIDEN ANNOUNCES 2020 PRESIDENTIAL BID: 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT For many in the media, Biden isn't liberal enough, at least not for the post-Obama era. He doesn't promise free college and free health care and has a history of working with Republicans, such as John McCain (whose daughter Meghan loves him\u00a0and will host him on \"The View\"\u00a0Friday.) What's more, Biden's campaign style \u2014 speak at rallies, rack up union endorsements \u2014 seems hopelessly old-fashioned when we measure popularity by Instagram followers. News outlets are predicting he'll have trouble getting in the online fundraising game, leaving him reliant on big donors, which used to be standard practice. And then there's the age thing. Biden would be the oldest president to be inaugurated, at 78, and he looked a step slow\u00a0in encounters with reporters Thursday and a few weeks ago. But what if the journalists are in something of a Twitter bubble, and the actual Democratic Party is much more moderate? We saw that with the spate of allegations by women of unwanted touching, which dominated news coverage until polls showed that most Dem voters weren't concerned. In that wider world, the Scranton guy's connection to white, working-class voters could help him against Trump in the industrial Midwest. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Biden denounced the president's term as an \"aberrant moment\"\u00a0in his launch video, saying four more years would damage the country's character and \"I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\" But first, he'd have to win the nomination in the face of an unenthusiastic press corps. A New York Times news story said Biden would be \"marshaling his experience and global stature in a bid to lead a party increasingly defined by a younger generation that might be skeptical of his age and ideological moderation.\" The Washington Post quoted Democratic strategists as saying that Biden faces an \"uphill battle\"\u00a0and \"isn't necessarily the heir apparent to Obama, despite being his No. 2 in the White House for eight years. They argue voters will judge\u00a0Biden by the span of his decades-long career and are worried the veteran pol\u00a0hasn't yet found a winning formula\u00a0for his own candidacy.\" The liberal Slate said the ex-veep's rivals view him as a \"paper tiger\": \"Biden is something more like a 2016 Jeb Bush: a weak establishment favorite whose time might be past ... Biden's biggest challenge in the primary will be a compromised past spanning nearly 50 years.\" \"Compromised\"\u00a0suggests a history of scandal, yet what Slate means is political baggage, such as his backing of a Clinton-era crime bill unpopular with black voters today. Yet I think the rank and file isn't as concerned about a vote back in 1994, or even the Anita Hill hearings, as the chattering classes. BIDEN'S SENATE RECORD, ADVOCACY OF 1994 CRIME BILL WILL BE USED AGAINST HIM, EX-SANDERS\u00a0STAFFER SAYS One of the few left-leaning pundits to\u00a0suggest\u00a0the press is underestimating Biden is data guru Nate Silver at 538: \"Media coverage could nonetheless be a problem for Biden. Within the mainstream media, the story of Biden winning the nomination will be seen as boring and anticlimactic. That tends not to lead to favorable coverage. Meanwhile, some left-aligned media outlets may prefer candidates who are some combination of more leftist, more wonkish, more reflective of the party's diversity, and more adept on social media. \"If Biden is framed as being out of touch with today's Democratic Party and that narrative is repeated across a variety of outlets, it could begin to resonate with voters who don't buy it initially. If he's seen as a gaffe-prone candidate, then minor missteps on the campaign trail could be blown up into big fumbles.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Look, it's entirely possible that Biden could stumble, get lapped in fundraising and just be outclassed by younger and savvier rivals. He was hardly a great candidate in 1987 and in 2008. But if the former vice president finds his footing and the field narrows, the press will be forced to change its tune, and we'll see a spate of stories about how Joe Biden has \"grown.\"",

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He\u2019s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that\u2019s up 6 points and a new high for her.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden\u2019s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0at 5 percent,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0at 4 percent,\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke\u00a0at 3 percent, and\u00a0Cory Booker,\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0each at 2 percent.\u00a0Michael Bennet,\u00a0Julian Castro,\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard,\u00a0Tim Ryan,\u00a0Tom Steyer, and\u00a0Marianne Williamson\u00a0receive 1 percent apiece.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s firewall still strong -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201c[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary.\u00a0Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston \u2026 gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is \u2018too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.\u2019 And she doesn\u2019t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.\u201d\n\nWill any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u2019s son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u2019s work and his service as vice president. \u2026 So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. \u2026 In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u2019s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive\u2026 Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u2014 in false ways \u2014 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u2019 ire.\u201d\n\nJane Sanders takes starring role in husband\u2019s campaign -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife,\u00a0Jane Sanders. \u2026 When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u2026 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u2018especially me,\u2019 had told him to slow down. \u2026 In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u2018egotistical\u2019 to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u2018very much a close adviser.\u2019 Above all, she said, she was \u2018his wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nVoter intensity on both sides through the roof -\u00a0Gallup:\u00a0\u201cA year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given \u2018quite a lot of thought\u2019 to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

She was known only as \u2018Sarah the African,\u2019 and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, \u2018the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,\u2019 \u2018an Ethiopian,\u2019 or \u2018a statue of Florentine bronze.\u2019 A \u2018negress\u2019 who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked\u00a0Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by\u00a0Georges Cuvier\u00a0just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer\u2019s hit posthumous opera,\u00a0L\u2019Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. \u2026 On her debut in September she was billed above M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman,\u00a0William Meyer, and even above\u00a0Mlle Ad\u00e8le, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028 points (\u2191\u00a01.2 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a026.2 points (\u2191 3.4 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a014.4 points (\u2193\u00a01.6 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a05.4 points (\u2193\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.2 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Fox News, Quinnipiac University, IBD, Monmouth University and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-10.6 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.4 points\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.\u201d\n\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign -\u00a0AP: \u201cFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch\u00a0told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was \u2018abruptly\u2019 recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a \u2018concerted campaign against me\u2019 and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. \u2018Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u2019 Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.\u201d\n\nReport: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson\u00a0in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic \u2018deal\u2019 to stop the U.S. case against\u00a0Reza Zarrab\u00a0on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson \u2014 including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.\u201d\n\nPete Session\u2019s political revival threatened by Ukraine role -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cFormer Representative\u00a0Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as \u2018Congressman-1\u2019 in the indictment of\u00a0Lev Parnas\u00a0and\u00a0Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of\u00a0Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2026 Mr. Sessions\u2019s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.\u201d\n\nContinetti: We are all Ukrainians -\u00a0Free Beacon:\u00a0\u201cFrom Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nTRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY\nYahoo:\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president,\u00a0Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard.\u00a0\u2018Trey Gowdy doesn\u2019t know s***,\u2019 she said. \u2026 \u2018He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u2018Well, if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, just talk to\u00a0Bob Mueller.\u2019\u2019 Toensing and her husband,\u00a0Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump\u2019s legal team.\u201d\n\nAnd he can\u2019t even join until January -\u00a0WashEx:\u00a0\u201cFormer Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy\u00a0cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, \u2018Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there\u2019s a problem with, he can\u2019t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.\u2019 It was only a day after\u00a0Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. \u2026\u00a0Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession,\u00a0federal law\u00a0prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.\u201d DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cHouse Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0for not holding a vote authorizing the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings \u2014 arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate.\u00a0Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump\u2019s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn\u2019t changed, describing the idea as the latest \u2018Republican canard\u2019 in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. \u2026 Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u2014 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.\u201d\n\nHouse members get an earful from voters back home -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cThe \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep.\u00a0Anthony Brindisi\u2019s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. \u2026 Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can\u2019t avoid it. \u2026 But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u2014 serving as the party\u2019s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u2019 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\u201d\n\nIndependents\u2019 support for impeachment jumps 10 points -\u00a0NPR:\u00a0\u201cA slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split \u2014 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.\u201d\n\nROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cPresident Donald Trump wants to sideline\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0\u2014 but the Utah senator isn\u2019t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 \u2014 headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen.\u00a0Susan Collins, Colorado Sen.\u00a0Cory Gardner\u00a0and Michigan Senate hopeful\u00a0John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u2019s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u2019s efforts to ostracize him.\u201d\n\nDems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cMs. [Nita]\u00a0Lowey\u2019s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including\u00a0Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman,\u00a0David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that \u2018if someone were to step down or retire,\u2019 she would \u2018have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me.\u2019 Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey\u2019s district: Her parents\u2019 house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district.

I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don\u2019t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn\u2019t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.\u201d \u2013\u00a0E\u2019Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa\n\n\n[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small \u2013 measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey\u2019s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president\u2019s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks\u2019 zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as \u2018news.\u2019\u00a0 But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question.\u00a0 That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong?\u00a0 Please explain!\u00a0 And keep up the good work!!!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand\n\n\n[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is not a thing. It\u2019s like a couple being \u201cpre-engaged.\u201d But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and \u201cimpeachment\u201d is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In\u00a0our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]\n\n\n\u201cAll my teams have long gone home for the winter.

But c\u2019mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats\u2019 pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year\u2019s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s.\u00a0Matt Carpenter\u00a0is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism,\u00a0Paul DeJong\u00a0is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal,\u00a0Kolten Wong\u00a0surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli\u2019i in his hometown and\u00a0Paul Goldschmidt\u00a0has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And\u00a0Yadi\u00a0is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow \u2018bout them Redbirds!

The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, \u2018Is this your turd? \u2018Cuz that's absurd\u2019 and \u2018This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.\u2019 The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThe whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides.

His rollout was quite successful,\" Stirewalt said during an appearance\u00a0on \"America's Newsroom.\" Biden announced his candidacy on Thursday with a message blasting President Donald Trump for his conduct in office. Within the first 24 hours, Biden's campaign raised $6.3 million \u2014 outpacing his competitors\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas \u2014 with 96,926 individuals who \"chipped in\" on the first day. \"He raised more money than\u00a0anybody else had raised, which is saying something because Bernie Sanders can Hoover up\u00a0small dollar donations like\u00a0nobody in history,\" Stirewalt told Fox News host Sandra Smith. MIKA BRZEZINSKI DISMISSES JOE BIDEN ALLEGATIONS: 'I REFUSE TO GIVE IT ANY MORE TIME' Biden has repeatedly led other 2020 candidates in polling before he even announced. In a national poll released at the end of April, Biden got a 24-point lead over Sanders. The RealClearPolitics polling average also gave Biden a substantial lead for the Democratic nomination. Stirewalt remarked\u00a0that Biden's rollout was successful even though some observers were skeptical. \"Biden, despite a lot of\u00a0skepticism about how he was going to\u00a0start\u00a0out, Joe Biden hit his marks\u00a0very nicely for the beginning\u00a0of his campaign,\" he said, mentioning a \"very successful\"\u00a0town hall event in Pittsburgh. NEW YORK POST: TRUMP WOULD PASS BIDEN'S 'MEASURE OF SUCCESS' WITH FLYING COLORS Before Biden's announcement, he encountered controversy\u00a0over his conduct during the Anita Hill hearings in 1991, as well as several\u00a0allegations that he inappropriately touched women. Biden said that in a private conversation with Hill, he expressed regret for the way her hearing was conducted. He did not, however, apologize for his own actions because, he said, he didn't treat her \"badly.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a video message posted to Twitter, Biden also said he didn't think he touched anyone in an inappropriate way\u00a0but said he would \"listen respectfully\" to concerns. \"And not once \u2014 never \u2014\u00a0did I believe I acted inappropriately.\u00a0 If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.

There is real abuse that goes on. Matt Lauer, other people in this town, Harvey Weinstein, other people in Tinseltown, the gymnastics coach, there is real assault and real abuse.

BIDEN ACCUSER SAYS SHE'D VOTE FOR HIM OVER TRUMP Biden continues to face scrutiny over inappropriate touching and his treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, then a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. Lucy Flores, a former candidate for lieutenant governor in Nevada, accused Biden, a fellow Democrat,\u00a0of inappropriate touching and wrote an op-ed\u00a0published in the New York Times on Monday about her experience since making the accusations.

Clarence Thomas is a Supreme Court justice. Brett Kavanaugh was litigated and he's a Supreme Court justice. Putting someone's shoulders in a work environment -- honestly, it happens all the time.

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign on Thursday accused Joe Biden of selling out to big donors in an effort to \u201cbuy the election\u201d following reports that the former vice president and frontrunner\u00a0for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination would form a super PAC to accept unlimited donations from billionaires and corporate elites to cure his current fundraising woes. A spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign responded Thursday evening, telling Fox News in a statement that, in the eyes of President Trump, \u201cthe general election has already begun,\u201d and Democrats must use any means possible within the parameters of current federal elections laws to win back the presidency \u2014 even if that includes taking money from corporations and billionaires alike. TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING CASH HAUL REPORTEDLY RATTLING DEMOCRATS \"Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors \u2014 and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\"Let\u2019s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvery Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs -- and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.\u201d Biden, who\u2019s trailing his Democratic rivals in fundraising, said when he first announced his candidacy in April that he would not accept money from super PACs. The former U.S. senator from Delaware declared he was committed to driving perceived \"dark money\" from politics. Before entering the 2020 race, Biden told PBS NewsHour in January 2018\u00a0that he was the one who told\u00a0Sanders not to accept super PAC money, arguing\u00a0he would lose the trust of the middle class. TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS TO BIDEN\u2019S \u201960 MINUTES\u2019 INTERVIEW, TAKES SWIPE AT HUNTER \u201cMy positions are a hell of a lot closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on some of the economic positions,\u201d Biden told PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff last year. \u201cI mean, I sat with Bernie. I'm the guy that told him you shouldn't accept any money from a super PAC because people can't possibly trust you.\u201d Within the third quarter, Biden\u2019s campaign raised $15.2 million but was left with just $9 million after expenditures, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, which welcomes super PAC contributions, and the Republican Party together raised $125 million in that same time period for the president\u2019s re-election, according to the Republican National Committee. Using these funds, Trump's campaign paid for attack ads targeting Biden amid an ongoing Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry against the president. While Biden\u2019s campaign this week softened its stance on accepting super PAC donations, Sanders boasted\u00a0his bid for the presidency is 100 percent grassroots funded. Biden\u2019s campaign told Fox News on Thursday that he\u00a0is still committed to eradicating private donations from federal elections \u2014 but until he becomes president, is open to big-donor contributions to defeat Trump. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \u201cAs president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United [a 2010 Supreme Cout decision on campaign financing] and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News. \u201cUntil we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided the general election has already begun. In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes until we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d",

These low numbers may partly be explained by a lack of support among white women, a key voting bloc that voted for Trump in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nIncumbent underwater on economy for the first time -\u00a0Quinnipiac University: \u201cFor the first time since President Trump was elected, more voters say that the national economy is getting worse than getting better, with 37 percent saying it is getting worse, 31 percent saying it is getting better, and 30 percent saying it is staying the same. \u2026 When asked to rate the state of the nation's economy, 61 percent of voters say that it is excellent or good, while 37 percent say that it is not so good or poor. \u2026 Voters also say that President Trump's policies are hurting the nation's economy at 41 percent, while 37 percent say that they are helping, and 20 percent say that his policies make no difference.\u201d\n\nPoll finds Americans dread the 2020 election -\u00a0USA Today:\u00a0\u201cAmericans are facing the 2020 presidential election with a dominant feeling: Dread. \u2026 If the candidate they support loses, nearly four in 10 said they would have little or no confidence that the election had been conducted in a fair-and-square way, setting up what could be a debate over the legitimacy of the next president. \u2026 In the crowded Democratic contest, former Vice President Joe Biden retained a wide lead, at 32%, up 2 percentage points from the USA TODAY/Suffolk poll taken in June. But Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren moved up 4 points to second place, at 14%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped 3 points, now at third place with 12%. \u2026 Only three other candidates received support above 2%: South Bend (Indiana) Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, each at 6%, and businessman Andrew Yang at 3%. At 2% were former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.\u201d\n\nWarren tries to crowd her way in -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cElizabeth Warren\u00a0does not like to talk about polls, or crowds, or \u2018momentum.\u2019 \u2026 Over the past week, Warren drew the largest crowds of her campaign. Seattle's audience dwarfed a 12,000-head-count crowd in Minneapolis; a more hastily planned event in Los Angeles drew around 4,000. Warren, once nearly counted out of the race, can now pull out crowds comparable to Barack Obama's in the summer of 2007 or Bernie Sanders's in the summer of 2015. \u2026 But Warren's crowds, never small but increasingly impressive, are complicating rival campaigns' views of their competition. Sanders, whose ability to fill arenas four summers ago fed into his 2015 surge, has never had to contend with a primary opponent like that. And Biden, whose crowds have been noticeably smaller than Sanders's or Warren's in early-voting states, bristles at the idea that his competitors are bigger draws.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: NEVER NUDE\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf we should not be willing to be exposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to [Britain and Spain\u2019s]\u00a0insults and encroachments, we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be annoyed.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 24\n\nTIME OUT: GREEK SYSTEM\u00a0\u00a0\nNatGeo:\u00a0\u201cChildhood education in ancient Greece was highly dependent on one\u2019s gender. \u2026 In the fifth century B.C., Greece\u2019s greatest minds were preoccupied with the most effective ways to raise children. \u2026\u00a0The teaching that\u00a0Isocrates\u00a0praised was known by Greeks aspaideia, a term derived from\u00a0pais, the Greek word for child. In ideal terms, paideia was intended to allow male children to purge the baser parts of human nature so they could achieve the highest moral state. On a pragmatic level, it also provided society with well-prepared men to take on the political and military burdens of citizenship as adults.\u00a0Paideia, however, was not intended for female children. \u2026 In stark contrast to the traditional, family-centered childhood of Athens was Sparta\u2019s rigid schooling system. Known as\u00a0agoge, it was centrally organized by the state. \u2026 Whereas Athenian education imposed a strict segregation of the sexes, Spartan boys and girls trained and competed in athletics alongside one another.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nAverage approval:\u00a041.4 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a054.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-13 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 0.6 points\n\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 44% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 41% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 43% approve - 55% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

In a statement, the 74-year-old Isakson cited his battle with Parkinson's disease. \u2018I am leaving a job I love because my health challenges are taking their toll on me, my family and my staff,\u2019 he said. \u2026 With his resignation, Georgia Gov.\u00a0Brian Kemp, a Republican, will now have to appoint a replacement for Isakson until a special election can be held in 2020. The winner of that election will serve the remaining two years of Isakson's term, and the winner of the 2022 election will serve a full six-year term. Isakson's retirement also means that voters in Georgia will have to cast a ballot for both of the state's Senate seats next year as Sen.\u00a0David Perdue, a Republican, is seeking a second term in office.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKansas Republicans seek primary challenger to one of their own -\u00a0Kansas City Star:\u00a0\u201cKansas Treasurer\u00a0Jake LaTurner\u00a0said Tuesday that he will consider dropping out the race for U.S. Senate to instead mount a primary challenge against freshman Republican Rep.\u00a0Steve Watkins\u00a0after encouragement by a former Kansas governor. Former Kansas Gov.\u00a0Jeff Colyer\u00a0took the highly unusual step Tuesday of calling for LaTurner, a Republican, to drop out of the race for an open Senate seat and challenge an incumbent Republican after Watkins has spent more than a week battling a whisper campaign. Colyer, a Johnson County Republican who served as Kansas governor for 11 months, did not refer to Watkins by name in a statement calling on LaTurner to seek the seat. He noted Watkins\u2019 lackluster fundraising and made a vague reference to poor coalition-building.\u201d\n\nGOP taking no chances on N.C. special House election -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201c[House Minority Leader\u00a0Kevin]\u00a0McCarthy\u00a0has traveled to the state to help the Republican candidate, state Sen.\u00a0Dan Bishop, and has pushed his rank-and-file lawmakers to lend a hand. And as he chatted up contributors, he warned that next month\u2019s vote is critical: Following a devastating 2018 election that demolished the House GOP majority, a win in the nationally-watched race would give the party a badly-needed morale boost. Republicans are funneling resources into the southern North Carolina district as they try to stave off an embarrassing loss in a GOP-heavy seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016 by more than 11 percentage points. With private polling showing a close race between Bishop and Democrat\u00a0Dan McCready, Trump will travel to the district on Sept. 9, the night before the special election, for a rally in Fayetteville, N.C. And the White House is also planning to deploy Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., before the election.\u201d\n\nConstituents sweat vulnerable Democrats on impeachment - Politico: \u201cDemocrats hoping to avoid clashes over impeachment when they left Washington this summer are being confronted with a difficult reality at sometimes hostile town hall events. Voters across the country \u2014 from California to Pennsylvania to Massachusetts \u2014 grilled House Democrats on the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump at a series of events this month, regardless of whether they support or oppose the drastic measure. \u2026 Many progressive voters want Democratic leaders to move forward with impeachment immediately, the politics of it be damned, because ethics demand it; others are hammering their representatives over the possibility that impeachment would boost Trump\u2019s reelection prospects because he would claim vindication after being acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate. \u2026 Many of the pro-impeachment voters turning out at town halls didn\u2019t appear to be part of organized efforts\u2026\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nMississippi Lt.

      "content": " Democrats should continue attacking former Vice President Joe Biden in hopes that the party will adopt more progressive stances needed to beat President Trump in 2020, the founding editor of a democratic socialist magazine argued. Writing in The Guardian, Jacobin Magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara called for a Democratic nominee that would push a \"real progressive agenda\" rather than just attacking the president. \"Simply pointing to the Trump administration and saying 'this is not normal'\u00a0won\u2019t be enough to rally people into the voting booth,\" he wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday. Sunkara's call came as some warned intraparty divisions could\u00a0weaken Democrats' chances at\u00a0beating Trump -- the one priority\u00a0around which the party seemed to clearly\u00a0coalesce. KARL ROVE: 2020 DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS ENGAGED IN 'TWO-FRONT CIVIL WAR' Biden, the frontrunner since before he formally announced he was entering the race, took a decidedly anti-Trump tone from the outset but has received criticism for not being progressive enough on certain issues. According to Sunkara, attacking Biden would help \"break the myth of Biden's 'electability.'\" And, Sunkara argued,\u00a0even if Biden beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other progressives for the party's nomination, criticism\u00a0could force the party to adopt a more progressive platform. \"Although he seems to believe so, a Biden victory is not preordained. He could conceivably get edged out by a candidate, like Sanders, bold enough to offer a genuinely alternative vision for America \u2013 not just shielding us from the nightmare of Trump, but providing us with aspirations for the future,\" Sunkara said. \"Even if Sanders loses the primary, this strong anti-Biden stance might force the Democratic party to adopt more progressive positions that would actually help its chances against Trump. 2020 DEM JOHN DELANEY WARNS OF PARTY'S 'INTOLERANCE' AMID AOC SPAT OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' \"Not only is Medicare for All popular, but 60% of Americans support free college and a majority back a jobs guarantee. Big ideas to solve our social problems \u2013 and efforts to make the rich pay for them \u2013 are popular. Whoever challenges Trump will need to start adopting them.\" Biden, on Wednesday, released a costly climate change plan that seemed at least partially to be an attempt at warding off progressive criticism. After his staff indicated in May that Biden sought a middle way on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took a veiled shot at his moderation. She, along with others, has\u00a0proposed a more aggressive\u00a0\"Green New Deal\" which Biden's camp cited as a 'crucial framework\" for addressing climate change. But just as Biden pushed his\u00a0climate plan, he faced even more friendly fire over his stance on abortion.\u00a0His fellow 2020 Democratic candidates vehemently denounced the Hyde Amendment -- a decades-old law that blocks federal funding from going towards most abortions -- after Biden's campaign said he supported the measure.

      "content": " Joe Biden\u2019s message was clear. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Jim Crow sneaking back in,\u201d the former vice president warned at a rally in Columbia, South Carolina,\u00a0soon after launching his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign. JOE BIDEN UP BY DOUBLE DIGITS IN LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 POLL Biden, in equating new restrictions on voting eligibility with the heinous racial segregation laws of generations past, was at the same time courting black voters who predominate in the Democratic primary in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote in the race for the White House. The former veep's bond with that critical voting bloc has only strengthened in the weeks since. For now the clear front-runner in the Democratic nomination campaign, Biden is being boosted at this early stage by his\u00a0immense popularity\u00a0with black voters. For Biden's rivals, this is a daunting factor heading into primary season. The key question going forward, according to former Democratic National Committee leader and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile, is whether the 76-year old white male candidate in a field of young and diverse contenders can \u201csolidify this support.\u201d According to the latest Fox News poll, Biden stands at 33 percent support among white Democratic voters. But that support rises to 38 percent among non-white likely Democratic primary voters. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is a distant second among that group, at 14 percent. The two major Democratic contenders who are black -- Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey --\u00a0stand at 6 percent and 5 percent in the survey, respectively. Every other candidate is also in single digits among non-white likely voters. Notably, Pete Buttigieg, who's risen from obscurity to the upper-middle\u00a0tier in many polls, stood at just 1 percent among that group. The South Bend mayor acknowledged at a Fox News town hall on Sunday\u00a0that he needs to do more to appeal to \"black and brown\" voters, suggesting that minority voters are \"skeptical of people who seem to come out of nowhere.\" It doesn't hurt Biden that he spent\u00a0eight years as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s right-hand man, a period that did more than just build his name recognition. Part cheerleader, part sage\u00a0and part protector, Biden was always deferential to the nation\u2019s first black president, who extended political affection in return. As they left office in January of 2017, Obama praised his trusted friend and adviser. \u201cMy family is so proud to call ourselves honorary Bidens,\u201d the outgoing president said as he awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony. While Obama is staying neutral at this early point in the primaries, Biden is running in many ways as his successor. During his swing through South Carolina, as elsewhere, he was quick to compliment his former boss, calling Obama \u201cone of the best presidents we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d His standing as Obama\u2019s vice president and his longtime relationships with African-American Democratic leaders across the country are so far helping keep him far ahead of the rest of the field in courting the black vote. Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, pointed to Biden\u2019s record on civil rights and his eight years serving with Obama, saying that black voters \"know Biden's track record\" and that \"he's been there for them time and time again.\" \"What you're seeing now is just a validation of a comfort level,\" said Elleithee, a senior spokesman for then-Sen. Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee. \"Biden is the guy who gives them a sense of security and comfort, and that he would be a champion for them probably more than anyone else right now,\" he added during an appearance Monday on Fox News' \u201cThe Daily Briefing.\u201d Brazile said that Biden\u2019s \u201ca place holder because everyone knows him. You call up my nieces and nephews right now, they\u2019ll say \u2018Biden\u2019 because they know Biden. They don\u2019t know the other candidates that well.\u201d But she pointed out that while Biden is a well-known commodity with the older black electorate, \u201cAfrican-American voters are trending young and he\u2019s not as well known. Maybe they were in elementary school when Joe Biden was elected vice president. The question is will he be able to reach out and give them a hopefully optimistic message not only to win their support but broaden participation.\u201d Elleithee warned that Biden's current standing atop the field doesn't mean that another candidate can't \"chip away\" at his lead with minority voters. And Biden can provide his rivals with plenty of ammunition \u2013 including his crafting of the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, his vote last decade in favor of the Iraq War, his now-criticized treatment of Anita Hill while Senate Judiciary Committee chairman during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearing, and his initial observation of Obama during the 2008 primaries as \u201cclean and articulate.\u201d HARRIS CRITICIZES BIDEN OVER CONTROVERSIAL 1994 CRIME BILL After Biden recently defended the crime bill, which has been criticized in recent years for a spike in incarcerations, especially among minorities, Harris shot back. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for Vice President Joe Biden, but I disagree,\u201d the senator said last week. \u201cThat 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and it was the first time we had a federal three strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states.\u201d The comment by Harris could just be an appetizer for things to come. Brazile noted: \u201cIt's early.\u201d And pointing to Obama\u2019s original White House win, she predicted \u201cwe could see a repeat of the 2008 cycle where one of the candidates catches fire in Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada and all bets [are] off going into South Carolina and Super Tuesday. You will see once again black voters playing an oversized role in the major states on Super Tuesday.\u201d",

Hunter Biden's financial involvement in the Ukraine gas company Burisma -- while his father was in office -- has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks since the House of Representatives formally launched the impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his conversation with the\u00a0Ukrainian president about investigating the Bidens. With public impeachment hearings scheduled for this week, Republicans\u00a0recently included Hunter Biden on a list of witnesses they wanted to hear under oath. Appearing on a televised town hall Monday, the 2020 frontrunner doubled down on his claim that no wrongdoing took place while he was vice president. \"Every single, solitary, serious investigator... looked at this and said there's absolutely zero basis to the accusation that I acted inappropriately or that my son did,\" Biden told the Iowa audience. \"This is all about Trump trying to create a diversion... There's not a scintilla of evidence pointing out that anything is wrong.\" After calling Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a \"chump,\" Biden dismissed Republicans'\u00a0inclusion of his son on their testimony wish list.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is facing\u00a0claims that his\u00a0campaign plagiarized at least five parts of the\u00a0climate platform released on Tuesday. The apparent similarities were first flagged on Twitter by a progressive activist. By Tuesday afternoon, most of the examples in the Biden campaign platform had been updated online to include attribution to a third party. BIDEN UNVEILS CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN USING GREEN NEW DEAL AS FRAMEWORK, AFTER AOC CRITICISM \u201cThe paragraph in Joe Biden\u2019s climate plan about carbon capture and sequestration includes language that is remarkably similar to items published previously by the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition,\u201d Josh Nelson, the vice president of CREDOmobile, tweeted earlier in the day. Nelson posted two examples of the campaign borrowing language from left-wing groups. Biden's platform said, \"Carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d But Nelson pointed out on Twitter that the Blue Green Alliance used that same language in a 2017 letter. In another example, the campaign\u2019s platform said,\u00a0\u201cBiden\u2019s goal is to make CCUS a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals.\u201d Nearly identical language appears on the website of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which said its \"goal is to make carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals.\u201d By Tuesday afternoon, attribution was apparently added to both parts to give credit to the Blue Green Alliance and Carbon Capture Coalition. The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News, but told Politico, \"Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22 page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.\u201d Additional\u00a0examples surfaced Tuesday, with The Daily Caller News Foundation identifying three other sections that raised questions. The Daily Caller flagged a part from Biden\u2019s platform that said, \u201cAviation accounts for nearly 2 percent\u00a0of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that portion is expected to increase. Unfortunately today, few low-carbon technologies or fuels have been developed to tackle this challenge.\u201d The liberal website Vox in January used similar language in a story that said, \u201cAviation accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that share is poised to grow.\u201d In another example, the campaign said the \u201caverage American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years.\u201d The website American Rivers has previously posted online that the \u201caverage American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years.\u201d By Tuesday afternoon, the Biden platform attributed the information to American Rivers. The Biden\u00a0campaign platform on Tuesday also said, \u201c40 percent\u00a0of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the U.S. live in Alaska, where the rapid pace of rising temperatures and melting sea ice and glaciers threaten the critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state.\u201d The\u00a0Climate.gov\u00a0website has strikingly similar language:\u00a0\u201cOf the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States, 40 percent (229 tribes) live in Alaska Native communities. The rapid pace of rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost in Alaska is having a significant negative impact on critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state.\u201d By Tuesday, the platform had attributed the information \u201cto the U.S. federal government.\u201d Republicans reacted Tuesday by accusing Biden of repeated plagiarism \u2013 an allegation that famously hampered his 1988 presidential campaign. \u201cThis is not Joe Biden's first brush with plagiarism,\u201d said the Republican National Committee\u2019s Steve Guest. \u201cDuring his 1988 campaign, Biden plagiarized campaign speeches from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as well as Robert Kennedy. During law school, Biden plagiarized, too.\u201d In a statement earlier in the day, Biden announced his environmental plan, calling it\u00a0\u201cThe Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and\u00a0Environmental Justice.\u201d \u201cWe must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world,\u201d Biden said.

Joe Lieberman praised President Trump's China strategy on \"America's Newsroom\" Wednesday, after saying 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe\u00a0Biden may have flip-flopped on the issue. The former vice presidential candidate said America can't run the risk of getting into a cold war with China and must stand firm with regard to intellectual property rights. JOHN SUNUNU ON JOE BIDEN'S LEAD SLIPPING IN IOWA: HIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 'A LITTLE BIT INEPT' \"Well, I've seen a lot of flip-flops in my day,\" said Lieberman, the former Independent senator from Connecticut. \"I'd say that one just is low down on the scale. Here's what I mean. In the earlier comment, [Biden]\u00a0was kind of Mr. Pro American ... Yesterday he said [China's]\u00a0a challenge but not a threat. So I think in a way he clarified what he was trying to say earlier which seemed to be almost like don't worry about it. Don't worry about China.\u00a0But we do have to\u00a0worry about China.\u00a0It's a growing power. And we have to worry not only about the challenge it represents to us, but that we make sure if we possibly can, that we not get into some kind of cold war with China because that would hurt us as well as them.\" Lieberman said he has been assigned to work with the\u00a0Chinese company GTE to assess why it's being\u00a0viewed as a threat in the United States. He claimed it's safe for Americans to conduct business with China, but also warned against the country's history of stealing trade secrets. \"This telecom company ZTE, which, in a way, is a smaller version of what Huawei does [is] worried that there's still opposition to it doing business in the United States,\" he said. BIDEN LEAD SLIPS IN LATEST IOWA POLL; SANDERS, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG ARE NEAREST CONTENDERS \"So they asked me not to lobby for them, but to find out what's on people's minds and what can we do to reassure people in American government, American business, American consumers that it's safe to buy ZTE products. So there's a lot of concerns here. Some of it is about historic patterns of China where there is some evidence that it's happened. For instance, some Chinese companies have stolen trade secrets from American companies.\" Lieberman said Trump is taking the right approach with China by pushing for tariffs and publicly highlighting the rising conflict between the two superpowers. \"I do [agree with Trump] on the substance of [his China strategy]\u00a0which is that these negotiations with the Chinese which are described as trade or tariff negotiations are really more than that,\" he said.\"If it was just tariffs I think we already would have had a deal.\" \"But the president is raising another kind of issue and it really is an important one to raise, which is the kind of structural differences between our two countries,\" Lieberman continued. \"It's time for China -- it's a great economy now. Stop, if they are still stealing our trade secrets -- stop\u00a0forcing American companies when they do business in China to share their technology with Chinese companies and reassure us that if we buy Chinese products you're not going to use them in some day of conflict between our two countries to compromise America.\"",

Earlier this month, Joe Biden told Fox News\u00a0in Iowa\u00a0that he never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings with him. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.\u201d Hunter Biden told The\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0previously that he and his father had spoken \u201cjust once\" about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. A source close\u00a0to Archer\u00a0told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. Contemporaneous news reports indicate\u00a0the vice president was in the Hamptons at the time. Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014. Earlier this month, Trump suggested that despite his claims, Joe Biden seemingly discussed Ukraine matters with his son. The White House has sought to point to\u00a0possible corruption by the Bidens, amid the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry against the president. \u201cAnd now, he made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOf course you spoke to your son!\u201d Biden\u00a0has acknowledged\u00a0on camera\u00a0that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured\u00a0Ukraine to fire top prosecutor\u00a0Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating\u00a0Burisma Holdings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0where Hunter had a\u00a0lucrative role\u00a0on the board despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired. TRUMP SEEKS TO TURN TABLES ON BIDEN AMID IMPEACHMENT PROBE \"Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,\" Biden\u00a0joked at a panel two years after leaving office. Shokin himself had already been widely accused of corruption. Critics alleged\u00a0Hunter Biden\u00a0might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. \"Impossible to justify $50k/month for Hunter Biden serving on a Ukrainian energy board w zero expertise unless he promised to sell access,\" political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work. In a combative\u00a0interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed\u00a0Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired. \"I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,\" Giuliani said. \"The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was.\" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had\u00a0pressured him into resigning\u00a0because he was unwilling to drop the case. REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER\u2019S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE Later, Giuliani added: \"I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor\u2019s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.\" After anchor\u00a0George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back:\u00a0\"How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won\u2019t be [investigated], because they\u2019ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.\" Speaking separately to\u00a0Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\"\u00a0Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque. \u201cThe pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,\" Giuliani said, \"which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know\u00a0and when did he know it?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Giuliani referred to a December 2015\u00a0New York Times\u00a0article about Hunter Biden, Burisma\u00a0and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message. \"The question is,\" Giuliani asked,\u00a0\"when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say, 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'\" \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d producer\u00a0Alex Pfeiffer\u00a0contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren\u00a0raked in $24.6\u00a0million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden \u2013\u00a0once the unrivaled front-runner \u2013\u00a0for the primary lead. While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling\u00a0$25.3 million in the third quarter. BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL But Warren's campaign cash number comes close \u2014\u00a0and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by\u00a0Biden\u00a0in the last quarter. Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls. The Massachusetts senator, who\u2019s produced one progressive policy proposal after another,\u00a0announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.\u201d \u201cTogether, we\u2019re building a movement that\u2019s going to put power back in the hands of the people,\u201d she pledged. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Warren\u2019s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter. Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million. Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million. President Trump\u2019s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign\u00a0announced that it\u00a0and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if\u00a0she reaches the general election, Warren touted her \"grassroots movement\" and highlighted \"that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.\" Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate\u2019s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign\u2019s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel\u00a0and ads. Fox News' Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.\u201d\n\nBiden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: \u201cJoe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That\u2019s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). \u2026 Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020.\u00a0 \u2026 Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).\u201d\n\nTrump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: \u201cWisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. \u2026 Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.\u201d\n\nHave you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: \u201cAt campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled \u2018Dude Gotta Go,\u2019 with a lengthy discussion of the president\u2019s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of \u2018electability,\u2019 which she described as the \u2018elephant\u2019 in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. \u2026 In strategic terms, her campaign\u2019s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates \u2026 while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.\u201d\n\nSTEYER STICKING AROUND \nFox Business: \u201cThe wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. \u2018Tom is surging because he\u2019s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,\u2019 his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. \u2018Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: \u201cBernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation\u2019s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event\u2019s host committee in 2016. \u2026 His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.\u201d\n\nDem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: \u201cInterviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how \u2014 or how much \u2014 the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]\u2026 Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump\u2019s unmatched ability to shift the public\u2019s focus. \u2026 The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire\u2026 But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND\u2026 \n\n\u201c\u2026it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated\u2026\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1\n\nTIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF \u2018THE NATION\u2019S RIVER\u2019\nSmithsonian: \u201cWhen George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water \u2018the nation\u2019s river.\u2019 At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation\u2019s capital had lost its luster. \u2026 Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. \u2026 Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University\u2019s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. \u2026 But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a027.2 points (\u2193\u00a00.4 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a024.6 points (\u2191 3.8 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a014.6 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.6 points (\u2193\u00a02 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a06.2 points (\u2191\u00a00.8 points from last wk.)\n[Averages include: IBD, Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University, Fox News and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a040.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.8 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-13 percent\nChange from one week ago: \u2193 2 points\n[Average includes: IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 53% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; CNBC: 37% approve - 53% disapprove; Gallup: 40% approve - 56% disapprove.] \u00a0 \n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word \u2018impeachment.\u2019 Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. \u2026 The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a \u2018walk and chew gum\u2019 image for the party \u2014 that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.\u201d\n\nTeam Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: \u201cThe White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who\u2019ve come out in support of the inquiry. \u2026 Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he\u2019s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\u201d\n\nMcConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: \u201cEarlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have \u2018no choice\u2019 but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. \u2018Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,\u2019 McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. \u2018All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\u2019 \u2026 The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's \u2018Ad Library,\u2019 started running the digital ad last week\u2026\u201d\n\nSUPCO BACK IN SESSION\nFox News: \u201cNow, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. \u2018The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,\u2019 said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. \u2018And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.\u2019\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nTrump pulls back troops from northern Syria ahead of Turkish assault, Pentagon officials \u2018blindsided\u2019 - Fox News\n\nTrump to rally for GOP candidates for governor in Louisiana Friday - KALB\n\nTrump granted reprieve on tax return case - Fox News\n\nMark Kelly outraises Martha McSally for third quarter - Arizona Republic\n\nWarren and Schumer\u2019s 20 year history - National Journal\n\nPergram: Ever since impeachment inquiry was announced, it's been getting crazier out there - Fox News\n\nJimmy Carter recovering after fall at Georgia home - WAGA\n\nAUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER\n\u201cWe say, \u2018Don\u2019t cross this line.\u2019 Okay, you crossed it. So, \u2018Don\u2019t cross\u00a0this\u00a0line.\u2019 We\u2019re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.\u201d \u2013 Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cA week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very \u2018wine-dy\u2019 (meaning curve-y)\u00a0 road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled \u2018Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans\u2019 strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your \u2018Off Ramp\u2019 article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I gather from your\u00a0sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president\u2019s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been \u201cperfect\u201d then what\u2019s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It\u2019s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don\u2019t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: \u201cYou have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We\u2019re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that\u2019s our job.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m supposed to do that and not talk about what\u2019s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president\u2019s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It\u2019s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we\u2019ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don\u2019t seem to understand what a pickle he\u2019s put them in \u2014 and the huge problems he\u2019s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken \u2014 the \u201cperfect\u201d doctrine \u2014 does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now \u201cmove on\u201d from a divisive distraction. It\u2019s none of my business who wins this fight. That\u2019s up to you. But if you\u2019re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don\u2019t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I\u2019m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]\n\n\n\u201cChris, I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting \u2018dirt\u2019 on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don\u2019t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what\u2019s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas\n\n\n[Ed. note: The president\u00a0mustn\u2019t\u00a0do such things himself.\u00a0And he\u00a0especially\u00a0mustn\u2019t\u00a0do them when he would be the direct\u00a0beneficiary.\u00a0We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI.\u00a0We have all manner of means by which to combat\u00a0corruption\u00a0here and abroad.\u00a0But when\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0about his political opponents, the\u00a0president\u00a0must do his best to stay\u00a0out of it.\u00a0Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in\u00a0our\u00a0legal\u00a0system\u00a0to provide\u00a0dispassionate\u00a0justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the\u00a0temptation\u00a0is.\u00a0But\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0not something Americans want to become normal. That\u2019s\u00a0how\u00a0governments operate\u00a0in places like\u00a0Turkey, Russia and China: People in power\u00a0use\u00a0that power to stifle their rivals.\u00a0I know Trump\u00a0believes\u00a0the system is rigged against him, but he is still the\u00a0president\u00a0and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation\u00a0or voters\u00a0will surely throw him out next year.]\n\n\n\u201cUnforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent \u2013 and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the \u2018Curse of the Early Frontrunner\u2019 and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to \u2018keep your powder dry\u2019 for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.\n\n\n[Ed. note:\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0very interesting\u00a0take, Mr. Haldorson.

An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new \u2014 and arguably strangest \u2014 offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as \u2018cuy\u2019 in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But Mar\u00eda del Carmen Pilapa\u00f1a, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation \u2014 and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. \u2026 Pilapa\u00f1a makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig\u2019s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\u201cAs I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer\u00a0(1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.\n\nChris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted\u00a0during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday night\u00a0that neither he nor his son Hunter did anything \"wrong\" when it comes to the younger Biden's past work in\u00a0Ukraine. Biden was asked why his son was able to hold a lucrative role serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, while he was running U.S.-Ukraine policy as former President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. DEMS UNITE BEHIND IMPEACHING TRUMP AT DEBATE, EVEN AS PELOSI SAYS THERE WON'T BE A VOTE \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government, which was to root out corruption in Ukraine and that\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d Hunter Biden, earlier\u00a0Tuesday during an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d likewise defended his role, claiming he did nothing improper, though he did acknowledge\u00a0it was \"poor judgment\" to have joined the company's board. \u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,\u201d the younger Biden said Tuesday morning. He also acknowledged in the interview that if he had a different last name, he would not have been appointed to the board of Burisma. During the debate, Biden continued to defend his son, saying that his \u201cstatement speaks for itself,\u201d and that the focus should be on President Trump asking Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 elections. \u201cRudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven they are flat-out lying,\u201d Biden said. The Ukraine controversy began when a whistleblower reported that the president had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine\u2014specifically, why Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter was on the board. The president's request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, something critics have cited as evidence of a\u00a0quid pro quo arrangement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That whistleblower report and the fallout from the transcript of the highly controversial phone call between Trump and Zelensky this summer sparked a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., though, said Tuesday that the House would not vote, at this point in time, to formalize the impeachment proceedings. Biden maintained Tuesday that Trump\u2019s efforts were simply because of his concerns surrounding his 2020 reelection chances, particularly against Biden. Several polls have shown Biden as Dems' presidential frontrunner throughout the primary season, and some have further suggested he would have an edge against Trump in a general election. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump,\u201d Biden continued, repeating a line he has used frequently on social media. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He\u2019s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d",

We\u2019ve worked with him for a long time and I think we\u2019ve done a good job at trying to help him be successful.\u201d Kushner also addressed the House Democrats' ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry, which has shed\u00a0light on Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who reportedly used his father\u2019s name to gain a seven-figure job at one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies despite having no prior related worked experience. Hunter Biden worked for the company, Burisma Holdings, at the same time his father, while vice president, was seeking the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a top Burisma official. The impeachment probe stems from a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that President Trump, during a July phone call, asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in the country.\u00a0Trump made the request while the U.S. was withholding military aid but maintains there was no quid quo pro. Kushner insisted that the president was clear of wrongdoing. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to impeach the president for the past three years or get him out of office and they\u2019ve been unsuccessful at that,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cThe best thing going for the president is that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and at this point, they\u2019ve investigated him over and over and over again, and I think the American people are sick and tired of it.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s record of accomplishments is unimpeachable, and he\u2019s going to continue to do the things that the American people care about,\u201d Kushner continued. \u00a0\u201cIf Congress wants to be a part of the work we do to try to make the country stronger and more prosperous, we welcome them to join us. If they want to play silly games, we\u2019ll obviously deal with that in an appropriate manner, but we\u2019re not going to let that distract us as an administration.\u201d Kushner, who is Jewish, traveled to Israel on Monday where he met separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former military chief Benny Gantz. The two rivals were deadlocked following last month's Israeli elections, with neither able to easily form a majority coalition, raising the possibility of an unprecedented third election in less than a year.\u00a0Kushner urged Gantz and Netanyahu to form a government so Israel would be able to seize on the \u201ctremendous opportunities\u201d in the region, including military and business partnerships with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations. \u201cBenny was a great general in the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and he did a great job there and served Israel tremendously, and he seems to have a good intention to try and bring good to Israel, and hopefully he will be able to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu and find a way to move forward,\" Kushner told News Israel 13. He also responded to Israeli concerns after President Trump made the call to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision some critics said left the Kurds, who are American allies, vulnerable to Turkey and other forces. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \u201cAnyone in Israel who thinks it has any implications for the U.S.-Israel relationship is badly mistaken,\u201d Kushner said,\u00a0\u201cbecause under President Trump, the bond between America and Israel has been significantly strengthened and our intention is to continue to do more of the same.\u201d Fox News' Brooke Singman, Brie Stimson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden, in an online video Thursday, officially declared his candidacy for president in 2020, capping off weeks of intrigue and media speculation. He\u00a0enters a crowded field of Democratic contenders aiming to unseat President Trump -- nearly 32 years after he announced his first campaign for president.\u00a0The campaign is Biden\u2019s third for the White House, having also unsuccessfully run in 1988 and 2008. \"The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America -- America -- is at stake. That\u2019s why today I\u2019m announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Biden tweeted early Thursday. With the announcement, which followed months of deliberations, Biden becomes a front-runner in an incredibly crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders all vying to face off next year against\u00a0Trump. The president welcomed Biden into the race, warning him that the race will be \"nasty.\" \"Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe,\" Trump tweeted. \"I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!\" Biden, along with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- who is\u00a0making his second straight White House run --\u00a0have consistently topped the polls in the race for the Democratic nomination. In Thursday's video, the former vice president pointed to the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia in August of 2017 at a large white nationalist rally, Biden took aim at Trump\u2019s response that \u201cthere were some very fine people on both sides.\u201d \u201cWith those words, the president of the United assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,\" Biden charged. \"And in that moment, I new the threat to this nation was unlike any I had seen in my lifetime. I wrote at the time that we\u2019re in the battle for the soul of this nation. Well, that\u2019s even more true today. We are in the battle for the soul of this nation.\" Biden argued that \"if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\" Fox News reported last week that the theme of the announcement would be \u2018the battle for the soul of America.\u2019 Biden is expected to follow up the announcement with his first high-dollar fundraiser in the Philadelphia home of Comcast executive David Cohen Thursday evening and\u00a0appear at a local union hall in Pittsburgh on Monday. The former Delaware senator has for weeks been rallying\u00a0potential donors in an effort to gain momentum, noting that Sanders and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas managed to raise $6 million within 24 hours of launching their candidacy. The Biden campaign said that the former vice president will lay out his \u201cvision for rebuilding America\u2019s middle class\u201d at the Pittsburgh event. Then he\u2019s scheduled to travel to the four states that vote first in the primary and caucus nominating calendar. They add that Biden will hold a rally in Philadelphia on May 18, likely at the city\u2019s Museum of Art \u2013 known nationally for the scene of the fictional Rocky Balboa\u2019s training on the museum\u2019s steps in the movie \"Rocky.\u201d The start and finish of his initial campaign swing in Pennsylvania is no surprise. The state \u2013 long a crucial battleground in presidential elections \u2013 was one of the key states Trump flipped in the 2016 election to help him capture the White House. And while Biden has long lived in Delaware and represented that state for nearly four decades in the Senate, he was born and spent his early years in Scranton, Pennsylvania and the Keystone State has always remained special to him. Moments after his announcement, Biden was endorsed by Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Biden\u2019s long awaited and much anticipated presidential campaign launch comes after facing allegations in recent weeks\u00a0from women that he had made them feel uncomfortable in the past with what was described as inappropriate touching. It instantly become a top story online and on the cable news networks, forcing the former vice president to play defense in the #MeToo era and defend his decades old brand of close up and personal politics \"Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying,\" Biden explained in a video released during the height of the furor, which threatened his looming candidacy. \"Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That's my responsibility and I will meet it.\" While Biden didn\u2019t apologize to those who raised the allegations, he did say that \"I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t understand more. I\u2019m not sorry for any of my intentions. I\u2019m not sorry for anything I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.\u201d And referring to well-publicized past\u00a0episodes of getting too close for comfort with fellow politicians, their family members and others, the former vice president explained that \"it is incumbent on me and everybody else to make sure that if you embrace someone, if you touch someone, it\u2019s with their consent, regardless of your intentions.\" While the controversy was dominating headlines, Biden\u2019s inner circle was continuing to reach out to Democratic operatives as they quietly mapped out a national campaign structure as well as staff in the early voting primary and caucus states. And in the days leading up to the launch, Biden picked up the pace on reaching out to top donors and supporters, with the acknowledgment that he\u2019ll be judged by how much he fundraising dollars he hauls in in the first 24 hours after declaring his candidacy. Biden has long had his eyes on his presidency: In June of 1987, Biden first launched a bid for the 1988 Democratic nomination.The then-senator from Delaware was considered one of the stronger candidates in the emerging Democratic field. But three months into his campaign, he faced newspaper headlines that he had plagiarized a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. The incident sparked a controversy, knocking Biden out of the race well before the start of the primaries and caucuses. Biden ran a second time for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 cycle, declaring his candidacy in January of 2007. Despite his long record, his campaign never caught lightning in a bottle. There were also some well-publicized gaffes, including his description of then-Sen. Barack Obama. \"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\" Biden said at the time. \"I mean, that's a storybook, man.\u201d The comments quickly spelled trouble for Biden, forcing him to apologize. Biden\u2019s bid was also overshadowed by Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, who ended up battling each other in an historic and marathon quest for the nomination. Biden dropped out of the race after coming in fifth in the Iowa caucus, grabbing less than one percent of the vote. But seven months later, Obama selected Biden as his running mate. The pair won the November 2008 election, and were re-elected in 2012. Biden seriously considered another run for the White House in 2016, but grappling with the death of his eldest son Beau, the Vice President announced in October of 2015 that he would not launch a campaign. Speaking from the podium at the Rose Garden, Biden explained that he had been emotionally drained by the death of his son and stressed that \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110 percent of who they are.\u201d But the decision not to run haunted him. He noted in early 2016 that he regretted not running \u201cevery day.\u201d Trump\u2019s upset victory over Clinton in the 2016 presidential election changed the dynamic for Biden. He soon became a vocal critic of the Republican in the White House, and speculation sprang up that Biden would consider a final presidential bid in 2020. Trips to New Hampshire in 2017 and to Iowa, South Carolina and Iowa in 2018 fueled the flames. Biden dropped a major hint of his pending 2020 campaign in early March. After walking to the podium at the at the annual convention of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) to chants of \u201crun Joe, run,\u201d by the union crowd, Biden said \u201cI appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks.\u201d The comments brought a standing ovation from the mostly blue collar audience that Biden feels he can count on as he runs for president. SANDERS FACES HECKLERS In early April, Biden told reporters \"I am very close to making a decision to stand before you all relatively soon.\" Asked why the hold-up, Biden quickly answered, \"The hold-up is to put everything together.\" At the time, Biden also pushed back against the perception that he's a moderate in a party that's increasingly moving to the left. He defended himself, saying he'll stack his record against \"anybody who has run or who is running now or who will run.\" And highlighting his early public push for same-sex marriage during the Obama administration, he stressed \"I'm not sure when everybody else came out and said they're for gay marriage.\" Biden was born on November 20, 1942, and lived in Scranton, Pennsylvania for ten years until moving with his family to Delaware. He became an attorney in 1969 and was elected to the New Castle City Council in 1970. He won what was out the outset a long-shot election to the Senate two years later, becoming the sixth-youngest senator in the nation\u2019s history. He was re-elected six times before resigning in 2009 to take on the duties as vice president. During his nearly four decades in the Senate, he was a longtime member and former chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. He also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But Biden\u2019s role as Judiciary Committee chairman in 1991 during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is arguably more controversial today than it was at the time nearly three decades ago. In March he lamented the impact of \"white man's culture\" and bemoaned his own role in the hearings that undermined witness Anita Hill's credibility. Biden said that Hill, who is black, should not have been forced to face a panel of \"a bunch of white guys\" about her sexual harassment allegations against Thomas, who was nominated by President George H.W. Bush. GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to give her the kind of hearing she deserved,\" he said. \"I wish I could have done something.\" But his comments elicited derision by many women, who argued that as the chairman of the committee, he had the power to do something. Biden married his wife Neilia in 1966. In 1972, soon after his election to the Senate, his wife and their daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident. Sons Beau and Hunter Biden survived. He married his second and current wife Jill five years later. Fox News' Bradford Betz contributed to this report.",

      "content": " DURHAM, N.H. \u2013 There\u2019s a new warning sign for former Vice President Joe Biden in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. Biden,\u00a0once the unrivaled front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polling and many early primary and caucus state surveys,\u00a0now stands at 15 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, according to\u00a0a new University of New Hampshire poll conducted for CNN. That's a drop of 9 percentage points since the previous UNH/CNN survey, which was conducted in July. WARREN OPENS UP 7-POINT EDGE OVER BIDEN IN NATIONAL POLL Asked about the new poll, Biden told MSNBC on Tuesday that \u201cpolls, as you know, are up and down.\u201d The former vice president stated that he still planned on performing well in New Hampshire and the other early-voting states of Iowa, Nevada\u00a0and South Carolina. The survey indicates Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 21 percent support, with progressive rival Elizabeth Warren at 18 percent. There\u2019s no front-runner in the new poll, as Sanders\u2019 3 point edge over Warren is within the survey\u2019s sampling error for likely Democratic primary voters. Both Sanders and Warren \u2013\u00a0who hail\u00a0from the neighboring states of Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively\u00a0\u2013\u00a0stood at 19 percent in the July survey, trailing Biden. South Bend, Ind.,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2013\u00a0at 10 percent \u2013\u00a0is the only other candidate in the still-large field of Democratic White House hopefuls to crack double digits. His numbers are unchanged from the summer survey. The new poll was conducted Oct. 21-27, entirely after the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are tied\u00a0at 5 percent support, with each gaining support from the summer survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas register at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less. New Hampshire presidential primary voters are traditionally late deciders, which is reflected in the survey. With three-and-a-half months to go until the February contest, only 23 percent said they\u2019ve definitely decided on which candidate they\u2019ll support. Just over one in five said they\u2019re leaning toward\u00a0a candidate, with a whopping 57 percent saying they remain undecided. Biden \u2013 who returns to New Hampshire at the end of next week to formally file to place his name on the primary ballot \u2013 still leads when it comes to electability. Thirty-six percent of those questioned say he has the best chance of any Democratic White House hopeful of beating President Trump in next year\u2019s general election. But that\u2019s down from 45 percent in July. And in the new survey, the former vice president grabs just 20 percent support among his core groups \u2014\u00a0voters 50 and older, and self-described moderates and conservatives. POLL SUGGESTS MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD BE FRONT-RUNNER IN NH IF SHE ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE RACE Warren\u00a0doubled her electability number, from 9 percent in July to 18 percent now. And Sanders widened his lead over Warren as the most progressive candidate in the field \u2014\u00a0from 40-23 percent in July to 47-18 percent now. Buttigieg saw his favorable rating rise from 48 percent in July to 55 percent now. Klobuchar saw her favorability soar from 24 percent in the summer to 40 percent now. And Yang\u2019s favorable rating skyrocketed as well, from 17 percent to 36 percent. In the Republican presidential primary, Trump remains the overwhelming front-runner, with 86 percent support among likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Even though he\u2019s visited the Granite State nearly every week since launching his long-shot primary challenge in April, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld stood at just 5 percent. But he\u2019s ahead of the two other Republican presidential primary long shots. Both former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former conservative radio talk show host and one-term congressman from Illinois Joe Walsh are each at just 1 percent in the poll. The UNH/CNN poll was conducted using live telephone operators, who questioned 574 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire. The margin of error for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. Four-hundred-and-sixty-one likely GOP primary voters were also questioned, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.",

Dick Gruber, mayor of the northwest city in Iowa, announced this week that he is backing former Vice President Joe Biden for the 2020, rather than closest rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The endorsement was\u00a0reported by The Washington Examiner, and was announced in an email to reporters from the Biden campaign. WARREN SAYS SHE'S OPEN TO HALTING DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS \u201cIowans know that Joe Biden is the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump next November, and that\u2019s why leaders from across the state are coming forward to proudly show their support,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. The nod is likely to raise some eyebrows from Trump supporters, who have delighted in President Trump\u2019s frequent mocking of Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d in reference to her past claims to have Native American ancestry. Warren apologized to Native groups\u00a0this year after she touted a DNA test that her campaign said backed her claims to have Native American heritage. \"Like anyone who has been honest with themselves, I know I have made mistakes,\" Warren said. \"I am sorry for the harm I have caused.\" But it\u2019s an issue that has continued to dog her, particularly as Trump has repeatedly used the \u201cPocahontas\u201d moniker for years -- even though his opponents have alleged that it is a racist slur. \u201cWho? Pocahontas?\u201d Trump said when asked about Warren in 2016. When told by reporters that the term was \u201cvery offensive,\u201d he responded: \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d before immediately saying it again.

That didn't go over so well as the FOP released a video rebuffing Buttigieg's gift. \"If this was a lame attempt to apologize to South Bend police officers, it didn't go over very well,\" FOP President Harvey Mills said in a video posted in July. Buttigieg also faces\u00a0low support among African Americans and\u00a0came under fire during Wednesday's Democratic debate for using a stock photo of a black woman to promote his plan geared toward the \"empowerment of black America.\"",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., \u201ccondescending\u201d and elitist for comments she made last week suggesting he was running in the \u201cwrong presidential\u00a0primary.\u201d Biden made the comments at a Pittsburgh fundraiser and in an op-ed published in Medium Tuesday. He did not mention her by name, but\u00a0wrote in the op-ed that her attacks represent an \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d with a \"my way or the highway\"\u00a0approach to politics. HILLARY CLINTON ADVISES DEMS TO CHOOSE 2020 NOMINEE WHO CAN WIN ELECTORAL COLLEGE \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than that,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.\u201d Biden wrote that her jabs are an \u201celitism\u201d that working and middle-class Americans don\u2019t appreciate. Warren also said he was \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d when he criticized her recently unveiled Medicare for All plan. Biden and the other Democratic presidential candidates have stepped up their attacks on Warren recently as she surges in the polls, jockeying with Biden for the top spot. Biden concluded in the op-ed\u00a0that Democrats need to stop elitist attacks on each other\u00a0in order to beat President Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It\u2019s not the first time Warren has been called elitist. Republican Sen. Scott Brown\u00a0mockingly referred to her as \u201cProfessor Warren\u201d when he unsuccessfully ran against her in Massachusetts in 2012. The Warren campaign has yet to comment on Biden's remarks.
