      "content": " A former campaign employee from the 2020 presidential bid of\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sander\u00a0filed a labor complaint this week, alleging that some\u00a0employees faced retaliation for involvement\u00a0in organizing for a collective bargaining agreement. The employee, who has not been publicly identified, filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Tuesday, according to a redacted copy of the charge obtained by Bloomberg Law. The complaint alleges that Sanders\u2019 campaign made unionized employees work additional days without\u00a0commensurate days off, thus violating the terms of their collective bargaining agreement. Campaign management \"retaliated against me when I organized the bargaining unit and sent an email requesting compliance with the [collective bargaining agreement],\u201d the individual wrote in the charge. The charges, if true, could be\u00a0yet another ironic blow for the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist\u00a0senator, I-Vt., who has portrayed himself as an ally of organized labor. Sanders made history earlier this year after announcing that his campaign employees would be represented by a union. But The Washington Post reported last week, that campaign staffers have been \u201cbattling with \u2026 management, arguing that the compensation and treatment they are receiving does not meet the standards Sanders espouses in his rhetoric, according to internal communications.\u201d CHARLES PAYNE: BERNIE SANDERS CUTTING STAFFERS\u2019 HOURS TO MEET MINIMUM WAGE MARK TEACHERS HIM A \u2018VALUABLE LESSON\u2019 An agreement on that dispute was reached earlier this week, with Sanders announcing that pay would be raised from $36,000 to $42,000. The unfair labor practice charge filed on Tuesday alleges that some employees were not notified of their collective bargaining agreement before being hired and made to believe they were \u201cat-will.\u201d \u201cThe campaign leadership, from Senator\u00a0Sanders on down, respects the rights of all of its employees to speak collectively and bargain about their terms and conditions of employment, and it supports the mission of the NLRB to enforce worker and union rights,\" Sanders' campaign said in a prepared statement to Fox News.\u00a0\"That is exactly why the Bernie 2020 campaign voluntarily recognized the employees\u2019 chosen union and engaged in good faith bargaining that resulted in a\u00a0historic collective bargaining agreement.\" The campaign declined to discuss the specifics of the matter \"in order to maintain the integrity of the NLRB process.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The NLRB\u2019s office in Indianapolis is now investigating the allegations, The Hill reported. If the claims are proved to be true, and if the National Labor Relations Act and\u00a0involved parties are unable to bring about a resolution,\u00a0the case will be sent to an NLRB administrative law judge.",

End of discussion,\u201d but added he has an issue with the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has run the country in recent years, the Washington Examiner reported. \u201cI think what has happened is in recent years under Netanyahu, you have an extreme right-wing government with many racist tendencies,\u201d Sanders said, blaming the prime minister for worsening tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0Sanders also criticized President Trump\u2019s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the holy city of Jerusalem, something he believes put peace negotiations with Palestinians at risk. In May, the Trump administration officially opened the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, in a historic move cheered by Israelis but met with mass protests from Palestinians that turned deadly in the lead-up to the ceremony. Clashes at the border had left dozens of Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded by the time the ceremony ended. But Israel's prime minister praised the Israeli security forces for protecting the Gaza-Israel border, as U.S. officials held out hope that the prospect of peace remained in reach. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If he becomes president, Sanders said, he\u2019d consider using the billions in aid the U.S. sends to Israel each year as leverage to force Netanyahu\u00a0to change his actions, adding that Palestinians deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, the Examiner reported. Netanyahu became the longest-serving Israeli prime minister this month, having held office for more than 13 years, according to The Guardian. He needs to win an election in September and survive three corruption cases against him in order to remain in office. Fox News' Brooke Singman and Judson Berger contributed to this report.",

      "content": " President Trump drew a torrent of criticism from Democrats on Saturday over a series of Twitter messages aimed at\u00a0U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and the Baltimore district that Cummings represents in Congress. But just a few years ago, Sen. Bernie Sanders -- a candidate seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination -- took his own shots at Baltimore, a struggling Northeast city grappling with high rates of violent crime, drug abuse, poverty and political corruption. \u201cAnyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you\u2019re in a wealthy nation,\u201d Sanders said during a visit to the city\u2019s West Baltimore section in December 2015, the Baltimore Sun reported. \u201cYou would think that you were in a Third World country.\u201d TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON CUMMINGS CRITICISM AS DEMS, BALTIMORE OFFICIALS DEFEND 'HERO' REP The independent U.S. senator from Vermont also referred to Baltimore as \u201ca community in which half of the people don\u2019t have jobs.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a community in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable,\u201d he added, according to the Sun. Sanders was visiting the section of Baltimore where a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray was arrested earlier that year for allegedly possessing an illegal knife. Gray fell into a coma while in police custody and died a few days later, sparking a national outcry against members of the city\u2019s police department. But all six police officers who were suspended in connection with the death either had all charges against them dropped, or were acquitted. ARRESTS ANNOUNCED IN GUNPOINT ROBBERY OF BALTIMORE DEPUTY POLICE COMMISSIONER, WIFE In 2016, Sanders posted a Twitter message about Baltimore. \u201cResidents of Baltimore\u2019s poorest boroughs have lifespans shorter than people living under dictatorship in North Korea,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cThat is a disgrace.\u201d The bleak portrait Sanders painted back then seems little different from the one Trump presented Saturday, in which the president said the city had become a monument to governmental failures. In one message, Trump described Cummings\u2019 district as \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d \u201cIf he spent more time in Baltimore,\u201d the president added, \u201cmaybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place.\u201d \u201cWhere is all this money going?\u201d Trump asked later, referring to federal dollars sent to Baltimore over the years. \u201cHow much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Prominent Democrats \u2013 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who was born in Baltimore and whose father was a Baltimore mayor, and presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 were quick to defend Cummings and fire back at Trump. Also on Saturday, Sanders appeared to abandon his past critiques of Baltimore and focus instead on defending Cummings and bashing the president. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s really going on,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201c@RepCummings has been busy revealing the failures of the Trump administration and exposing the greed of Trump\u2019s friends in the pharmaceutical industry, and our racist president doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d",

Speaking to Jon Favreau on the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0a 2020 Democratic presidential primary hopeful, admitted that it is difficult to ignore Trump\u2019s controversial tweets, but argued that focusing on them and not the issues would almost guarantee that the current occupant of the White House remains there for another term. \u2018[Y]ou cannot ignore Donald Trump and his tweets and his lies,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut if you become obsessed with them, I guarantee you will lose the election.\u201d BERNIE SANDERS CLAIMS 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WILL SLASH HEALTH CARE COSTS WITH TAX HIKE Sanders also criticized his fellow candidates for not shifting the focus of their campaigns to include young and working-class voters. \u201cThe establishment hangs out with the wealthy and the comfortable and people in power and the establishment kind of forgets that as we speak there are millions of people living paycheck to paycheck, who can\u2019t afford health care, who can\u2019t\u2013are paying 50 percent of their limited incomes on rent, who are scared to death about an illness in the family that might bankrupt them,\u201d Sanders said. He added: I think the Democratic establishment to a significant degree, there\u2019s a lot of rhetoric out there, but has really forgotten about that and has forgotten about the need to stand up the power.\u201d Sanders appeared on the popular liberal podcast just days before he is set to take the stage at the second Democratic primary debate and as he battles with Sen.

This comes as Trump faces accusations himself of racism for his incendiary tweets. \"I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist, just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard,\" Trump tweeted Monday. Sanders tweeted back that \"Trump's lies and racism never end.

His comments came during a long, contentious exchange in which candidates clashed over competing visions for health care. Sanders has championed the Medicare-for-all program with his own bill in the Senate and, along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is perhaps its most vociferous proponent in the Democratic field. Sanders' team, on Twitter, doubled down on his fiery statement during the debate.

I know that because I wrote the damn bill. #DemDebate,\" a tweet\u00a0read. His team\u00a0also tweeted his disappointment with former Rep.

      "content": " Once largely considered \u201ctaboo\u201d and a \u201cdirty word,\u201d socialism \u2014\u00a0particularly, Democratic socialism \u2014 has seemingly started to trickle into\u00a0the political mainstream in recent years, thanks, in part, to self-proclaimed Democratic socialist\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. An August 2018 Gallup poll found Democrats had a \u201cmore positive image\u201d of socialism than of capitalism, with 57 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying they had a positive view of socialism compared to 47 percent who had a positive view of capitalism. Sanders will join Fox News Channel for a town hall co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum on Monday, April 15, at 6:30 p.m. ET in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \u201cViews of socialism among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are particularly important in the current political environment because many observers have claimed the Democratic Party is turning in more of a socialist direction,\u201d Gallup noted at the time. 3 BERNIE SANDERS POLICIES NOW EMBRACED BY THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD Socialism \u2014 a\u00a0term that first hatched in the early 19th century, per The Washington Post\u00a0\u2014 has \u201cmeant different things to different people in different times and places, while maintaining a stable core of themes and objectives: social (as opposed to private) control of the means of production, and of all the societal, humanitarian and political-economic changes that entails, especially where the freedom and autonomy of working people are concerned,\u201d\u00a0Opinion columnist Elizabeth Bruenig wrote in August 2018. But what exactly does it mean to be a Democratic socialist? And how have Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and other politicians who align with the political philosophy describe\u00a0its meaning to them? Read on for a brief look Democratic socialism. Democratic socialism pulls from both Democracy and socialism, per the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) website.\u00a0Political theorist and activist Michael Harrington helped form the DSA in 1982. \u201cDemocratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically \u2014 to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few,\u201d the group states, noting to achieve a more \u201cjust society\u201d many \u201cstructures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives.\u201d Democratic socialists favor decentralization; they don\u2019t necessarily want to create \u201can all-powerful government bureaucracy\u201d but are not in favor of \u201cbig corporate bureaucracies to control our society either,\u201d reads the website. Those who align with the political ideology typically support pro-union politics, tuition-free public universities, universal healthcare\u00a0and using tax money from the wealthy to fund social welfare programs, among other ideas, reported TIME\u00a0in October 2018. \u201c[What they want] is not a violent overthrow of capitalism, but working within the system through legal and peaceful means [such as] electoral and social movements,\u201d Maurice Isserman, a professor of History at Hamilton College, told the magazine at the time. \"Medicare for All,\" strong unions and electoral power are three of the DSA\u2019s current campaigns. Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and now one of the many vying for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, explained what the political ideology means to him during a CNN town hall in February. \u201cThese are not radical ideas,\u201d said Sanders, 77. \u201cWhat democratic socialism means to me is having, in a civilized society, the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cAll people should have health care. You can\u2019t get ahead in this country, in this world, unless you have a decent education.\u201d \"We have got to, as a right, end the kinds of discrimination \u2014 the racism, the sexism, and the homophobia \u2014 that exists. To me, when I talk about democratic socialism, what I talk about are human rights and economic rights,\u201d he continued, before going on to list his policies \u2014 such as tuition-free public universities, raising the minimum wage and universal health care \u2014 he would enact if elected president. New York Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, echoed Sanders when speaking to Business Insider in March. \"So when millennials talk about concepts like Democratic socialism, we're not talking about these kinds of 'Red Scare' boogeyman,\" she said. \"We're talking about countries and systems that already exist that have already been proven to be successful in the modern world.\" \"We're talking about single-payer health care that has already been successful in many different models, from Finland to Canada to the UK,\" she added, before going on to say Democratic socialism enforces \u201cbasic levels of dignity so that no person in America is too poor to live.\u201d Julia Salazar, who represents New York\u2019s 18th State Senate District, is also a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist,\u00a0telling October, a beer-centric magazine, she has been a DSA member for two years and is \u201ccommitted to trying to build Democratic socialism.\u201d On a personal level, Salazar, 28, said being a Democratic socialist \u201cmeans fighting to make sure that every person is empowered to be able to determine their own destiny.\u201d \u201cThat all of us have access to not only basic needs, but to what we need to thrive in society. Housing is a human right, not something that should be at the mercy of the market. Health care is a human right, similarly, that shouldn\u2019t be accessible only by income or status,\u201d she added. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district, has also spoken on the political ideology \u2014 telling In These Times\u00a0in August of 2018 \u201cit means a strong partner.\u201d \u201cWhen I talk about equitable, just fairness, I lean on a whole group of people who understand just how much the structures in place are set up against the people, people of color, and the working class. It helps me have an organization and people to lean on. It\u2019s important to have that kind of partnership,\u201d\u00a0Tlaib, 42, said. Isserman\u00a0told NPR in July 2018 \u201cthis is the most important moment in DSA history.\u201d The group has garnered an increasing amount of visibility in recent years, increasing from roughly 7,000 members to 50,00 since President Trump\u2019s election in 2016, according to a 2018 Axios\u00a0report. The growing membership, combined with big wins for Democratic socialists are solid examples of the group\u2019s \u201cgrowing movement,\u201d the publication added. BERNIE SANDERS' BIGGEST STAR-STUDDED BACKERS: MARK RUFFALO, DANNY DEVITO AND OTHERS No country to-date has fully instituted Democratic socialism, per the DSA\u2019s website, which noted some countries \u2014 Canada, Sweden and France, among others \u2014 have pulled from the political ideology in terms of health care, childcare and beyond. Republicans, specifically, often refer to countries where socialism has arguably gone array \u2014 such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela, among others \u2014 to discredit some of the group\u2019s ideologies. \u201cCritics say the U.S. would be a poorer, less efficient society,\u201d Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University, also told TIME.",

A LOOK AT HIS WEALTH AND ASSETS In December 2018, Sanders outlined four ways to \"revitalize\" the U.S. economy: increasing the minimum wage to $15 by 2024, universal health care, tuition-free colleges and the creation of \"millions of jobs\" in sustainable energy. \"Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that work for the many, not just the few,\" tweeted Sanders in February. \"We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.\"",

      "content": " Bernie Sanders is one of the front-runners\u00a0\u2014 raising $18 million in the first six weeks\u00a0of his campaign \u2014 among a crowded field of 2020 presidential hopefuls, but the self-described democratic socialist has also been a trend-setter for the field. Since the Vermont senator mapped out his plans for a \"political revolution\" in 2016, many members of Congress have embraced his policies and ideas.\u00a0And now several candidates are\u00a0using them as talking points as they hit the campaign trail. BERNIE SANDERS FAST FACTS: 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE VERMONT SENATOR Sanders will join\u00a0Fox News Channel for a town hall\u00a0co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum on Monday, April 15, at 6:30 p.m. ET\u00a0in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Here's a look at some of the biggest proposals the 77-year-old\u00a0\u2014 the longest-serving independent member of Congress in U.S. history\u00a0\u2014 has championed for years that 2020 Democrats are now touting. Sanders\u00a0first introduced the\u00a0\"Medicare for All\"\u00a0bill in 2016. He saw it as\u00a0a step toward achieving universal health care. The single-payer health insurance plan would require all U.S. residents to be covered with no copays and deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be regulated to play a minor role in the system. HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED In August 2017, Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif., became the first Senate Democrat\u00a0to support Sanders' bill.\u00a0During a speech\u00a0to officially launch her 2020 run, Harris\u00a0declared \"health care is a fundamental right\" and vowed to serve her constituents by supporting \"Medicare for All.\" Sanders\u00a0introduced an updated version of his \"Medicare for All\" plan\u00a0on April 10. The following 2020 candidates have already endorsed the updated proposal: Harris, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.,\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. The latest edition of Medicare for All adds coverage for long-term care in home and community settings, on top of its basic promise of comprehensive health coverage, including dental and vison. Brand name prescription drugs would be subject to copays totaling no more than $200 annually. Several independent studies\u00a0of Medicare for All have estimated that it would dramatically increase government spending on health care, in the range of about $25 trillion to $35 trillion or more over a 10-year period. But a recent estimate from the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst suggests that the cost could be much lower. For years, Sanders has made passionate pushes to increase the minimum wage. He recently reintroduced legislation to increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour by 2024. \"While the official unemployment rate is relatively low, too many workers in America today are making wages that don\u2019t pay enough to make ends meet.\u00a0Workers and their families cannot make it on $9 an hour or $10 an hour \u2013 or even less,\" Sanders said in a statement in November, claiming it would give 40 million workers a raise. \"We have got to raise the minimum wage in this country to a living wage \u2013 at least $15 an hour.\" At least 20 states increased their minimum wages since the start of the New Year, according to Fox Business. BERNIE SANDERS' BIGGEST STAR-STUDDED BACKERS: MARK RUFFALO, DANNY DEVITO AND OTHERS The Raise the Wage Act legislation that\u00a0was reintroduced in the new Congress by Sanders this year, was cosponsored by several 2020 contenders including Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Once again, Sanders has vowed as a presidential candidate that he will aim \u201cto make public colleges and universities tuition free.\u201d \u201cHigher education in America should be a right for all, not a privilege for the few,\u201d Sanders has said. \u201cIf we are to succeed in a highly competitive global economy and have the best-educated workforce in the world, public colleges and universities must become tuition-free for working families and we must substantially reduce student debt.\u201d Under Sanders' \"College for All Act,\"\u00a0which he introduced alongside Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., in 2017, the government would be responsible for 67 percent ($47 billion) of the cost of tuition and states would pay for the remaining 33 percent ($23 billion). \"The legislation would eliminate tuition and fees at four-year public colleges and universities for families making up to $125,000 \u2013 about 80 percent of the population \u2013 and make community college tuition- and fee-free for all,\" according to a statement released by Sanders' campaign at the time. The proposal has been backed by Warren, Harris, Gillibrand. Some candidates, such as Klobuchar, however, have blasted the idea. \u201cNo, I am not for free college for all,\u201d Klobuchar said during a televised town hall in Manchester in February. \u201cI wish if I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, I would.\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying to find a mix of incentives and make sure kids are in need- and that\u2019s why I talked about expanding Pell Grants, can go to college and be able to afford it and make sure that people who can\u2019t afford it are able to pay.\u201d South Bend Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, too, hasn't fully joined the tuition-free college rallying cry. \u201cAmericans who have a college degree earn more than Americans who don\u2019t,\u201d Buttigieg recently said, per Politico. \u201cAs a progressive, I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn\u2019t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they did.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " CONCORD, N.H. --\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. But the self-proclaimed democratic socialist arguably accomplished a more lasting feat. He changed the conversation \u2013 bringing one-time fringe positions like a \"Medicare-for-all\" single-payer health care system, a massive increase in the national\u00a0minimum wage, and free tuition at community colleges and some public schools into the mainstream of the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda. WATCH THE BERNIE SANDERS TOWN HALL ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL AT 6:30 PM ET MONDAY Now, his own success in shaping that agenda has raised an obvious challenge: He's no longer the only candidate in the field who stands for these issues. In fact, he's one of many. Crystallizing this conundrum, the senator this week re-introduced an updated version of his Medicare-for-all bill\u00a0and was quickly joined by four of his rivals for the nomination -- with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York\u00a0and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all co-sponsoring. It was the latest example of how, as the independent senator from Vermont runs a second straight time for the Democratic presidential nomination, he's both leading the charge on these policies but also fighting to stand out in a\u00a0field of nearly 20\u00a0candidates, many like-minded. For the time being, polling suggests primary voters are enthusiastic about the original purveyor of these proposals. He consistently rates at the top of the field alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to jump in. Sanders himself is quick to remind voters he was the one promoting these\u00a0ideas before they were so popular. \u201cI want to offer a very special thanks to the people of New Hampshire. In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off. Thank you, New Hampshire,\u201d Sanders said in March as he returned to the first-in-the-nation primary state for the first time since declaring his 2020 candidacy. Recalling his marathon primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he said, \u201cthe ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 -- ideas, they said, that nobody in America would support.\u201d He highlighted that thanks to the wave that nearly carried him to the nomination, \u201cthose ideas that we talked about four years ago that seemed so very radical at that time -- well, today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the American people and have overwhelming support from Democrats and independents. And they're ideas that Democratic candidates all across the board are supporting.\u201d Medicare-for-all is a prime example. A January poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2013 which focuses on health care polling \u2013 indicated that 81 percent of Democrats supported a single-payer insurance model. That support dropped to 53 percent for independents and 23 percent among Republicans questioned. On Capitol Hill, meanwhile,\u00a0support remains limited, with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer stopping short of endorsing it. SANDERS' PROPOSALS NOW EMBRACED BY 2020 DEMS Sanders said his mission in the 2020 election is \u201cto turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality.\u201d But that mission is also the goal for many of his rivals for the Democratic nomination. Sen. Warren, another politician popular on the left, is also pushing the same progressive proposals. And some of the other leading 2020 candidates \u2013 such as Sens. Booker of New Jersey and\u00a0Harris of California, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are promoting similar plans, from criminal justice and immigration reform to refusing contributions from super PACs, corporations\u00a0and lobbyists\u00a0to battling climate change. And some of those rivals are years younger than the 77-year-old Sanders and don\u2019t carry with them a \u2018socialist\u2019 target on their backs. Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile says that while Sanders does face a lot of competition in the progressive lane for the nomination, \u201cthey don\u2019t have the same name ID as Hillary Clinton and the same type of broad support that Clinton had\u201d in 2016. \u201cI do believe this is Senator\u00a0Sanders' opportunity \u2013 his last opportunity on the national level \u2013 to score a major victory. This is about delegates, not popularity,\u201d explained Brazile, a Fox News contributor. SANDERS SAYS FELONS BEHIND BARS SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE It\u2019s early in the 2020 cycle \u2013 we still have 10 months to go before the voting begins \u2013 but so far Sanders has kept other candidates from stealing his thunder. He surged out of the gate\u00a0following his Feb. 19\u00a0announcement, drawing large crowds and racking up big bucks. Sanders hauled in $18.2 million in fundraising in the first 41 days of his campaign. The senator\u00a0consistently registers in second place in double digits in 2020 polling, trailing\u00a0Biden \u2013 an all-but-certain White House contender \u2013 but ahead of the rest of the field. And even though they have plenty of candidates to choose from this time around, many of his supporters are sticking with Sanders. New Hampshire Sanders supporter Lorna Wakefield, who came in person to see Sanders in March when he returned to the Granite State, said\u00a0she\u2019s sticking with the senator 100 percent. \u201cBernie\u2019s the one who started this all. We\u2019re with Bernie,\u201d she said. And, Chris Liquori \u2013 a member of the Sanders steering committee in New Hampshire \u2013 argued, \u201cWhy settle for the imitation when you\u2019ve got somebody who\u2019s been doing this for 40 years, who brought the party to its knees and brought them where they are now?\u00a0Why would you go with anyone else?\u201d",

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., argued Sunday that among the presidential candidates, he was the best Democrat to win back a string of Midwestern states from President Trump in 2020, claiming that the sitting president had told working-class families a \"monstrous lie\" by vowing to take on monied interests in Washington. \"Donald Trump has told literally thousands of lies since he began his campaign and since he has been in the White House,\" Sanders told an estimated crowd of 4,500 at an outdoor rally in Pittsburgh. \"But, the biggest lie that he told the people of Pennsylvania ... was that he was going to stand up for working families and take on the establishment.\" Sunday's rally wrapped up a four-day, five-state swing\u00a0during\u00a0which Sanders also held rallies in Wisconsin and\u00a0Michigan. Voters in all three states backed\u00a0Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, stunning Democrats who had seen them\u00a0as part of a \"blue wall\" held together by urban African-American voters and traditionally liberal white working-class voters.\u00a0The Sanders campaign said in a memo prepared in advance of the trip that the pathway to victory runs through the Midwest. The memo said that Sanders has received donations from more than 8,000 people in Wisconsin, 14,000 in Michigan and 18,000 in Pennsylvania. Sanders was leading all Democratic candidates in fundraising. Sanders had a good showing in the industrial belt in 2016's Democratic primary, winning Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. But Hillary Clinton pounded him by 12 percentage points in Pennsylvania. \"We are going to win in Pennsylvania, we\u2019re going to win in Michigan, we're going to win in Wisconsin, we're going to win in\u00a0Indiana and Ohio,\" Sanders promised his cheering supporters. \"And, by the way, we\u2019re going to win the election.\" Earlier in Lordstown, Ohio, and again in Pittsburgh, Sanders pressed Trump to put action behind his words on General Motors plant closings. Trump has assailed the company for shutting its small-car factory in Lordstown, in a politically important state, complaining about the company's leadership and a local union leader while seldom mentioning the other U.S. factories that GM plans to close. That's not enough, Sanders said. \"If you want a federal contract paid for by taxpayers, treat your workers with respect and dignity. No more paying your workers inadequate wages while you provide CEO's with multimillion-dollar parachutes, no more taking away health care benefits, no more denying workers the right to form a union. \"And if you are not a good and responsible corporate citizen, do not think that you will get federal contracts,\" Sanders added. The self-described democratic socialist said his political movement mirrored\u00a0the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the women's movement and the gay rights movement in showing that \"real change never takes place from the top on down, always from the bottom up.\" He recited a laundry list of policies -- including raising the federal minimum wage, government-run health care\u00a0and legalizing marijuana -- that he claimed were described as \"too radical\" by members of the media and political establishment. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: WE NEED AN ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE TOP ONE PERCENT \"Today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the American people and they are ideas that Democratic candidates from school board to president of the United States now support,\" Sanders said, noting that his insurgent campaign\u00a0for the 2016 Democratic nomination had netted \"more votes from young people than Trump and Clinton combined.\" Sanders also proudly noted that his supporters had campaigned successfully to change the party's rules governing superdelegates at next year's Democratic National Convention \"and maybe ending a system in which one candidate had 500 superdelegates before the first vote was cast.\" The Democratic National Committee voted last summer to prevent superdelegates\u00a0from voting on the first presidential nomination ballot unless a candidate had enough votes from pledged delegates, who\u00a0choose a candidate based on the results of the Democrats' primaries and caucuses. The Vermont senator also addressed his signature issue, vowing to health insurance companies that \"whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It is an international embarrassment that in America today we got 30 million people with no health insurance and even more who are underinsured with high deductibles and high co-payments and for all of that we end up spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other nation,\" said Sanders, who warned his audience that \"the insurance companies are getting nervous\" about his message. \"They are prepared and will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to stop us,\" he said, \"but we are gonna win this struggle and we will pass a Medicare for All single-payer program.\" Fox News' Jennifer Oliva in Pittsburgh and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., admitted Tuesday he \"was dumb\" and ignored warning signs of a health condition\u00a0in the months leading up to his heart attack last week. \"I must confess, I was dumb,\" the 2020 presidential candidate said outside his home in\u00a0Burlington, Vt. \"Thank God, I have a lot of energy during this campaign. I've been doing,\u00a0in some cases, three or four rallies a day, going all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED HEART ATTACK Sanders revealed that he never had a doctor in his Vermont hometown,\u00a0\"let alone a cardiologist,\" because his primary physician is based in Washington, D.C. \"We're going to meet him,\"\u00a0Sanders said moments before getting in a car with his wife, Jane, to attend the appointment with his new physician. \"I understand he's a very good cardiologist. Going to see him on a regular basis to get some checkups, and obviously, I'll be on-and-off in Vermont and so we're going to meet him today.\" Sanders insisted he was \"feeling good,\" adding that he doesn't think the heart attack, for which he had two stents inserted into his chest to help with blood flow, \"helps or hurts\"\u00a0his chances of beating President Trump in 2020. His campaign also downplayed any skepticism that his\u00a0ailments would have a negative impact on his presidential run. \"Make no mistake, Sen. Bernie Sanders is as committed \u2014 more so, even more now than he always has been, if that's even possible,\"\u00a0national campaign co-chair Nina Turner told the Associated Press in an interview. Sanders is scheduled to attend the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Ohio next week.\u00a0He said Tuesday that he \"certainly intends to be actively campaigning\" but will \"change the nature\" and frequency of rallies and events to \"make sure I have the strength to do what I have to do.\" \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Sanders said\u00a0about his campaign prior to his heart attack. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d Even before Sanders was rushed to the hospital after complaints of chest pains during a campaign rally in Nevada last week, the candidate faced questions about\u00a0his age. The 78-year-old is the\u00a0oldest candidate in the race and would be the oldest person to be elected president, should he win. Sanders said\u00a0he still plans to release his medical records, promising to do so \"at the appropriate time.\" A spokesperson for Sanders did not respond to Fox News' request for comment. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"If there's any message that I hope we can get out there, is that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\"When you're hurting, when you're fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.\" Sanders received\u00a0another piece\u00a0of bad news on Tuesday. His\u00a0daughter-in-law, 46-year-old\u00a0Rain\u00e8 Riggs, died at a Pennsylvania hospital two days after being diagnosed with cancer, according to an obituary posted on the Lee & Martin Funeral Home Facebook page.

Need proof? Look no further than the 2020 Democratic presidential fight. Three years after Democrats witnessed a vicious\u00a0presidential primary battle between eventual nominee Hillary Clinton and one-time longshot\u00a0Bernie Sanders, there are concerns that a revival of the war of words between their two camps could do damage to the party in 2020. \u201cI think there\u2019s a small segment of people in both camps who harbor significant resentment,\u201d a veteran Democratic campaign strategist told Fox News. The strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely, warned that there \u201care Bernie people who have constantly attacked Clinton and there are Clinton people who resent the primary of 2016. I think this is a lingering problem that\u2019s going to find its way into the 2020 nomination process.\u201d BERNIE SANDERS POLICIES NOW BACKED BY 2020 DEM FIED Sanders and Clinton tried to bury the hatchet in the summer of 2016, in hopes of putting to rest a bitter and contentious primary fight for the Democratic presidential nomination that saw Sanders blast the party\u2019s establishment favorite. But the delicate peace between the independent senator from Vermont and the former U.S. secretary of state was tepid at best. And following Clinton\u2019s shocking loss to GOP nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 general election, Clinton and many of her top staffers blamed Sanders and his legions for her defeat. Fast forward to 2019 and the ill will lingers. Some of Clinton\u2019s top aides from her 2016 campaign took aim at Sanders earlier this year, as he came out of the gate on a roll following the February launch of his second straight presidential campaign. Ex-Clinton staffers savaged Sanders over his use of private jets during the 2016 general election while he was stumping across the country for the Democratic nominee, as detailed in a Politico article. BERNIE'S BIG BUCKS: SANDERS HAULS IN $18.2 MILLION Explanations from the Sanders\u00a0camp that the senator needed to fly private jets in order to keep a non-stop itinerary of nearly 40 rallies in 13 states during the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign didn\u2019t fly with some of those Clinton aides. \u201cRoyal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,\u201d Zac Petkanas, the Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign\u2019s director of rapid response, said. The spokesman for the Sanders 2016 campaign fired back, claiming that members of Clinton\u2019s team are some of the \u201cbiggest a--holes in American politics.\u201d \u201cYou can see why she\u2019s (Clinton) one of the most disliked politicians in America,\" Michael Briggs added, speaking to Politico. Sanders did himself no favors in an appearance earlier this year on \u201cThe View.\u201d Asked if he would be asking for advice from the 2016 nominee \u2013 as some rivals for the nomination have been doing \u2013 Sanders answered, \u201cI suspect not\u2026.Hillary and I have fundamental differences.\u201d Longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill took to Twitter to punch back. \u201cI don\u2019t know who our nominee is going to be but I am damn sure that beating Trump & getting America back on the right footing is going to require a unified Democratic Party, so crap like this 613 days before Election Day is irresponsible, counter-productive, & sets us all back,\u201d he tweeted. IT'S BIDEN, SANDERS AND BUTTIGIEG IN LATEST NH 2020 POLL The war of words is worrying some longtime Sanders supporters in New Hampshire, where the senator\u2019s crushing victory over Clinton in the February 2016 primary rocketed him into the bloody battle with the eventual nominee. \u201cThey need to learn the lessons of why they lost what should have been an easy victory and just live with it so we can win [in 2020],\u201d urged former state Sen.

      "content": " There were three big-time events over the weekend. Tiger Woods pulled off the most remarkable comeback in any sport with his Masters win. (And Donald Trump called it, said he'd win majors after they played together in February, you've gotta give him that.) Pete Buttigieg delivered an announcement speech (soon after the 18th hole) that drew Tiger levels of praise, as the media lovefest with the South Bend mayor continues unabated. (Beto who?) And Bernie Sanders picked a fight with a liberal website, making sure it was leaked to The New York Times. It's long past time to take Bernie seriously. \"Bernie Sanders is the Democratic Front-Runner,\"\u00a0says the Atlantic. \"Stop Thinking of Bernie Sanders As a Gadfly. He's the Front-Runner,\"\u00a0cautions the L.A. Times. He's raised the most money ($18 million), he's drawing big crowds, and in a new Emerson poll, he edges out the undeclared Joe Biden, 29 to 25 percent. Sanders even forced himself to talk to reporters for the first time in two months on the trail. So why on earth is he starting an intra-party battle with a scathing letter to the Center for American Progress? In the letter, Sanders wrote: \"This counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop. The Democratic primary must be a campaign of ideas, not of bad-faith smears. Please help play a constructive role in the effort to defeat Donald Trump.\" The backstory: The Center for American Progress is a Hillary-centric think tank, founded by John Podesta 16 years ago and funded in part by George Soros. It remains filled with Democratic establishment figures. Sanders undoubtedly got screwed by the DNC and the party apparatus in 2016, when the playing field, including a meager number of debates, was tilted to favor Hillary Clinton. So he's understandably sensitive on the subject. But Bernie's beef is with ThinkProgress, a liberal website that is affiliated with CAP but which both groups say is editorially independent. What really burned Bernie was a posting that began: \"It's all very off-brand and embarrassing, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is a millionaire. Turns out railing against 'millionaires and billionaires'\u00a0can be quite the lucrative enterprise.\" Now I happen to think this is utter BS. The Vermont senator achieved millionaire status in part by writing a book that became a best-seller. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.\u00a0And Sanders made that point forcefully last night at a Fox News town hall with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Sanders accused ThinkProgress of \"dishonesty\"\u00a0and said the site was also being unfair to fellow liberals Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. ThinkProgress editor-in-chief Jodi Enda, a former CNN and Knight-Ridder reporter, responded by saying her site will not take sides in the Democratic primaries. \"Political leaders should not be able to muzzle or stop coverage that they consider critical,\"\u00a0said Enda's statement, reported by the Times. But by yesterday CAP President Neera Tanden had backed down, saying a ThinkProgress video on Sanders \u201cis overly harsh and does not reflect our approach to a constructive debate of the issues.\u201d Sanders is obviously trying to send a message. But isn't he punching down by going after an ideological website? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In other words, if he's on track to win the Democratic presidential nomination, he should be brushing off criticism by liberal writers. The letter makes him sound hypersensitive \u2014 and the leak broadcast the dispute to many millions who would never have seen the ThinkProgress post. Sanders is about to draw far tougher press scrutiny than he did in 2016, when the media never thought he had a shot at beating Hillary. And how he deals with that scrutiny will show people whether he has the toughness to take on Trump.",

      "content": " New York Times opinion columnis\u00a0Paul Krugman-- who once called Sen. Bernie Sanders' economic policies \u201cdestructive self-indulgence\u201d-- is now praising the leading 2020 candidate for \u201ccivic virtue\u201d because he\u2019s advocating his policies despite his\u00a0riches. Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, offered a defense of Sanders on Thursday following the revelations that the senator\u00a0became part of America's one percent, thanks to his 2016 presidential campaign that propelled him to national stardom and wealth. BERNIE SANDERS RELEASES 10 YEARS OF TAX RETURNS; DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST MADE OVER $560G IN 2018 \u201cA peculiar chapter in the 2020 presidential race ended Monday, when Bernie Sanders, after months of foot-dragging, finally released his tax returns,\u201d Krugman wrote, calling the filings \u201cperfectly innocuous.\u201d He said that while it seems that \u201cSanders got a lot of book royalties after the 2016 campaign, and was afraid that revealing this fact would produce headlines mocking him for now being part of the 1 Percent,\u201d he shouldn\u2019t actually hide his wealth. \u201cPoliticians who support policies that would raise their own taxes and strengthen a social safety net they\u2019re unlikely to need aren\u2019t being hypocrites; if anything, they\u2019re demonstrating their civic virtue,\u201d Krugman wrote, calling such attacks \u201cstupid.\u201d The senator\u2019s 2018 tax return revealed that he and his wife, Jane, earned over $550,000, including $133,000 in income from his Senate salary and $391,000 in sales of his book, \u201cOur Revolution: A Future to Believe In.\u201d The filings showed that Sanders has been among the top 1 percent of earners in the U.S. According to the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, families in the U.S. earning $421,926 or more a year are part of this group. NY TIMES' PAUL KRUGMAN SAYS US PART OF 'NEW AXIS OF EVIL' WITH RUSSIA, SAUDI ARABIA Krugman\u2019s rare defense of Sanders comes after his relentless attacks on the Sanders campaign during the 2016 election. In a January 2016 column, Krugman decried Sanders\u2019 idealism, saying \u201cit\u2019s not a virtue unless it goes along with hardheaded realism,\u201d which Sanders doesn\u2019t have. \u201cSorry, but there\u2019s nothing noble about seeing your values defeated because you preferred happy dreams to hard thinking about means and ends. Don\u2019t let idealism veer into destructive self-indulgence,\u201d he wrote. In a blog post the same month, Krugman also declared Sanders\u2019 positions on financial reform and healthcare were \u201cdisturbing.\u201d \u201cAnd in both cases his positioning is disturbing \u2014 not just because it\u2019s politically unrealistic to imagine that we can get the kind of radical overhaul he\u2019s proposing, but also because he takes his own version of cheap shots,\u201d he wrote.

Sanders, one of the leading candidates in the Democratic presidential primary race and an increasingly vocal critic of the Netanyahu\u00a0government, said\u00a0during a New Hampshire town hall event that the U.S. should take a broader view of the Middle East \u2013 and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular \u2013 and not always side with Israel. SANDERS CAMPAIGN'S #MYBERNIESTORY BACKFIRES AS GRUDGE-BEARING DEMS LASH OUT OVER 2016 \u201cThe United States government gives a whole lot of money to Israel, and I think we can leverage that money to end some of the racism that we have recently seen in Israel,\u201d he said. Sanders compared the situation to\u00a0the United States' alliance with Saudi Arabia, which he called \u201ca corrupt, murderous regime\u201d despite being \u201cgood pals of ours\u201d while opposing Iran. \u201cYou can criticize both,\u201d he said. Regarding the absence of a lasting peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, Sanders did make clear that he is not blaming only one side. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE IS BIGGEST THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY \u201cThe fault is not all with Israel, you have very poor and corrupt Palestinian leadership, but what the goal of the United States has got to be is to bring people in the region together, the Palestinians and the Israelis to create a kind of workable peace which works for both parties, not just one.\u201d This echoed what the self-proclaimed democratic socialist said in July on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast, where he said, \"Our policy cannot just be pro-Israel, pro-Israel, pro-Israel. It has got to be pro-region working with all of the people, all of the countries in that area.\u201d In that segment, Sanders also made the Saudi Arabia comparison and suggested using aid as leverage. If elected, Sanders would be the first Jewish president. As such, he insisted at the New Hampshire event that opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government is not anti-Semitic. The Democratic Party lately has struggled with how to frame criticism of Israel's government, with some lawmakers accusing members like\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., of using anti-Semitic language in suggesting Israel supporters in America are bought. She and congressional allies have also likened boycotts of Israel to boycotts of Nazi Germany. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. State Department recently updated its definition of anti-Semitism to include, \"Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\" Sanders has not used such language. But his accusations that the Netanyahu government is racist have drawn a rebuke from pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, which earlier this year tweeted in response: \"Name-calling by political leaders against the democratically elected government of Israel is counterproductive to maintaining close ties and advancing peace.\" Fox News' Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with his announcement that he is joining the 2020 Democratic presidential field, but he also snagged away some of Sanders\u2019 former staff. Biden, who made his long-awaited entry into the race for the White House on Thursday, has hired former Sanders\u2019 staffer Symone Sanders to be one of his senior campaign advisers, his campaign announced. Sanders served as the Vermont lawmaker\u2019s spokeswoman in the 2016 presidential race and is a well-known Democratic strategist and political commentator on CNN. PROGRESSIVE GROUP TAKES AIM AT BIDEN SOON AFTER LAUNCH The hiring of Sanders is another indication of the expected tough fight that Biden and Sanders are in for as the two frontrunners battle a deep Democratic field. While Sanders himself didn\u2019t torch Biden as he jumped into the race, it\u2019s clear that many of his progressive supporters view the former vice president as a threat. Biden\u2019s entry into the race \u2013 at least in the early going \u2013 sets up a battle between himself and Sanders, who thanks to his fierce fight with eventual nominee Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination, enjoys name ID on the level of the former vice president. Justice Democrats -- who also called Biden \u201cout-of-touch\u201d \u2013\u00a0is an increasingly influential group among the left of the party. They\u2019ve championed progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as well as Sanders. The group was founded by members of Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. Biden has pushed back against the perception that he's a moderate in a party that's increasingly moving to the left. Earlier this month he described himself as an \u201cObama-Biden Democrat.\u201d And Biden said he'd stack his record against \"anybody who has run or who is running now or who will run.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Highlighting his early public push for same-sex marriage, he said, \"I'm not sure when everybody else came out and said they're for gay marriage.\" Former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile \u2013 a Fox News contributor \u2013 highlighted that \u201cJoe Biden can occupy his own lane in large part because he\u2019s earned it.

The question is can he find enough people to help him stir the pot.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders says he wants to double union membership and give workers the right to strike without the fear of their jobs being filled by replacement workers, ahead of a speech Wednesday to organized labor. In unveiling his \"workplace democracy plan\"\u00a0Wednesday morning ahead his appearance at the Iowa AFL-CIO convention, the progressive senator from Vermont said \u201ccorporate America and the billionaire class have been waging a 40-year war against the trade union movement in America that has caused devastating harm to the middle class in terms of lower wages, fewer benefits and frozen pensions.\u201d FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS Sanders,\u00a0who is making his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, vowed \u201cthat war will come to an end when I am president. If we are serious about rebuilding the middle class in America, we have got to rebuild, strengthen and expand the trade union movement in America.\u201d Sanders said if elected, he would aim to double union membership by the end of his first term in the White House\u00a0in January 2025.\u00a0 His plan also calls for ending so-called \"right to work\"\u00a0laws favored by Republicans and decried by organized labor for weakening a union\u2019s ability to negotiate contracts. Twenty-seven states currently have such laws, which prevent unions from insisting workers become union members as a work requirement. Sanders\u2019 proposal would also give every union worker the right to strike and ban the replacement of striking workers. And the progressive senator also pledged to sign an executive order to prevent large corporations from engaging in union-busting and\u00a0outsourcing jobs, while preventing\u00a0companies that pay workers less than $15 per hour from obtaining federal contracts. WARNING SIGNS FOR SANDERS IN LATEST 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY POLLS The Sanders blueprint would also stop employers from \u201cruthlessly exploiting workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors or denying them overtime by falsely categorizing them as a \u2018supervisor.\u2019\u201d The progressive senator has long been a friend to organized labor. He has\u00a0headlined New Hampshire\u2019s annual AFL-CIO Labor Day breakfast the past five years and this year on the presidential campaign trail he\u2019s joined striking workers on the picket lines a handful of times. He has also confronted Walmart\u2019s leadership at their annual shareholders meeting, asking for an increase in the company\u2019s minimum wage. And Sanders has heavily criticized Amazon,\u00a0helping to induce the company to raise\u00a0its wages to at least $15 per hour.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., upped the ante in his progressive agenda on Thursday when he signaled support for\u00a0criminal charges against executives at oil companies. \"Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused,\" Sanders tweeted. His comments were the latest in progressive politicians'\u00a0long line of attacks on big corporations and their role in climate change. It came on the same day that he released a sweeping $16 trillion plan to address climate change. Sanders painted\u00a0his \"Green New Deal\"\u00a0as a way to \"end the greed of the fossil fuel industry.\" OCASIO-CORTEZ: 'THERE'S NO DEBATE' THAT FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION SHOULD STOP \"We are going to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry and move to 100% renewable energy,\" he tweeted in an attack on natural gas. Sanders' website indicated that he would, as president, direct his Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against companies like Exxon. \"These executives have spent hundreds of millions of dollars protecting their profits at the expense of our future, and they will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last penny out of the Earth,\" his website reads. \"Bernie promises to go further than any other presidential candidate in history to end the fossil fuel industry\u2019s greed,\u00a0including by making the industry pay for its pollution and prosecuting it for the damage it has caused.\" BERNIE SANDERS: CLIMATE CHANGE POSES A BIGGER THREAT TO AMERICA THAN ISIS The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, responded to Sanders in a statement to Fox News. \"Pitting important environmental goals against working families who rely on affordable American energy is a false choice,\" the organization said. \"While some may use attacks on natural gas and oil to energize their political base, our industry will remain focused on providing the energy that powers America\u2019s economy and modern lifestyle, while also continuing to lower carbon emissions beyond their current generational low.\" While Sanders' pledge seemed unprecedented, left-wing attacks on big oil are nothing new. Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of more than a dozen states in investigating ExxonMobil over allegations it misled the public about climate change.

Sanders' plan, along with other Democratic climate change proposals, would\u00a0likely inflict a heavy financial toll on companies like Exxon as Democrats embraced timelines that would drastically reduce carbon emissions within just decades of implementation. Congressional Democrats have, for example, proposed a carbon tax as a way to cut carbon emissions by 100 percent by 2050. The bill would purportedly\u00a0rebate\u00a0a majority -- 70 percent --\u00a0of\u00a0revenues from the tax to low and middle-income Americans as a monthly dividend while spending the rest on infrastructure, energy innovation, and helping communities transition to a \"cleaner energy economy.\" ICELAND UNVEILS MEMORIAL FOR MELTED GLACIER The right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute indicated\u00a0that businesses would collectively face trillions of dollars in costs as they upgraded commercial and industrial buildings. For example, the study found that the battleground state of Pennsylvania would face over $2 trillion in costs for upgrading residential, commercial\u00a0and industrial buildings.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0seeks a complete\u00a0transition to \"energy efficiency\" and \"sustainable\u00a0energy\" \u2014\u00a0much of which would be owned and administered by the federal government. During an appearance on MSNBC\u00a0Thursday night, Sanders\u00a0told\u00a0host Chris Hayes that the U.S. needed an \"aggressive\" federal approach to producing electricity\u00a0and nodded after Hayes claimed he proposed a \"federal takeover of the whole thing.\" Sanders agreed with Hayes' assessment that he\u00a0wanted to create a \"Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]\u00a0extension for the whole country.\" \"You can't nibble around the edges anymore,\" Sanders added. SANDERS RELEASES $16 TRILLION 'GREEN NEW DEAL' PLAN, PROMISES IT WILL 'PAY FOR ITSELF' The TVA is a federally owned corporation that was started in 1933 to provide flood control, electricity generation\u00a0and a host of other services to the Tennessee Valley. The TVA's service area covers parts of seven southern states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia. \"Look, the TVA has done a lot of good work ... What we need to do is have an aggressive federal government saying that we are going to produce a massive amount of energy from solar and from wind and from other sustainable energies,\" Sanders said. In his climate plan, Sanders praised the TVA but indicated that it and other federal, administrative bodies didn't cover enough of the United States. \"Currently, four federal Power Marketing Administrations [PMAs]\u00a0and the Tennessee Valley Authority generate and transmit power to distribution utilities in 33 states,\" the plan read. \"We will create one more PMA to cover the remaining states and territories and expand the existing PMAs to build more than enough wind, solar, energy storage and geothermal power plants.\" DANIEL TURNER: BERNIE SANDERS' GREEN NEW DEAL IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE Sanders' plan would\u00a0entail the federal government massively regulating the U.S. energy supply, which he\u00a0said would be \"sustainable\" by 2030 \"at the latest.\" \"The renewable energy generated by the Green New Deal will be publicly owned, managed by the federal Power Marketing Administrations, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Tennessee Valley Authority and sold to distribution utilities with a preference for public power districts, municipally- and cooperatively-owned utilities with democratic, public ownership, and other existing utilities that demonstrate a commitment to the public interest,\" the plan read. When Hayes asked Sanders how he responded to critics who balked at the program's cost, Sanders\u00a0said the country couldn't \"afford not to afford it\" because the future of the planet was at stake. Sanders has claimed that his $16 trillion plan would \"pay for itself,\" something Heritage Foundation scholar Nick Loris suggested was ridiculous. BERNIE SANDERS SIGNALS HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD PURSUE 'CRIMINAL' CHARGES AGAINST OIL EXECUTIVES \"Sanders' plan would cause energy prices to skyrocket, bankrupting families and businesses and empowering the federal government to control America\u2019s energy economy,\" he said in a statement provided to Fox News.\u00a0\"And what would we get for it? A change in the earth's temperature that\u2019s barely measurable. The Green New Deal isn\u2019t a 'climate thing'\u00a0at all. Turns out it\u2019s a green-glossed Trojan horse designed to increase government control over the economy.\" In addition to taking over the nation's energy supply, Sanders' plan claims to end unemployment by creating 20 million jobs, provide \"massive investments in research and development\" and impose fines and litigation on the fossil fuel industry. The plan predicts that income tax revenues, penalties for fossil fuel companies, a reduced need for safety net spending, \"making the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share\" and other policy impacts would make the program pay for itself.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign on Thursday accused Joe Biden of selling out to big donors in an effort to \u201cbuy the election\u201d following reports that the former vice president and frontrunner\u00a0for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination would form a super PAC to accept unlimited donations from billionaires and corporate elites to cure his current fundraising woes. A spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign responded Thursday evening, telling Fox News in a statement that, in the eyes of President Trump, \u201cthe general election has already begun,\u201d and Democrats must use any means possible within the parameters of current federal elections laws to win back the presidency \u2014 even if that includes taking money from corporations and billionaires alike. TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING CASH HAUL REPORTEDLY RATTLING DEMOCRATS \"Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors \u2014 and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\"Let\u2019s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvery Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs -- and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.\u201d Biden, who\u2019s trailing his Democratic rivals in fundraising, said when he first announced his candidacy in April that he would not accept money from super PACs. The former U.S. senator from Delaware declared he was committed to driving perceived \"dark money\" from politics. Before entering the 2020 race, Biden told PBS NewsHour in January 2018\u00a0that he was the one who told\u00a0Sanders not to accept super PAC money, arguing\u00a0he would lose the trust of the middle class. TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS TO BIDEN\u2019S \u201960 MINUTES\u2019 INTERVIEW, TAKES SWIPE AT HUNTER \u201cMy positions are a hell of a lot closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on some of the economic positions,\u201d Biden told PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff last year. \u201cI mean, I sat with Bernie. I'm the guy that told him you shouldn't accept any money from a super PAC because people can't possibly trust you.\u201d Within the third quarter, Biden\u2019s campaign raised $15.2 million but was left with just $9 million after expenditures, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, which welcomes super PAC contributions, and the Republican Party together raised $125 million in that same time period for the president\u2019s re-election, according to the Republican National Committee. Using these funds, Trump's campaign paid for attack ads targeting Biden amid an ongoing Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry against the president. While Biden\u2019s campaign this week softened its stance on accepting super PAC donations, Sanders boasted\u00a0his bid for the presidency is 100 percent grassroots funded. Biden\u2019s campaign told Fox News on Thursday that he\u00a0is still committed to eradicating private donations from federal elections \u2014 but until he becomes president, is open to big-donor contributions to defeat Trump. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \u201cAs president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United [a 2010 Supreme Cout decision on campaign financing] and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News. \u201cUntil we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided the general election has already begun. In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes until we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d",

This is something that we're working on and that we will introduce.\" Sanders has long touted his \"Medicare-for-All\"\u00a0proposal, which would\u00a0replace job-based and individual private health insurance with a government-run plan that guarantees coverage for all with no premiums, deductibles and only minimal copays for certain services. Health care has become a key issue in South Carolina,\u00a0which is among the Republican-led states that turned down Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Sanders' legislation does not specify new revenues, instead providing a separate list of \"options\" that include higher taxes on the wealthy, corporations and employers while promising the middle class will be better off. \"You're going to be paying more in taxes,\" Sanders said Friday to a man asking how he'd benefit from Medicare for All if his employer currently pays for most of his premiums. \"But at the end of the day, you're going to be paying less for health care than you are right now. It will be comprehensive.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The healthcare industry has become a favorite whipping boy for Sanders, who told his audience Friday:\u00a0\"Thirty years from now your kids and your grandchildren will be asking you was it really true?\u00a0That there were people in America who could not go to the doctor when they wanted to?\u00a0Was\u00a0it really true that people went bankrupt because they could not pay their healthcare bills?\u00a0And you will have to tell them, 'Yes, it was.' But together we are going to end that obscenity and we're going to end it in the next few years.\" The new proposal is not the only debt that Sanders has called for canceling. He has repeatedly called for the elimination of $1.6 trillion in student loan debt as well and calling for public college and universities to be tuition-free. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Sanders is the second choice among Democrats nationwide, garnering 17.1 percent of the vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a comfortable lead with 28.9 percent support, while Elizabeth Warren is narrowly behind Sanders in third place at 16.5 percent support.

But I would also defend my rights, and know my rights, and make sure -- if possible -- that police officer\u2019s camera is on or goes on.\u201d Sanders\u2019 answer was very different from the one former Vice President Joe Biden gave when a female student asked a similar question at the same event.

ALABAMA SENATE PASSES BILL BANNING NEARLY ALL ABORTIONS In a tweet, the Vermont senator flatly stated, \u201cAbortion is a constitutional right.\u201d He did not elaborate. The statement prompted swift rebukes on Twitter. \"When human life begins, human rights begin,\" tweeted March for Life, the anti-abortion group. \"No one has the right to kill an innocent human being, no matter how young or helpless that human being is.\" The U.S. Constitution does not specifically address abortion. But abortion-rights activists argue the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, as cited by the Supreme Court in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, includes a \"right to privacy\" that allows women to decide whether to have an abortion. Sanders' comments follow Alabama\u2019s legislature passing a bill that would make performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy with almost no exceptions. Other Democratic presidential candidates have made similar arguments, as they blast Alabama\u2019s bill. \u201cThis is an outrage and it's nothing short of an attack on women's basic human rights and civil rights and it's something that women of America are going to have to fight against with everything they've got,\u201d New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Wednesday on MSNBC. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted, \"Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned.\" Campaigning in New Hampshire on Wednesday, California Sen. Kamala Harris said\u00a0of the Alabama abortion law: \u201cThis will not stand.\u201d In Alabama and other conservative states, anti-abortion politicians and activists emboldened by the addition of conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court hope to ignite legal fights and eventually overturn the landmark Roe v.

      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " Amid repeated chants of \"Lock him up!\" and \"Green New Deal,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.,\u00a0issued a full-throated endorsement of Bernie Sanders at a spirited\u00a0rally in Minneapolis' Williams Arena on Sunday night, saying a \"mass movement of the working class\" is needed to take down President Trump and end \"Western imperialism,\" as she put it. \"I am excited for President Bernie Sanders!\" Omar thundered at the conclusion of her remarks, as rock music blared throughout the University of Minnesota venue. At no point did either Omar or Sanders attempt to stop attendees from shouting\u00a0\"Lock him up\" whenever Trump was invoked.\u00a0Last year, CNBC's John Harwood\u00a0had predicted\u00a0that \"any serious Democratic candidate will make a point of shutting down\"\u00a0such chants directed at the president. Omar's endorsement was a break from the rest of the state\u2019s delegation of Democrats, which endorsed\u00a0Sen. Amy Klobuchar's more moderate campaign. It also constituted a\u00a0youthful shot in the arm for Sanders' left-wing presidential bid, which has remained competitive with\u00a0Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns. WHY DID OMAR VOTE 'PRESENT' ON RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING ARMENIAN GENOCIDE? \"Here in Minnesota, we don't just welcome refugees -- we sent them to Congress,\" Omar said to applause. \"Right now, achieving that universal dream feels more out of reach than it ever has in my lifetime.\" Then, pointedly refusing to mention President Trump's name, Omar continued: \"The current occupant of the White House likes to talk about making America great. But, every action, and virtually every word out of his mouth, is an attack on the very values and ideals that make this country a beacon of hope for me and the people around the world.\" Later on, still without mentioning the president's name, Omar incorrectly\u00a0claimed that Trump called neo-Nazis \"very fine people\" -- a suggestion that White House officials repeatedly stressed was taken out of context.\u00a0And, in a nod to the \"send her back\" chant that erupted at a Trump rally earlier this year, Omar remarked, \"None of us are going back. We're here to stay.\" Even as she accused Trump of \"coddling\" white supremacy, Omar insisted that Sanders' proposals -- such\u00a0as free college and government-sponsored health care for everyone, including illegal immigrants --\u00a0were not \"radical.\" \"These are values that have been enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for decades,\" Omar claimed, referring to the United Nations document.\u00a0\"But, here is the cold truth: We can't achieve any of these goals if we don't build a movement that is representative of all of our aspirations, all of our pain, and all of our shared trauma.\" Omar also appeared to defend her decision to vote \"present\" on a congressional resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide, saying it was an effort to combat using genocides selectively as a \"political\" football. And Omar, who has been criticized by members of her own party for her past anti-Semitic statements, emphasized Sanders' Jewish faith in announcing her support. \"I am proud to stand with the son of a Jewish refugee who survived genocide,\" Omar said, referring to Sanders. \"The acknowledgment of pain and suffering is personal for both of us. The fight for human rights is undeniable. And when we recognize injustices of the past and present, whether it is genocide against Jewish people, Armenians or Rwandans or Bosnians or Native Americans or more.\" Sanders has been endorsed by other members of the so-called progressive\u00a0\"squad\" of Democrats, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. (The only member of the \"squad\" not to endorse Sanders is Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley.) Days before the endorsements were announced, the\u00a0longtime Vermont senator suffered a heart attack on Oct. 1, prompting fears that his health issues could derail his presidential ambitions. Sanders was introduced at the arena by a spirited University of Minnesota college student who complained that fellow students \"are being put\" into debt. The student acknowledged that he personally was not in much debt, but very much felt the pain of those who were. Taking the microphone, Sanders praised Omar as an \"extraordinary woman who 30 years ago was in a refugee camp in Kenya.\" \"Thank you, Ilhan Omar,\" Sanders said, his voice cracking. Then, he unloaded a series of superlatives, punctuated by audible boos. \"It gives me no pleasure to tell all of you what you already know: that today, tragically, we have a president of the United States who is a pathological liar -- who is running the most corrupt administration in history, who has obstructed justice, who has used his office for personal gain, who has threatened to withhold national security funds from an ally in order to improve his political chances.\" Before calling Trump a racist, sexist, bigoted homophobe, Sanders remarked,\u00a0\"This is a president who deserves to be impeached, and will be impeached.\" As the crowd erupted in a \"Lock him up\" chant -- in a reference to the \"Lock her up\" chants at Trump rallies, typically directed at Hillary Clinton -- Sanders stood by the microphone and didn't try to interrupt. But, minutes later, Sanders appeared to call for an end to divisiveness while reading from his prepared remarks. \"We are going to do exactly the opposite of what Trump is doing,\" he said.\u00a0\"He is trying to divide us up. We are going to bring our people together... around an agenda that works for all of us, not just the one percent.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"People say that Ilhan and I make an odd political couple. But in fact, there is really nothing odd about it at all,\" Sanders continued. \"Ilhan and I share a common link as the descendants of families who fled violence and poverty, and who came to this country as immigrants. But that is not just my story, or Ilhan's story -- that is the story of America.\" He also said he and Omar both were working\u00a0to eliminate \"all student debt in America,\" and make all public colleges \"tuition-free.\" Fox News' Andrew Craft contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Two days after Sen. Bernie Sanders said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cdisparage\u201d his rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the independent senator from Vermont seemed to\u00a0rib\u00a0the front-runner right now in the race, former Vice President Joe Biden,\u00a0over high-dollar fundraisers. In a fundraising email to supporters on Wednesday, Sanders spotlighted his campaign trip this week to Nevada, the first western state to voter in the primary and caucus calendar. BERNIE SANDERS MAKES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS PITCH TO TOP DEMOCRATS IN MUST WIN PRIMARY STATE \u201cBut I am not going to Nevada to attend a fundraiser hosted by a corporate CEO on the Las Vegas strip \u2014 I am going to Nevada to attend a rally with supporters and a town hall on immigration,\u201d the populist senator emphasized. While not mentioning Biden by name, it was clear Sanders was referring to the former vice president, who campaigned in Nevada three weeks ago. On that trip, Biden held a fundraiser at the Las Vegas Strip that was hosted by MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, a Republican. The CEO and other top executives of \u00a0William Hill, the world\u2019s biggest bookmaker, also co-hosted the fundraiser. It was the second time in less than a week that the independent sentaor from Vermont and his campaign targeted Biden for his numerous top-dollar fundraising events from coast to coast. BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN PACE CALLED INTO QUESTION In a fundraising email on Friday to supporters titled \u201cWe risk falling behind,\u201d Sanders campaign manager wrote that Biden\u2019s \u201craising huge sums of money at large fundraising events all across the country. And these are not grassroots fundraising events.\u201d Faiz Shakir added that \u201cthese are high-dollar functions hosted and attended by corporate lobbyists, health care executives, a Republican casino-CEO, and a union-busting lawyer among others.\u201d Sanders' Wednesday fundraising email came two days after the senator, at a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, said he knew most of his nearly two-dozen rivals for the Democratic nomination and stressed that \u201cthey are good people and you\u2019re not going to get me to disparage them.\u201d In the month since he launched his third bid for the White House, the former vice president appears to have become Sanders\u2019 favorite foil on the campaign trail. Besides fundraising, the senator has also criticized Biden for his past support of free trade deals, for his 2002 vote in support of the Iraq War, and for taking a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach to combating climate change. Biden, the clear front-runner in the polls right now, has defended his record from attacks but has not directly fired back against Sanders or any of his other critics in the 2020 field. Biden\u2019s been raising big bucks through small-dollar online donations \u2013 his campaign last week touted their online contributions and said those kinds of contributions made up the lion\u2019s share of the whopping $6.3 million it raised in the 24 hours after the former vice president announced his candidacy last month. But Biden's also been holding some high-profile, high-end fundraisers. On his first night as a White House contender, he raised $700,000 at the Philadelphia home of a Comcast executive. He also hauled in big bucks at a Hollywood finance event earlier this month and at two Florida fundraisers last week. Wednesday night, during a campaign swing in Texas, Biden will headline a Dallas fundraiser hosted by some of the Lone Star state\u2019s most prominent trial lawyers and political donors. The former vice president\u2019s expected to hold two major fundraisers in Boston on June 5, and two more in New York City on June 17, sources close to Biden\u2019s inner circle told Fox News. Fundraising was far from then-Sen. Biden\u2019s wheelhouse in his unsuccessful White House runs in the 1988 and 2008 presidential cycles. But so far, the third time appears to be the charm, as Biden\u2019s raking in big bucks both at traditional fundraisers with deep-pocketed donors -- which he's opened up to media coverage in a move for transparency -- as well as through online contribution The former vice president\u2019s far from the only Democratic presidential candidate courting top donors. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are also holding behind closed doors finance events. And South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a one-time long-shot who\u2019s surged in recent months, is also competing for big money. Biden\u2019s campaign has repeatedly pointed out they\u2019re not accepting contributions from corporate political action committees or federally registered lobbyists. The courting of wealthy\u00a0donors used to be commonplace, but this time around, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 another top progressive contender - have criticized Biden and said no to those types of donations. But Sanders reportedly has decided to now hold in-person fundraising events and has hired an official to oversee such finance events.",

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Bernie Sanders released a plan Saturday to eliminate $81 billion in past-due medical debt, going a step beyond his primary rivals who have called for a government-run health insurance program. \u201cIn America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,\u201d Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement, adding: \"It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.\" SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to\u00a0negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies. Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it:\u00a0\u201cremove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.\u201d He said the registry would use \"public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.\" The self-described democratic socialist added that\u00a0he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices. BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM' Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released. During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is \"a lot of money,\" but he added, \"Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Sanders was one of the earliest\u00a0supporters of \u201cMedicare-for-All,\u201d which would replace job-based\u00a0and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option. Sanders has\u00a0also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3\u00a0interview said \"there's a difference\" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. \"I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,\" he said. \"If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that\u2019s your decision\u2026But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.\u201d",

Sanders, I-Vt., has slipped from second place to third in a new poll, with\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0taking his spot among likely caucus-goers in Nevada. The poll, conducted by Monmouth University, showed Warren leading Sanders with 19 percent support compared to his 13 percent.\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden continued dominating the field, however, with 36 percent in Nevada, an early indicator of Democratic success during the primaries. The survey was the first Nevada poll released this cycle that meets the Democratic National Committee\u2019s criteria for qualifying for the debates. SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS Previous polling has shown Warren trailing Sanders as both push a more progressive message against the frontrunner and perceived moderate\u00a0Biden. While Biden led the field among \"moderate or conservative\" voters, \"very liberal\" voters, who made up about a quarter of likely caucus-goers,\u00a0supported Warren and Sanders with 27 and 26 percent respectively. According to polling, likely caucus-goers rated health care (41 percent) as their most important issue when thinking about a candidate. Environmental concerns (17 percent) and immigration (19 percent) as the top issues voters identified. Only 14 percent, however, said \"beating\" President Trump was their top priority. Trump has become such a negative symbol among\u00a0Democrats that many have cautioned against choosing a candidate based on other criteria. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PUSH FOR BREAKUP OF BIG TECH Others, like Jacobin Magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara, urged Democrats to push Biden to the left and force the party to endorse more progressive proposals. Among those proposals was \"Medicare for all\" which both Sanders and Warren have proposed as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act passed when Biden was Vice President.

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at South Bend, Ind.,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg for suggesting that he would nominate independent-minded judges like former Justice Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Buttigieg has been outspoken about his stance on expanding the Supreme Court in hopes of making it less partisan, but in an interview with Cosmopolitan, he shed some light as to the type of nominee he'd appoint as president. \"My appointments will definitely be people who share my values. But when I\u2019m talking about the structure of the Supreme Court, I\u2019m talking about something deeper,\" Buttigieg said.\u00a0\"I\u2019m talking about depoliticizing the Supreme Court\u00a0Because right now, every time there\u2019s a vacancy, there\u2019s this apocalyptic ideological battle and it hurts the court and it hurts the country.\" Buttigieg went on to explain that he wanted justices \"who think for themselves\" and cited Kennedy and former Justice\u00a0David Souter as examples. \"So I've floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best. One of them would be to have 15 members, but 5 of them can\u00a0only\u00a0be seated if the other 10 unanimously agree,\" Buttigieg continued. \"The idea here is you get more justices who think for themselves. Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law.\" The South Bend mayor faced backlash from the progressive left on social media with critics pointing to Kennedy's record on the Supreme Court -- including his votes with the majority on the landmark 2010 Citizens United campaign-finance case and in the ruling upholding the White House's travel restrictions affecting multiple Muslim-majority countries last year. Sanders, the first 2020 candidate to weigh in on Buttigieg's remarks, was a bit more subtle with his criticism. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"Interesting, I\u2019d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor,\" Sanders tweeted. The Buttigieg campaign slammed the tweet that went viral, insisting it \"ignores\" how the candidate expressed in that same interview that he wants a nominee that shares his values. \"To be clear: Pete has consistently said he would appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who share his progressive values.

      "content": " Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has pledged to American workers that he would institute a $15-per-hour minimum wage if he wins the White House in 2020. But unionized workers on Sanders\u2019 own campaign say they wish he would start now -- by paying a higher wage to them. According to a report, members of Sanders\u2019 staff have been using the senator's\u00a0own campaign rhetoric against him as they try to wrestle more pay from the self-described democratic socialist. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HIS $40 TRILLION MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN WOULD HELP US SAVE MONEY In a letter to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, the campaign staffers claim they \u201ccannot be expected to build the largest grassroots organizing program in American history while making poverty wages,\u201d the Washington Post reported. \u201cGiven our campaign\u2019s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour,\u201d the letter continues, \u201cwe believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team.\u201d According to the Post, field organizers claim that their long hours working on behalf of Sanders drop their actual pay to about $13 per hour. \u201cMany field staffers are barely managing to survive financially,\u201d the union letter says, \u201cwhich is severely impacting our team\u2019s productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.\u201d But when contacted by the Post on Thursday, Shakir seemed to paint a different picture. \u201cWe know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns, as is shown by the latest fundraising reports,\u201d Shakir said in a statement, according to the Post. \u201cEvery member of the campaign, from the candidate on down, joined this movement in order to defeat Donald Trump and transform America. Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president.\u201d As for Sanders himself, the Post said it was unclear whether the candidate was aware of the grievances among his campaign staff. The Post report surfaced on the same day that the Democrat-controlled House voted in favor of a bill to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009. The situation in the Sanders campaign seems a far cry from March, when Sanders\u2019 campaign proudly announced that its employees had chosen to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400. In May, the campaign ratified a union contract with the workers, making it the first presidential campaign in history to do so. At the time, the campaign touted \"unprecedented standards for campaign workers,\" including pay transparency, a defined wage scale, access to mental health care coverage, an anti-discrimination policy that protects immigrant and transgender staff members, and a \"pro-worker grievance and arbitration process.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump has offered a different perspective on conditions facing U.S. workers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., earlier this week, the president said 6 million new jobs had been created in the U.S. since he was elected and the nation\u2019s unemployment rate of 3.7 percent was at its lowest point in decades. Republican leaders have said a minimum wage hike would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for middle-class families, citing research from the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO report found that the Democrats\u2019 bill would boost wages for about 17 million people \u2013 but it would also reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce the nation\u2019s output. Overall, the CBO said the move would reduce real family income by about $9 billion in 2025 \u2013 or 0.1 percent.

But when it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals.\u00a0Sanders' campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN \u201cWorking-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. \u201cThis is what momentum looks like.\u201d Sanders is making his second straight White House run. His campaign highlighted that the candidate didn\u2019t reach the 4 million individuals milestone in the 2016 cycle until after February\u2019s New Hampshire primary, which is still more nearly three months away. Sanders, though, didn\u2019t announce his 2016 bid until late April\u00a02015. This time around, Sanders launched his presidential campaign in February of 2019, two months ahead of his 2016 schedule. Sanders \u2013 like his progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 is relying on small-dollar grassroots donations to fuel his campaign. He hauled in $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, more than any other Democratic White House hopeful. That haul was powered by some 1.4 million contributions. Sanders\u2019 donor announcement came on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s fifth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, which will be held in Atlanta.",

      "content": " Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist whose standing in the 2020 primary has become threatened by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters \u2013 is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS\u2019 PLAN: ECONOMISTS The comments come\u00a0amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism.\u00a0It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year,\u00a0when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren\u00a0reportedly said, \"I am a capitalist to my bones.\" Sanders explained he is not a capitalist\u00a0because he\u00a0\"will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.\u201d A Gallup poll this year\u00a0found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing. The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and the Green New Deal. Meanwhile, two economists at the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under\u00a0Sanders'\u00a0plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020. Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0that \u201cwith the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a\u00a0much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes.\"\u00a0The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan. The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent\u00a0levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent\u00a0for fortunes in excess of $10 billion. Sanders vowed to go further than\u00a0Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires\u2019 fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren. Sanders\u2019 plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent\u00a0on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders\u2019 tax rates don\u2019t top out until 8 percent\u00a0for the richest households.
