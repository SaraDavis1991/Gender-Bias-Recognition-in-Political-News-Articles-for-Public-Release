      "content": " Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren announced in an interview on Saturday that she wants to break up not only Amazon, Google, and Facebook, but also Apple -- as the Massachusetts senator pushes further to the left of her numerous Democratic rivals on a host of populist issues. Speaking to The Verge at the South by Southwest (SXSW) technology conference in Austin, Texas, Warren specifically demanded that Apple must be forced to either surrender control over the App Store, or cease selling its own apps within it. \"Apple, you\u2019ve got to break it apart from their App Store. It\u2019s got to be one or the other,\" Warren said.\u00a0\"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don\u2019t get to do both at the same time.\" She elaborated: \"If you run a platform where others come to sell, then you don\u2019t get to sell your own items on the platform because you have two comparative advantages. One, you\u2019ve sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you\u2019ve made a decision about what you\u2019re going to to sell. And second, you have the capacity \u2014 because you run the platform \u2014 to prefer your product over anyone else\u2019s product. It gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.\" Warren asserted that similar antitrust principles were\u00a0\"applied to railroad companies more than a hundred years ago,\" and that \"we need to now look at those tech platforms the same way.\" Responding to a federal appeals court's recent rejection of the Trump Justice Department's bid to block the planned\u00a0AT&T-Time Warner merger, Warren told The Verge:\u00a0\"How well do I think the Justice Department and the FTC are doing? Not well at all, and not well for a long time now.\" WARREN FLOATS IDEA OF TAXPAYER-FUNDED REPARATIONS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT ALSO NATIVE AMERICANS In a lengthy post on the website Medium on Friday, Warren targeted Amazon, Facebook, and Google for breakup, but did not mention Apple. Warren said the large tech giants had used mergers to \"limit competition,\" citing examples such as Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp; Amazon using its market power to \"force\" smaller competitors, such as Diapers.com to sell to the company; and Google buying mapping company Waze and advertising company DoubleClick. She also mentioned that their marketplaces were used to limit competition. \"Amazon\u00a0crushes small companies by\u00a0copying\u00a0the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own\u00a0branded\u00a0version. Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by\u00a0demoting\u00a0its content on its search algorithm, and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of\u00a0Yelp,\" Warren wrote. Warren, who specifically denied being a Socialist as recently as this weekend, proposed two ways of restoring competition to the tech sector, including passing legislation that would designate the large platforms as \"platform utilities\" and\u00a0reversing already approved mergers, which she deemed \"illegal and anti-competitive.\" TRUMP CALLS TIM COOK 'TIM APPLE' TO HIS FACE; COOK REACTS BY CHANGING NAME ON TWITTER Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank for science and technology policy, sharply disagreed with Warren's proposal. \"The Warren campaign\u2019s call to break up big tech companies reflects a 'big is bad, small is beautiful' ideology run amok,\" Atkinson said in a statement obtained by Fox News. \"The proposal ignores the fact that many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money. Breaking up large Internet companies just because they are large won\u2019t help consumers. It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Warren herself tempered some of her rhetoric on Saturday, saying simply, \"I am not\" when asked if she considered herself a democratic Socialist, in the vein of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cAll I can tell you is what I believe \u2013 there\u2019s an enormous amount to be gained from markets. Markets create opportunities. \u2026 but markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat,\u201d Warren told an energetic crowd at the Austin City Limits\u2019 Moody Theater. Warren's calls for major\u00a0changes in antitrust law follow her other relatively radical proposals, including her idea of taxing idle wealth. Specifically, Warren has proposed an annual 2 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. But because Warren would seek to tax wealth itself -- as opposed to income or some other kind of transfer -- without equally apportioning such a tax among the states,\u00a0legal experts say it is likely unconstitutional. Warren has also said that Native Americans should be \u201cpart of the conversation\u201d on reparations for African-Americans -- a move that threatens to bring back her own history with Native Americans. Her fellow 2020 hopefuls Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro have come out in favor of reparations for African Americans, but have so far not gone as far as Warren in opening the door to reparations for Native Americans.

      "content": " Three Facebook ads from Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren calling for the break up of tech giants \u2013 including Facebook \u2013 were restored Monday evening after they were briefly taken down, according to reports. The ads,\u00a0which were identical in images and texts, cited Warren's recent proposal to break up \"anti-competitive\" mergers, like Facebook's ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram, Politico reported. The ads\u2019 removal and restoration follow an interview on Saturday in which Warren announced her desire to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple. ELIZABETH WARREN'S 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN 'WILL BE THE END OF HER': A.B. STODDARD In a statement released to The Hill, Facebook insisted it removed the ads because of improper use of its logo but decided to restore them in \u201cthe interest of allowing robust debate.\u201d Per company policy, the statement reportedly said, Facebook bans advertisers that reference its name or company logo in order to weed out ads that falsely promote a product using the company\u2019s name. Andy Stone, a company spokesman, said other Warren ads that simply mentioned her proposal to breakup tech giants, like Facebook, weren\u2019t removed. Facebook did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Warren responded by pointing out that the company's \"ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power\" appeared to prove her point. GET THE FOX NEWS APP At a town hall appearance in New York City on Friday, Warren told the crowd that, as president, she would\u00a0pick regulators who would seek to break up what she called \"anti-competitive mergers\" such as Facebook's recent purchase of Instagram and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.

      "content": " Elizabeth Warren has come to the defense of capitalism \u2026 sort of. Sen. Warren, D-Mass., agreed that capitalism historically has been a \u201cforce for good\u201d during an interview Wednesday on\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d The 2020 presidential candidate also referred to herself as a capitalist \u201cdown to [her] bones,\u201d\u00a0before saying regulations must be in place to make the system run smoothly. \u201cI believe in markets, I see the benefits that markets can produce,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there's a cop on the beat, those markets start to work again.\" CRITICS POUNCE AS WARREN SAYS SHE HAS 'ZERO' SYMPATHY FOR PARENTS IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS BRIBE SCANDAL \"Banks, in that case, are forced to develop their profit models, not on cheating people, but on actually offering a better product.\u201d Warren added: \u201cI think it also, when it doesn't work, it's been a force for bad, but that's been true of every form of government that we can identify. We've gotten it right sometimes, and we've gotten it wrong sometimes. When you let markets work with rules and with people on the beat to enforce those rules, we can produce a lot of wealth in this country.\u201d The Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s comments run counter to some remarks made by members of her party recently, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Speaking at the SXSW conference last weekend, Ocasio-Cortez slammed capitalism as \u201cirredeemable\u201d. SANDERS SAYS HIS IDEAS ARE NOW BEING INVOKED BY DEM CANDIDATES 'FROM SCHOOL BOARD TO PRESIDENT' \u201cThe most important thing is the concentration of capital and it means that we seek and prioritize profit and the accumulation of money above all else and we seek it at any human and environmental cost. That is what that means. To me that ideology is not sustainable and cannot be redeemed,\u201d she said. \u201dWhat we are reckoning with are the consequences of putting profit above everything else in society.\u201d The recent rise and dominance of a hard-left faction in the Democratic Party has opened the door for conservatives to sound\u00a0warnings that the party is lurching toward \"socialism.\" TRUMP SLAMS DEMOCRATS FOR CAMPAIGNING ON 'SEDUCTIVE' SOCIALIST POLICIES President Trump, in a new interview, tore into Democrats for campaigning on what he called \u201cseductive\u201d socialist policies despite potentially dire consequences. \u201cYou always have to be very careful, because socialism is easy to campaign on but tough to govern on, because the country goes down the tubes,\u201d Trump told conservative website Breitbart. 'PAWN STARS' HOST RICK HARRISON SLAMS SOCIALISM: 'THERE'S NO POINT IN WORKING HARD' \u201cBut when you tell people free medical, free education, no more student loans\u2014all of the different things that you say\u2014it\u2019s a great thing to campaign on, but then ten years later the country is down the tubes. It\u2019s gone.\u201d The president then suggested the 2020 election could come down to a \u201creferendum on socialism versus capitalism,\u201d according to the website. Trump\u2019s remarks come shortly after Vice President Pence accused Democrats of openly advocating for socialism with policies such as \"Medicare-for-all\" and the Green New Deal -- a system he said had \u201cimpoverished millions of people around the world.\u201d Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, Pence said: \u201cUnder the guise of Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the past century.

      "content": " A new national poll indicates that Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0enjoys a widening lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014\u00a0though another recent survey showed Biden holding the top spot. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward\u00a0the Democrats\u00a0in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN In Quinnipiac\u2019s previous survey \u2013 conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate \u2013 Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent. Quinnipiac\u2019s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national\u00a0CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that\u00a0suggested Biden at 34 percent,\u00a0with Warren a distant second at 19 percent\u00a0and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president\u2019s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling. During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn. South Bend, Ind.,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar\u2019s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and\u00a0qualifies\u00a0for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia. No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll. \"Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,\" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement. The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now. Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent. THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October\u2019s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said\u00a0Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said\u00a0Biden and 11 percent said\u00a0Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. \"Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,\u201d Snow said. \"Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters \u2014\u00a0including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward\u00a0the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.",

And I\u2019ll add one little piece to it and say when you take a look at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building the infrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe do these things together because you can\u2019t start a little business and at the same time try to build the road out front of your house. ... What\u2019s happened in America is we have cut back on those infrastructure investments. Right now, we are spending about six-tenths of one percent on our infrastructure.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household, according to a January study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The unprecedented plan doesn't come cheap, American Action Forum president Douglas Holtz-Eakin and his co-authors wrote in the study. \"The Green New Deal is clearly very expensive,\" the study concluded. \"Its further expansion of the federal government\u2019s role in some of the most basic decisions of daily life, however, would likely have a more lasting and damaging impact than its enormous price tag.\" At the same time, \"the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess the GND (Green New Deal) using the standard tools of policy analysis,\" the study stated, noting that \"many of the policies proposed in the GND are redundant with other aspects in it, which also complicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict.\" GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD COST UP TO $93 TRILLION, OR $600G PER HOUSEHOLD, STUDY SAYS During her town hall, Warren also voiced support for reparations and said she would back the creation of a panel \u201cto examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d \"I believe it's time to start the national, full-blown conversation about reparations,\" Warren said on CNN, before adding: \u201cignoring the problem is not working.\u201d According to a study published by University of Connecticut researcher Thomas Craemer, the value of slave labor from 1776 to the end of the Civil War in 1865 ranged from range from $5.9 to $14.2 trillion in 2009 dollars. Warren was asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper if she would support monetary compensation, to which she replied that she believes there are \u201ca lot of ways\u201d to structure potential reparations.

But that requires ignoring the progress made by blacks\u2014both in absolute terms and relative to whites\u2014who lived much closer to the era of slavery. For example, the soaring violent-crime rates that produce so much \u201ctrauma\u201d in poor black communities today did not exist in those communities in the first 100 years after emancipation, even though poverty rates at the time were much higher and racism was still legal and widespread.\u201d In a statement last month, the California Democrat explained why she supports reparations. \u201cWe have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,\u201d the statement read.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and confronted the 2020 candidate about the direction of Democrats. \u201cSo what do you say privately -- pretend that we\u2019re not on TV, about people who worry about the direction in which the Democratic Party may be going?\u201d Velshi asked. \u201cSome of the party wants it to be more liberal and others want the candidates to be more moderate.\u201d Warren didn\u2019t respond directly to the question, putting emphasis on the \u201cgrassroots\u201d of the party. ELIZABETH WARREN PITCHES POLICIES TOTALING $100 TRILLION AT TOWN HALL: ESTIMATES \u201cLet me give you a different way of looking at it; I want our party to be more grassroots. I want our party to be more connected all across this country. And I\u2019ll tell you how I look at it: I look at that in terms of money,\u201d Warren told Velshi. \u201cI don\u2019t take PAC money of any kind. I don\u2019t take Washington lobbyist money of any kind. And I\u2019ve made the decision that I\u2019m going to spend my time with grassroots all around this country trying to build a movement. Now, that\u2019s a different way to try to power a campaign, to power a presidential campaign.\u201d \u201cI think as a Democratic Party, we have this extraordinary opportunity during a primary to actually make our case to people at the grassroots, to engage them, and to revitalize our democracy,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t just be about going to places where we can scoop lots of money and then run lots of TV ads, this should be about building the on-the-ground movement that\u2019s gonna help us win in 2020, that\u2019s gonna help us win not just the White House but Congress, the state houses, the governor\u2019s mansions, and that\u2019s gonna help us have the power to be able to\u00a0start making real changes come January 2021.\u201d",

      "content": " CONCORD, N.H. \u2013 South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Democratic presidential campaign\u00a0rival Sen.\u00a0\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0over her \"Medicare-for-all\" plan\u00a0on Wednesday, after becoming the first major candidate to file for\u00a0the ballot in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Buttigieg, who grabbed headlines at this month's presidential debate for challenging\u00a0Warren over how\u00a0she\u2019ll pay for her plan to implement a single-payer health care system, expanded on those concerns Wednesday. NH PRIMARY GETS REAL AS FILING PERIOD GETS UNDERWAY \u201cI certainly think we all have a responsibility to explain how our plans are going to be paid for, and my concern about the plan she\u2019s putting forward is not just the multi-trillion-dollar hole but also the fact that most Americans would prefer not to be told that they have to abandon their private plan,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview with Fox News and New Hampshire\u2019s Concord Monitor newspaper. \"I want to create this public plan and then if it\u2019s the right plan for everybody, everybody will want it,\" Buttigieg added. \"If it\u2019s not the right plan for some people, then some people will keep what they\u2019ve got. I think that\u2019s the best policy. It\u2019s definitely what most voters, including what most Democratic voters, believe. And I believe those voters are not wrong.\u201d Warren supports 2020 rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders has repeatedly acknowledged that taxes for most Americans would rise to pay for the program but has claimed\u00a0that most people would save money in the long run\u00a0due to the elimination of premiums, co-payments and deductibles. Yet at this month's debate, Warren wouldn\u2019t say if middle-class taxes would rise to pay for her Medicare-for-all system and pledged to\u00a0unveil her plan for paying for it soon. Warren also returned fire at Buttigieg on the debate stage, criticizing his health care plan as \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d Warren repeated her debate pledge while campaigning in New Hampshire Tuesday night, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019ll have a plan out soon that shows both how much Medicare-for-all costs and how it is we\u2019re going to pay for it. It\u2019s coming out soon.\u201d Speaking with reporters Wednesday after filing at the New Hampshire State House, Buttigieg painted clear contrasts between himself and\u00a0Warren and Sanders, the two populist standard-bearers in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls. \u201cIf as a voter you\u2019ve decided you want the most ideologically left candidate possible, then of course you\u2019ve already got your choice,\u201d he said, taking an indirect jab at both Warren and Sanders. \u201cBut I think a lot of others are looking for real progressive solutions that can be achieved and that can command the support of a strong American majority. I think that\u2019s where most Democratic voters are.\u201d And he vowed that if he won the White House, \u201cI would be the most progressive president in my lifetime but I also would build out majorities to do these things in a way that can actually unify rather than further polarize the American people.\u201d BUTTIGIEG IN FOURTH PLACE IN NEW NH POLL, TRAILING SANDERS, WARREN AND BIDEN Buttigieg arrived in the Granite State one day after a new poll from the University of New Hampshire for CNN put the one-time long-shot for the nomination in fourth place among likely Democratic primary voters, at 10 percent. Ahead of him were Sanders, I-Vt., at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, and former Vice President Joe Biden at 15 percent. The 37-year old candidate, the youngest in the Democratic field, appeared to question Biden\u2019s readiness. \u201cIn order to win, we need to put forward a candidate who can demonstrate the readiness to lead this country forward. We\u2019re going to have to turn the page. And it\u2019s not as simple as going back to normal. We\u2019ve really got to build up a new normal,\u201d Buttigieg told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019ll also say when it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it\u2019s been with a candidate who\u2019s new on the national scene, hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time in Washington and represented a new generation of leadership. By contrast, every single time in the last 50 years we have put forward the most Washington-orientated candidate, we have come up short in November,\u201d he added. Hours before Buttigieg arrived in Concord, a new poll from Politico and\u00a0Morning Consult suggested that 37 percent of registered voters said they were either definitely or probably not ready for a president who is gay. Buttigieg, who would become the country\u2019s first openly gay president if elected, said: \u201cI think the biggest thing on the minds of voters is whether they\u2019re getting paid enough, whether they\u2019re going to be able to get health care, how they\u2019re going to save for retirement.\u201d And he emphasized that \u201cserving up\u201d answers for such pocketbook concerns, \u201cI think is how we can get past a lot of old prejudices as America has time and time again proven itself capable of moving forward and not back on these issues.\u201d Buttigieg has already gone up with TV ads in Iowa, which votes first in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar. When asked if he\u2019ll go up on the airwaves in the Granite State, Buttigieg pledged that \u201cyou\u2019ll be seeing a lot of us here in New Hampshire, both in terms of our commitments with investments, our large and growing ground game, and the use of my time. Because I think New Hampshire is the state that will really catapult me towards success in the nomination.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asked where he needs to finish in New Hampshire, the candidate said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to set up the goalposts just yet.\u201d Pointing to Warren and Sanders,\u00a0who hail from\u00a0the neighboring states of Massachusetts and Vermont respectively, Buttigieg\u00a0noted that \u201cobviously there\u2019s some competitors with a neighborhood advantage, but I do think that we can do well here and when we do, that that\u2019ll be a key part of our path to the nomination.\u201d",

      "content": " MANCHESTER, NH \u2013 A new poll in the state that holds the first presidential primary in the race for the White House indicates Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00a0fading\u00a0to a distant third. WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren\u2019s 2-point edge is well within the survey\u2019s sampling error. Warren\u2019s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden\u2019s dropped 11 points from that survey. Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth\u2019s May survey. New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren. The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He\u2019s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return\u00a0to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday. \u201cWarren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,\u201d said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray. The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she\u2019s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren\u2019s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent. According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who\u2019s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders. Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll. The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard\u2019s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she\u2019s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month\u2019s fourth round of nomination debates. The poll\u2019s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend.\u00a0A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent\u00a0and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling. A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders;\u00a0and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren. The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February\u2019s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The poll\u2019s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary. \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,\u201d Murray noted.",

      "content": " When asked on Monday if she would\u00a0\u201cstop U.S.-supported murder\u201d if she became\u00a0president, candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, \u201cI like your frame on this.\u201d Warren, D-Mass., made the comment in a town hall\u00a0at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, where she addressed a crowd of hundreds of students, faculty members and\u00a0residents. During the town hall, a man identified as Isaiah\u00a0is heard saying, \u201cThe office of the president also has an amazing responsibility to people outside of the United States, given [its]\u00a0power and position, and right now the United States is bombing at least seven countries.\u201d \u201cWe support genocides in Palestine and in Yemen. The U.S. military is actually the biggest polluter of any organization in the world, and we also work in more clandestine ways,\u201d he said. \u201cColumbia economist Jeffrey Sachs reported that between 2017 and 2018, United States sanctions on Venezuela caused over 40,000 deaths. And we also have sanctions on many other countries like Iran, North Korea, and you can name many more. WARREN'S $52T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN REVEALED: CAMPAIGN STILL CLAIMS NO MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES NEEDED \u201cSo, I\u2019m wondering, as president, will you stop U.S.-supported murder, whether it\u2019s through sanctions, arms support\u00a0or boots on the ground?\u201d Warren then immediately responded by saying, \u201cSo, I like your frame on this.\u201d \u201cYou know,\" she continued, \"here\u2019s how I see this. [If] we want to be a great nation, lead the world, then we need to live our values every single day. And that means we don\u2019t support, for example, what\u2019s going on in Yemen. The worst man-made humanitarian crisis in generations.\u201d Warren went on to say, \u201cAnd yet, we continue to support the Saudis as this war goes on and on and on. Children die, people die by the thousands, by the tens of thousands in this country. We need to say no. We need to be willing to back up. We need to bring our combat troops home.\u201d Almost 100,000 people\u00a0have been killed since 2015 as the Yemen war rages on, according to data unveiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) this summer. The report \u2013 which collated statistics in partnership with the Yemen Data Project \u2013 charts the number of civilian deaths since the beginning of the Saudi-led coalition intervention in their neighboring country in March 2015. The United Nations has for more than a year declared it to be \u201cthe world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\u201d \u201cA great nation does not fight endless wars. We should not be in combat in Afghanistan, we should not be in combat in the Middle East. This is not where we should be,\u201d Warren added, as the crowd applauded. She then went on to talk about foreign policy. \u201cWe have military, we have a great military. We have people who have signed up to make the ultimate sacrifice. Their families sacrifice for them to be there,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThere are people who will do whatever we ask them to do. But we should not ask our military to solve non-military problems.\u201d \u201cAnd the example of that is Afghanistan,\u201d she added. Warren went on to say, \u201cThe Afghan government controls less than 60 percent of land mass in Afghanistan after 16 years of our being there and\u00a0losing our own people\u00a0and losing so many Afghans in it.\u201d She said the poppy and heroin trade is bigger than ever. Warren went on to say, \u201cWe need to think about our diplomatic tools, we need a state department that has diplomats, people on the ground who understand the language, the economy, the local politics, we need to use our economic tools.\u201d \u201cNo great nation cuts and runs on our allies, the Kurds, who stood and fought with us against terrorism,\u201d she continued, referencing America\u2019s withdrawal of troops from northern Syria. TRUMP'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO SYRIA SAYS US WITHDRAWAL DID NOT PROMPT INVASION BY TURKEY American soldiers for five years battled alongside Kurdish-led fighters and succeeded in bringing down the rule of the Islamic State group across a third of Syria at the cost of thousands of Kurdish fighters' lives. Trump initially announced his intention late last year to begin withdrawing troops from Syria, a decision that prompted the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS. At the time, there were about 2,000 American troops deployed to Syria. The U.S. pullout announced last month largely abandoned Syrian Kurdish allies who have fought the Islamic State group alongside U.S. troops for several years. Between 200 and 300 U.S. troops are to remain at the southern Syrian outpost of Al-Tanf. \u201cWe want to be a great nation, we got to know the difference between dictators and stop sucking up to dictators,\u201d Warren said as she continued to answer\u00a0Isaiah's\u00a0question on Monday. \u201cAnd our allies, we should be friendlier to Canada than we are to North Korea.\" \"But for me, that\u2019s the heart of it. We\u2019ve got to be a country that\u2019s willing to get out there and recognize the worth and dignity of every human being. To work with our allies to try to make this a safer world.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP According to a set of new surveys from The New York Times Upshot and Siena\u00a0College, Trump leads Warren but trails former Vice President Joe Biden in the battleground states likeliest to decide if he'll win\u00a0reelection, The Times reported on Monday.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., lead the Democratic presidential field, according to the national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll\u2019s opening measure of the 2020 horse race. Biden gets the support of 26 percent of voters who say they will participate in next year\u2019s Democratic primaries or caucuses, while 19 percent back Warren. They\u2019re followed by Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who are tied at 13 percent. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets support from 7 percent of Democratic primary voters, and former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are at 2 percent. No other candidate gets more than 1 percent. Biden performs best among African Americans, older Democrats and those who are moderate or conservative in their political views, while Warren runs strongest with self-described liberals and those ages 18 to 49. Sanders also performs best among the youngest Democratic primary voters.\u201d\n\nBiden holds lead among South Carolina Democrats - Fox News: \u201cSouth Carolina Democratic primary voters, more than half of whom are expected to be African American, say former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is the best candidate to handle racial issues.\u00a0 Even among black voters, he bests California Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, who pressed Biden on the issue during the first Democratic debate.\u00a0 Biden apologized for remarks he made about working with segregationist senators in the 1970s at a Saturday campaign event in Sumter, S.C. A Fox News Poll released Thursday finds Biden leading on an array of other key issues as well. Overall, Biden garners 35 percent among South Carolina Democratic primary voters in the race for the party\u2019s nomination -- over twice the support of any other candidate.\u00a0\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0receives 14 percent and Kamala Harris is close behind at 12 percent.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar rolls out policies for Alzheimer's, rural health care - Des Moines Register: \u201cU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar unveiled her plan Friday for tackling Alzheimer's disease, protecting rural hospitals and other policies targeted at seniors in her bid to earn Iowans' caucus support. Along with three other presidential candidates, Klobuchar will appear at an AARP/Des Moines Register forum in Des Moines to address issues of importance to older voters. Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, has a history of Alzheimer's disease in her family and has championed various bills related to the ailment, or its symptoms. In 2017, she co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, designed to boost training to help people who may wander from safety as part of their condition.\u201d\n\nSanders officially puts support behind abolishing Electoral College - The Hill: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday night said he favored getting rid of the Electoral College. Sanders was pressed on the issue at a presidential town hall hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens. \u2018It is hard to defend a system in which we have a president who lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, so the answer is yes,\u2019 he said. Sanders had previously made similar remarks, but stopped short of calling for abolishing the voting body. \u2018Presidential elections cannot be fought out in just a dozen \u2018battleground\u2019 states,\u2019 he told The Washington Post. \u2018I believe that we need to reexamine the concept of the Electoral College.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s Senate records being kept secret - WaPo: \u201cThose questions [about Biden\u2019s time in the Senate] might be answered in the massive trove of Senate records he donated eight years ago to the University of Delaware under an agreement that they could be made public by early this year. But the records are being kept secret, following new terms the university posted on its website just before Biden made his presidential campaign official in April. Biden has sought to blunt criticism of his past actions by putting the most positive spin on them, but the limited availability of documents from his 36-year Senate career complicates a full evaluation of his record.\u201d\n\nDNC launches training program to recruit student volunteers - The Atlantic: \u201c\u2026\u2018Getting to Know the Community,\u2019 is part of a new training program from the Democratic National Committee that teaches young people, mostly people of color, how to be campaign organizers.

The DNC has high hopes for the student trainees: Come summer 2020, it hopes to put them to work for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee.

Acosta came under fire this week for his role as U.S. attorney for Florida in securing a plea deal for Epstein that resulted in an 18-month sentence \u2014 he served just 13 months. \u2026 Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Monday for Acosta to step down over what she called an \u2018unconscionable agreement\u2019 with Epstein, and was soon joined by a chorus of other top-ranking congressional Democrats. Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote to Acosta on Wednesday inviting him to testify at a July 23 hearing that will examine his actions related to Epstein. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was the first 2020 Democrat to react to Acosta\u2019s resignation, tweeting: \u2018Good riddance.\u2019\u201d\n\nPELOSI SUPPORTS PUSH TO RAISE DEBT LIMIT \nBloomberg: \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters she\u2019s \u2018convinced\u2019 that Congress should raise the U.S. debt ceiling this month, before lawmakers leave for a six-week recess. Her declaration came after speaking with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone Thursday, just hours after she told reporters that the timing for Congress to act on the debt limit was uncertain. The California Democrat said she still wants to tie the debt limit to a broader agreement on overall spending levels. \u2026 Democrats and Republicans are negotiating whether they can attach the debt ceiling bill to a two-year budget deal that would avoid an automatic $126 billion cut at the end of the calendar year. Such an agreement would help the government avoid another shutdown when funding runs out Oct. 1. Pelosi said she and Mnuchin \u2018have not exhausted our conversations\u2019 and will continue talking. The two \u2026 agreed to speak again Friday morning, according to a Pelosi aide.\u201d\n\nReport: Budget deficit jumps 23% - AP: \u201cThe U.S. budget deficit increased by $140 billion during the first nine months of this budget year to $747.1 billion as government revenues and spending both hit records. The Treasury Department reported Thursday that the deficit for the current fiscal year through June is up 23.1% over the same period a year ago with receipts rising by 2.7% while spending increased 6.6%. The Trump administration is forecasting that the deficit for the full budget year, which ends on Sept. 30, will top $1 trillion, up from a deficit of $779 billion last year. The Congressional Budget Office is not quite so pessimistic for this year, forecasting a deficit of $896 billion this year. But the CBO projects that deficits will top $1 trillion beginning in 2022 and will remain above $1 trillion annually through 2029.\u201d\n\nWYOMING COULD SEE A SENATE SHOWDOWN \nPolitico: \u201cFormer Rep. Cynthia Lummis announced a bid for Senate in Wyoming Thursday, becoming the first Republican to jump into the race and setting up a potential clash with her successor in the House, Rep. Liz Cheney. Lummis, also a former two-term state treasurer, was first elected to the House in 2008 and retired after the 2016 election. She was the only woman to serve in the conservative House Freedom Caucus when the group first formed in 2015. \u2026 Lummis told reporters Thursday she spoke with Cheney before announcing her bid, and said the race to replace retiring Sen. Mike Enzi will be a \u2018real barn-burner\u2019 if the two women face off in a primary. \u2018She needs to make her decision.

The Alabama Senate seat is considered a prime pickup opportunity for Republicans, and Sessions\u2019s name has been in the mix as a potential candidate who could win it. Shelby said Sessions would be a strong candidate for a seat he held before joining the Trump administration, but could \u2018struggle if the president was against him.\u2019 In conversations with Trump about the race, Shelby said Trump \u2018was not encouraging\u2019 of Sessions running. \u2018How do I say it?

Internal talks over the structure of the hearings originally scheduled for July 17 have been heating up for days, with some members complaining they might not have enough time carved out to ask questions. Sources said Friday morning the hearings will be pushed back to July 24. A senior source said there was a \u2018breakdown in negotiations\u2019 to have Mueller appear.

Staff at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah say they received a call last weekend from a man who \u2018had a few too many\u2019 alcoholic drinks but discovered a baby lesser goldfinch struggling on the ground.

However, a yearbook obtained by The Washington Free Beacon showed Warren's\u00a0son Alex\u00a0attended Kirby Hall School\u00a0during the 1986-1987 school year. The online publication reported that the school currently charges nearly $15,000 per year for\u00a0tuition, up from $4,700 in 1995, the earliest year for which records are available. ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY WITH AYANNA PRESSLEY BROUGHT TO BRIEF HALT BY PRO SCHOOL-CHOICE PROTESTERS \"Elizabeth's daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade,\" a Warren aide told Fox News. \"Elizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools.\" Warren's\u00a0rally in Atlanta on Thursday night was disrupted\u00a0by a large group of school choice activists. \u201cFighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,\u201d Warren began, drawing applause and\u00a0cheers.\u00a0\u201cAs a white woman, I will never fully understand the discrimination, the pain, the harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Suddenly some protesters\u00a0began chanting:\u00a0\u201cOur children, our choice!\" as\u00a0Warren tried\u00a0to speak over them.

      "content": " Joe Biden remains the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but a new national survey indicates Sen. Elizabeth Warren tops the former vice president by double digits when it comes to enthusiasm. Thirty-five percent of likely Democratic primary voters questioned in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they\u2019re enthusiastic about voting for the populist senator from Massachusetts who\u2019s put out one progressive policy proposal after another. That\u2019s a dozen percentage points ahead of the 23 percent who said they were enthusiastic about voting for the former vice president. WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT And Warren -- who\u2019s been on a steady rise in both national and early primary and caucus voting state polling the last five months -- also gets the most second-choice support, with 21 percent of Democratic primary voters saying she would be their second choice in the record-setting field of roughly 20 White House hopefuls. The poll's Tuesday release came a day after an estimated crowd of up to 20,000 people showed up to see Warren at a rally in New York City. Biden leads the overall horse race, with 31 percent support in the poll. That\u2019s up 5 points from Biden\u2019s standing in the previous NBC/WSJ survey from July. The new poll was conducted Sept. 13-16, in the days following the third round Democratic presidential primary debate. Biden received praise from political pundits for his more steady performance, especially at the start of the showdown when he aggressively questioned how Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2013 the other progressive standard bearer in the Democratic field \u2013 would pay for their Medicare-for-all proposals. Warren stood at 26 percent support in the poll, up 6 points from the previous NBC/WSJ survey. Sanders was in third place, at 14 percent. THE LATEST POLLS FROM FOX NEWS South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg was at 7 percent in the poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent. That\u2019s down from 13 percent in July, when Harris enjoyed a surge in polling in the wake of her take down of Biden at late June\u2019s first round of debates. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stood at 4 percent in the new poll, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 2 percent. Everyone else in the Democratic primary race registered at 1 percent or less. The survey indicates Biden leading Warren 42 to 15 percent among self-described moderate or conservative Democrats, while the senator tops the former vice president 36 to 19 percent among those who describe themselves as liberal. Biden also enjoyed a significant advantage among black voters and older voters, with Warren holding a strong edge among women with college degrees and voters calling for large scale change. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted by live telephone operators, with 506 Democratic primary voters questioned. The survey\u2019s sampling error was plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.",

      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": " 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Saturday doubled down on her call for the House to open impeachment proceedings against President Trump in the wake of the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report -- even as others in her party appear wary of such a push. \u201cI know people say this is politically charged and we shouldn\u2019t go there, and that there is an election coming up, but there are some things that are bigger than politics,\u201d she told an audience at\u00a0Keene College, New Hampshire. WARREN URGES HOUSE TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS ON HEELS OF MUELLER REPORT \u201cWe cannot be an America that says it is OK\u00a0for a president of the United States to try and block an investigation into a foreign attack on our country or an investigation into that president\u2019s own misbehavior -- so I have called on the House to initiate impeachment proceedings.\u201d While investigators effectively cleared the president and his associates on the Russia collusion charge central to the probe, it outlined a series of Trump actions that were investigated as part of the obstruction-of-justice inquiry. WHY DID MUELLER WAIT TO ANSWER COLLUSION QUESTION, BUSH AG MICHAEL MUKASEY ASKS Mueller did not reach a determination on that issue, but he provided a series of examples of how Trump tried to limit the probe -- including telling his then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell the acting attorney general to remove Mueller. Democratic leaders have so far focused on demanding access to the full, unredacted report and have also called for Mueller to testify to Congress. Warren first made her call for impeachment on Friday, when she\u00a0noted that Mueller said in his report that \u201cCongress has authority to prohibit a President\u2019s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.\u201d \"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\" she tweeted.\u00a0\"That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States. MUELLER REPORT IGNITES NEW DEM BATTLE OVER IMPEACHMENT In justifying her call, she said on Saturday that there are \u201cthree big toplines [from the Mueller report] that are inescapable.\u201d \u201cA hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election in order to help Donald Trump; Donald Trump welcomed that help; and when the federal government tried to investigate what happened, Donald Trump took multiple steps to try and derail or obstruct the investigations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fundamental question for us is \u2018is there going to be some accountability here?\u2019\u201d she added. Her call is likely to be welcomed by the left-wing\u00a0of the party, whose wing in Congress has been open in its hope to impeach the president. Freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who said in January that she wanted to \u201cimpeach the motherf----r,\u201d has introduced a resolution urging the House Judiciary Committee to probe whether Trump committed impeachment-level offenses. That resolution has been signed onto by fellow left-wing freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. But it is far from clear how much traction such a push will gain. Impeachment proceedings would almost certainly be dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate and risk-taking 2020 Democrats away from their policy agendas to focus on impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other 2020 Democrats have so far not come out in explicit support of Warren\u2019s call, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has long been skeptical of impeachment proceedings against Trump. \"I\u2019m not for impeachment,\" Pelosi told The Washington Post in an interview last month. \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\" Fox News\u2019 Elina Shirazi, Judson Berger and Paulina Dedaj\u00a0contributed to this report.",

EVERYONE ELSE\nABC News: \u201cTwo progressive powerhouses will be center stage for night one of the second Democratic debate on Tuesday. The party will be watching for Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren to mix it up, knowing that they're treading in the same ideological territory. But the two New England senators are longtime allies who don't actually disagree on very much. The real action in Detroit could come from podiums closer to the wings, where a group of relative moderates -- including several who are unlikely to qualify for future debates, minus a big splash -- stand ready to bring the fight. If the Michigan backdrop wasn't enough, Tuesday night's lineup offers a virtual tour of challenging places for Democrats to win. Among those joining Sanders and Warren on stage: Indiana's Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar, Texas' Beto O'Rourke, Montana's Steve Bullock, Ohio's Tim Ryan and Colorado's John Hickenlooper. A showdown between Sanders and Warren for the progressive mantle may be inevitable. But that doesn't make it immediate, with potential disagreements on display not necessarily among the front-runners, but between them and the rest.\u201d\n\nWill their truce be strong enough? - Politico: \u201cThe candidates themselves have largely kept things cordial. But signs of tension have trickled out. As Warren\u2019s poll numbers ticked up, Sanders staffers took digs at her on Twitter for not participating in a Fox News town hall, while suggesting her rise was a manufactured media narrative. \u2026 In the weeks after, some of the tweets were deleted and aides said Sanders made it clear he did not condone attacking Warren. \u2026 CNN moderators will undoubtedly try to goad them into conflict [tonight], but both candidates have signaled they will do their best to resist. \u2026 Based on conversations with their advisers, it's more likely the candidates will face off against the more moderate candidates onstage than against each other.\u201d\n\nBIDEN BOUNCES BACK AFTER FIRST DEBATE SLUMP\nQuinnipiac University: \u201cFormer Vice President Joseph Biden reverses his slump following the first Democratic presidential debate and now leads the pack with 34 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean Democratic, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has 15 percent, with 12 percent for California Sen. Kamala Harris and 11 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. This compares to results of a July 2 survey by the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll, showing Biden with 22 percent, Harris with 20 percent, Warren with 14 percent and Sanders with 13 percent.\u00a0 \u2026 Rounding out the Democratic field are South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 6 percent, and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang with 2 percent each. There are four candidates with 1 percent each and 14 candidates at less than 1 percent each.\u201d\n\nBiden, Sanders attack new Harris health care plan - Fox News: \u201cHours after White House candidate Sen. Kamala Harris unveiled her plan to push the country towards a government-backed \u2018Medicare-for-all\u2019 health care system over the next decade, the California Democrat faced incoming fire from two of her top rivals for their party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. The campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont slammed the Harris proposal, saying, \u2018call it anything you want, but you can\u2019t call this plan Medicare for All.\u2019 And, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s team called the Harris plan a \u2018have-it-every-which-way approach\u2019 that \u2018both backtracks on her long-promised \u2013 but then-hedged \u2013 support of Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All legislation.\u2019 \u2026 The Harris plan appeared to stake a middle ground between Sanders\u2019 \u2018Medicare-for-all\u2019 proposal and the public option to enhance ObamaCare that Biden has proposed.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: HELPFUL HINTS \n\n\u201cA good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62\n\nTIME OUT:\u00a0A SWEET GAME\nAtlantic: \u201cIf you were a child at some point in the past 70 years, odds are you played the board game Candy Land. According to the toy historian Tim Walsh, a staggering 94 percent of mothers are aware of Candy Land, and more than 60 percent of households with a 5-year-old child own a set. The game continues to sell about 1 million copies every year. \u2026 What makes it so appealing? The answer may have something to do with the game\u2019s history: It was invented by Eleanor Abbott, a schoolteacher, in a polio ward during the epidemic of the 1940s and \u201850s. The outbreak had forced children into extremely restrictive environments. Patients were confined by equipment, and parents kept healthy children inside for fear they might catch the disease. Candy Land offered the kids in Abbott\u2019s ward a welcome distraction\u2014but it also gave immobilized patients a liberating fantasy of movement.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 43.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a052.2 percent\nNet Score: -8.4 points\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0down 2 points\u00a0\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% approve - 53% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 51% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The Treasury Department said Monday it expects to issue $814 billion in net marketable debt in the second half of this calendar year, bringing total debt issuance to $1.23 trillion in 2019. That would represent a slight decline from borrowing in 2018, when the Treasury issued $1.34 trillion in debt\u2014more than twice as much as the $546 billion it issued in 2017. The budget gap for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 is on course to exceed $1 trillion, following the 2017 tax cuts that constrained federal revenue and a previous two-year budget deal that raised spending nearly $300 billion above spending caps Congress enacted in 2011. The new budget agreement congressional leaders announced last week effectively pushed the issue of government spending off until after the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nTyler Cowen: RIP rational debate about the federal budget - Bloomberg: \u201cApparently, U.S. politics are now so polarized, rational conversation about the federal budget is no longer possible. Last week, the House of Representatives approved a two-year budget deal that stands to boost spending by $320 billion, significantly expanding the deficit. Yet commentators have not been able to articulate a coherent response \u2014 no matter which political side they\u2019re on. Democrats seem not to recognize that the spendthrift budget is similar to the kind of fiscal policy they were recommending before Trump\u2019s election. The common claim, voiced by partisans from Lawrence Summers to Paul Krugman, was that the economy had entered a new era of long-term \u2018secular stagnation\u2019 and deficient demand. Left-leaning economists called for more government spending and higher budget deficits, and that is what we are getting now, albeit with a suboptimal level of infrastructure spending.\u201d\n\nSen. Shelby finalizing fiscal 2020 bills - Roll Call: \u201cSenate Appropriations subcommittee leaders are likely to learn within the next week how much they have to spend on their fiscal 2020 bills. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said Monday he hopes to finalize the 12 subcommittee allocations by the end of this week or early next week. \u2018We\u2019re working on it now, but they will come later in the week or the first of next week,\u2019 Shelby said. \u2026 He has, however, said for weeks that he hopes to mark up the fiscal 2020 Defense measure the first week lawmakers are back in Washington following the August recess. He has also expressed hope that negotiators might pair the Defense spending bill with the Labor-HHS-Education spending bill, which proved successful last year and became law before the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30.\u201d\n\nPOLL: HALF OF VOTERS THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RACIST\nQuinnipiac University: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is racist, American voters say 51 - 45 percent in a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today. White voters are divided as 46 percent say he is racist and 50 percent say he is not, the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll finds. Trump is racist black voters say 80 - 11 percent and Hispanic voters say 55 - 44 percent. Men say 55 - 41 percent that Trump is not racist. Women say 59 - 36 percent he is racist. But 49 percent of American voters say President Trump's immigration policies are motivated by \u2018a sincere interest in controlling our borders,\u2019 while 41 percent say his immigration policies are motivated by \u2018racist beliefs.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018While half of voters think President Donald Trump is racist, religion shows an even bigger divide. Only 21 percent of white Evangelicals believe the President is racist. Compare that to 63 percent of voters who don't affiliate with any organized religion,\u2019 said Mary Snow, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll.\u201d\n\nBut the majority don\u2019t favor impeachment - Quinnipiac University: \u201cVoters say 60 - 32 percent that Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Support for starting impeachment proceedings is 61 - 29 percent among Democrats and 66 - 23 percent among black voters, but every other listed party, gender, education, age and racial group is opposed. Still, voters say 52 - 40 percent that Trump attempted to \u2018derail or obstruct\u2019 the investigation into the 2016 election and say 56 - 31 percent that the Mueller Report did not clear the president of any wrongdoing. A total of 71 percent of American voters are \u2018very concerned\u2019 or \u2018somewhat concerned\u2019 that a foreign government may try to interfere in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nDCCC sees major staff shakeup due to diversity concerns - Politico\n\nRepublicans sue to block new citizen redistricting commission in Michigan - Detroit News\n\nTwo more senators join growing list of impeachment supporters - Politico\n\nFox News Poll: Six in ten say Iran, North Korea pose a threat to US safety - Fox News\n\nAUDIBLE: SURE\u2026\n\u201cPeople are so invested in creating this false narrative about me as the \u2018crystal lady,\u2019 \u2018wacky new-age nutcase.\u2019 If you really think about it, I must be doing something right that they\u2019re so scared.\u201d \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson told Hill.TV during an interview.\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nELECTROLYTES\u00a0\u2260\u00a0REAL LIGHTS \nWIBW: \u201cA Colorado driver gets an A for effort in his clever attempt to replace a broken tail light with a red sports drink.

But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. \u2018All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,\u2019 she said. \u2026 Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to \u2018open up\u2019 about her past. \u2026 The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board \u2018accepted with regret\u2019 her \u2018resignation\u2019 the following summer.\u201d\n\nEd Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign -\u00a0NY Mag:\u00a0\u201cBut the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she\u2019s just \u2018too liberal\u2019 or \u2018too far left\u2019 for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign\u2019s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She\u2019s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.\u201d\n\nPennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems -\u00a0FOX43:\u00a0\u201cPennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. \u2026 Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him\u2026 Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.\u201d\n\nTeam Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: \u201cProminent friends and supporters of Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders\u2019s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can \u2014 or should \u2014 maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. \u2026 Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar raises $4.8 million -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cDemocrat\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator\u2019s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar\u2019s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar\u2019s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support.\u00a0Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE\n\n\u201cIf, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies \u2026 what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!\u201d \u2013\u00a0John Jay,\u00a0Federalist No. 4\n\nTIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW\nHistory:\u00a0\u201cOn October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine\u00a0O\u2019Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O\u2019Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. \u2026Despite the fire\u2019s devastation, much of Chicago\u2019s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world\u2019s first skyscrapers.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a027.2 points (\u2193\u00a00.4 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a024.6 points (\u2191 3.8 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a014.6 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.6 points (\u2193\u00a02 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a06.2 points (\u2191\u00a00.8 points from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: IBD, Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University, Fox News and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a040.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.8 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-13 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193 2.6 points\n\n[Average includes: IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 53% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove;\u00a0CNBC: 37% approve - 53% disapprove; Gallup: 40% approve - 56% disapprove.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.\u201d\n\nTrump digs in -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cThe Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block\u00a0Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nGraham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman\u00a0Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump\u2019s personal attorney,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. \u2018Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General\u00a0Viktor Shokin,\u2019 Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. \u2018Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.\u2019 Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.\u201d\n\nHouse Dems try to keep whistleblower secret -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cHouse Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump\u2019s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats\u2019 deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower\u2019s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. \u2018There are lots of different protocols and procedures we\u2019re looking into to find out what works and doesn\u2019t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,\u2019 said a person familiar with the talks.\u201d\n\nPerry under pressure -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cEnergy Secretary\u00a0Rick Perry\u00a0on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. \u2026 Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country\u2019s government. He also said it was \u2018true\u2019 that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. \u2026 Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. \u2018I\u2019m here.

She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly \u2018what law did President Trump break?\u2019 With the impeachment standard being \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019 Meredith\u2019s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas\n\n\n[Ed. note: So I gather you\u2019re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn\u2019t relevant. Congress\u2019 power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited.\u00a0Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles\u00a0here.\u00a0How about alleging that Johnson acted \u201cto bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach\u201d on Congress? It\u2019s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson\u2019s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]\n\n\n\u201cAt the risk of being accused of being \u2018too cute by a half,\u2019 until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a \u2018political opponent\u2019 for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government?\u00a0Full disclosure \u2013 I am a supporter of President Trump.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I can\u2019t blame a guy for trying, Mr. Kasparek!]\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nOOPS\nSF Gate:\u00a0\u201cReptile breeder\u00a0Brian Gundy\u00a0had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr.\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0Library in downtown San Jose.

      "content": " The owner of a website that details\u00a0various controversies surrounding Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had an accompanying Facebook page taken down after it was deemed in violation of Facebook's\u00a0policy against impersonation -- a decision\u00a0the company\u00a0eventually reversed Tuesday. William Jacobson, a law professor at Cornell Law School, owns and runs elizabethwarrenwiki.org \u2014\u00a0a website dedicated to various controversies surrounding the Democratic presidential candidate, particularly her claims of having Native American heritage. ZUCKERBERG SAYS IF WARREN BECOMES PRESIDENT, FACEBOOK WOULD SUE US GOVERNMENT He also ran an accompanying Facebook page, which posted articles from the site. \u201cIt was a way of getting the content out to the public,\u201d he told Fox News in an interview. But on Monday afternoon,\u00a0Jacobson received a notice saying the page had been taken down for violating Facebook's policies regarding impersonation. Facebook\u2019s community standards forbid users from using other peoples\u2019 images to deceive\u00a0or mislead people about the origin of the content. \"Pages, groups and events must not impersonate or falsely represent a brand, entity or public figure,\" the policies state.\u00a0\"Where a Page, group or event is being used to express support for or interest in a brand, entity or public figure, it must make clear in the name or description that it is not an official representation.\" But Jacobson maintains\u00a0the page was in line with Facebook standards as it carried a disclaimer saying\u00a0it was not affiliated with Warren\u2019s campaign or Senate office. He posted a screengrab of the disclaimer in an article for Legal Insurrection. He also said\u00a0the site never attempted to impersonate Warren, even with the disclaimer. \u201cThe\u00a0page is called 'Elizabeth Warren Wiki' and it has a link to the wiki website and all of the content posted was from the wiki website, so no one could look at the page and think this is her campaign or Senate office because everything was from the wiki website,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we covered all our bases, and I don\u2019t know how this happened,\u201d he said. Jacobson said he immediately filed an appeal via the Facebook process. By Tuesday evening, the page was restored. \"This page was mistakenly removed and has been restored,\" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, told Fox News in an email. In his original article flagging his concerns, Jacobson\u00a0wrote: \"It\u2019s another reminder, as when our YouTube page was taken down without warning, that we can\u2019t rely on big tech.\" Before the page was restored, Jacobson\u00a0wondered if a recent feud between Warren\u2019s supporters and those of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was partly responsible. \u201cAll I know is the last couple of days there was a Twitter war between Bernie and Warren supporters, and Bernie\u2019s supporters were linking to the wiki website,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be pure coincidence or it might be that someone decided to complain to Facebook about the page.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The suspension came\u00a0just as comments emerged from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that the company may have\u00a0to sue the government if Warren becomes president. \"You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies \u2026 I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in July, according to The Verge.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., issued a blistering tweet Wednesday in which she called for Attorney General Bill Barr to resign from the Justice Department. \"AG Barr is a disgrace, and his alarming efforts to suppress the Mueller report show that he's not a credible head of federal law enforcement,\" she said. \"He should resign\u2014and based on the actual facts in the Mueller report, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President.\" AG WILLIAM BARR TESTIFIES BEFORE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OVER MUELLER REPORT HANDLING -- LIVE BLOG Her comments came just as Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and testified about Special Counsel Robert\u00a0Mueller's report. The testimony occurred just after\u00a0a report surfaced claiming that Mueller was dissatisfied with the way that Barr presented his report in March but did not call his summary of the report\u00a0inaccurate. Barr has faced a wave of criticism after releasing his summary and speaking on the Mueller report, using comments which critics saw as a defense of President Donald Trump. While Warren trailed some other 2020 contenders in the polls, she seemed to lead other candidates in her calls for bold action after the Justice Department released Mueller's report. She was the first candidate, for example, to call for impeachment proceedings, a step both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democrats opposed. Amid Barr's testimony, the attorney general received criticism from other members of congress as well. Reps. Elliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Mark Pocan, D-Wis., also called for Barr's resignation. BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE CRIMINAL LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., another 2020 hopeful, tweeted her support for an investigation into Barr by the Justice Department's inspector general. Later Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden said he thought the attorney general should step down.\u00a0\"I think he's\u00a0lost the confidence of the American people. I think he should,\" Biden said in answer to a question while campaigning in Iowa. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republican members, however, defended Barr and sharply criticized\u00a0speculation surrounding the Russia investigation. \"Remarkable to watch Washington Democrats continue to deny reality.

      "author": "Sam Dorman",
      "content": " Time magazine will feature Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on its cover on May 20 \u2014 continuing a trend of spotlighting\u00a0Democrats out to challenge President Trump in the 2020 election. On Thursday, Time\u00a0revealed the cover, which followed others featuring South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden, and a long list of other Democratic candidates. The magazine appeared to be focusing\u00a0on Warren's policy proposals \u2014\u00a0which conservatives have derided as socialist, too expensive\u00a0and unrealistic \u2014 as \"big ideas.\" \"Elizabeth Warren is bettng that Americans are ready for her big ideas,\" the cover read. It also highlighted\u00a0Warren's oft-repeated line \"I have a plan for that.\" Noting the senator's series of \"complex policy proposals,\" Time\u00a0editor\u00a0Haley Sweetland Edwards portrayed\u00a0Warren as the catalyst behind a \"populist political revolution.\" TIME MAGAZINE'S 'MOST INFLUENTIAL' LIST REVEALS JUST WHO IS ON WHOSE SIDE IN WASHINGTON \"This flurry of white papers, often rendered in fine detail, appears to suggest a technocratic approach to governing,\" Edwards wrote in the magazine's cover story.\u00a0\"But in fact, her \u00advision, taken as a whole, is closer to a populist political revolution.\" Amid other concerns about bias, Time\u00a0received criticism for its cover featuring\u00a0Pete Buttigieg and his partner, Chasten, at the beginning of May. Left-leaning outlets\u00a0PinkNews and Towleroad\u00a0praised the cover, which featured the big-print type \"First Family.\" \"The unlikely, untested and unprecedented campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\" it read. Buttigieg has become controversial for his claim to be a \"devout Christian,\" as Time\u00a0described him, while maintaining a same-sex partnership \u2014 something many Christians have deemed contradictory. TALE OF TWO DEMS: MAYOR PETE GETS COVER STATUS, BIDEN GETS WHACKED Buttigieg's cover story started with a description of an anti-abortion activist wearing a devil costume, taunting the Indiana mayor and remarking that Buttigieg was \"such a threat\" because he was a \"homosexual\" people could be proud of. After citing pastor Franklin Graham's derisive response to Buttigieg and Jacob Wohl's sexual assault\u00a0allegations, correspondent Charlotte Alter wrote,\u00a0\"But to some Americans, Buttigieg may just be the man to vanquish America\u2019s demons.\" Time\u00a0featured Biden on its cover before he announced his 2020 bid, but also while he led other Democrats in the polls. The crowded Democratic field also made an appearance on Time's\u00a0cover in February when the magazine detailed how the \"biggest field yet\" was intent on challenging\u00a0Trump in 2020. That cover showed Democrats peering into the Oval Office as Trump sat at his desk. By contrast, many\u00a0Time\u00a0covers of Trump have led to cries of negativity.\u00a0For instance, earlier this year one cover featured a cartoon Trump slinging Twitter birds at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. as she catapulted subpoenas at him. TIME'S 'PHENOM': IS AOC USING THE MEDIA \u2014 OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND? Another, more ambiguous cover, from April, showed Trump smiling while weathering an ominous storm looming over\u00a0the Capitol. The image appeared after Special Counsel Robert Mueller released his report on the Russia investigation, which stopped\u00a0short of recommending prosecution for obstruction of justice. \"America has now seen Trump weather a massive investigation led by a widely respected prosecutor,\" Time's\u00a0Brian Bennett wrote. Bennett\u00a0declared the report \u2014 which didn't establish that Trump's campaign\u00a0colluded with Russia, either \u2014\u00a0one of Trump's \"biggest victories\" but said Mueller's verdict wasn't \"nearly as definitive as the president and his allies would claim.\" He also wrote that the report didn't \"clear Trump of obstruction\" and that his \"presidency\u00a0remains extraordinarily scandal-scarred.\" Some other covers\u00a0have shown Trump's face melting;\u00a0his hair on fire after his first year in office;\u00a0Trump as a series of wrecking balls;\u00a0his face composited with that of Russian President Vladimir Putin; and Trump seeing a reflection of himself as a king. As the conservative IJR Red noted,\u00a0those seemed to differ from covers of former President Barack Obama. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One of Time's\u00a0more\u00a0controversial covers of the president happened as the administration struggled to deal with criticism over family separations at the southern border. The cover, introduced as a reflection on \"Trump's border separation policy,\" included a much-circulated photo of a crying migrant girl who had, in fact, not been\u00a0separated from her parents. Time's\u00a0editor in chief stood by the cover, saying \"our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment.\u201d",

      "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren announced a plan Wednesday to send at least $1 trillion \u2013\u00a0of her $3 trillion climate plan \u2013\u00a0to communities hit hard by industrial pollution, particularly low-income areas and communities of color. The announcement came in a\u00a0campaign video posted to Twitter, which shows the Massachusetts senator\u00a0visiting a neighborhood in southwest Detroit, often referred to as the most polluted area in Michigan, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents the district. In the clip, Warren speaks to community members about residents who have been diagnosed with cancer linked to exposure to toxins after years of living in the shadow of a massive oil refinery. WARREN FACING SCRUTINY OVER CLAIM SHE WAS FIRED FOR BEING PREGNANT In line with her overarching campaign to end corruption in Washington, Warren calls the pollution in these communities a result of \u201cdecades of discrimination and environmental racism,\u201d saying it is \u201cunacceptable and it must change.\u201d The plan, which has been\u00a0posted to her website,\u00a0builds upon policies covering everything from affordable housing to green manufacturing to clean energy. She stresses the need to build \u201cstrong, resilient communities\u201d\u00a0by doing more than just \u201ccleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d According to the campaign, this would mean identifying the most at-risk communities and requiring all federal agencies to consider the climate impact of any proposed projects. Warren\u00a0also calls for investing in the nation\u2019s public water systems, ending the privatization of those systems and enforcing water quality standards. The plan is vague on how exactly the $1 trillion would be spent, but also calls for grants to long-term residents of \"redlined\" communities that were once discriminated against financially\u00a0\"so that they can buy homes in the neighborhood of their choice and start to build wealth.\" Warren's plan is one of many multitrillion-dollar commitments from the Democratic field that have raised questions over how they would be funded. Her climate policy claims that an added corporate profit tax, as well as reversing part of the Trump administration's tax cuts, would finance the programs. WARREN SLIPS AHEAD OF BIDEN IN LATEST POLL Warren also vows to get tough on polluting companies. This includes reinstituting the Superfund Waste Tax, which ensures hazardous waste sites are properly cleaned up and expired in 1995. \u201cPolluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u2014\u00a0not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u2019ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess,\u201d she says. Warren\u2019s environmental justice policy comes ahead of a campaign swing through South Carolina, California, and Nevada later in the week.",

Warren\u00a0announced at a news conference outside her home hours\u00a0earlier Monday that she was filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee for president,\u00a0becoming the first candidate to take the major step toward a 2020 run\u00a0-- and she reminded her audience that the day had been a break from her normal routine. \"I'm here in my kitchen, uh, and um, I thought maybe we'd just take some questions and I'd see what I can do,\" Warren, 69, began as she looked into a camera apparently set up on a countertop. She continued: \"It's been kind of an amazing day. So, today, I, um, got up early this morning, and, uh, talked to a bunch of folks on the phone, and then went outside and talked to the press -- and this is our house, and has been for a long time, and there are all these reporters, and trucks, and everybody outside the house.\" The liberal firebrand pointed to her dog, Bailey, who was also in the kitchen and who accompanied her earlier in the day. \"And I went out and talked to the press, and Bailey went out -- it was his first press conference -- and my husband Bruce [Mann] was with me,\" Warren said. TRUMP, IN EXCLUSIVE NYE INTERVIEW, TELLS FOX NEWS WARREN HAS A 'PSYCHIATRIST' Seconds later, Warren's apparent craving struck: \"Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,\" she said, as she walked out of view of the camera. \"Um, want a beer?\" she then asked as her husband briefly entered the room. \"No, I'll pass on a beer for now,\" he responded. Then, matter-of-factly from across the camera as he left the kitchen, he offered a quick farewell:\u00a0\"Enjoy your beer.\" After returning, Warren announced that she has already received donations from individuals all 50 states, as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico. \"It really has been an exciting day,\" she said, as she touted the importance of small donors in politics. \"Fortnite? Good to see you,\" Warren said at one point in the livestream, reading the online handle of one user in the chat, whose name refers to a popular online\u00a0videogame. The senator then elaborated on her plans for the evening. \"Here it is -- getting ready for New Year's Eve. It's easy for Bruce and I to make plans, because we pretty much do the same things every year,\" Warren said. \"Um, for New Year's Eve we watch Casablanca, we get some good food ... and, um, we sit there upstairs and we watch Casablanca.\" She added that the movie \"fills me with hope.\" Ocasio-Cortez, 29, popularized the use of Instagram stories and livestreams earlier this year\u00a0to connect with her supporters. O'Rourke, too, often broadcast himself while in his home cooking and performing other tasks. In November,\u00a0Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s communications director, told Rolling Stone that Ocasio-Cortez used social media to separate herself from older politicians. Instagram provides Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0\u201cmore capacity for transparency\u00a0and just to be herself,\u201d Trent told the magazine.\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0think there\u2019s a larger\u00a0comfort level there.\u201d But Warren likely will face a more spirited opponent in 2020 than did Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated longtime incumbent Democrat Joseph Crowley in a shocking primary upset in part, analysts said, because he did not take her insurgent candidacy seriously enough. In an exclusive interview set to air during Fox News' 'All-American New Year' special Monday night,\u00a0President Trump suggested that only Warren's \"psychiatrist\" knew\u00a0whether she thought she could win the White House in 2020. Trump often has derided Warren for claiming she has Native American ancestry. At\u00a0a\u00a0rally in July, he\u00a0joked that he would\u00a0pull out a heritage kit during a hypothetical presidential debate\u00a0with Warren and slowly toss it at her, \"hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces.\"",

      "content": " The top three Democratic candidates were put on defense during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders all facing pointed questions about their age, health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency. The line of questioning started with\u00a0Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could \u201creassure\u201d Americans that he was up for the task. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I\u2019m going to reassure the American people,\u201d Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d Next came Biden\u2014whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure. \u201cBecause I watched it, I know what the job is, I\u2019ve been engaged,\u201d Biden, 76, said, adding that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d he is running for president is his age\u2014and with that, comes \u201cwisdom.\u201d \u201cWe need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d He added: \u201cI will not need any on the job training.\u201d Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January\u2014the first contest of the 2020 primary season. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy who\u2019s released anything up here,\u201d he scoffed. Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond. \u201cI say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels \u201cyoung\u201d and is ready for another term of his administration. \u201cI feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,\u201d Trump said in April. Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021\u2014Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field\u2014Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71. But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,\u201d she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. \u201cWho is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?\u201d Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health\u2014a suggestion that was ignored.",

      "content": " A day after 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg's town hall with Fox News, Republican pollster Chris Wilson told \"Fox & Friends\" that the South Bend, Indiana mayor's political platforms aren't unlike those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Arguing that it was a \"smart move\" by Buttigieg to appear\u00a0at\u00a0the Fox News town hall, just as Sanders did and Warren refused to do, Wilson added that Buttigieg is likely still too far outside the mainstream to gain a popular vote. \"It's the younger, well-informed, center-left candidate,\" Wilson, CEO of WPA Intelligence, said. \"But at the same time, there is\u00a0not much distinguishable between\u00a0his policies and those of Bernie\u00a0Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. \"Even though he put a\u00a0softer\u00a0edge on it, I think in the end\u00a0he comes off as somebody who is\u00a0way too far out of the\u00a0mainstream for American\u00a0politics,\" he continued. SLIDESHOW: BEHIND THE SCENES AT BUTTIGIEG TOWN HALL Buttigieg acknowledged at the event that\u00a0he needs to work harder to appeal to voters of color. According to \"Fox & Friends\" host Ainsley Earhardt, Buttigieg is polling well among white voters but at only one percent among \"non-white primary voters.\" Wilson said this means Buttigieg will find success in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but will face more difficulty when campaigning in southern states like South Carolina, Texas and Georgia. \"Even in California, the vote will\u00a0be heavily Hispanic, heavily\u00a0African-American.\u00a0He will have challenges outside\u00a0of major metropolitan\u00a0areas and outside of the\u00a0midwest,\"\u00a0Wilson said. Despite the mayor's impressive rise since announcing his presidential run, Wilson said he believes Buttigieg will have a strong run but eventually \"flame out.\" EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: EVEN MAYOR PETE SAYS HE'S SURPRISED BY HIS SURGE IN THE POLLS Given the fact that Joe Biden continues to lead the polls among Democratic voters, Earhardt asked Wilson whether it's possible Biden could choose Buttigieg as his running mate, should he get the nomination. \"The Democratic party will\u00a0not accept a ticket with two\u00a0white males,\" Wilson said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Buttigieg may be homosexual he\u00a0still is white.\u00a0Major coalitions of the\u00a0Democratic party,\u00a0African-Americans, Hispanics, are going to come out and say 'won't stand for this,' you have to have Kamala Harris or\u00a0someone like that as the VP,\" he added.",

      "content": " MANCHESTER, New Hampshire \u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren emphasized her populist platform and highlighted her humble beginnings as she made her first campaign stop in New Hampshire \u2013 the state that traditionally holds the first primary of the presidential election season. \u201cThis is our chance to dream big, to fight hard, and to make this an America that works not just for the rich and the powerful but an America that works for everyone,\u201d the liberal torchbearer from Massachusetts said to a crowd of several hundred\u00a0people at Manchester Community College. Warren, who was re-elected in November to a second term in the Senate, argued that \u201cwe need to make systemic change in this country, real change.\u201d Warren\u2019s visit was her first to the state since launching a presidential exploratory committee nearly two weeks ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Presidential candidates from neighboring Massachusetts have a history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think Michael Dukakis in 1988, Paul Tsongas in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, and Mitt Romney in 2012. But asked in an interview with Fox News if New Hampshire was a must-win state, Warren wouldn\u2019t directly answer. Instead she said:\u00a0 \u201cI know there are a lot of folks who have their thoughts on strategies and how all of this is supposed to work. But I am not a professional politician. My first time ever to be in electoral politics was when I first ran for the Senate exactly one term ago.\" Another progressive firebrand, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is seriously mulling a second straight White House bid. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, launching him into a marathon fight with the eventual nominee. \u201cI\u2019ve known Bernie since long before I got involved in electoral politics,\u201d Warren said when asked how she could compete against Sanders if he launches a campaign. \u201cBernie and I are old friends and we\u2019ve talked about a lot of the same issues for a long, long, time.\u201d FORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL JULIAN CASTRO FORMS PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE Warren\u2019s trip to New Hampshire came the day after another progressive lawmaker \u2013 Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2013 announced her candidacy for president. Other liberal lawmakers \u2013 such as Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon \u2013 are also making moves toward\u00a0running. But Warren wasn\u2019t worried about the competition, saying \u201cI think this is great. She later told reporters \u201cit\u2019s exciting that Democrats have so many ideas and so many people who want to get out and talk about them.\u201d She touted that \u201cI have the biggest anti-corruption proposal since Watergate.\u201d Her proposals include ending \u201clobbying as we know it\u201d and putting \u201cmore power in the hands of unions, more power in the hands of employees, more power in the hands of consumers. We need to attack head on the costs that hard-working families face every day.\u201d And taking a shot at Republican President Trump without naming him, she called for making \u201ceveryone who runs for public federal office put their tax returns online, everyone.\u201d Trump, both as a candidate and as president, has repeatedly refused to release any of his federal income tax returns. Warren also highlighted her push to build 3.2 million housing units across the country, called for legalizing marijuana, repairing the criminal justice system, and she received one of her biggest applause when she touted \u201cI believe in science.\u201d \u201cClimate change is real. We have a moral and economic responsibility in this country starting right now,\u201d she added. And taking another indirect shot at the President, she argued that \u201cwe need a strong EPA led by someone who believes in science.\u201d Asked later why she didn\u2019t directly mention the president, Warren explained that \u201cI think we need to talk about our affirmative version.\u201d But she added that \u201cI\u2019m willing to fight. Everybody knows that.\u201d Warren also spotlighted her working-class upbringing in Oklahoma, saying \u201cit was a bumpy path for me. I dropped out of school at 19, got married.\u201d She explained that \u201cfor those who think I was born at Harvard (University), in fact I went to the state law school of New Jersey, Rutgers, for $450 a semester.\u201d Asked why she emphasized her early life over her ensuring years at Harvard or in the Senate, Warren said \u201cI think people want to know how you started and I was born and raised in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a part of my story and always will be.\u201d After her event in Manchester, Warren headlined a jam-packed house party in Concord at the home of former New Hampshire Senate president Sylvia Larsen. Warren\u2019s visit to the Granite State came days after a bill in the New Hampshire legislature to change the name of Columbus Day to indigenous people\u2019s day received its first committee hearing. Warren \u2013 whose autumn announcement detailing her Native American heritage was panned by many political pundits and conservatives \u2013 is a supporter of the name change. \u201cMy view on this is why would we not want to honor indigenous people. These were the people who were here. These were the people who in Massachusetts reached out helped the first settlers to Massachusetts Bay colony and helped them survive those first harsh and rugged years. I\u2019m in favor of honoring. I think that\u2019s a good thing for us to do,\u201d she told Fox News.",

The campaign proposal by two-term senator from Massachusetts -- unveiled\u00a0Friday \u2013 comes two days after Russia investigation special counsel Robert Mueller said a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel policy prohibited him from even considering criminal charges against President\u00a0Trump. MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WAS NOT AN OPTION \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan to make sure that no president is above the law,\u201d Warren said in a statement, calling for lawmakers to \"pass a law clarifying Congress\u2019s intent that the Department of Justice can indict the President of the United States.\" \u201cCongress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,\"\u00a0the progressive senator added. \"And when I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll appoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no president is shielded from criminal accountability.\u201d Warren was one of the first Democratic White House hopefuls to urge the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump for obstruction of justice. She made her call after the release of a redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report. The special counsel, in his report and in his first public comments on his nearly two-year long investigation, highlighted that he and his team were not exonerating Trump. \u201cIf we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\" Mueller said. BARR RIPS MUELLER 'LEGAL ANALYSIS' Mueller\u2019s boss, Attorney General William Barr, said in a CBS News interview on Thursday that the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel finding shouldn\u2019t have prevented the special counsel from indicating whether Trump had obstructed justice. \"The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he's in office,\u201d Barr stated. \u201cBut (Mueller) could've reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.\" THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE MUELLER REPORT But Warren \u2013 in her Friday announcement \u2013 slammed Barr, saying he \u201chas disgraced himself by acting like Trump\u2019s personal defense attorney.\u201d And she charged that Barr \u201cwrote a four-page \u2018summary\u2019 to mislead the public about the Mueller report\u201d and gave a press conference to \u201crepeat White House talking points about the Russia investigation.\u201d TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'TOTALLY CONFLICTED' The president, in reacting to the special counsel\u2019s comments, once again spotlighted that \u201cMueller didn\u2019t find Obstruction.\u201d And on Thursday, the president fired away at the special counsel, saying \u201cI think he is a totally conflicted person. I think Mueller is a true never-Trumper. He\u2019s somebody who dislikes Donald Trump\u201d So far, only around 40 representatives in the 435-member House have called for the start of an impeachment inquiry. Warren is one of around ten Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 in a 24 person field \u2013 to urge the House to begin impeachment proceedings.",

ELIZABETH WARREN APOLOGIZES TO CHEROKEE NATION FOR TAKING DNA TEST TO PROVE NATIVE-AMERICAN ROOTS \u201cI'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Warren said the reason she claimed ancestry in the past was because she was told stories about her heritage from her family. But last year, she released the results of a DNA test showing she is only between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American -- and apologized for identifying as Native American on past forms. Asked if she had a chance to do it over, would she still have claimed Native American heritage, Warren said, \u201cI can\u2019t go back. But I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Still, Warren denied benefiting from her ancestry claims, including when she was applying for jobs, saying it never \u201caffected any job I ever got.\u201d But \"Charlamagne tha God,\" in the interview, compared her to Dolezal, the former NAACP chapter leader who famously resigned after her parents revealed she was not African-American. \u201cYou're kind of like the original\u00a0Rachel Dolezal a little bit -- Rachel Dolezal is the white woman pretending to be black,\u201d the interviewer said.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u00a0said Friday that she is open to halting deportations of illegal immigrants in order to force Congress to pass \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d -- a day after a leading 2020 rival,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a deportation moratorium part of his immigration plan. The response from Senator Warren, D-Mass., came after a question at a town hall in North Carolina. A woman, who spoke in Spanish, told Warren about her husband, who she says was arrested for drug possession, served his sentence and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She asked if any moratorium would include those with criminal records. SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL \u201cSo I am open to suspending deportations, particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cI believe that what we\u2019re doing right now, with ICE focusing on people who do not pose a threat -- that when ICE comes into our communities, takes our neighbors, our friends, our family members -- that they do not make this country safer.\u201d Warren said\u00a0she wants ICE to focus on things like fighting terrorism and tackling the import of drugs such as fentanyl. She also said she opposes the Trump administration\u2019s view, which\u00a0she summarized as \"anyone who has violated any law means they can\u2019t even be considered to stay.\u201d She did not say if that moratorium would include any exceptions for those with convictions for violent or other serious crimes. Warren\u2019s push for a deportation moratorium comes a day after Sanders issued his own sweeping immigration plan, one\u00a0that would impose a moratorium on deportations, \"break up\" existing immigration enforcement agencies, grant full welfare access to illegals\u00a0and welcome a minimum of 50,000 \u201cclimate migrants\u201d in the first year of a Sanders administration. According to the plan, President Sanders would stop deportations until there was a full audit of \"current and past practices and policies.\" He would also break up Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Matters to do with deportation and enforcement would return to the Department of Justice, customs matters to the Treasury and naturalization and citizenship to the State Department. Warren was asked if she would break up those agencies, but said only that they need to be \u201creorganized within the system\u201d and reformed. WARREN $52T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN REVEALED: CAMPAIGN STILL CLAIMS NO MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES NEEDED \u201cICE and CBP need to be completely reformed. They should not be spending their resources on things that don't pose a threat to the United States, they should not be spending their resources on scooping up neighbors and friends who pose no real threat,\u201d she told reporters. \"They need to be spending their resources on container shipping, on contraband that comes into this country, on terrorists. Not on people who are here with their families, and trying to live peacefully and make a living among us.\u201d Sanders' plan also opens up all welfare and government services to include illegal immigrants, promising that\u00a0his \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and \u201cCollege-for-all\u201d plans would both be available regardless of immigration status. Warren, who announced her $52 trillion \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan last week, reiterated that that plan would include illegal immigrants. \u201cMedicare-for-all, as I've put together, covers everyone regardless of immigration status and that's it,\u201d she said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In particular, she said it would make a lot more sense once those illegal immigrants are on a\u00a0\"pathway to citizenship\" she has as part of her plan to legalize those in the country illegally. \"If you're on a path to citizenship, we just fixed a big part of deportation, right?\" she said.\u00a0\"Why wouldn't we want you to have healthcare?\" Fox News\u2019 Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.",

Trump - White House flouts subpoenas, heading for court -\u00a0State races will test Trump factor Tuesday -\u00a0Dedication to the hot sign\n\n\nHOW MANY MULLIGANS WILL WARREN GET?\nThrough her long, steady climb into second place for the Democratic nomination across the summer and early fall, Massachusetts Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0ran a disciplined, risk-averse campaign.\n\n\nRelying on an impressive work ethic, favorable press coverage, an extensive operation and a deeply committed set of core voters, Warren shouldered past Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0and seemed poised to overtake front running former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden.\n\n\nAnd then... pffffffftttt. Or, more accurately, double pffffffftttt.\n\n\nThe conventional wisdom on Warren and her autumn stall is that her class-warfare liberalism is too scary for a Democratic Party chiefly interested in finding the most electable candidate to beat\u00a0President Trump. As Obama car czar\u00a0Steven Rattner, a Gergenesque repository of the CW, put it\u00a0to the NYT\u00a0about the Democratic donor class, \u201ceveryone is nervous\u201d because Warren \u201cwould fundamentally change our free-enterprise system.\u201d\n\n\nBut there\u2019s little indication that Warren could ever build the kind of transformational coalition to deliver on her most lavish promises \u2014 confiscating trillions from the fortunes of billionaires, free college, the Green New Deal, universal child care and on and on \u2014 let alone win the presidency.\n\n\nWho could have watched the way Warren botched the conception, timing and execution of the rollout of her single-payer health plan last week and still consider her capable of a political revolution on par with FDR\u2019s? Americans are capable of voting for very liberal and very conservative candidates, but almost never those who are bad at politics.\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like it was her first unforced error.\n\n\nAs Warren prepared last year to begin her candidacy in earnest, she committed with one of the most amazing self-owns in recent political history. She had long faced criticism for exploiting a dubious claim of Native American ancestry for professional advantage. It was a subject she understandably wanted to clean up before she launched her campaign.\n\n\nIn a party where questions of racial identity can be paramount, Warren might have opted for a contrite approach. Maybe a listening tour among tribal nations. Maybe a carefully worded apology.\n\n\nInstead, Warren opted for confrontation. She took a DNA test that she said vindicated her claims and tried to stick it in the face of Trump, who calls her \u201cPocahontas.\u201d\n\n\nIt was a disaster.\n\n\nWarren has between \u201c1/64th to 1/1024th\u201d native ancestry, or about what an average white American might expect to have. Tribal leaders were furious. Not only had Warren reduced native identity to blood rather than belonging, but she didn\u2019t even have the blood to back it up.\n\n\nIn reply, Warren did what she should have done in the first place and sought out the counsel and forgiveness of native leaders. But one had to wonder how the candidate touted as the big brain in the race could have made a mistake so foolish. Only hubris can explain it.\n\n\nBut as spring turned to summer, Warren not only persisted, but she started to make real gains on her left-wing rival, Sanders. She was drawing the kinds of crowds that had once flocked to the Vermont socialist. Coupled with the kind of gushy, uncritical press coverage unseen since\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, Warren was ready to break out.\n\n\nEven better, events conspired to provide her with the perfect moment to take the lead.\n\n\nBiden has been a remarkably weak front-runner all along. He\u2019s strapped for cash, struggling for a raison d'\u00eatre beyond just beating Trump and absolutely stinks with the younger voters in his party.\n\n\nWhen news broke about a month ago that Trump had pressured his Ukrainian counterpart for dirt on Biden, it looked like it might be nearly as bad for the former vice president as it was for Trump.\n\n\nTrump was after a prosecution of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, for peddling influence in the woe-begotten former USSR. The younger Biden\u2019s business pitch there and elsewhere overseas seems to have been one common to political relatives for generations: My dad will like you more if you pay me.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of swampy, Clintonian conduct that not only raised questions about Biden\u2019s general-election viability but spoke directly to the desire for a populist revolt on which Warren is basing her candidacy.\n\n\nWarren seemed like she was ready to pounce, rolling out a policy paper on anti-corruption measures. Here was the perfect spot for an insurgent candidate to take a stand. And then, she didn\u2019t.\n\n\nInstead, Warren did with health insurance what she did a year ago with her claims about \u201chigh cheekbones\u201d and contributions to \u201cPow Wow Chow.\u201d She took an existing problem of her own making \u2014 in this case, a failure to articulate a plan to back up her proposal to abolish private insurance \u2014 and made it worse with a ham-handed response.\n\n\nA month ago, Biden looked like he was in free fall and Warren was still climbing. In our average of primo polling, his advantage got as narrow as 2 points.\n\n\nWith a trio of new polls out Sunday from\u00a0WSJ/NBC News,\u00a0WaPo/ABC News\u00a0and\u00a0our own whiz-bang polling team, however, Biden is back almost where he was before the Hunter episode.\n\n\nWarren didn\u2019t just miss her moment, she also kicked it into reverse by managing to annoy voters and analysts across the ideological spectrum with an insurance plan that is deemed both\u00a0overly ambitious\u00a0and\u00a0impractical.\n\n\nBut Warren\u2019s real problem isn\u2019t ideological or policy-oriented. It\u2019s her lack of political acumen.\n\nBIDEN WIDENS NATIONAL LEAD IN MATCHUP V. TRUMP\nFox News: \u201cDemocratic primary voters increasingly feel the need to nominate a candidate who can beat President Trump in 2020, and more think Joe Biden can do that than any of the other top Democratic hopefuls. In addition, while most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their field, more than a quarter wish they had other options, according to a new Fox News Poll. Biden leads the nomination race with the backing of 31 percent of Democratic primary voters, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 21 percent, Bernie Sanders at 19 percent, and Pete Buttigieg at 7 percent. In early October, Biden was at 32 percent, Warren 22, Sanders 17, and Buttigieg 4.\u00a0Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang receive 3 percent apiece, followed by Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, and Amy Klobuchar each at 2 percent, and Tom Steyer at 1 percent. Compared to March, the first Fox News Poll on the race, Biden\u2019s support is unchanged, while Warren has gained 17 points, Buttigieg is up 6 and Sanders is down 4.\u201d\n\nBattleground state polls show a different story -\u00a0NYT: \u201cDespite low national approval ratings and the specter of impeachment, President Trump remains highly competitive in the battleground states likeliest to decide his re-election, according to a set of new surveys from The New York Times Upshot and Siena College.\u00a0Across the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Joe Biden by an average of two points among registered voters but stays within the margin of error. Mr. Trump leads Elizabeth Warren by two points among registered voters, the same margin as his win over Hillary Clinton in these states three years ago.\u00a0The poll showed Bernie Sanders deadlocked with the president among registered voters, but trailing among likely voters. The results suggest that Ms. Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, might face a number of obstacles in her pursuit of the presidency.\u201d\n\nVoters remain split on personal attributes - WaPo: \u201cThe Post-ABC News poll asked Democrats to choose which of five top-ranking candidates is best across seven personal and policy attributes. Biden continues to lead on the question of electability\u2026 But Biden was matched or exceeded by Warren or Sanders on other attributes. Asked which candidate \u2018best understands the problems of people like you,\u2019 Sanders led with 30 percent, compared with 22 percent for Biden and 20 percent for Warren. The three candidates are about even when it comes to who would do most to bring needed change in Washington, and Biden and Sanders tied at 25 percent on which candidate is closest to them on the issues. On honesty, Biden and Sanders are roughly even\u2026 On the question of which of five leading Democrats \u2018has the sharpest mental ability,\u2019 Biden [fell] narrowly between Warren at 24 percent and Sanders at 17 percent.\u201d\n\nWhy was Beto such a bust? -\u00a0Politico: \u201cAs night fell and his staffers led him through the drizzle to his rented Dodge Grand Caravan for the last time, Beto O\u2019Rourke was asked Friday by a reporter, \u2018What do you think went wrong for you?\u2019 He didn\u2019t answer, allowing the question, over cross-talk from reporters, to hang briefly in the air.\u00a0There was no simple way to explain his fall, the most spectacular failure of the Democratic presidential primary. \u2026 In the first day of his campaign, he raised a staggering $6.1 million. Then it evaporated. The proximate cause of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fall was not in the unorthodox things he did. \u2026 Rather, it was everything he didn\u2019t do \u2014 rendering him an object lesson in the familiar limits of charisma, the liability of high expectations and the importance of organization. Or, as O\u2019Rourke might say, of having one\u2019s \u2018s[--]it\u2019 together. For too long \u2014 and irreparably \u2014 he did not.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: EQUIPOISE\n\n\u201cThe ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense are, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70\n\nTIME OUT: AMERICA'S COWBOY PHILOSOPHER\nTulsa [Okla.] World: \u201cWhen\u00a0Will Rogers\u00a0came home to visit, he never mentioned the celebrities he knew or the movies he made, said\u00a0Doris \u2018Coke\u2019 Meyer, his great niece. He wouldn't talk about meeting the president. \u2026 If you grow up in Oklahoma, you grow up knowing all about Will Rogers. You know about the rope tricks and the black-and-white movies and the plane crash. You can quote him saying he never met a man he didn't like. You know he's as much a part of our history as the Land Run and the Oil Boom. But maybe the way we know him, he doesn't come across as such a big deal. Important to us, sure. But outside of Oklahoma? \u2018Don't take him for granted,\u2019 Coke says. \u2018He's still one of the most famous people in the world.\u2019 Monday would have been Rogers' 140th birthday. He died Aug. 15, 1935 at age 55, in an Alaska airplane crash with aviator Wiley Post.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a026.6 points (\u2193\u00a01 point from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a022.4 points (\u2193 2.4 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a016.6 points (\u2191\u00a02 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a08.4 points (\u2191\u00a02 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a03.4 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: NBC News/WSJ, ABC News/WaPo, Fox News, USA Today/Suffolk University and Quinnipiac University.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042.2 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a055.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-13.2 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a01 point\n\n[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 39% approve - 59% disapprove; Fox News: 42% approve - 57% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 56% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 46% approve - 52% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Already, two officials have skipped depositions scheduled for Monday morning:\u00a0John Eisenberg, the lead attorney for the National Security Council, and\u00a0Robert Blair, a top aide to acting White House chief of staff\u00a0Mick Mulvaney. The House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees also scheduled depositions in the afternoon for National Security Council aide\u00a0Michael Ellis\u00a0and Office of Management and Budget aide\u00a0Brian McCormack, but so far those officials are not expected to show up either. All are facing subpoenas, but President Trump has limited cooperation with the probe, as he publicly rails against Democrats for how they've conducted it.\u201d\n\nPoll: Two-thirds say Trump acted inappropriately -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cNearly half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a new Fox News Poll. In addition, 6-in-10 believe the president did ask foreign leaders to investigate political opponents -- and two-thirds say that action is inappropriate. Forty-nine percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say he should be impeached but not removed, and 41 percent oppose impeaching Trump. That\u2019s about where things stood in early October, when 51 percent said impeach/remove, 4 percent impeach/don\u2019t remove, and 40 percent opposed altogether. The two-point dip in support for impeachment comes from a 5-point decline among Republicans, as 8 percent favor impeachment now, compared to 13 percent in early October.\n\nContinetti: Trump has to choose between the circus and the White House -\u00a0NYT: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s problem is that he can\u2019t win re-election on Republican votes alone. He needs independents. He has won their votes before \u2014 in 2016 \u2014 but he has a lot of work to do if he wants to regain their support. He has the material for a strong campaign. He just needs to grasp it. Does he have the self-discipline required to pull off the job? \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament and erratic, confrontational style are part of the reason voters do not like him. \u2026 Mr. Trump has two ways he could regain his standing among independents and win over undecided voters. He can pray that Democrats nominate a candidate whose personality and policies independents find more unappealing than his own. Or he can modify the way he comports himself in public. It is telling that the least likely option is the one within Mr. Trump\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nImpeachment pressure builds on Susan Collins - Politico: \u201cShortly after she became one of just five Republican senators to vote to acquit President Bill Clinton on both charges of impeachment, Susan Collins returned [and] Maine Republicans did not exactly roll out the welcome mat. \u2026 Twenty years later as she prepares to take Donald Trump\u2019s presidency in her hands\u2026 If she votes to acquit the president, the state\u2019s resurgent Democratic Party and its national allies are likely to clobber her as out of step with the state\u2019s light blue hue. And if she votes to remove Trump from office after a Senate trial, she\u2019ll risk dampening support from the conservative base and raising the ire of the president himself. Still, impeachment also offers an opportunity for Collins to emphasize her independence at a time of deep polarization and a crucial moment in history. \u2026 [N]o one has a more wrenching confluence of politics, personal brand and principles to consider than Maine\u2019s senior senator.\u201d\n\nProsecutors one step closer to obtaining Trump taxes -\u00a0NYT: \u201cA federal appeals panel on Monday said President Trump\u2019s accounting firm must turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors, a setback for the president\u2019s attempt to keep his financial records private. But the tax returns are not likely to be handed over soon. Mr. Trump has fought vigorously to shield his tax returns, and the case appears headed to the United States Supreme Court.\u00a0 Mr. Trump had sought to block his accounting firm from releasing the tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Prosecutors in the office are investigating the role of the president and his business in hush-money payments made to two women just before the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nSTATE RACES WILL TEST TRUMP FACTOR TUESDAY\u00a0\nWaPo: \u201c\u2026[For\u00a0Andy\u00a0Beshear\u00a0the Democratic candidate for governor in Kentucky] and\u00a0Jim Hood, the Democratic candidate for governor in Mississippi, such policy focus is being tested as Trump storms into these two Republican-friendly states and attempts to turn Tuesday\u2019s governor\u2019s election into a referendum on him and his possible impeachment at the hands of congressional Democrats. \u2026 Democrats see the three governors\u2019 races as an opportunity to prove that voters still want local leaders to prioritize issues of health and economic well-being in states that continue to rank among the poorest in the nation. Political strategists from both parties warn that the Democrats\u2019 issue-centric strategy comes with risks as partisan polarization creeps deeper into voters\u2019 everyday lives. \u2026 The challenges facing Beshear and Hood are similar to the one facing Louisiana Gov.\u00a0John Bel Edwards\u00a0(D). Polls showed Edwards comfortably ahead before the state\u2019s bipartisan \u2018jungle\u2019 primary last month, but he failed to win an outright majority.\u201d\n\nConservative group tests transgender anxiety in Kentucky race -\u00a0NYT: \u201cFrom the 12th floor of a glass office tower in the Washington suburbs, a campaign to sway the governor\u2019s race in Kentucky on Tuesday is being waged with an alarmist claim that has little to do with the race itself: If Democrats have their way, soon boys will be able to compete against girls in school sports. This scenario, presented in a pair of ads that are appearing on computer screens and smartphones across Kentucky, is the work of a little-known group funded by anonymous donors called the American Principles Project, which in recent years has focused on fighting more familiar clashes in the culture wars over same-sex marriage and abortion rights. The group is limiting its work to Kentucky for now, but strategists say it has bigger ambitions. It is effectively running a pilot program for the 2020 election that will help it determine how it could use the debate over transgender rights to rally conservative voters in support of President Trump.\u201d\n\nRecall effort against Alaska governor gains steam -\u00a0AP: \u201cA fight is brewing over whether Alaska Gov.\u00a0Mike Dunleavy\u00a0should be recalled from office, with his critics saying he's incompetent and has recklessly tried to cut spending while supporters see a politically motivated attempt to undo the last election. Dunleavy, a Republican, has drawn parallels between himself and President Donald Trump, casting himself as a chief executive trying to implement an agenda of smaller government and resource development while facing attacks from the left. Trump, the subject of an impeachment inquiry, has defended Dunleavy on Twitter.\u00a0A state elections official could decide as early as Monday whether the first serious attempt to recall an Alaska governor since the early 1990s should advance to a second phase of signature-gathering. The decision could be challenged in court.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nTrump says he won\u2019t commit to keeping government open before Thanksgiving\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo\n\nPergram: The impeachment inquiry in all its complexities\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nAUDIBLE: SMH \n\n\u201cAs a left-wing San Francisco liberal, I can say to these people: \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019\u201d \u2013\u00a0House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0talking to Bloomberg about Medicare for All.\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nDEDICATION TO THE HOT SIGN\nWOWT: \u201cJayson Gonzalez, of Champlin, Minnesota, has been making weekend trips to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa. He'd pack his car with boxes of doughnuts, head north and deliver them to his customers around the Twin Cities. Less than a week after the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported about his road trips, Gonzalez said he got a phone call from Krispy Kreme's Nebraska office telling him to stop selling the company's doughnuts in Minnesota. Krispy Kreme stores left Minnesota 11 years ago. His Krispy Kreme-craving-clientele got word in a Facebook post on Halloween that this weekend's run had been sprinkled with objections and scrubbed. Gonzalez wrote, \u2018Hi all! I bear some bad news. Unfortunately the run for this Saturday will not be taking place, as I have been told I have to shut down operations.\u2019 \u2026 Jayson seems to be taking this all in stride and he appears to believe his enterprising side hustle might even set the stage for brighter lights in his future.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cA large segment of American opinion doubts the legitimacy of unilateral American action, but accepts action taken under the rubric of the \u2018world community.\u2019\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer\u00a0(1950-2018) writing for The New Republic on July 29, 1991.\n\nChris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

Elizabeth Warren was caught off-guard by tough questions from New York morning radio hosts about her past claims of\u00a0Native American ancestry, said Boston radio host Howie Carr. In a sit-down on\u00a0\"The Breakfast Club\" syndicated radio show, Warren acknowledged regret over her past claims of Native American heritage \u2013 an issue that has dogged her throughout her political career. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit,\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne tha God\u00a0told Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0during the Friday interview, referring to the former NAACP chapter leader who famously resigned after her parents revealed she was not African-American, as she had claimed. \u201cI'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d 2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION Warren said the reason she claimed ancestry in the past was because she was told stories about her heritage from her family. But last year, she released the results of a DNA test showing she is only between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American -- and apologized for identifying as Native American on past forms. \"Obviously Elizabeth Warren was not expecting to get this kind of grilling. ... No one was yelling or anything, but they really took her over the coals,\" said Carr on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday, scoffing at Warren's explanations of the claims and recalling Hillary Clinton's interview on the same show in 2016, when she talked about carrying hot sauce. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carr said the ancestry questions will continue to dog Warren in her campaign for the nomination. \"She obviously benefited from falsely claiming to be a Native American. This is like an original sin that she can't get seem to get beyond. It\u00a0always comes back to that. She likes to blame Donald Trump and talk radio for this, but\u00a0she did this herself and she can't get around it as she showed again,\" he said.",

      "content": " 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is proposing a new \u201cwealth tax\u201d on Americans with more than $50 million in assets, as well as other measures that include a significant hike in funding for the Internal Revenue Service. \"We need structural change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing something brand new \u2013 an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I\u2019m calling it the 'Ultra-Millionaire Tax' & it applies to that tippy top 0.1% \u2013 those with a net worth of over $50M,\" Warren, who sits on the left of her party, tweeted Thursday afternoon. The Washington Post reported the proposal involves a 2-percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in assets, and an additional 3 percent on those with more than $1 billion. ELIZABETH WARREN GIVES TRUMP THE SILENT TREATMENT AS 2020 CAMPAIGN KICKS OFF Economist Emmanuel Saez, one of two left-leaning economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who advised her on the proposal, claimed it would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Warren also tweeted: \"The rich & powerful run Washington. Here\u2019s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they\u2019ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged for the top if I ever saw one.\" Such a proposal is not out of character for Warren, who has long railed against income inequality and the uber-rich, but would mark a move to the left by the party as a whole if it were adopted. Democrats have been nervous about pitching higher taxes, although a number have said they would reverse some of President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. The Post reported the plan also would\u00a0include mechanisms to combat tax evasion, such as more funding for the IRS, a measure to require all those paying the wealth tax be subject to an audit and a one-time penalty for those with over $50 million who have tried to renounce citizenship. Warren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. OCASIO-CORTEZ AGREES THAT A WORLD THAT ALLOWS FOR BILLIONAIRES IS IMMORAL Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said earlier this month that she wanted to fund her Green New Deal in part by slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on top earners. She said that, like in the 1960s, tax rates for those with incomes up to $75,000 could be as low as 10 or 15 percent, but much higher for those earning millions. \u201cBut once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn\u2019t mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more,\u201d she said. Warren\u2019s plan likely would hit a buzzsaw of opposition from Republicans, who champion the benefits of free-market economics and low tax rates. However, there could be some breakaway support for such a plan from some of those on the nationalist right in particular -- a segment of the right that has questioned free-market dogmas and where\u00a0higher taxes on the rich are\u00a0not always anathema. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly pitched a plan that would increase the tax rate to 44 percent on those earning more than $5 million -- although the plan was not adopted. Meanwhile, conservative firebrand Ann Coulter has shown support in the past for taxes on the very rich, particularly as she says they would be aimed at liberals and those who support lax immigration policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cForget the top 2 percent,\u201d she said in a 2012 column. \u201cThe top 1 percent of the top 1 percent keep voting for higher taxes -- and then take advantage of indefensible tax loopholes and deductions. Get them.\u201d Recently, she reacted to a call by the Chamber of Commerce for an\u00a0extension of protections to illegal immigrants who came to the country as children, by tweeting:\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the 70-80% tax on the rich.

Biden Jr. The party endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle, at which time he described Working Families as \u2018the closest thing\u2019 to \u2018my vision of democratic socialism.\u2019 The group\u2019s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party\u2019s ideological future is at stake.\u201d\n\nBernie shakes up New Hampshire staff - Fox News: \u201cFacing discontent and unheeded warnings from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. The campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders\u2019 steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director. Shannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders\u2019 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator\u2019s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign. \u2026 The move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nTeam Biden warns: Warren can\u2019t connect with blue collar voters - Politico: \u201cAs Elizabeth Warren climbs in the polls, Joe Biden\u2019s Massachusetts allies are warning that her election history suggests she runs weakest among the types of voters Democrats need to win over to capture the White House. While Warren won reelection easily in 2018, Biden\u2019s backers point to her performance among independent and blue-collar voters as evidence she\u2019ll fail to appeal to similar voters in the Rust Belt \u2013 just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. \u2018The grave concern of many of us Democrats in Massachusetts is that in many of the counties where Sen. Warren underperforms, they are demographically and culturally similar to voters in key swing states,\u2019 said state Rep. John Rogers, who backs Biden. \u2026\u00a0 Warren\u2019s critics have long assailed the former Harvard Law School professor for being too far liberal and too out-of-touch with blue-collar voters to beat Donald Trump, despite an economic message that speaks directly to many of their concerns.\u201d\n\nBeto comes after Buttigieg over his conciliatory\u00a0tone on guns - Fox News: \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke launched an expletive-fueled defense of his call Sunday to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s while also pushing back at critics \u2013 including fellow 2020 Democrat Pete Buttigieg. During last Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, the former Texas congressman said, \u2018Hell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\u2026\u2019 Buttigieg [said] the clip \u2026 \u2018will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u2019\u00a0 \u2026 O\u2019Rourke pushed back in a tweet: \u2026. \u2018When candidates say, \u2018At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue\u2014and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.\u2019\u201d\n\nOld school South Carolina politics get a boost - NYT: [Today] organizers of the 2019 Galivants Ferry Stump will add new twists to what has become a 143-year tradition. For the first time, the stump meeting will host presidential candidates \u2014 and it will do so in the fall of an odd-numbered year. \u2026 But with interest in the Democratic primary so high in South Carolina, an early voting state, and no stump event planned until long after the state\u2019s primary voters go to the polls, organizers said they had felt compelled to break from tradition and invite presidential contenders to Galivants Ferry in the fall. As of late Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were scheduled to attend.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK:\u00a0PRODUCTIVE, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY \n\u201cThe public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies.

But the idea goes back further than that. Almost every American\u2019s understanding of layering comes from the mid-century U.S. military. In 1943, the Quartermaster Corps\u2014the branch of the U.S. Army charged with procuring uniforms, among many other essential logistics of war\u2014introduced an experimental new uniform kit, which it named the M-43. The ensemble included a woolen undershirt, a long-sleeved, flannel shirt, and a sweater. \u2026 The military shaped Americans\u2019 sense of style in other ways, too. After demobilization, the historian Paul Fussell explains, veterans who had gotten used to \u2018loose, highly informal\u2019 uniforms were primed to keep shifting men\u2019s fashion toward casual wear. Out were the \u2018trim fit and exaggerated shoulders\u2019 of the prewar period. Looking prepared to get one\u2019s hands dirty, as a soldier might in an M-43 jacket, became more important than a tailored appearance.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with\u00a0your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a029 points\u00a0\nWarren:\u00a018.6 points\nSanders:\u00a015 points\nHarris:\u00a06.8 points\nButtigieg:\u00a05.2 points\n\n[Averages include: CNN, ABC News/WaPo, IBD, Quinnipiac University and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a040 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a054.8 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-14.8 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0no change in points\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 56% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The major revision to the Times' reporting came several hours after various politicians, including virtually all major 2020 Democratic candidates for president, cited the Times' reporting as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh. \u2026 Top 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro announced on Sunday that Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2018must be impeached,\u2019 after an uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh resurfaced in a weekend New York Times piece. The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\u201d\n\nPaper botched rollout - NYT: \u201cJames Dao, deputy editorial page editor for The Times, said in a statement that the essay was \u2018a well-reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.\u2019 The Times was roundly criticized for a tweet \u2014 which was later deleted \u2014 made on its Opinion account on Saturday about the essay that read: \u2018Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u2019 Mr. Dao said the tweet \u2018was clearly offensive and never should have gone out and we sincerely apologize.\u2019\u201d\n\nTRUMP REACHES FOR NEW MEXICO \nAxios: \u201cAt a Trump rally back in February in El Paso, Texas, the campaign saw an unexpected pattern in the attendee data \u2013 a large crowd of New Mexicans crossed the state line to be there. \u2018That was our first glimpse into the idea that there might be something happening,\u2019 the Trump campaign's Tim Murtaugh told Axios\u2026. Since then, New Mexico has become an unlikely target for the 2020 Trump campaign. It's the state with the highest percentage of Hispanics and Latinos (about 1 in 2 residents), and it's gone with Democrats in 6 of the last 7 general elections. \u2026 Demographers and pollsters tell Axios it's highly unlikely Trump can win New Mexico's 5 electoral votes. The state Latino population is overwhelmingly Democratic. Major New Mexico cities are booming and moving left politically, while Republican strongholds are losing their share of the population. Trump lost New Mexico in 2016, and his net approval rating has plummeted from +17 when he first took office to -13 as of July.\u201d\n\nHouse GOPers chafe at Trump-allied consultants - Politico: \u201cHouse Republicans sparred behind closed doors with Trump-aligned political operatives at a GOP retreat over the new online fundraising platform backed by party leaders and the White House. The fight Thursday over WinRed's data and competitiveness highlights long simmering tensions between GOP lawmakers and operatives allied with the president, and underscores the growing frustrations in the party as they try to hash out a strategy to win back the House next year. \u2026 Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) specifically raised concerns about data sharing, while other lawmakers were confused with how the operation works and pressed operatives for more information about the fundraising tool, according to aides and lawmakers who were present. Stefanik, who formerly led recruitment efforts for the GOP\u2019s campaign arm, pressed WinRed president Gerrit Lansing about whether lawmakers who use the apparatus would have to share their data with other people and questioned how it could be protected, several sources said.\u201d\n\nDEM LEADERS DRAW LINE ON GUN LEGISLATION\nPolitico: \u201cDemocratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any firearm legislation that falls short of universal background checks for gun sales \u2018will not get the job done,\u2019 complicating delicate negotiations between the president and a group of senators. Trump has been discussing potential legislation with senators in both parties that would expand background checks but would not go as far as House-passed legislation that would apply them to all gun sales with limited exceptions. Trump issued a veto threat on the House\u2019s background-checks bill earlier this year, and few Republicans in Congress support it. But in a conversation with Trump on Sunday morning, the House speaker and Senate minority leader indicated to Trump that they were taking a much harder line than rank-and-file senators involved in the talks.\u201d\n\nRocky start for shutdown talks - The Hill: \u201cSenate government funding talks are off to a rough start with 10 working days to go until the shutdown deadline. The impasse is throwing into question if senators will be able to get any of the fiscal year 2020 bills through the chamber this month, a setback for Republicans who wanted to clear a major package before October. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he still wants to bring bills to the Senate floor for a vote but warned that lawmakers need to \u2018negotiate the terrain.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve been down that road before,\u2019 he said, asked how the funding talks get unstuck. \u2018There\u2019s got to be a resolution to it\u2014it could be sooner. It could be later.\u2019 The partisan breakdown has left lawmakers visibly flummoxed about how to resolve the impasse. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) described the negotiations as \u2018pretty fragile.\u2019\u201d\n\nLewandowski may use testimony as Senate springboard - Axios: \u201cWatch for Trump's former campaign manager at the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday \u2013 and not just because of the prospect of a fiery exchange with Chairman Jerry Nadler. \u2026 If Corey Lewandowski goes forward with a run for the Senate in his home state of New Hampshire \u2013 which he's seriously considering, a spokesperson says \u2013\u00a0 he'd be the first in Trump's inner circle to test those coattails. \u2026 \u2018Corey will use [the hearing] as part of the campaign. He will be confrontational to the Democrats. He will be totally loyal to Trump. And he will be playing to the right wing of the party who need to unite behind him in a primary,\u2019 Thomas Rath, former attorney general of New Hampshire and adviser to several GOP presidential candidates, tells Axios. \u2026 The Judiciary Committee plans to press for more information about possible obstruction of justice by Trump outlined in Robert Mueller\u2019s report, including his asking Lewandowski to press then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nDays after resigning as National Security Advisor John Bolton takes old job back as head of two political action committees \u2013 USA Today\n\nPergram: \u2018US political discourse needs more \u2018flying flamingos\u2019 \u2013 Fox News\n\nAUDIBLE: WEIRD FLEX\u2026 \n\u201cWhat health concerns man, you wanna wrestle?\u201d \u2013\u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden said after a reporter asked when he is going to release his medical records to address concerns about his health Friday afternoon in Houston following a campaign event. \n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\u201cThank you for making it safe to get into the political waters again.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS 'CORPORATE WING' OF DEMS IN SWIPE AT WARREN -- AS MODERATES BEGIN RALLYING BEHIND HER It's unclear if the two candidates took a moment to chat while the plane was taxiing on the tarmac, but based on some comments from the Vermont Senator this week it would seem less than likely. Earlier this week, Sanders seemingly swiped at Warren in reaction to a Politico report showing centrists \"coming around\" to her candidacy. \"The cat is out of the bag,\" Sanders tweeted. \"The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly 'anybody but Bernie.'\u00a0They know our progressive agenda of Medicare for All, breaking up big banks, taking on drug companies and raising wages is the real threat to the billionaire class. Sanders denied that tweet was about Warren, but when asked why her campaign has been picking up momentum in recent weeks, he suggested because some voters \"would like to see a woman elected.\" MEDIA BUZZ: ELIZABETH WARREN SURGES ON FLATTERING PROFILES, PUNDIT PRAISE \"I think that there are a certain number of people who would like to see a woman elected,\u00a0I understand that,\" Sanders said on CNN. \"There are people who would like to see somebody who was younger, and I understand that also.

Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016 \u2013 wrote in a piece Thursday suggesting\u00a0she's now become too \"divisive,\" and would be better off staying in the Senate instead of running against President Trump in 2020. \u201cWhile Warren is an effective and impactful senator with an important voice nationally, she has become a divisive figure,\u201d the editors wrote. \u201cA unifying voice is what the country needs now after the polarizing politics of Donald Trump.\u201d It's a far cry from 2015, when the board wrote:\u00a0\u201cDemocrats would be making a\u00a0big mistake\u00a0if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. While Warren has repeatedly vowed that she won\u2019t run for president herself, she ought to reconsider.\u201d \u201cRunning for president is hard. Deciding not to run? That can be even harder,\u201d Thursday's piece began, before noting an announcement from former Democratic Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick\u00a0that he would not be launching a 2020 run. While commending Patrick\u2019s tenure in office and saying that he \u201cwould have been a formidable candidate,\u201d the publication urged other lawmakers in the state \u201creportedly considering presidential runs\u201d to \u201cthink carefully before jumping in, too.\u201d The outlet noted multiple lawmakers who have been rumored to be contemplating a White House bid.

Warren didn\u2019t seize the open window of opportunity in the 2016 election and now \u201cthere\u2019s reason to be skeptical\u201d of her possible success as a candidate, The Globe said, while noting some poll figures in the state. \u201cGovernor Baker garnered more votes than her in a state that is supposed to be a Democratic haven,\u201d The Globe wrote. \u201cMeanwhile, a\u00a0September poll\u00a0indicated that Massachusetts voters were more enthusiastic about Patrick making a White House bid than Warren.\u201d OBAMA\u2019S CHOICE: BETO MEETING PUTS EX-PRESIDENT IN AWKWARD SPOT, AS NUMEROUS ALLIES EYE 2020 Warren has not been shy about her interest in running against President Trump, at one point saying that after the midterm elections, she would \u201ctake a hard look at running for president.\u201d While acknowledging the difficulty for politicians to decide against launching a campaign after previously suggesting they would take it under consideration, The Globe noted Patrick's ability to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in testing the waters and deciding to stay on the beach,\u201d they concluded.

Elizabeth Warren\u00a0spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, \u201cI hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.\u201d But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013 over his family\u2019s role in the Ukraine controversy\u00a0that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the\u00a0Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president\u2019s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, \u201cno.\u201d WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to go back and look at the details.\u201d The \"details\" to which Warren was referring are from the two ethics plans she's unveiled to tackle corruption in government. Her campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that the plans wouldn't prevent any child of a vice president from serving on such a board. Warren\u2019s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump\u2019s call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\u00a0However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a \u201cpromise\u201d of an investigation. Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country\u2019s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama\u2019s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor \u2013 who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 later was dismissed. TRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY Trump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They\u2019re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine\u2019s assistance in investigating the Bidens. Warren kicked off her event \u2013 in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign \u2013 by emphasizing, \u201cnobody\u2019s above the law... not even the president.\u201d And, she repeated her call that \u201cit is time for impeachment now.\u201d The Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report. Asked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel\u2019s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN She continued, \u201cDonald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that\u2019s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.\u201d Warren\u2019s stop in New Hampshire came a day after\u00a0a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted her pleasure in reaction to the news that Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan will step down from his position Thursday after a 31-year career with the financial institution. \u201cAbout damn time. Tim Sloan should have been fired a long time ago. He enabled Wells Fargo's massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, & then helped cover it up. Now\u2014let's make sure all the people hurt by Wells Fargo's scams get the relief they're owed,\u201d posted Warren, who has long crusaded against shady practices from Wall Street and big banks. The 2020 presidential candidate has been among the most ardent critics of Sloan, 58, and Wells Fargo, which has been besieged by scandals in recent years. He will retire from the lender on June 30 and will be replaced by the firm\u2019s general counsel Allen Parker on an interim basis, Bloomberg reported. \u201cIt has become apparent that the focus on me has become a distraction that impacts our ability to successfully move Wells Fargo forward,\u201d Sloan said on a conference call after the announcement. WELLS FARGO PLANS TO SLASH HEADCOUNT IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS Sloan had faced calls for his resignation since taking the helm of the fourth-largest bank in the U.S. in 2016, with the mandate of cleaning it\u00a0after his predecessor was forced out. Critics, including Warren and other Democrats, didn't feel Sloan was up to the task after a series of high-profile scandals that included employees illegally opening fictitious accounts in customers' names to meet aggressive sales goals and overcharging customers for mortgages and auto loans. Both scandals resulted in Wells Fargo paying\u00a0penalties\u00a0totaling billions. In a series of tweets Thursday, Warren called for an investigation into the CEO for his role in Wells Fargo's crimes. WELLS FARGO TO PAY $2.1 BILLION FOR ROLE IN HOUSING BUBBLE \"By the way, getting fired shouldn't be the end of the story for Tim Sloan. He shouldn't get a golden parachute. He should be investigated by the SEC and the DOJ for his role in all the Wells Fargo scams. And if he's guilty of any crimes, he should be put in jail like anyone else,\" she posted. At a contentious House Financial Services Committee\u00a0hearing earlier this month, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused Wells Fargo of \"financing the caging of children\" and suggested it should bear the costs for oil spills and climate change. During the same hearing,\u00a0Sloan\u00a0tried to assuage concerns from lawmakers that he was not acting quickly enough to address the lender's long list of scandals. \u201cWith all of this experience and the length of time that you have been there, the roles that you have played, you have not been able to keep Wells Fargo out of trouble, you keep getting fined,\u201d panel Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said. \u201cWhy should Wells Fargo continue to be the size that it is?\u201d News of Sloan\u2019s departure was met with cheer from Democrats. \u201cTim Sloan needed to go, and he should not take a huge payout with him. But Wells Fargo\u2019s mismanagement is about more than one CEO \u2013 this bank needs a complete culture shift,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio tweeted Thursday. \u201cThank u, next,\u201d tweeted California\u00a0Rep. Katie Porter. Some Republicans were just as happy to see Sloan go. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThe bottom line is that we\u2019ve not seen the type of cultural or institutional change so desperately needed at Wells Fargo,\u201d said Patrick McHenry,\u00a0the top Republican sitting on the House Financial Services Committee. Sloan will retire with a standard retirement package and has stock options estimated at about $24.5 million. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base \u2014 wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already\u00a0showed signs\u00a0that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.\u201d\n\nDems turn to big donors to blunt Trump\u2019s early cash advantage -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cDemocratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that\u00a0President Trump\u00a0is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump\u2019s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection \u2014 far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.\u201d\n\nNew debate threshold squeezes also-rans -\u00a0Politico: \u201cNew thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate \u2014 which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles \u2014 represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) \u2014 or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. \u2026 The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five \u2013 Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0\u2013 who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.\u201d\n\nDems try to manipulate moderators -\u00a0NBC News: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate\u2026 Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher,\u00a0Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for\u00a0Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine\u2026 The top PBS journalists under consideration are\u00a0Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor\u00a0and\u00a0Amna Nawaz. Politico\u2019s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC\u2026 The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.\u201d\n\nSanders hits 4 million donations mark -\u00a0Fox News: \u201c\u2026[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders\u2019 campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. \u2018Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,\u2019 campaign manager\u00a0Faiz Shakir\u00a0touted. \u2018This is what momentum looks like.\u2019\u201d Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg -\u00a0AP: \u201cBefore he\u2019s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u00a0is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina.\u00a0Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he\u2019s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. \u2018He\u2019s got what it takes and he\u2019s got the resources to take it to Trump,\u2019 Benjamin said in an interview. \u2018I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.\u2019 First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina\u2019s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016.\u201d\n\nDems pleased with field, still open to changing horses -\u00a0NPR: \u201cOn the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most \u2018enthusiastic\u2019 to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most \u2018enthusiastic\u2019 about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY\n\n\u201cThe number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated.

Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? \u201cIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new\u00a0NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\u00a0Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. \u2026 \u2018We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,\u2019\u00a0Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. \u2018What\u00a0we're seeing is people just locking in.\u2019\u201d\n\nArmy colonel testifies about Trump demand -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cOne of the witnesses, Lt. Col.\u00a0Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official\u00a0George Kent\u00a0and the unnamed intelligence community official\u2026 Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a \u2018demand\u2019 and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it \u2018would be interpreted as a partisan play.\u2019 He also emphasized that he reported his concerns \u2018out of a sense of duty.\u2019 Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been \u2018excluded\u2019 from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.\u201d\n\nImpeachment scrambles Senate strategies -\u00a0Politico: \u201cThe Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump\u2019s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. \u2026 Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. \u2026\u00a0Much is uncertain and out of the Senate\u2019s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there\u2019s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.\u201d\n\nCONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20\nPolitico: \u201cHouse and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.\u201d\n\nPelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen\u2019s jitters -\u00a0Politico: \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President\u00a0Richard Trumka\u00a0on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump\u2019s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting.\u00a0The private huddle with the labor leader \u2014 at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn\u2019t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nI\u2019ll Tell You What: Surprise!

      "content": " 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is known for her left-wing views on issues from health care-for-all to taxing the super-wealthy. But a new deep dive into the left-wing firebrand\u2019s past finds that she was known as a \u201cdiehard conservative\u201d in school. Politico reports that, while Warren has acknowledged but downplayed her Republican past in public, a review of her scholarship and interviews with friends reveals that she has a hitherto unexplored \u201cconservative track record\u201d -- mainly on economic policy. WARREN NOT WORRIED ABOUT POLLS: 'IT'S EARLY...I'M RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN THAT I WANT TO RUN' \u201cLiz was a diehard conservative in those days. \u2026 Now we\u2019ve swapped \u2014 a 180-degree turn and an about-face,\u201d Katrina Harry, one of Warren\u2019s high school friends, told the outlet. \u201cLiz was sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude,\u201d law professor Calvin Johnson, a colleague of Warren\u2019s at the University of Texas at Austin in the early 1980s, said of the future senator, who, decades later, would be credited as\u00a0architect of the Consumer Financial\u00a0Protection Bureau (CFPB.) \u201cShe\u2019s definitely changed. It\u2019s absolutely clear that something happened,\u201d said Rutgers law professor Gary Francione, another Warren colleague from the 1980s. Politico reports that Warren first had a political conversion in the '80s when she traveled to bankruptcy courts and saw that Americans filing, far from being irresponsible as she'd imagined, actually\u00a0resembled her own family. But she reportedly moved to the left when she was recruited on a federal commission to reform the bankruptcy code in the mid-1990s, before losing that battle in 2005. WARREN'S $6 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL FAR BEHIND SANDERS \u201cShe really did have a \u2018Road to Damascus\u2019 conversion when she saw the bankrupt consumers really were suffering -- forced into bankruptcy by illness, firing or divorce\u2014and not predators,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI realize nonpartisan just isn\u2019t working,\u201d Warren told Politico. \u201cBy then it\u2019s clear: The only allies I have are in the Democratic Party, and it\u2019s not even the majority of Democrats.\u201d Despite Warren\u2019s conservative past, her left-wing credentials are not in doubt. In addition to supporting radical policies such as the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all, Warren has distanced herself from the 2020 field by pushing a \u201cwealth tax\u201d for those with more than $50 million in assets.

But should Warren secure the 2020 Democratic nomination, she wouldn\u2019t be the only one on the ballot to have switched parties. President Trump donated to Democratic candidates in the past, and was registered as a Democrat between 2001 and 2009.",

      "content": " Democratic 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren\u00a0on Saturday unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal that would see\u00a0higher taxes on gun manufacturers, waiting periods for guns and an investigation into\u00a0the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Massachusetts senator's\u00a0proposal comes a week after the two mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that left more than 30 people dead and dozens injured. Warren begins her plan with a goal of dramatically reducing gun deaths and then proposing policies that would help achieve that goal. WARREN SURGES, SANDERS SLIPS, BIDEN STEADY IN NEW POST-DEBATE POLL IN IOWA \u201cIn 2017, almost 40,000 people died from guns in the United States. My goal as President, and our goal as a society, will be to reduce that number by 80 percent,\u201d Warren said in a Medium post announcing the plan. \u201cWe might not know how to get all the way there yet. But we\u2019ll start by implementing solutions that we believe will work.\u201d Warren\u00a0proposes executive action to \u201crein in an out-of-control\u201d gun industry and hold manufacturers accountable for gun violence. Those actions include background checks, extending bulk sale reporting requirements and raising the minimum age for purchase on certain guns. She also promises to investigate \u201cthe NRA and its cronies.\u201d \u201cThe NRA is accused of exploiting loopholes in federal laws governing non-profit spending to divert member dues into lavish payments for its board members and senior leadership,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll appoint an attorney general committed to investigating these types of corrupt business practices, and the banks and third-party vendors \u2014 like Wells Fargo \u2014 that enabled the NRA to skirt the rules for so long.\u201d Warren goes on to propose a law that would impose criminal liability and jail time for gun company CEOS if their company \u201cis found guilty of a crime or their negligence causes severe harm to American families.\u201d Her plan also says that a President Warren would push to end the Senate filibuster to make it easier for Congress to pass a package of gun reforms that she says she would sign within the first 100 days of her presidency. Part of that package would include as assault weapons ban, a ban on \u201chigh-capacity ammunition magazines\u201d and a ban on \u201cdeadly gun accessories.\u201d Her legislation would also increase taxes on gun manufacturers, including raising taxes to 30 percent on guns and 50 percent on ammunition \u201cto reduce new gun and ammunition sales overall and to bring in new federal revenue that we can use for gun violence prevention and enforcement of existing gun laws.\u201d Other proposals including prohibiting anyone convicted of a hate crime from owning a gun, and passing extreme risk protection laws to allow a temporary restriction of gun access for those in crisis or at higher risk of harming themselves or others. The plan comes as Warren heads to Iowa with a number of other 2020 hopefuls, where they will be speaking at a gun safety forum in Des Moines. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Typically gun control is an intensely partisan issue, but in the days since the shootings, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have expressed their openness to passing enhanced background checks into law. \u201cGuns should not be placed in the hands of mentally ill or deranged people,\" Trump tweeted Friday. \"I am the biggest Second Amendment person there is, but we all must work together for the good and safety of our Country.

The survey also finds\u00a0President Trump\u00a0continuing to struggle, with economic concerns seemingly starting to affect his standing, leaving a cloudy picture about the 2020 presidential election. Warren finds herself in a strong position with Democratic voters ahead of Thursday's Democratic presidential debate. Seventy-five percent of Democratic voters now say they have a favorable impression of Warren \u2014\u00a0that's up from 53% in January, a 22-point jump from the last time the poll asked the favorability of candidates or potential candidates. What's more, the percent of those saying they have a negative impression has gone down from 17% to 11%. \u2018Elizabeth Warren seems to be on the verge of starting to make significant and serious inroads into this contest,\u2019 said\u00a0Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducts the poll. He added, \u2018Heading into the debate, she's very well-positioned.\u2019\u201d\n\nHigh stakes for Harris -\u00a0LAT: \u201cIn the nearly eight months since [Kamala Harris] formally launched her White House bid, California\u2019s U.S. senator has fallen into a familiar pattern. Exhilarating highs \u2014 her artfully executed announcement, her Senate grilling of attorney general nominee\u00a0William Barr, her standout performance in June\u2019s first presidential debate \u2014 followed by extended doldrums that stalled her momentum and erased those gains. At the same time, her campaign has had to adjust its strategy to account for the strength of rivals\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, placing greater emphasis on the Iowa caucuses and forcing Harris to scramble against opponents with a considerable head start courting activists and snapping up the state\u2019s top political talent. Now mired well back in the crowded pack, Harris faces intense pressure for a standout performance in Thursday\u2019s debate and, beyond that, greater facility at the up-close style of engaging voters that is worlds away from the TV-driven, media-centric campaigns she has grown accustomed to in California.\u201d\n\nBeto falls to fourth in his home state -\u00a0Quinnipiac University: \u201cOne day before the next Democratic debate is held in Houston, former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0tops the field in the Texas Democratic primary with 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0follows with 18 percent, while both Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0and former U.S. Rep.\u00a0Beto O'Rourke\u00a0are at 12 percent. This compares to an early June Quinnipiac University Poll, in which Biden had 30 percent, O'Rourke had 16 percent, Sanders had 15 percent, and Warren had 11 percent. \u2026 In today's primary, there are a number of candidates in the mid to low single digits, with Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0at 5 percent, Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0and former HUD Secretary\u00a0Julian Castro\u00a0at 3 percent, and Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0at 2 percent. There are three candidates at one percent, with nine additional candidates with less than one percent.\u201d\n\nCalifornia real estate billionaire to host Biden fundraiser -\u00a0CNBC: \u201cBillionaire and real estate magnate\u00a0George Marcus\u00a0is preparing to host former Vice President Joe Biden next month for a 2020 fundraising event. Marcus, a billionaire megadonor who bundled more than $100,000 for\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0in 2016, is expected to be the lead host at a lunch for Biden\u2019s return to San Francisco in the first week of October, according to people familiar with the matter. Biden\u2019s allies have been prodding Marcus for months to open his doors to the campaign, these people added. Biden\u2019s campaign announced the candidate will be traveling to California on Oct. 3, but the press release did not give further details.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: IT\u2019S ALL GOOD\n\n\u201cBut in a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited; both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength\u2026 it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 48\n\nTIME OUT: THE LESSON OF 9/11\n\nIn light of the tremendous response we got from readers last year we are linking back to\u00a0our musings\u00a0from the previous anniversary of September 11th: \u201cOne of the most treasured and often repeated sayings about 9/11 is the line from the widow of\u00a0Jason Dahl, the pilot of Flight 93, the doomed airliner that, perhaps thanks to the courage of passengers and crew, crashed in a former Pennsylvania coal mine rather than its intended target of the U.S. Capitol. A year later,\u00a0Sandy Dahl\u00a0retuned to the scene as part of her mission to build a fitting memorial for her husband and the 39 other Americans who died there. She said, \u2018If we learn nothing else from this tragedy, we learn that life is short and there is no time for hate.\u2019 Her comments resonated because Dahl expressed what was so much on the hearts of Americans. The attacks came during an era of viscous political infighting. We had a failed impeachment two years before. And just 10 months before the attack, a presidential election had remained unresolved for 41 agonizing days. Cynicism abounded. We had been narrowly, bitterly divided. We had been hateful to each other. We had put party over country. But no longer, we said. Our new motto would be simple: United we stand.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028 points\u00a0\nWarren:\u00a018.2 points\nSanders:\u00a014.8 points\nHarris:\u00a06.4 points\nButtigieg:\u00a05 points\n\n[Averages include: ABC News/WaPo, IBD, Quinnipiac University, USA Today/Suffolk University and Monmouth University.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a040 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a054.8 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-14.8 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0down 1.8 points\u00a0\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 56% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

On paper, it was Republicans who emerged victorious, going 2-for-2 in two separate congressional elections. But there was also a silver lining for Democrats \u2014 their final vote margin in the night\u2019s marquee race was much bluer than the district\u2019s baseline partisanship. \u2026 The results also represent a continuation of the mini-realignment we\u2019ve seen in the Trump era of suburbs getting bluer and rural areas moving even more toward the GOP. For instance, [Dan] McCready lost the district even as he won suburban Mecklenburg County by 13 percentage points, an improvement on the 2018 results, when he won Mecklenburg by 10 points. \u2026\u00a0McCready did worse than his 2018 performance in\u00a0every other county, most of which are sparsely populated.\u201d\n\nSenate Dems vow to support Markey over Kennedy -\u00a0Politico: \u201cSenate Democrats\u2019 campaign committee is siding with incumbent Sen.\u00a0Ed Markey\u00a0over potential insurgent challenger Rep.\u00a0Joe Kennedy III, Sen.\u00a0Catherine Cortez Masto\u00a0said in an interview on Tuesday. The Nevada senator, who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the DSCC \u2018will be there\u2019 for Markey if Kennedy launches a challenge. \u2018That\u2019s why we were created, to support our incumbents. And Ed Markey is not only an incumbent but he knows the issues that are important to Massachusetts. He\u2019s been out front on so many issues, including climate change,\u2019 Cortez Masto said. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear whether Kennedy is serious about running against Markey in a primary or is trying to scare the senator into retirement. Kennedy also could be trying to increase visibility in case Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wins the presidency and the state holds a special election for her seat. Warren has endorsed Markey.\u201d\n\nSasse receives surprise Trump endorsement -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cPresident Trump offered an unexpected endorsement Tuesday night of Sen.\u00a0Ben Sasse\u00a0(R-Neb.), a prominent member of the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 faction in 2016 who has since mused about leaving the Republican Party and faces a primary challenge next year. \u2018Senator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska,\u2019 Trump said in a tweet. \u2018He is great with our Vets, the Military, and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border, Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\u2019 Ending months of speculation about his plans, Sasse, 47, announced a bid for a second Senate term last week. \u2026\u00a0 Sasse\u2019s campaign seemed surprised by Trump\u2019s endorsement. \u2018Ben\u2019s grateful for the President\u2019s kind words,\u2019 Sasse spokesman\u00a0James Wegmann\u00a0said in a statement.\u201d\n\nPOLL SHOWS BIG SLIDE FOR TRUMP SINCE JULY\nWaPo:\u00a0\u201cThe new Post-ABC poll is much more in line with other early general election polls\u2026 There are signs not just that Trump is trailing, but also that he might actually be regressing \u2014 at least slightly. The Post-ABC poll shows his approval dropping from 47 percent in July \u2014 what was then a high for his presidency \u2014 to 40 percent today. \u2026 But even if you accept that not much has fundamentally changed, the new poll is bad for Trump. It accounts for [Joe]\u00a0Biden\u2019s second-largest lead (15 points) over Trump since launching his campaign. And his biggest lead (16 points) came just two weeks ago in a Quinnipiac University poll. Trump\u2019s nine-point deficit against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (52-43) is tied for his second-highest in high-quality national polls. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) seven-point lead (51-44) is tied for her second-biggest, too. And Sen. Kamala D. Harris\u2019s (D-Calif.) seven-point lead is her third-biggest.\u201d\n\nEarly state GOPers won\u2019t cave on cancelling contests -\u00a0AP: \u201cRepublicans in Iowa and New Hampshire are vowing to hold a caucus and primary next year, even as party leaders in a handful of other states have canceled their contests to help smooth President Donald Trump\u2019s path to reelection. \u2018Under no circumstances will the New Hampshire primary ever be canceled, whether there\u2019s token opposition or a serious contest,\u2019\u00a0Steve Duprey, New Hampshire\u2019s national Republican committeeman, said in an interview. \u2018It was never even up for discussion,\u2019 echoed Iowa GOP National Committeeman\u00a0Steve Scheffler\u00a0in a separate interview. \u2018We\u2019re not going to shut the door on anyone\u2019 \u2026Trump allies on the ground in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas moved in recent days to cancel their 2020 primary contests altogether to eliminate the possibility of trouble. Some said the cancellations were simply a cost-cutting measure, yet they follow aggressive steps by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee in recent months to strengthen Trump\u2019s reelection chances.\u201d\n\nLong-shot GOP primary challengers to have their own debate -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cThe three long-shot challengers taking on President Trump in the 2020 primaries are expected to face-off in their own debate later this month. Former Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Bill Weld, former South Carolina governor and congressman\u00a0Mark Sanford\u00a0and former Rep.\u00a0Joe Walsh\u00a0of Illinois have been invited by Business Insider to participate in a debate Sept. 24. Weld and Walsh\u2019s campaigns told Fox News they would be attending the debate. Sanford\u2019s campaign was optimistic its candidate would also take the stage as long as a scheduling conflict was resolved. Business Insider told Fox News that the debate will be streamed live on Business Insider Today, their daily news show on Facebook Watch. They added that the president -- who has derided his primary opponents as the \u2018Three Stooges\u2019 -- was invited to participate but has not responded.\u201d\n\nSHUTDOWN THREAT GAINS\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cSenate appropriators had barely begun work on Tuesday before the process blew up, mired in disagreements over abortion-related \u2018poison pills,\u2019 funding for domestic programs and President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. The squabbling reinforces the likelihood that a stopgap spending bill will be needed through mid-November or early December, which House and Senate leaders are mulling as they face another government shutdown at the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0said Democrats are trying to \u2018wiggle out\u2019 of a handshake agreement included in the budget deal signed by Trump last month, which was aimed at ensuring both sides avoid overly partisan policy provisions that could tank appropriations bills. \u2026 But Senate Minority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer\u00a0said poison pills aren\u2019t the problem. Republicans want to increase funding for the wall by $12 billion, taking as much as $5 billion from domestic programs and pilfering more military construction funds, he said.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nThe race is on to be Trump\u2019s fourth national security adviser -\u00a0NYT\n\nTrump orders federal efforts to address homeless camps in California\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo\n\nTrump admin wants Congress to pass North American trade deal in the next two months -\u00a0Politico\n\nRep.\u00a0Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., to replace Rep.\u00a0Mark Meadows\u00a0as Freedom Caucus chair\u00a0-\u00a0The Hill\n\nAUDIBLE: HOW FAR WE\u2019VE COME\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to do anything as a loner, but if you get together with like-minded people, you can create a force for change.

Daily Inter Lake reported Sunday that the U.S. agriculture department's Wildlife Services division says there have been multiple reports of feral hogs near the border. An official says eight mature pigs were discovered in Canada directly above Montana's Lincoln County this summer. Wildlife Services, the Montana Invasive Species Council, the National Feral Swine Program, and the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department say the pigs could do widespread damage. Officials say the pigs are \u2018rototillers\u2019 that root for food and wallow in farms, fields and forests, leaving terrain unrecognizable. The pigs may also spread diseases impacting livestock and other animals. Various state groups are working on prevention and management measures.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cIn the end: 10 years, no second attack (which everyone assumed would come within months). That testifies to the other great achievement of the decade: the defensive anti-terror apparatus hastily constructed from scratch after 9/11 by President Bush, and then continued by President Obama. Continued why? Because it worked. It kept us safe \u2014 the warrantless wiretaps, the Patriot Act, extraordinary rendition, preventive detention and, yes, Guantanamo.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer\u00a0(1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Sept. 8, 2011.\n\nChris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

Bernie Sanders at 17 percent, and former Vice President Joe Biden at 15 percent. \u2026 Those who consider themselves \u2018very liberal\u2019 \u2026 are divided in their top choice with Sanders getting 32 percent and Warren at 30 percent. Those who identify as \u2018somewhat liberal\u2019 \u2026 are split in their top choice between Buttigieg and Warren, with Warren at 29 percent and Buttigieg at 24 percent. Among \u2018moderates and conservatives\u2019 \u2026 it's a close race for the top spot between Buttigieg and Biden, with Buttigieg at 19 percent and Biden at 18 percent.\u201d\n\nPoll finds Biden, Warren tied -\u00a0Monmouth University: \u201cDemocrats and Democratic-leaning voters are divided over who they want to stand against Trump in 2020.\u00a0The top contenders remain Biden (23%), Warren (23%), and Sanders (20%). In late September, these three stood at 25%, 28%, and 15%, respectively. Buttigieg garners 9% (up from 5%) and [Kamala] Harris gets 5% (same as 5% in late September).\u00a0 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each get 3% and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar gets 2%.\u00a0 The remaining eight candidates included in the poll earn 1% or less.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Dems unhappy with Warren snubbing convention -\u00a0Politico: \u201cU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the latest Democratic frontrunner to confirm she'll skip the California Democratic Party nominating convention in Long Beach this month, sparking sharp criticism from party chair\u00a0Rusty Hicks. Hicks took to Facebook last night in a blistering post to urge Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden to \u2018reconsider your misguided decision to publicly snub\u2019 the California Democratic Convention\u2026 Biden two weeks ago indicated he would bypass the convention and TV forum\u2026 Hicks' post is a clear indication that California Democratic Party leaders are unhappy with Warren\u2019s decision to pass on the forum, which will clearly get less national attention now that two leading contenders are out. But strategists say that Warren\u2019s camp clearly believe she should be spending more time in key early states like Iowa and New Hampshire as her poll numbers rise.\u201d\n\nGabbard makes 10 for November debate, Klobuchar makes December stage -\u00a0Politico: \u201cHawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0has qualified for the November Democratic presidential debate and Minnesota Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0has made the December debate after the release of a new Iowa poll, which also featured\u00a0Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg,\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0bunched within 5 points of each other at the top of the field. Klobuchar got 5 percent support in the Iowa survey from Quinnipiac University released on Wednesday. She previously hit at least 4 percent support in three other polls approved by the Democratic National Committee, according to POLITICO\u2019s tracking, and she has accrued over 200,000 individual donors, the other threshold to make the December debate stage. She had previously qualified for the November debate. \u2026 Gabbard will join nine other candidates on the November stage: Joe Biden,\u00a0Cory Booker, Buttigieg,\u00a0Kamala Harris, Klobuchar, Sanders,\u00a0Tom Steyer, Warren and\u00a0Andrew Yang.\u201d\n\nBernie big bucks -\u00a0NYT: \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s campaign plans to spend more than $30 million on TV advertising alone in the first four presidential nominating states and California, according to several people familiar with the strategy, a financial show of force that also suggests he needs to reach outside the traditional sphere of Democratic primary voters and caucusgoers for support. Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, has been on the air in Iowa since early October, when his campaign spent $1.3 million on television advertising, and has bought $1 million of TV time in New Hampshire beginning Thursday. The campaign has so far largely flouted traditional politicking\u2026 But in earmarking tens of millions of dollars for television advertising between now and Super Tuesday in early March, the campaign is following a more established and analog path to accomplish what it says is the same aim.\u201d\n\nMeet the \u2018Barnstormers for Pete\u2019 -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cDES MOINES, Iowa\u2014Wear\u00ading their team\u2019s col\u00adors of blue and yel\u00adlow, they ar\u00adrived here from around the coun\u00adtry at their own ex\u00adpense to sup\u00adport the De\u00admo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adtic pres\u00adi\u00adden\u00adtial bid of Pete Buttigieg.\u00a0Barn\u00adstorm\u00aders for Pete, a grass-roots ef\u00adfort or\u00adga\u00adnized on\u00adline, helped give the mayor of South Bend, Ind., one of the big\u00adgest cheer\u00ading sec\u00adtions at a closely watched De\u00admo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adtic Party event Fri\u00adday.

Plus, Chris tries to redeem himself with this week's trivia.\u00a0LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE\n\nREPORT: TRUMP FRUSTRATED BY BARR\u2019S LACK OF PUBLIC HELP\nWSJ: \u201cPres\u00adi\u00addent Trump wanted At\u00adtor\u00adney Gen\u00aderal\u00a0William Barr\u00a0to pub\u00adlicly de\u00adclare that he hadn\u2019t bro\u00adken any laws dur\u00ading a phone call with the Ukrain\u00adian leader that is now at the heart of an im\u00adpeach\u00adment in\u00adquiry, but Mr. Barr re\u00adfused the re\u00adquest, an ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion of\u00adfi\u00adcial said Wednes\u00adday.\u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s re\u00adquest for Mr. Barr to hold a news con\u00adfer\u00adence came shortly af\u00adter the White House re\u00adleased a rough tran\u00adscript of the July 25 call. In that call, Mr. Trump pressed Ukrain\u00adian Pres\u00adi\u00addent\u00a0Volodymyr Ze\u00adlen\u00adsky\u00a0to un\u00adder\u00adtake in\u00adves\u00adti\u00adga\u00adtions re\u00adlated to De\u00admo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adtic pres\u00adi\u00adden\u00adtial can\u00addi\u00addate Joe Biden, as well as the 2016 elec\u00adtion. Mr. Trump\u2019s de\u00adsire for such a pub\u00adlic an\u00adnounce\u00adment was dis\u00adcussed among White House of\u00adfi\u00adcials, who re\u00adlayed it to the Jus\u00adtice De\u00adpart\u00adment, the of\u00adfi\u00adcial said.\u201d\n\nBolton willing to testify if court clears way -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cFormer national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton\u00a0is willing to defy the White House and testify in the House impeachment inquiry about his alarm at the Ukraine pressure campaign if a federal court clears the way, according to people familiar with his views. Bolton could be a powerful witness for Democrats: Top State Department and national security officials have already testified that he was deeply concerned about efforts by Trump and his allies to push Ukraine to open investigations into the president\u2019s political rivals while the Trump administration held up military aid to that country. The former national security adviser, who abruptly left his post in September, is expected to confirm their statements and describe his conversations with Trump, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry.\u201d\n\nFrothy tweets come back to sting whistleblower lawyer -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cMark Zaid, one of the attorneys representing the intelligence community whistleblower at the center of the Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry, tweeted conspicuously in January 2017 that a \u2018coup has started\u2019 and that \u2018impeachment will follow ultimately.\u2019\u00a0Then, in July 2017, Zaid remarked, \u2018I predict @CNN will play a key role in @realDonaldTrump not finishing out his full term as president.\u2019 Also that month, Zaid tweeted, \u2018We will get rid of him, and this country is strong enough to survive even him and his supporters.\u2019 Amid a slew of impeachment-related posts, Zaid assured his Twitter followers that \u2018as one falls, two more will take their place,\u2019 apparently referring to Trump administration employees who defy the White House. Zaid promised that the \u2018coup\u2019 would occur in \u2018many steps.\u2019\u201d\n\nPence aide answers impeachment probe questions -\u00a0NPR: \u201cA top aide to Vice President Pence arrived Thursday to testify in the ongoing House impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\u00a0Jennifer Williams\u00a0is a longtime foreign service officer who was assigned to be the vice president's special adviser for Europe and Russia in the spring. She would be the first person from the vice president's office to testify in the probe of whether the president withheld military aid from Ukraine while seeking a political favor. She will be the third person who was listening in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00a0to testify, a White House aide confirmed to NPR's\u00a0Mara Liasson.\u201d\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Ruling: Trump should\u2019ve known -\u00a0This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0shares his thoughts on WSJ columnist\u00a0Peggy Noonan\u2019s latest column: \u201cNoonan\u2019s piece in last Saturday's Wall Street Journal, she asked how history would view President\u00a0Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u00a0if, when asked by British Prime Minister\u00a0Winston Churchill\u00a0for help fighting the Nazis in 1940, he had conditioned that aid on the provision of dirt on\u00a0Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt's eventual Republican opponent in the 1940 presidential election. We would be repulsed to learn this. Of course, Roosevelt never made such a Trumpian demand. \u2026 In fact, Trump should have known that the act of soliciting assistance for his campaign from a foreign government, whether directly by him or indirectly by Giuliani, is defined as criminal under federal law \u2013 a high crime, as the Constitution puts it. He also should have known that refusing to perform a lawful duty, releasing the $391 million Congress had authorized until a personal favor comes his way, is also defined in federal law as criminal \u2013 bribery, as the Constitution puts it.\u201d\u00a0More\u00a0here.\n\nTRUMP THREATENED SESSIONS ON SENATE RUN\nNYT: \u201cJeff Sessions, the former senator from Alabama whose tumultuous tenure as President Trump\u2019s attorney general lasted less than two years, plans to announce on Thursday that he will enter the race to reclaim his old seat in 2020, a Republican official said. Mr. Sessions has remained largely out of the public eye, and has been effectively exiled from Republican politics, since he was forced out of the Trump administration last November. \u2026\u00a0But over the last week, Mr. Trump sent word to Mr. Sessions through allies that he would publicly attack him if he ran. And Mr. McConnell recently approached Mr. Trump, asking him whether his feelings about Mr. Sessions might have improved. The president said he was very much still opposed to Mr. Sessions and would make that clear if he had to, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Several Republican officials thought that had settled the matter \u2014 until Mr. Sessions decided to run.\u201d\n\nBevin still not conceding -\u00a0Lexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: \u201cKentucky Gov.\u00a0Matt Bevin\u00a0Wednesday did what he has done so often during his term as governor \u2014 he refused to back down. Bevin requested a recanvass in the race for governor, which Democrat\u00a0Andy Beshear\u00a0won by 5,189 votes, according to unofficial vote results from the Kentucky State Board of Elections.\u00a0Bevin has refused to concede the election. \u2026\u00a0At the governor\u2019s mansion Wednesday evening, Bevin refused to take questions but criticized\u00a0Alison Lundergan Grimes\u00a0for going on CNN\u00a0while votes were being counted and claimed \u2018thousands of absentee ballots were illegally counted\u2019 and that people were turned away from the polls. He provided no evidence to back up his claims, saying instead his campaign was in the process of getting affidavits.\u00a0He did not say whether he plans to formally contest the election.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nWSJ Editorial Board: \u2018The anti-Republican trend\u2019\u00a0-\u00a0WSJ\n\nIt's official: Pence files paperwork for Trump to be on New Hampshire primary ballot\u00a0-\u00a0WMUR\n\nAUDIBLE: HAIR-RAISING\u00a0\n\n\u201cHis people argue Biden can lose Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, and win South Carolina and be fine. Okay \u2013 don\u2019t kid a kidder. I worked on the\u00a0John Edwards\u00a0campaign.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jennifer Palmieri, a top adviser to\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0in 2016, speaking with\u00a0Vanity Fair.\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cA few recent polls have showed Biden to be in 4th place (although the distance from first to fourth is almost within the margin of error) in Iowa primary polls. Reporting has breathlessly focused on how bad he is doing there. I understand the importance of perception and trends, etc., but from a practical standpoint, is there really much of a difference? I seem to remember reading that the Democrats were going to go to a more proportional method for distribution of delegates. Assuming the top four in Iowa (or any other state) finish with 20, 19, 17, and 15 percent, how would that translate into delegates? And, why isn\u2019t there more coverage of the potential chaos the Dems are going to have in Milwaukee because of their proportional plan?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Fred MacDonald, Artesia, N.M.\n\n\n[Ed. note: You\u2019re quite right, Doc. But don\u2019t discount the momentum a candidate could obtain from an Iowa win \u2013 especially a dark horse like Pete Buttigieg. I think that while the odds of a contested convention are low, they are certainly higher than in recent years. Milwaukee could be quite a show this summer!]\n\n\u201cChris, Now that Virginia has turned blue, how come Dems are still ignoring their governor is an alleged racist with photo proof, and their lieutenant governor is an alleged rapist? Even those running for president are turning a blind eye. The #MeToo movement has been noticeably absent. Al Sharpton has been noticeably quiet? Why?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Floyd Prophet, Kannapolis, N.C.\n\n\n[Ed. note: Partisanship is a helluva drug, Mr. Prophet. One might ask why Republicans have not more openly expressed concern about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. The simple answer is that it is not in their political interests to do so. Courage has always been in short supply in the political class, but in our post-shame culture, radical self-interest seems to usually take the place of even insincere decency. Northam now has a mandate in the form of a midterm sweep for his party and will doubtless slip away largely undamaged.]\n\n\n\u201cLexington [Kentucky] Herald Leader: \u2018Trump\u2019s inability to lift an unpopular Bevin in a state the president won by almost 30 percentage points creates a perception the president is weak as he heads into the 2020 elections and as talk of impeachment swirls in D.C.\u2019 I beg to differ with LexKY HL. Trumps ability to lift a highly unpopular and failing candidate to within a slim margin of victory bodes well for his 2020 re-election bid. Those who support him know that he is a fighter and will back him all the way.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mike Tardif, Santa Ana, Calif.\n\n\n[Ed. note: Trump probably did plenty of good for Bevin. We don\u2019t really know what the contour of the race was over time, but the one really worthwhile public, non-partisan pollster in the race, Mason-Dixon, found the race essentially tied in December and again just before the vote. It\u2019s easy to see, though, that without Trump giving him a boost, the hugely unpopular Bevin could have really tanked at the end.]\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nMA\u2019AM, THIS ISN\u2019T \u2018KNIGHT RIDER\u2019\nFox News: \u201cMassachusetts police on Wednesday morning saved a woman who was trapped in a\u00a0car\u00a0\u2026 that was trapped in a truck.\u00a0The Northampton PD posted a photo of a\u00a0Subaru\u00a0SUV that was\u00a0driven into the open back of a landscaping trailer and got lodged at a 45-degree angle.\u00a0After rescuing her, the uninjured driver told them that the windshield had fogged up and she didn\u2019t see coming up ahead on the two-lane road.\u00a0Police also discovered that she had an expired registration and issued her a citation for that, along with one for impeded driving.

He handed it over to the Congress of the United States of America to do our constitutional duty,\u201d she said. MCCONNELL RAILS AGAINST MUELLER REPORT POLITICS IN BLISTERING FLOOR SPEECH: 'CASE CLOSED' Her remarks followed McConnell\u2019s early condemnation of democratic lawmakers who continue to probe deeper into whether or not Trump obstructed justice by colluding with the Russians during the 2016 election or whether the president tried to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. \"Many Americans were waiting to see how their elected officials would respond,\" McConnell said. \"With an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country finally unify to confront the real challenges before us? Would we finally be able to move on from partisan paralysis and breathless conspiracy theorizing? Or would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship, and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and his agents need only stand on the sidelines and watch as their job is done for them?\" McConnell\u2019s calls to refocus lawmaker\u2019s attention to looming concerns of election security ahead of the 2020 race were met with more partisan blame from across the aisle. \u201cForeign powers are ramping up to interfere in our next election, the Senate has done nothing. Nothing to grapple with the problem,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY said Tuesday. Reading portions of the Mueller report, Warren insisted that although Attorney General William Barr\u2019s summary memo of the Mueller report claimed to exonerate the president, the investigative findings detailed in the 448-page report are sufficient to bring impeachment charges against the president. \u201cNo matter how many times Mitch McConnell or the rest of the Republicans want to wish that away, it\u2019s there, in black and white in the report,\u201d Warren said.

Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register\u2019s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. \u2018This is the first major shakeup\u2019 in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u2026 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\u201d\n\nDem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style \u2018Biden fest.\u2019 A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juli\u00e0n Castro\u2019s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday\u2019s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event\u2019s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.\u201d\n\nVoters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: \u201cAs Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they\u2019re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party\u2019s more moderate frontrunner \u2014 Joe Biden \u2014 also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll\u2026 But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they\u2019re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they\u2019re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)\u201d\n\nThe end may be near for Booker - Politico: \u201cCory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. \u2018We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,\u2019 campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. \u2018It\u2019s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.\u2019 The bottom line, Demissie said, is that \u2018we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward\u2019 if the campaign can\u2019t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. \u2026 Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn\u2019t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: GOOD CALL GUYS \n\u201cFor the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.\u201d \u2013 James Madison, Federalist No. 42\n\nTIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS\nHistory: \u201cAmid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the \u2018Corps of Discovery,\u2019 featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. \u2026 On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to\u00a0Oregon\u00a0Territory.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028.2 points\u00a0\nWarren:\u00a020.2 points\nSanders:\u00a016 points\nHarris:\u00a06.6 points\nButtigieg:\u00a05.4 points\n[Averages include: Fox News, NBC News/WSJ, CNN, ABC News/WaPo and IBD.]\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a043.6 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.6 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-10 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 4.8 points\n\n[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 54% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration\u2019s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. \u2026 The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word \u2018impeachment,\u2019 but her message hinted at that possibility.\u201d\n\nTrump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: \u201cPresident Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he\u2019s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a \u2018witch hunt.\u2019 For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. \u2018If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,\u2019 Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. \u2026 Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.\u201d\n\nSchumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: \u201cSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress \u2018as required by law.\u2019\u201d\n\nGiuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: \u201cRudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats.

The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. \u2026 There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. \u2026 Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s treatment of migrants.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nCheck this out: Inside Fox News\u2019 polling \u2018nerdquarium\u2019 - LAT\n\nTeam Trump growing more concerned about Michigan - Politico\n\nRand Paul interfering with Liz Cheney Senate run - Politico\n\nAlaska Republicans cancel 2020 presidential primary - Anchorage Daily News\n\nAUDIBLE: *MIC DROP*\n\u201cSo many people seem to think that judges are just like politicians with robes.

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0accused President Trump of \"enriching\" himself and his family after he supposedly \"suggested\"\u00a0that Vice President Pence stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg on his recent trip to Ireland. Warren,\u00a0D-Mass., one of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump in 2020,\u00a0sent a letter to the State Department Thursday asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over all communications between his office and Pence or anyone else in the White House who was involved in planning the Ireland trip. Speaking from Dublin on Tuesday, Pence said his decision to stay at the hotel was \"logical,\" noting that he had family ties to the village. Some Democrats claimed taxpayer dollars were being used to\u00a0benefit\u00a0Trump's businesses, noting that Doonbeg was\u00a0nearly 200 miles away from where the vice president\u00a0conducted official meetings with Irish leaders. CHARLIE KIRK: ELIZABETH WARREN'S POPULARITY IS SOARING. HERE'S WHY REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE NERVOUS Warren wrote in her letter that reports of the agreement and \"the extent to which the president could potentially benefit financially from the taxpayer expenditures on this visit ...\u00a0are disturbing,\" and she asked the State Department who specifically knew of and approved the lodging request beforehand. Pence said he cleared the decision with the State Department and \"they approved us staying there\"\u00a0before booking his stay at the Trump hotel in Doonbeg, a move that Warren called\u00a0\"another example of what appears to be open corruption\" within the Trump administration. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the ranking member of the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, similarly\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Pence on Thursday asking for more information about the cost of his stay in Doonbeg, including comparable rates for hotels in Dublin. Peters wrote that he had \"serious concerns about wasteful expenditures and possible conflicts of interest related to taxpayer-funded travel by this administration,\" adding that he was \"even more troubled by the apparent conflict of interest in your decision to stay at a property owned by President Trump, which creates the risk that taxpayer funds are being used to directly profit the president.\" Pence's great-grandmother grew up in Doonbeg. The vice president\u00a0said he was \"pleased to have the opportunity to return to that family hometown.\" Pence Chief of Staff Marc Short insisted the vice president's office followed \"normal protocol\" to book the trip, but said Trump had made the \"suggestion.\" \"It's like when we went through the trip, it's like, well, he's going to Doonbeg because that's where the Pence family is from. It's like, 'Well, you should stay at my place,'\" Short said Tuesday.\u00a0\"It wasn't like a, 'You must.' It wasn't like, 'You have to.' It's a facility that could accommodate the team.\" Trump denied it was his suggestion at all, saying Wednesday he never spoke to the vice president about the matter. He added,\u00a0\"I don't suggest anything.\" Short said in a statement,\u00a0\"At no time did the president direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort, and any reporting to the contrary is false.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Air Force Two costs about $13,000 per hour when Pence is on board, The Associated Press reported. Pence personally covered the expenses of the trip for his\u00a0mother and sister, who were traveling with him, Short said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Sanders, I-Vt., has slipped from second place to third in a new poll, with\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0taking his spot among likely caucus-goers in Nevada. The poll, conducted by Monmouth University, showed Warren leading Sanders with 19 percent support compared to his 13 percent.\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden continued dominating the field, however, with 36 percent in Nevada, an early indicator of Democratic success during the primaries. The survey was the first Nevada poll released this cycle that meets the Democratic National Committee\u2019s criteria for qualifying for the debates. SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS Previous polling has shown Warren trailing Sanders as both push a more progressive message against the frontrunner and perceived moderate\u00a0Biden. While Biden led the field among \"moderate or conservative\" voters, \"very liberal\" voters, who made up about a quarter of likely caucus-goers,\u00a0supported Warren and Sanders with 27 and 26 percent respectively. According to polling, likely caucus-goers rated health care (41 percent) as their most important issue when thinking about a candidate. Environmental concerns (17 percent) and immigration (19 percent) as the top issues voters identified. Only 14 percent, however, said \"beating\" President Trump was their top priority. Trump has become such a negative symbol among\u00a0Democrats that many have cautioned against choosing a candidate based on other criteria. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PUSH FOR BREAKUP OF BIG TECH Others, like Jacobin Magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara, urged Democrats to push Biden to the left and force the party to endorse more progressive proposals. Among those proposals was \"Medicare for all\" which both Sanders and Warren have proposed as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act passed when Biden was Vice President.

      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren is having a media moment. A whole bunch of them, actually. From two glowing profiles to pundit praise, the Massachusetts senator is increasingly being touted as the main threat to Joe Biden. Any presidential candidate who rises in the polls starts getting good press. But there are two underlying reasons behind Warren's media surge. One, political reporters want a contest, not a Biden coronation. Simple as that. Two, many political journalists and commentators are more enamored of Warren's liberal politics. Biden is simply too moderate for them, too incremental in his approach. ARNON MISHKIN: DON'T COUNT ELIZABETH WARREN OUT Remember how most of the prognosticators predicted he would sink like a stone because he was too out of touch with the party's progressive wing? Having been embarrassed by Biden's dominance, they'd love the vindication of seeing him fade \u2014 and the wokeness of the Democrats not nominating a white male. Still, you have to credit Warren on several fronts. After a slow start, she is moving up on the basis of hard work. She is doing it with substance, a wonky, I-have-a-plan-for-that approach. And her success belies the fact that she\u2019s not a natural politician \u2014 she first ran for Senate at age 62\u2014\u00a0or a scintillating speaker. Even President Trump, who had written off the woman he insists on calling by a denigrating nickname, noted her progress by saying of Kamala Harris, \"Pocahontas is cleaning her clock.\" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Warren has a long way to go. The new Fox News poll has Biden at 32 percent, Bernie Sanders at 13 percent and Warren at 9 percent. But in a South Carolina poll, Biden now leads Warren 37 to 17 percent, with Bernie tied for fourth at 9 percent. Most of her gains have been at Sanders'\u00a0expense. Politico weighed in by reporting that Trump's reelection campaign is \"setting its sights on a new target,\"\u00a0Warren, who \"threatens to cut into the president\u2019s blue-collar base.\" ANDREW STEIN: JOE BIDEN STANDS FOR NOTHING EXCEPT JOE BIDEN (AND THAT OUGHT TO MAKE DEMS NERVOUS) Well, the campaign would be guilty of malpractice if it didn't prepare for Warren as a possible opponent. But to its credit, Politico gets on-the-record quotes from Trump pollster John McLaughlin, who says: \"Although our own early published polls and internal polls discounted Elizabeth Warren, her recent momentum in May and June in national and early caucus and primary states into a strong second place to a flat Joe Biden is a cause for our campaign's attention. Senator Warren's attacks on President Trump's policies need to be rebutted.\" The New York Times Magazine posted an amazingly positive profile yesterday, filled with such passages as: \"For her entire career, Warren's singular focus has been the growing fragility of America's middle class. She made the unusual choice as a law professor to concentrate relentlessly on data, and the data that alarms her shows corporate profits creeping up over the last 40 years while employees'\u00a0share of the pie shrinks ... \"As a presidential candidate, Warren has rolled out proposal after proposal to rewrite the rules again, this time on behalf of a majority of American families ... \"Her grand overarching ambition is to end America's second Gilded Age.\" The only notes of skepticism involve how well Warren can sell herself: \"She's still thinking through how she communicates her ideas with voters.\"\u00a0And when author Emily Bazelon asked how she felt running against her friend Bernie: \"'You know, I don't think of this as competing,' she responded. It was the least plausible thing she said to me.\" The New Yorker also does the big-picture profile, headlined: \"Can Elizabeth Warren Win it All?\"\u00a0The focus: \"Her plans to fight outsized wealth.\" Author Sheelah Kolhatkar said on \"Morning Joe\"\u00a0that Warren is \"slowly plodding away and winning people over,\"\u00a0in part by \"ignoring the identity politics, the social justice stuff.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Axios fans the flames with the headline \"Joe Biden has an Elizabeth Warren problem.\"\u00a0She is \"well-positioned to undermine Biden, win or lose ...\u00a0Biden's people are worried about her rise, and feel they caught a break in not having to face her in the first debate.\"\u00a0And: \"President Trump has told people he thought he killed her campaign with his 'Pocahontas'\u00a0smear and that he's surprised by her resurgence.\" It could be that this is a turning point for Warren overtaking Biden, or she could well remain back in the pack. What's clear is that she'll get an extra boost from a media establishment that likes her and her politics.",

Elizabeth Warren on Friday announced a new plan to ban private prisons, alleging the companies behind them\u00a0are \u201cwringing billions out of federal taxpayers\u201d and sacrificing safety to \u201cboost their bottom line.\u201d \u201cThe government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe -- not to use their punishment as an opportunity for profit. That\u2019s why today, I\u2019m proposing my plan to root out once and for all the profit incentives perverting our criminal and immigration systems,\u201d the populist two-term senator from Massachusetts said\u00a0as she unveiled her policy proposal. Warren noted that from 2000 to 2016, the private prison population grew five times faster than the overall prison population. And she highlighted that some 4,000 corporations currently make money off mass incarceration. SANDERS TAKES SWIPE AT WARREN The progressive senator, who\u2019s rising in the polls in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, argued that given the green light by President Trump\u2019s administration, \u201cprivate detention centers have made millions implementing Trump\u2019s cruel immigration policies, as the number of detained children quintupled in just a single year.\u201d Warren spotlighted that nearly three-quarters of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities. \u201cPrivate facilities have higher rates of assaults than federal prisons. They violate federal rules by putting incarcerated people into solitary confinement to fit more bodies in the building,\u201d she charged. \u201cThey impose forced labor on immigrants just to make a buck. Multiple detainees have committed suicide. And now, under Trump, babies are getting sick and dying from their detention centers.\u201d WARREN'S REBOUND: SENATOR REGAINS FOOTING IN POLLS Warren said she\u2019d ban private federal prisons and detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons and ICE have with private detention providers. \u201cAnd I will extend these bans to states and localities by conditioning their receipt of federal public safety funding on their use of public facilities,\u201d she added. Warren\u2019s plan would also stop contractors from charging service fees for essential services for inmates, such as phone calls, bank transfers, and health care. And her proposal would expand\u00a0oversight, transparency and enforcement of them. Warren\u2019s plan is the latest in a slew of detailed policy proposals she\u2019s rolled out since formally launching her presidential campaign in February.",

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0raked in $24.6\u00a0million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul. The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden \u2013\u00a0once the unrivaled front-runner \u2013\u00a0for the primary lead. While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling\u00a0$25.3 million in the third quarter. BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL But Warren's campaign cash number comes close \u2014\u00a0and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by\u00a0Biden\u00a0in the last quarter. Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls. The Massachusetts senator, who\u2019s produced one progressive policy proposal after another,\u00a0announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.\u201d \u201cTogether, we\u2019re building a movement that\u2019s going to put power back in the hands of the people,\u201d she pledged. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Warren\u2019s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter. Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million. Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million. President Trump\u2019s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign\u00a0announced that it\u00a0and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if\u00a0she reaches the general election, Warren touted her \"grassroots movement\" and highlighted \"that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.\" Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate\u2019s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign\u2019s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel\u00a0and ads. Fox News' Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.",

Warren got several questions in the first half-hour and demonstrated a finely honed sense of slamming corporate America. Too many big companies, she said, care only about profits and are quick to move jobs to Mexico, Canada or Asia. At another point, Warren declared she was \u201ccalling out the monopolists.\u201d The senator also gave a passionate answer on why she backs Medicare for All \u2014 but totally ducked the question about why it was all right to eliminate private insurance for 150 million Americans. Even when she had a second bite of the apple \u2014 complaining that insurance companies \u201csucked $23 billion in profits out of the system\u201d last year \u2014 there was no effort to pin her down on forcing people to give up their private coverage. That was a central weakness of the MSNBC approach. Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie asked bread-and-butter policy questions, but under severe time constraints, made only a couple of token efforts to press the candidates who ignored the thrust of their questions. O\u2019Rourke wouldn\u2019t answer on whether he supports a 70 percent tax rate, even when his fudge was pointed out. The moderators never really challenged the candidates with another viewpoint in the first hour. Holt and Guthrie didn\u2019t ask about limitations on late-term abortion. They didn\u2019t say, \"Hey, doesn\u2019t a country need some border enforcement?' They didn't say, \"Hey, are you really going to blow up private health insurance for an all-government program?\" The entire debate was safely conducted within the confines of liberal orthodoxy. (In the second hour Chuck Todd was more aggressive and wide-ranging, calling out Warren when she sidestepped his specific question on guns; pressing Klobuchar on gun confiscation, and raising the cost of fighting climate change. Rachel Maddow, a liberal opinion host, read scripted questions that were straightforward but also alone the lines of, \"Are you doing enough to mobilize black and Latino voters?\") The Democrats vied with each other on their passion to protect abortion rights, but couldn\u2019t match Warren, who said they can\u2019t rely on the courts and Congress needs to enshrine Roe v. Wade into federal law. On this and other issues, the candidates were literally playing to their base. There was virtually no effort to reach out to Republicans or independents who might not subscribe to the left-wing line. Some of them sounded like open-borders advocates or pretty close to it. There were only flashes of debate among the candidates, such as a dustup over illegal immigration between O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro, which became incomprehensible as they cited sections of various laws. I was mildly surprised there wasn\u2019t more Trump-bashing, beyond the occasional whacks. But the group had decided collectively it was more important to push their policies and introduce themselves to the television audience. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If there was a dark horse as a strong debater in Miami, it was Bill de Blasio, but unfortunately for him, even a majority of New Yorkers didn\u2019t want him to run. In fact, Gabbard\u2019s sister tweeted on her account: \u201cIt's clear who MSNBC wants to be president: Elizabeth Warren. They're giving her more time than all the other candidates combined.\u201d (This was literally untrue.) In part because of that boost, Warren was the winner on several counts. She was crisp and confident, had a consistent theme \u2014 corporations are ruining America \u2014 and no one took a shot at her. She projected heartfelt anguish on the question about school shootings. Warren lucked out in the lottery, with the other top-tier candidates \u2014 Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris \u2014 slated for Thursday night. And she made the most of that opportunity.",

      "content": " Elizabeth Warren boasts she has a \u201cplan for that\u201d -- but it turns out she doesn\u2019t always have an answer for questions at the core of her White House bid. Warren, one of the leading Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, spoke to reporters Monday after an event at Roosevelt High school in Des Moines, Iowa, when the topic of \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d was raised. During the media gaggle, Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy asked Warren: \u201cHow should caucus-goers be confident it is possible to pay for 'Medicare-for-all\u2019 at all if the leading Democratic candidate still needs a few more weeks to tell them how it is going to get paid for?\u201d In response, Warren replied: \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you ask me that when the plan is out.\u201d POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE She did not give any further details. Warren has been criticized in recent weeks for not explaining exactly how she would cover the costs for her ambitious plan, with two fellow 2020 contenders taking issue with her during last week\u2019s debate. After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate in Ohio last Tuesday whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health0care proposal, the progressive senator didn\u2019t specifically answer, instead pledging, \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.\u201d Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who\u2019s soared in polling in recent months and has been considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden. ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued, \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything\u2014 except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this 'Medicare-for-all\u2019 plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,\u2019 understand what that means: It\u2019s 'Medicare for all who can afford it,\u2019 and that\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got. 'Medicare-for-all\u2019 is the gold standard.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren. The Minnesota Democrat said, \u201cAt least [Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up, and I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her 'Medicare-for-all\u2019 plan through Congress, Klobuchar said: \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cOn the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it\u2019s awfully important to be straightforward with them,\u201d Biden noted. \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Brooke Singman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren once railed against class warfare and defended the rich in an op-ed she penned way back in 2004 -- a column that underscores\u00a0her striking transformation over the years into a leading antagonist of the\u00a0so-called \"1 percent.\" The op-ed, titled \u201cThe Vital Middle,\u201d was published on July 16, 2004, as part of a special report from The American Prospect on then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. ELISA MARTINEZ: IF WARREN\u00a0UNDERSTOOD NATIVE AMERICANS, SHE'D KNOW SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK The Massachusetts Democrat, who was a Harvard Law School professor at the time, used the piece to offer advice to Kerry. Some of the viewpoints are familiar\u2014like going after corporate welfare\u00a0and pushing health insurance for all\u2014but others\u00a0seem far more moderate than Warren\u2019s current attitude toward the wealthy. \u201cIt is not about class warfare,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThe rich are not the enemy\u2014in fact, most of us would like to be rich.\u201d \u201cCorruption and misplaced priorities are the enemy. And the poor are not the only ones who have problems, so don\u2019t talk as if they are the only ones who deserve compassion,\u201d she continued. \u201cAmericans risk fracturing into disparate groups, jealously guarding whatever benefits we have gained, pursuing separate identities instead of the country\u2019s shared identity as part of one great American middle class,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat makes us nervous. Lead from the middle, because a middle-focused agenda helps all Americans, including our poor and our wealthy.\u201d In the piece, Warren went on to share somewhat of a Republican talking point -- blasting \"welfare cheats,\" while also maintaining her familiar stance of fighting against \"corporate welfare\" that favors \"well-connected mega-businesses and political friends.\" \"Stand for fair play--not handouts, not special interests--just plain, old-fashioned, everyone-plays-by-the-same- rules,\" she wrote. \"Reject welfare cheats, corporate cheats, or cheats of any other stripe. Speak to us of fundamental fairness, and we will believe again in what we can be.\" But fast-forward to the present\u2014and Warren, who is\u00a0now a leader in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, has changed her tune. One of her core policies is a wealth tax -- a 2 percent\u00a0annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million, and a 3 percent\u00a0tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion. She said during last week's Democratic primary debate\u00a0that \"taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does,\" and added that \"the rich are not like you and me.\" Warren sharply criticized the wealthy at the debate, saying \"the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.\" Warren critics cited the 2004 op-ed as a sign of inconsistency. \"Yet more evidence of Elizabeth Warren being dishonest and disingenuous about her record? What a shock,\" a Trump campaign official said. \"'Welfare cheats' is a Republican talking point that does violence to people--particularly communities of color--who have been failed by the corporate-dominated policies that Senator Warren apparently had an epiphany about not that long ago,\" a Democratic strategist told Fox News. \"We deserve a nominee who's been committed to systematic change for their entire career.\" When she announced her 2020 candidacy, Warren also said it was time to \"fight back\" against the wealthy. Her campaign has not responded to a Fox News request for comment on the 2004 piece. Warren, meanwhile, would qualify as wealthy herself, with a\u00a0reported net worth of $12 million.",

Elizabeth Warren\u00a0devolved into chants from competing sides Thursday as protesters interrupted the senator -- and her supporters tried to drown out their message. Warren's appearance at Clark Atlanta University also included Rep.\u00a0Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., who recently endorsed her home-state senator's\u00a0White House run. \u201cFighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,\u201d Warren began, drawing applause and\u00a0cheers.\u00a0\u201cAs a white woman I will never fully understand the discrimination, the pain, the harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin.\" Suddenly some protesters, later identified as\u00a0a group backing school choice,\u00a0began chanting. \u201cOur children, our choice!,\" they shouted, with Warren trying to speak over them. AYANNA PRESSLEY, IN BREAK FROM THE 'SQUAD,' BACKS WARREN FOR PRESIDENT Warren supporters then tried to drown out the protesters by\u00a0chanting \"Warren!\" \"Warren!\" The protesters then countered with \u201cDream big, our choice!\u201d \u201cAlright, so let\u2019s talk a little,\u201d Warren said, attempting to engage with the dissenters.

Pressley, who had introduced Warren, eventually returned to the stage. \u201cI want to say something,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cNo one is here to quiet you -- at least not this black woman who knows what it is when people try to put me in a corner and tell me to be quiet.\u201d \u201cYou are welcome here,\u201d Pressley continued. \u201cThe senator is here to talk about the contributions, fighters like you, have made to history so in this moment, there are many people that do not know this story because we have rendered as a historical footnote in history so I am going to appeal to you to not dishonor that history.\u201d She said, \u201cWe are grateful for your activism and your voice and you are welcome here and we would love to convene after this about the issue that you are here to stoke our consciousness about.\u201d \u201cBut when these women have been ignored this long, this is their moment and we are going to hear the story,\u201d Pressley concluded. She was met by loud applause and a standing ovation. The crowd then started to chant \u201cWarren!\u201d and the presidential hopeful continued her speech without\u00a0further interruptions. It was not immediately known if the protesters actually convened after the speech to discuss the issue they were chanting about\u00a0with Warren and Pressley. After the event, one protester told Fox News she was part of a parent activist group from Camden, N.J., that attended\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s rally in Atlanta. She said it was the group\u2019s first public protest and they were hoping to stage more demonstrations at events of other candidates. The group, comprised mostly of parents and caretakers fed up with \u201cfailing public schools,\u201d said they oppose Warren\u2019s stance on charter schools, saying they are \"pro school choice.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Pressley announced earlier this month that she is backing Warren for president \u2014 breaking from her fellow members of the \"Squad,\u201d who support Sen.

I can\u2019t wait to call her our president.\u201d Attracting Pressley's\u00a0endorsement was a coup for Warren, as Pressley and the others \"Squad\" members attract media attention and have helped set the Democrats' agenda for the 2020 election.

Then when\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0weaponized the taunt in a deadly effective way, Warren sought to double down, releasing a DNA report that said she was, in fact, part Native American.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is where it gets really funny. Having failed to do its homework, her campaign ended up bragging about a portion of native blood in which only the most committed bigot could be interested. She had less Indian ancestry than the average white American.\n\n\n*sad trombone*\n\n\nTribal leaders were furious, Republicans were splitting their sides with laughter and Democrats concerned for their 2020 chances were watching through latticed fingers at the implosion.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, with all of the subtlety and nuance of\u00a0Clark Griswold\u2019s Christmas display, Warren is sucking up to minority voters knowing as she does that like\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0in 2016 and several white progressives in 2018 primaries that the readership of\u00a0The Nation is not a sufficient base in a party that is substantially and increasingly not white.\u00a0\n\n\nIn a party enamored with\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0and\u00a0Stacey Abrams,\u00a0Warren looks hopelessly out of step. Democrats may very well choose a person of color as their 2020 nominee, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that they would pick a white person with racial baggage. (Sorry,\u00a0Mike Bloomberg.)\n\n\nNow, Warren has seen her stock tumble so far that she may one day be in good shape for a \u201ccomeback kid\u201d narrative, but not yet. And that really is the problem for Democrats: Their field will be full of zombies.\u00a0\n\n\nWarren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00a0Julian Castro, Colorado Gov.\u00a0John Hickenlooper, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Sanders and others have enough resources and can garner enough media attention to run for a long, long time.\u00a0\n\n\nEven now a phalanx of Democratic staffers fresh from the 2018 field of battle are surging into early states for these candidates. There\u2019s plenty of money and a field so large no one can really be discredited so early. If\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke\u00a0is a thing \u2013 and he is \u2013 who is to tell a sitting senator, governor or billionaire former mayor of New York they don\u2019t have a chance?\u00a0\n\n\nBut as the groan-inducing efforts to prop up Warren\u2019s floundering campaign illustrates, this all comes at a cost.\n\n\nIn 2012 Republicans were quite indulgent with themselves when it came to choosing a nominee, pausing over several odd lots, sometimes more than once, before grudgingly, half-heartedly accepting\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0as their man. This happened for a lot of reasons, most of all a misunderstanding among GOP voters about how hard it would be to defeat and incumbent president.\n\n\nBut it was also made worse by billionaire Republican donors and the consultants that milked them propping up doomed candidates and generally avoiding the hard arithmetic of primary politics.\u00a0\n\n\nRepublicans should not kid themselves. Few incumbent presidents have faced the challenges that Trump does.\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0had a pretty hard pull in 2004, but you\u2019d probably have to go back to his dad to find an incumbent with a to-do box as full as Trump\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he is nowhere near as vulnerable as Democrats would like to think. He will be a tough out and if the Blue Team has a bunch of zombies roaming around snacking on the brains of an engaged but uncertain electorate, it will cost them.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: ACTION HERO\u00a0\n\n\u201cThose politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature. They have with great propriety, considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand\u2026\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70\n\nTIME OUT: \u2018PIOUS, JUST, HUMANE, TEMPERATE AND SINCERE\u2019\u00a0\n\nOn this day in 1799, the father of our country,\u00a0George Washington, died at age 67 from a throat infection and the misinformed medical treatment of his time.\u00a0Mount Vernon: \u201cAt five in the afternoon [he] sat up from bed, dressed, and walked over to his chair.

Kyl sent Ducey a letter Wednesday announcing his resignation effective at the end of this month. \u2018When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to serve,\u2019 Kyl wrote. \u2018I have concluded that it would be best if I resign so that your new appointee can begin the new term with all other Senators in January 2018 and can serve a full two (potentially four) years.\u2019 Ducey's office said in a statement that the governor will appoint another replacement in the near future. Two prospects are GOP Rep.\u00a0Martha McSally, who lost a campaign for Arizona's other Senate seat earlier this year, and\u00a0Kirk Adams, Ducey's former chief of staff and a former speaker of the Arizona House.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd he isn\u2019t sold on McSally -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cArizona Gov. Doug Ducey has lost enthusiasm for appointing Rep. Martha McSally, a fellow Republican, to the Senate in recent weeks even as Republican leaders in Washington have championed her. \u2026 But her stock has fallen in the eyes of the governor, according to two people familiar with his thinking, as Ducey approaches one of the most significant decisions of his political career. Ducey\u2019s choice would affect not only the future of the Senate but the 2020 elections in an increasingly competitive battleground state. It could also impact his relationship with Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0(R-Ky.), a McSally advocate, as well as other party leaders who want to see more Republican women in Congress.\u00a0There are several reasons McSally\u2019s chances have faded, according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private conversations. One is a post-election memo her campaign strategists provided to The Washington Post last month, which attributed her defeat in November to external factors. Among them\u2026 There are also concerns about McSally\u2019s standing among Republican donors.\u201d\n\nCOHEN CALLS OUT TRUMP\u00a0\nNPR:\u00a0\u201cMichael Cohen, President Trump's onetime lawyer and fixer, says his former boss knew it was wrong to order hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who allege they had affairs with Trump \u2014 but he directed Cohen to do it anyway to help his election chances. Cohen also said in an interview with ABC News aired Friday that the president's repeated assertions that Cohen is lying about the payments and other aspects of his work for Trump were false. \u2018He knows the truth. I know the truth. Others know the truth,\u2019 Cohen said. \u2018The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.\u2019\u00a0Cohen pleaded guilty to financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. His ABC interview appeared less than 48 hours after a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced him to three years in prison and imposed around $2 million in financial penalties. It appears to be part of an effort by Cohen to rehabilitate his reputation, which is in tatters and disparaged by people on both sides of the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nGiuliani not concerned about Cohen\u2019s allegations -\u00a0Market Watch:\u00a0\u201cRudy Giuliani\u00a0bashed President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Friday, after Cohen said in a televised interview that Trump had directed him to make hush-money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the former New York mayor, now a lawyer for Trump, called Cohen\u2019s allegations \u2018much ado about nothing\u2019 and sought to minimize Cohen\u2019s admitted violation of campaign-finance law. \u2018Whether they talked about it or not, their talking about it can\u2019t make it a crime,\u2019 Giuliani said about the hush-money payments. \u2026 In discussing Cohen\u2019s admission, Giuliani told the Journal: \u2018It\u2019s campaign finance, my God.\u2019\u00a0\u2018Everybody pays a fine to the [Federal Election Commission] that is in politics. You can\u2019t follow all the rules.\u2019 The payments were found to be in violation of campaign-finance laws, since they were made in an attempt to influence the election. Giuliani also made comments to the Daily Beast about the violations, saying \u2018nobody got killed, nobody got robbed.\u2019\u201d\n\nHOUSE SCHEDULE IS \u2018SUBJECT TO CHANGE\u2019\nRoll Call:\u00a0\u201cHouse Majority Leader\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0stated the obvious on Thursday when he noted that the chamber\u2019s schedule for next week remains \u2018fluid and subject to change.\u2019 Outside of the big remaining item of business \u2014 a deal to extend government funding for nine departments and assorted agencies amid the congressional standoff with President Donald Trump over funding for a border wall \u2014 there is a dwindling list of legislative business for the chamber to attend to before the adjourning of the 115th Congress. The House conducted its final vote of the week early Thursday and as McCarthy and Minority Whip\u00a0Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., assembled on the floor to discuss the week ahead, the schedule McCarthy laid out reflected the uncertainty of when a spending deal might be considered, as well as the lack of a definitive plan on considering anything else.\u201d\n\nPelosi vs. Hoyer is another fight to watch -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cIn her quest to become speaker, Representative\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0of California appears ready once again to sacrifice the higher ambitions of her No. 2, Representative\u00a0Steny H. Hoyer, and Mr. Hoyer is not shy about expressing his objections. \u2018She\u2019s not negotiating for me,\u2019 he snapped the other day, referring to Ms. Pelosi\u2019s deal with a group of House Democratic rebels to impose term limits on the leadership \u2014 and not just herself \u2014 of four years. As Democrats prepare to assume control of the House, the Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex. The friction goes back decades. The last time Democrats took power from Republicans, in 2006, Ms. Pelosi backed then-Representative\u00a0John P. Murtha\u00a0in his effort to oust Mr. Hoyer from the majority leader\u2019s slot. The putsch failed spectacularly, but she\u2019s ready to handcuff him again with a deal on term limits that, if approved, would most likely usher both lawmakers from their leadership suites by early 2023, along with the No. 3 Democrat, Representative James E. Clyburn\u00a0of South Carolina.\u201d\n\nWALKER SIGNS LEGACY BILL STICKING IT TO DEMS\nAP:\u00a0\u201cWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed a sweeping package of Republican-written legislation Friday that restricts early voting and weakens the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general, brushing aside complaints that he is enabling a brazen power grab and ignoring the will of voters. Walker signed the bills just 24 days before he leaves office during an event at a state office building in Green Bay, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) from his Capitol office that has frequently been a target for protesters.\u00a0The Republican governor and one-time GOP presidential candidate downplayed bipartisan criticism that they amount to a power grab that will stain his legacy. Speaking for 20 minutes and using charts to make his points, Walker detailed all of the governor\u2019s powers, including a strong veto authority, that will not change while defending the measures he signed as improving transparency, stability and accountability.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nDes Moines Register 2020 Iowa poll out this weekend -\u00a0Des Moines Register\n\nTrump inauguration spending under investigation\u00a0-\u00a0WSJ\n\nChris Christie\u00a0withdraws from running for chief of staff\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nJoe Lieberman\u00a0tapped to do damage control for China\u2019s ZTE\u00a0-\u00a0Politico\n\nInspector general report shows complexity of recovering Strzok, Page texts\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo\u00a0\n\nJudge rules to uphold Maine\u2019s ranked-choice voting\u00a0-\u00a0[Portland] Press Herald\u00a0\n\nAUDIBLE:\u00a0UN CAF\u00c9 POR FAVOR\n\n\u201cEsta cafetera seguir\u00e1 sirviendo caf\u00e9 cubano para constituyentes en\u00a0#DC.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tweet\u00a0from\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., posted with a picture of her giving her successor, Democratic Rep.-elect\u00a0Donna Shalala, a \u201ccafetera\u201d machine to make Cuban-style coffee for constituents who visit the South Florida lawmaker\u2019s Washington office.\n\nBEST OF JOURNALISM 2018\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s time again for our annual year-end edition saluting the year\u2019s best journalism, and we need your input.

Elizabeth Warren, a top Democrat in the 2020 presidential elections, said President Trump is a white supremacist and has done \u201ceverything in his power to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country. Warren made the comments in an interview with The New York Times, which was published early Thursday. The remarks came after two mass shootings last weekend that resulted in 31 deaths. Democrats have placed the blame on Trump\u2019s rhetoric for the shooting. Beto O\u2019Rourke also labeled the president a white supremacist. Trump has said several times in the past that he is \u201cthe least racist person\u201d in the world. He called for unity after the shootings and visited El Paso and Dayton on Wednesday to comfort El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, told The Hill it is irresponsible for these Democrats to assign blame after the shootings. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that \u201cany group of hate\u201d concerns him. \"Whether it's white supremacy, whether it's any other kind of supremacy. Whether it's Antifa,\" he said, according to Axios. \"Whether it's any group of hate.\"",

Dick Gruber, mayor of the northwest city in Iowa, announced this week that he is backing former Vice President Joe Biden for the 2020, rather than closest rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The endorsement was\u00a0reported by The Washington Examiner, and was announced in an email to reporters from the Biden campaign. WARREN SAYS SHE'S OPEN TO HALTING DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS \u201cIowans know that Joe Biden is the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump next November, and that\u2019s why leaders from across the state are coming forward to proudly show their support,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. The nod is likely to raise some eyebrows from Trump supporters, who have delighted in President Trump\u2019s frequent mocking of Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d in reference to her past claims to have Native American ancestry. Warren apologized to Native groups\u00a0this year after she touted a DNA test that her campaign said backed her claims to have Native American heritage. \"Like anyone who has been honest with themselves, I know I have made mistakes,\" Warren said. \"I am sorry for the harm I have caused.\" But it\u2019s an issue that has continued to dog her, particularly as Trump has repeatedly used the \u201cPocahontas\u201d moniker for years -- even though his opponents have alleged that it is a racist slur. \u201cWho? Pocahontas?\u201d Trump said when asked about Warren in 2016. When told by reporters that the term was \u201cvery offensive,\u201d he responded: \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d before immediately saying it again. JOE BIDEN PREDICTS REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE AN 'EPIPHANY' ONCE TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE In August this year, he said his only regret was that he may have attacked her too early, and said that more attacks could be coming down the pipeline.. \u201cLike, Elizabeth Warren --\u00a0I did the Pocahontas thing,\u201d Trump told supporters. \u201cI hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago, I should\u2019ve waited.

      "content": " CONCORD, N.H. --\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0reiterated her strong support for the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Warren, who was in New Hampshire\u00a0Wednesday to file to place\u00a0her name on the Granite State's presidential\u00a0primary ballot, also took another shot at former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg, who\u2019s taking steps towards jumping into the Democratic\u00a0race. And she told Fox News that a\u00a0potential entry this week by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick wouldn\u2019t complicate her own White House bid. FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Warren \u2013 \u00a0one of the first\u00a0Democratic White House hopefuls to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment --\u00a0told reporters after filing that \u201cI believe it is appropriate for this impeachment inquiry to go forward. I think it should have happened earlier, but we're here now.\u00a0Let\u2019s do it.\u201d When asked if she had been watching the testimony from the televised public hearing, Warren said: \u201cI just haven\u2019t been able to catch up with it. Fortunately, I will catch up tonight.\u201d If the Democratic-controlled House impeaches the president, the GOP-led Senate would then hold a trial which could lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office. Such a trial would probably keep Warren and the other Senate Democrats running for president off the campaign trail during the weeks leading up to the first nominating contests\u00a0in Iowa and New Hampshire. \"I have Constitutional responsibilities,\" Warren said. \"I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. And if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Warren told Fox News that she hadn\u2019t talked with Patrick in recent days and said \u201cno\u201d when asked if the fellow Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s potential entry into the race would complicate her own campaign. When asked\u00a0about Patrick's\u00a0years working at investment firm Bain Capital, Warren answered \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize other Democrats. I\u2019m here to talk about why I\u2019m running for president.\u201d Patrick is likely to announce his candidacy\u00a0on Thursday by video or social media, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. He would then travel to neighboring New Hampshire on Friday the last day for candidates to file to place their names on the primary ballot. Patrick isn\u2019t the only Democrat likely to launch a campaign at this late date in the primary cycle. Bloomberg has placed his name on\u00a0the presidential primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas in recent days as he moves closer to launching a White House run. I believe that what our election should be about is grassroots. How you build something all across New Hampshire, all across the country, and that we really shouldn\u2019t have elections that are about billionaires calling all the shots, whether they\u2019re reaching into their pockets to fund their own elections or whether they\u2019re counting on getting other people to run,\" said Warren, who\u2019s been critical of Bloomberg in recent days. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that billionaires go on TV and cry,\" she added. \"Other billionaires encourage their billionaire buddies to jump into the race.\" Warren may have been referring to billionaire Omega Advisors\u00a0CEO Leon Cooperman, who lamented during an interview on CNBC last week that\u00a0Trump is dividing and polarizing Americans while Warren is pushing \u201cIdiocy.\u201d Like many other billionaires, Cooperman has heavily criticized Warren\u2019s proposed tax on the richest Americans, calling it a \u201cbankrupt concept.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters \u2013 is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS\u2019 PLAN: ECONOMISTS The comments come\u00a0amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism.\u00a0It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year,\u00a0when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren\u00a0reportedly said, \"I am a capitalist to my bones.\" Sanders explained he is not a capitalist\u00a0because he\u00a0\"will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.\u201d A Gallup poll this year\u00a0found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing. The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and the Green New Deal. Meanwhile, two economists at the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under\u00a0Sanders'\u00a0plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020. Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0that \u201cwith the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a\u00a0much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes.\"\u00a0The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan. The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent\u00a0levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent\u00a0for fortunes in excess of $10 billion. Sanders vowed to go further than\u00a0Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires\u2019 fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren. Sanders\u2019 plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent\u00a0on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders\u2019 tax rates don\u2019t top out until 8 percent\u00a0for the richest households.

Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. \u2026 The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday\u2019s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0went for long stretches without surfacing\u2026 Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar, Buttigieg shone through -\u00a0National Review:\u00a0\u201cThe October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.\u201d\n\nSanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash -\u00a0AP:\u00a0\u201cBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don\u2019t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They\u2019ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal.\u00a0With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden\u2019s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.\u201d\n\nSquad to endorse Sanders -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cThree members of the so-called \u2018Squad\u2019 of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a \u2018Bernie\u2019s Back\u2019 rally designed to generate excitement for the senator\u2019s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep.\u00a0Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. \u2026 The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2026\u201d\n\nSteyer spending stupendous -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cBillionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer\u00a0appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 21\n\nTIME OUT: AN INVENTOR\u2019S SLAP SHOT\nSmithsonian: \u201cInvented by\u00a0Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his\u00a0first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. \u2018At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,\u2019 says Frank Zamboni, the inventor\u2019s grandson and now president of the\u00a0Zamboni Company.\u00a0\u2018He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins\u2026 Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.\u2019 Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada\u2014the place of snow and ice\u2014but in Southern California\u2014the land of sun and fun. \u2026 As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028.2 points (\u2191\u00a00.8 point from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a026.4 points (\u2191 1.4 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a013.4 points (\u2193\u00a01.2 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a06.2 points (\u2191 0.6 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.4 points (\u2193\u00a00.2 points\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, Fox News, IBD, Monmouth University and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042.2 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a054 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-11.8 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.4 points\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 39% approve - 57% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be \u2018reassessed at some point.\u2019 The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his son \u2014 potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.\u201d\n\nGallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office -\u00a0Gallup:\u00a0\u201cPublic opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.\u201d\n\nStaffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials\u2019 actions around Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower\u2019s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers\u2019 inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.\u201d\n\nMulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cIn late May, acting White House chief of staff\u00a0Mick Mulvaney\u00a0organized a meeting that stripped control of the country\u2019s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those \u2018three amigos,\u2019 as they came to call themselves \u2014 diplomats\u00a0Gordon Sondland\u00a0and\u00a0Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary\u00a0Rick Perry\u00a0\u2014 has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.\u201d\n\nBEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL\nWYMT:\u00a0\u201cThe Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor\u00a0Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General\u00a0Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee\u00a0John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. \u2026 The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.\u201d\n\nSecond debate was heavy with personal attacks -\u00a0Louisville Courier Journal: \u201cRepublican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. \u2026 The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nPoll shows high confidence in Supreme Court\u00a0-\u00a0Annenberg Public Policy Center\n\nAUDIBLE: THANKS?\n\n\u201c[Amy\u00a0Klobuchar] had some smart answers.

That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.\n\n\n[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it\u2019s true. But our Constitution just wouldn\u2019t allow for it. The government can\u2019t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there\u2019s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I\u2019m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]\n\n\n\u201cI have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen\u2026one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and\u2026two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition\u2026having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that\u2019s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it\u2019s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he\u2019d give his enemies the pleasure.]\n\n\n\u201cI miss Chris\u2019 input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious.

BRADLEY\nHuffPo:\u00a0\u201cA man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones.\u00a0Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 \u2018after a long illness bravely borne\u2019 according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. \u2018Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!\u2019 stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included \u2018knocking\u2019 against the coffin\u2019s lid. \u2026 Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley\u2019s voice begins to sing: \u2018Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.\u2019 His daughter\u00a0Andrea Bradley\u00a0told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago \u2014 and that no one really knew about it other than her brother\u00a0Jonathan\u00a0and her nephew,\u00a0Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley\u2019s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank.

The debates, moderated in kindly, kid-glove fashion have been snooze fests. The polls have been steady for months. Ho hum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the front-runner has neither embraced the trash-talking pugilism some Democrats say is necessary to confront the incumbent president, nor has he embraced any of the sweeping, salvific-sounding policy positions his less experienced competitors glommed onto in the opening weeks of the race.\n\n\nBiden is selling moderation and predictability just at the moment when the political class \u2013 practitioners and journalists \u2013 had decided that everything has changed.\u00a0\n\n\nBiden\u2019s ordinariness as a political figure is an affront to the central lesson many in this world took from 2016 that the old world has been burned away. Biden\u2019s candidacy and success to this point have been strong arguments for the position that things aren\u2019t nearly as different in the Trump era as many have imagined them to be.\n\n\nBut what if Monmouth isn\u2019t an outlier, as the Biden campaign argues, but is, in fact, a harbinger of things to come?\u00a0\n\n\nIf that poll is on the money, then Biden\u2019s candidacy is already kaput.\u00a0\n\n\nBeing the consensus choice for a party\u2019s nomination relies on the presence of\u2026\u00a0consensus. There will be no O\u2019Rourke-ian existential journey nor any Buttigieg-ian quiet persistence if Biden really does slip from the top spot. Instead, the same party establishment that has sustained Biden would turn on him sharply.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Biden\u2019s former boss,\u00a0Barack Obama, would let \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d stagger on in a doomed effort without at least applying some considerable, quiet pressure to call it quits.\n\n\nWarren\u2019s enthusiastic supporters, both inside and outside of journalism, should therefore be worried about succeeding too soon. No matter how many puff pieces about the ways in which the party establishment or Wall Street or whomever is warming up to Warren, smart Democrats know the hurdles she would face as a general election candidate.\n\n\nIt is possible that she could beat\u00a0Donald Trump, but her far out positions and angry rhetoric of class warfare also create the possibility of a catastrophic wipeout that would hurt Democrats up and down the ballot.\n\n\nWarren looks a lot like her fellow senator\u00a0Ted Cruz\u00a0did in 2016. She\u2019s checking a lot of the right boxes for party activists but is struggling to outrun the notion that nominating her not only would reduce chances for success on the presidential level but also carry with it more profound dangers for the party.\n\n\nIf Biden doesn\u2019t like having the bullseye on his back as the front-runner, neither would Warren enjoy it. It seems improbable that the more moderate majority of Democrats would not rally to another candidate in the face of such a threat. And even before the forces of normalcy could gather, Sanders would surely train his fire more directly on his colleague from the state next door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s why those folks polling at 3 percent or 5 percent keep hanging around. If Biden really does crack up, his votes aren\u2019t going to Warren or Sanders, there would instead be a reinvigoration of the race and a chance for another moderate to rise.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: BIG BLOOMERS\n\n\u201cThe door ought to be equally open to all; and I trust, for the credit of human nature, that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of State legislation\u2026\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 36\n\nTIME OUT: MAKE PIE, NOT WAR\nSmithsonian: \u201cIn the early 1900s, the United States was at war\u2014over pie. On one side were the traditionalists, who saw pie as \u2018an article of necessity in every household as much as the bed and cook stove,\u2019 according to a\u00a0Chicago Daily Tribune\u00a0report in 1899. On the other side were the food reformers, who wanted to break this unhealthy and corrupting habit. \u2018Pie really is an American evil,\u2019\u00a0Kate Masterson\u00a0wrote in the New York Times\u00a0in 1902. \u2026 By the turn of the century, Americans were eating more apple pie than any other variety. Apples, first brought to the continent by the colonists, grew well across large swaths of the country and could be stored through the winter, unlike most other fresh fruits. The phrase \u2018as American as apple pie\u2019 would not be coined until a 1924\u2026 But the idea was already so deeply ingrained that pie eating became a way for the country\u2019s newest arrivals \u2026 to assimilate.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nAverage approval:\u00a041.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a054.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-12.6 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 0.8 points\n\n[Average includes: Monmouth University: 41% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 56% disapprove; Gallup: 41% approve - 54% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The allegations are consistent with others made over the years that relatives of Biden have sought to enrich themselves off of his public service. But they go further, representing the first explicit claims that\u00a0James Biden\u00a0offered to have the former vice president use his clout to further private business interests.\u00a0The allegations come in sworn declarations made by executives at firms suing Biden\u2019s brother that were filed in federal court on Friday.

Health care has emerged as a fault line in the Democratic primary debate, with Biden calling for building upon President\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement while other leading candidates, including Sens.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0(Vt.) and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(Mass.), advocate for a Medicare-for-all single-payer plan. In his 60-second spot, Biden highlights the importance to his family of having had health insurance at key moments as well as the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 while he was vice president.\u00a0\u2018The fact of the matter is, health care is personal to me. Obamacare is personal to me,\u2019 Biden says, as a picture is shown of Obama\u2026 Biden does not mention any of his Democratic rivals by name in his ad.\u201d\n\nDrucker: Warren\u2019s base not buying electability argument -\u00a0WashEx:\u00a0\u201cTo some degree, Warren is a beneficiary of the Trump phenomenon. The conventional media narrative about the populist Republican in 2016 was that his sharp tongue and hawkish position on immigration, among other issues, rendered him unelectable. He won, capturing three states a GOP nominee had not won in decades, plus battleground Florida. In Iowa and Ohio, two other swing states, Trump routed. That outcome is buoying Warren supporters amid naysayers and some polling data suggesting she might be a weak nominee. \u2018No one knows who can win,\u2019 said\u00a0Sheri Smith, a Warren supporter in her early 50s who is on disability. \u2018I don\u2019t think you know; I don\u2019t think I know and I don\u2019t think anybody on Sunday morning really knows.\u2019\u201d\n\nSore losers in debate derby grouse at DNC -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cWith the deadline to qualify for next month\u2019s third round of Democratic presidential debates closing in, the Democratic National Committee is facing an angry chorus of criticism from the candidates not likely to make the cut. At issue is the DNC\u2019s criteria for the contenders to take part in the prime-time showdown, including contributions from 130,000 individual donors and reaching at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls. \u2018The DNC\u2019s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,\u2019 charged Sen.\u00a0Michael Bennet\u00a0of Colorado \u2013 a lower-tier White House contender who is all but certain not to qualify for the third round. Montana Gov.\u00a0Steve Bullock, who also needs a miracle to qualify by the end-of-Wednesday deadline, argued that \u2018these DNC debate rules have turned this primary into the \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 \u2014 each step of this seems to be all about getting donors.\u2019\u201d\n\nYang predicts he will double campaign cash haul in third quarter -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cDemocratic presidential candidate\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0says he believes he will double his campaign cash haul when he reports his fundraising figures for the third quarter of this year, contending that his White House bid \u2018is catching.\u2019 \u2018We are going to raise more than twice as much money in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter, at a time when many other campaigns are starting to shrink,\u2019 Yang told Fox News. The tech entrepreneur from New York, once viewed by many observers as the longest of long-shot hopefuls seeking the Democratic nomination, was interviewed after unveiling his climate change plan during a campaign swing in New Hampshire. \u2026 Yang brought in $2.8 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising -- a respectable figure for a lower-tier presidential contender but far short of frontrunners' much more substantial hauls.\u201d\n\nOBAMA ENGAGES ON REDISTRICTING FIGHT\u00a0\nFox News:\u00a0\u201cFormer President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0is back in the political arena, announcing a new initiative to combat partisan gerrymandering \u2014 though Republicans say the efforts are really about helping Democrats. The \u2018Redistricting U\u2019 program, which is part of the \u2018All on the Line\u2019 campaign, aims to recruit and train individuals to take up the fight against drawing congressional districts based on partisan interests. \u2018Training is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2014 from my 2008 campaign until now,\u2019 Obama tweeted Monday. \u2018And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U.\u2019\u00a0Republicans, though, have accused Democrats of making it sound like they want fairness \u2014 when in reality they are hoping to place their party in a better position. \u2026 \u2018Redistricting U\u2019 was created in February after Obama merged his Organizing for Action group with former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s National Redistricting Action Fund.\u201d\n\nDEMS PITCH SHORT-TERM FUNDING BILL\u00a0\nCNBC:\u00a0\u201cDemocrats are considering the possibility of passing a short-term funding bill to keep the government running after Sept. 30. During a caucus conference call on Friday, Majority Leader\u00a0Steny Hoyer\u00a0raised the specter of a stop-gap measure that lasts through Nov. 22 in order to prevent a government shutdown, according to a person briefed on the talks. Another person suggested a more likely date could be Dec. 6. Politico was the first to report on the discussions. Lawmakers are currently on summer recess and will not return to Washington until Sept. 9. Floating a so-called continuing resolution is an acknowledgement that Congress simply will not have enough time to pass all 12 spending bills before the end of the fiscal year, one of the sources said. \u2026 So far, the House has passed 10 appropriations bills. The Senate has not passed any, as the Republican-led chamber waited on President Donald Trump to strike a deal with Democrats on top-line spending numbers. Trump signed that agreement early this month.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nFederal Election Commission lapses into shutdown mode after commission calls quits\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo\n\nHalf a year on, poll shows Northam rebounding from blackface scandal\u00a0-\u00a0WTOP\n\nJustice\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u00a0makes first public appearance Monday after completing radiation\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo\n\nPressure to replace NAFTA grows from swing-district Dems\u00a0-\u00a0WSJ\n\nAUDIBLE: KENNEDYS DON\u2019T WAIT\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI hear the folks who say I should wait my turn, but with due respect \u2014 I\u2019m not sure this is a moment for waiting.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., talking about his possible Senate run against Sen.\u00a0Ed Markey, D-Mass., per the\u00a0Boston Globe.\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nSEE, WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\nKSLA:\u00a0\u201cAfter reporting his truck stolen, a Washington man was arrested because investigators determined he had been inside a store, robbing it, during the theft.\u00a0William Kelley, 42, reported his Chevrolet pickup truck had been stolen Sunday morning, according to a report from the Kennewick Police Department. Kelley said he had left his keys on the front seat while looking for a nearby bathroom. An unidentified man on a 10-speed bike rode by the truck, discovered Kelley\u2019s keys, put his bike in the bed and drove away. \u2026 But upon watching surveillance video from the tavern, investigators determined that \u2026 Kelley arrived at the location about 5:30 a.m. He is accused of then going into a business across the street from the tavern to burgle it. While he was inside, allegedly stealing items, his truck was stolen.
