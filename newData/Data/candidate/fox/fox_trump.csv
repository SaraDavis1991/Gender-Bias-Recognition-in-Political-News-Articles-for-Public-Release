History: “On this day in 1776, Navy Captain John Barry, commander of the American warship Lexington, makes the first American naval capture of a British vessel when he takes command of the British warship HMS Edward off the coast of Virginia. The capture of the Edward and its cargo turned Captain Barry into a national hero and boosted the morale of the Continental forces. Barry was born in the seaboard county of Wexford, Ireland, in 1745 and offered his services to the Continental Congress upon the outbreak of the American Revolution. Congress purchased Barry’s ship, Black Prince, which it renamed Alfred and placed under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. It was the first ship to fly the American flag, raised by John Paul Jones.”"

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”

House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”

Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”

ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP
Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”

Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent.

Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”

Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

On the roster: Bevin lashes himself to Trump, sinks anyway - Impeachment hearings to begin next week - Buttigieg health plan under the microscope - Audible: What about a sweater for a shotgun? - Cat-ica! Cat-ica! Cat-ica!


BEVIN LASHES HIMSELF TO TRUMP, SINKS ANYWAY
Lexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: “Kentucky voters rejected Gov. Matt Bevin Tuesday, bucking a statewide Republican trend as they turned their backs on a politician known as much for his blustery personality as his conservative values. Democrat Andy Beshear, who ran a campaign as the anti-Bevin and stuck to a script of ‘kitchen table issues’ — education, pensions, health care and jobs — declared a narrow victory over the incumbent governor. Bevin refused to concede the race. … Beshear’s apparent victory comes even as Bevin clinged tightly to President Donald Trump, with several administration officials visiting throughout Bevin’s campaign, including two visits from Trump himself. Trump’s inability to lift an unpopular Bevin in a state the president won by almost 30 percentage points creates a perception the president is weak as he heads into the 2020 elections and as talk of impeachment swirls in D.C.”

What’s next? - Louisville Courier Journal: “The first step under Kentucky law is a recanvass of the vote, which is a review of the vote totals by each county clerk — counting absentee votes and checking printouts to make sure the numbers they transmitted to the State Board of Elections were correct. State law allows for a recanvassing if a county clerk or a county board of elections notices a discrepancy, or if a candidate makes a written request to the secretary of state.  ...the next possible step in the process under Kentucky law — a formal recount that includes a physical examination of the ballots. There is no provision for an automatic recount under Kentucky law. A candidate must file a petition with the Franklin Circuit Court by the Tuesday following the election. If petitioned, the judge would take possession of the paper ballots and voting machines and conduct their own recount. After doing so, the judge would make the final decision on who won the race, but that would be subject to appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals or the Kentucky Supreme Court.”

Suburban Trump backlash leads Virginia Dems to historic win - NYT: “In capturing both chambers of the legislature in Virginia, Democrats have cleared the way for Gov. Ralph S. Northam, who was nearly driven from office earlier this year, to press for measures tightening access to guns and raising the minimum wage that have been stymied by legislative Republicans. … For the first time since 1993, Democrats control both chambers in the legislature and the governor’s office — allowing them to redraw the state’s legislative boundaries after next year’s census. Linking Republican incumbents to the unpopular president and criticizing them for opposing gun control measures in the aftermath of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Democratic challengers built their victory with strong showings in suburbs stretching from outside Washington to Richmond and Hampton Roads. In Fairfax County, the state’s largest jurisdiction, the last remaining Republican lawmaker was defeated.”

Mississippi Republicans sweep statewide, first since Reconstruction - Jackson [Miss.] Clarion Ledger: “Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves won the race for Mississippi governor Tuesday night, defeating Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. Republicans were on track Tuesday to control all statewide elected offices in Mississippi and are expected to maintain super-majority control of the Legislature. It will be the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans control all statewide elected offices in Mississippi. In incomplete and unofficial results, Reeves led Hood on Tuesday night 52% to 47%. After a race filled with attack ads, Reeves took a conciliatory tone in his victory speech in downtown Jackson. ‘I will try to do what is right for the future of Mississippi,’ Reeves said. ‘And I mean all the people of Mississippi.’”

Republicans routed in Pennsylvania - Philadelphia Inquirer: “The political forces that shaped last year’s midterm elections showed no signs of abating Tuesday, as voters turned on Republicans and establishment Democrats alike in races from Philadelphia and Scranton to the suburbs of Delaware and Chester Counties. … Democrats will hold all five seats on the Delaware County Council, a Republican stronghold since the Civil War, and also assumed a majority on the legislative body in Chester County. In Bucks County, Democrats captured the Board of Commissioners for the first time since 1983. And in Philadelphia, a third-party insurgent candidate weakened an already marginalized GOP by securing one of the at-large City Council seats reserved for minority parties – a seat Republicans have held for decades.”

Gonzales: Some lessons from Tuesday’s results - Roll Call: “Kentucky was not an upset. Inside Elections changed its rating on the governor’s race from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid-July after finding Gov. Matt Bevin very vulnerable. So those who were surprised by Democrat Andy Beshear’s declared victory weren’t paying close enough attention. … Tuesday’s results continued to demonstrate GOP problems in the suburbs since Trump took office. The latest was in northern Kentucky in the Cincinnati suburbs, where Bevin won in 2015 and Beshear won in 2019. Or in northern Mississippi, in the Memphis suburbs where the GOP margin in DeSoto County dropped from 61 points to 20 points... These are just the latest pieces of evidence after Democrat Dan McCready’s overperformance in the Charlotte suburbs from 2018 to the 2019 special election in North Carolina’s 9th District. It should be particularly concerning for President Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.”

THE RULEBOOK: CHECK POINT

“To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate [when the president nominates individuals]? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 76

TIME OUT: WHEN EINSTEIN BECAME EINSTEIN
Smithsonian: “When the year 1919 began, Albert Einstein was virtually unknown beyond the world of professional physicists. By year’s end, however, he was a household name around the globe. November 1919 was the month that made Einstein into ‘Einstein,’ the beginning of the former patent clerk’s transformation into an international celebrity. On November 6, scientists at a joint meeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical Society announced that measurements taken during a total solar eclipse earlier that year supported Einstein’s bold new theory of gravity, known as general relativity. Newspapers enthusiastically picked up the story. ‘Revolution in Science,’ blared the Times of London; ‘Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.’ A few days later, the New York Times weighed in with a six-tiered headline—rare indeed for a science story. ‘Lights All Askew in the Heavens,’ trumpeted the main headline. … The spotlight would remain on Einstein and his seemingly impenetrable theory for the rest of his life.”

IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK
Fox News: “The House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings next week as part of the formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy. ‘Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted Wednesday. ‘On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, we will hear from William Taylor and George Kent,’ Schiff continued. ‘On Friday, November 15, 2019, we will hear from Marie Yovanovitch.’ ‘More to come,’ he added. … Meanwhile, U.S. diplomat David Hale appeared before the committees leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday behind closed doors. Hale is expected to tell lawmakers that political considerations were behind the State Department's decision to withhold U.S. military aid from Ukraine.”

McCarthy to adjust committee ahead of hearings - WaPo: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is planning to make a last-minute lineup change before open impeachment hearings of President Trump… Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) … is not a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which Democrats last week voted to give the sole power to conduct public hearings. According to three Republicans familiar with the talks but not authorized to comment publicly, McCarthy (R-Calif.) is considering placing Jordan on the panel, as well as others — such as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)… Matt Sparks, a McCarthy spokesman, confirmed comments that McCarthy made Tuesday to Politico indicating that he planned to ‘make adjustments to that committee accordingly, for a short period of time’ during the impeachment proceedings. Sparks said [Rep. Devin] Nunes would remain the top Republican in any scenario.”

More witnesses head to the Hill - AP: “Hale, who arrived Wednesday morning to testify behind closed doors, will also say that the State Department worried about the reaction from President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, also one of the strongest advocates for removing the ambassador. … Also scheduled to testify Wednesday was State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and close friend of the secretary. But Brechbuhl did not appear, instead departing with Pompeo on a trip to Germany early Wednesday morning. Two other witnesses who were scheduled for Wednesday — Russ Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Rick Perry, the Energy secretary — also are not expected to show up. Both have strongly criticized the probe.”

Senate GOP looks for ways to tar Bidens during impeachment - WaPo: “Senate Republicans are privately debating whether they should use an impeachment trial of President Trump to scrutinize former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as some Trump allies push to call them as witnesses while others dismiss the suggestion as a risky political ploy. The ongoing discussions are a revealing glimpse into the fault lines in the GOP ahead of a possible trial of Trump in the Senate, where there are varying appetites among Republicans for the type of political combat relished by the president and his most ardent defenders. Among a group of Trump’s allies inside and outside Congress, there is intense and growing interest in countering the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry by delving into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.”

BUTTIGIEG HEALTH PLAN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
NYT: “Mr. [Pete] Buttigieg, like others in the field, has a plan for expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured. But he also has a plan for limiting the prices that hospitals and doctors can charge to patients, even if they get their insurance from a private company. Mr. Buttigieg’s approach is slightly complicated… But it is a policy clearly intended to lower medical prices. … His plan would cap medical costs in an indirect way. It would allow insurers and medical providers to agree on whatever prices they wish in a contract. But it would limit how much insurers have to pay when providers are ‘out of network.’ The limit, double what Medicare pays them, would help patients who end up at a place that is not covered by their insurance. But it will also tend to influence the negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, putting downward pressure on in-network prices.”

Galston: ‘Elizabeth Warren’s health-care hara-kiri’ - WSJ: “Ms. [Elizabeth] Warren should be commended for the wealth of detail in her plan, which allows voters to judge it for themselves. This said, she may well have penned the longest suicide note in recorded history. There’s no reason for the entire Democratic Party to sign it.”

AUDIBLE: WHAT ABOUT A SWEATER FOR A SHOTGUN?

“The Trump presidency — it’s like every day is Christmas. You don’t know what’s under the tree. It can be that shotgun you’ve been hoping to get, or it can be a sweater you don’t want. ... There’s something under the tree. ... It makes it fun.” – Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in an interview with Politico.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Why don't we have separate polls for both parties and another for independents? These uneven, slanted polls raise the possibility that they are predetermined to show a particular result by design. If we had 3 distinctly separate polls, we could see how strong (or weak) Trump is with registered Republicans and who the Democrats want.  The real useful poll though would be who the independents like, which takes us back to how worthless the polls really are, and that it all boils down to who gets out to vote in November.” – Tom Weekly, Gilbert, Ariz.


[Ed. note: Every poll we use does exactly that, Mr. Weekly. Good surveys break out the various partisan groups. But we need all three groups because: a) some voters go vote against their own party’s nominees and b) voters’ perceptions of themselves are apt to change over the course of time. Someone may consider themselves very independent today but by Election Day will have picked a side.]


“I have a prediction. Given: The house will proceed on full investigation for Trump impeachment. Sham or not they will use all means to channel the facts to support their coming up with their version of the articles of impeachment. They will effectively use the media to be the outlet of their opinion of the facts. So far so good. Pelosi will then ‘decide’ to formally draft the articles of impeachment but she will NOT call for a vote of the house on the articles. Her logic will be that they have all the ‘facts’ to support a vote and action by the Senate but since we are so close to the election she will leave it up to the voters to get Trump out of office because that is the democratic right way of doing it. Let the people decide. Regardless of the process used to gather the ‘facts,’ how the hearings are run, cherry picking the witnesses, determining what questions will be allowed, it will be out there for public consumption mostly one sided. No Senate trial to actually determine guilt or innocence but that won’t matter as it is the court of public opinion that will determine Trumps re-electability and the deck will be stacked. Just my silly, but I believe realistic, opinion and it has nothing to do with my political leaning. I just despise the entire process.” – Alan Edelkind, Dublin, N.H.


[Ed. note: I had not thought about that! Hearings but no vote! You could be on to something, Mr. Edelkind. I will explore this possibility further. It certainly would solve several problems for Democrats. I don’t know whether rank and file members would allow it, but it’s certainly quite an idea.]

CAT-ICA! CAT-ICA! CAT-ICA!
Fox News: “A 7-year-old cat currently available for adoption at the Friends For Life Animal Rescue and Adoption Organization in Houston is causing mischief and his rebellious nature is going viral. Quilty, named after a character in Vladimir Nabokov's novel, ‘Lolita,’ got into trouble after repeatedly letting the other cats out of their rooms and into the shelter lobby. ‘Quilty will not be contained. And he has no shame,’ the shelter wrote in an Oct. 29 Facebook post. ‘Quilty loves to let cats out of the senior room. Repeatedly. Several times a day.’ Since then, the shelter has been inundated with potential homes for Quilty. The antics have reached more than 135,000 people on Twitter. ‘We're pretty floored and excited about the response we've received on Quilty's antics,’ Jennifer Hopkins with Friends for Life told Chron.com. ‘He's an awesome cat.’”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Washington, it seems, is a city in decline. History has taken up residence in Budapest and Tokyo, Brussels and Seoul. After a brief spurt of prominence and wealth owed to the Depression, Hitler and the cold war, Washington, we are told, has lapsed into a somnambular state. This is an exaggeration, but not too far from the truth.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine May 21, 1990.

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road

TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS
The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.


The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.


It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.


Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.


But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.


Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.


But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.


For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.


Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.


That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.


But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.


Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.


That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.

Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.


Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.

THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF 
“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67

TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL
Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING
Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”

Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”

Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”

Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019.  And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD
Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“Repose presupposes a fantasy world in which stability is self-sustaining without the United States. It is not. We would incur not respite but chaos.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Dec. 2, 2016.

On the roster: Trump Ukraine games tip Dems toward impeachment - Warren closing in on Biden in Nevada - Audible: Don’t get it twisted, bro - Goo goo g'joob


TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT
Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”

Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”

Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”

Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”

THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72

TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND 
Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA
USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”

She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”

Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”

DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

GOO GOO G'JOOB
Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

 Now, you may or may not like that role for our country. You may, as Trump held during his campaign, believe that America is a sap and a sucker that spends money and sheds blood overseas without anything in return, allowing other countries to take advantage of us.

 Or you may believe, as Trump did when his predecessor, Barack Obama, contemplated a similar action punishing for atrocities committed four years ago, that such interventions threaten U.S. national security and divert needed resources from rebuilding the United States. 

 And given the ways in which America has failed in the exercise of its power over the decades, these are far from unsupported arguments. In fact, what is happening in Syria today can properly be said to substantially descend from a confused and confusing application of American power.

 And here we get to the questions with which human beings always struggle the most. 

 We arrange our thinking and pursuits very much around questions relating to the word “can.” Those are simpler since they relate more to the other understanding of being exceptional -- can we do it? The hard ones are about “should.” The application of American power, exceptional or not, should always be governed more by the latter than the former.

 But as for the question of what America’s rightful role in the world is, Trump, after many years arguing the opposite, has placed himself firmly on the side of the exceptionalists. 
  
RUSSIAN OUTRAGE OVER SYRIA STRIKES
AP: “World leaders rallied around the United States after it launched a missile strike early Friday on a Syrian air base in response to this week's chemical attack, while Russia condemned the move as ‘aggression’ and suspended crucial coordination with Washington in Syria's congested skies. The overnight missile attack, which marked the first time the U.S. has directly targeted Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces, was condemned by his allies in Russia and Iran but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and its supporters, who expressed hope it signaled a turning point in the devastating six-year-old civil war. The bombing represents Trump's most dramatic military order since taking office and thrusts the U.S. administration deeper into the complex Syrian conflict. The Obama administration threatened to attack Assad's forces after previous chemical attacks, but never followed through.”

But claim they wouldn’t have been harmed - Miami Herald: “The Russian military says its facilities in Syria are reliably protected by cutting edge air defense weapons … Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that the S-400 and Pantsyr air defense systems offer a ‘guaranteed protection’ to Russian warplanes stationed at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's province of Latakia. He added that a Russian navy outpost in Syria's Mediterranean port of Tartus is protected by S-300 air defense systems. Konashenkov has previously said that the Russian military would help the Syrian military beef up its air defenses following the U.S. strike.

 And Iran isn’t happy either - LA Times: “Iran on Friday condemned the Trump administration’s missile strikes against Syria, saying the unilateral U.S. action would strengthen terrorists and ‘further complicate the situation’ in the Middle East. The Islamic republic, a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, said that while it condemned the use of chemical weapons, the U.S. response was ‘dangerous, destructive and a violation of international law.’ Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi rejected the conclusion that Assad’s forces had carried out the poison attack on Tuesday that killed more than 70 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in rebel-held Idlib province.”

SOME MEMBERS OF GOP ARE NOT ON BOARD
The Hill: “Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Thursday night that President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action in Syria after Trump ordered an airstrike in retaliation for a deadly chemical attack earlier this week. ‘While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked,’ Paul said in a statement shortly after reports that the U.S. had launched more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles against an airfield in Syria. ‘The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,’ Paul said.

THE RULEBOOK: ONE COURT TO RULE THEM ALL 
“To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22"

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa


[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.] 


“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’  But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question.  That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong?  Please explain!  And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand


[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]


“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.


[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]        


“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’
AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

DONALD TRUMP, DOWN TO EARTH
The departure of Michael Flynn as President Trump’s national security adviser has official Washington grinding like a chop saw on a ham hock.

 To call it a full freak out would be an insult to freaks.

 But as we have often discussed here, one of the most common conceits of humankind is that the matters of our own moment are unlike anything that have come before. While much of our current political condition is extraordinary, the truth is that we have been here before. Or at least in this neighborhood.

 We will come back to Flynn and the current discombobulation at the White House, but first, let’s hop in the Wayback Machine.

 It was Feb. 3, 2009 that the newly minted Obama administration hit the skids.

 Recall the initial promise of the 44th president’s tenure: a cool, technocratic, center-leftism that would deliver liberal policies but with such smart efficiency that even the business world would stand up and cheer.

 If you had “transformative” on your Beltway buzzword bingo game, congratulations.

 Here was the idea: The Panic of 2008 and the deepening recession would make America ready for a new, pragmatic leftism powered by newly chic policy geeks, big data and the connectedness of its supporters that would sweep away the grubby, short-sighted politics of the previous 20 years in favor of strategic thinking.

President Obama was like FDR. No, wait. Like Lincoln. Hold on. He’s really Mr. Spock.

 Front and center on the bridge of the Enterprise and channeling the excitement of the coming technocratic revolution was former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.

 Though he had become a Washington influence peddler since getting bounced out on his fodder shocks by the voters of South Dakota in 2004, this transgression could be forgiven. Daschle was serving as the guru of what was and would, unfortunately for the new president, remain the centerpiece of his administration: a massive restructuring of the American health care system.

 But revolutionizing American health care was just part of the transformation. The way government itself operated would change as well. Accordingly, the president ordered the creation of the position of “chief performance officer” and tapped management consultant extraordinaire Nancy Killefer to launch the office.

 With a master’s in business from M.I.T. and a sterling record at mega-consultancy McKinsey & Co., Killefer was going to give the federal government the equivalent of a colonoscopy to root out waste, inefficiency and outmoded practices.

 It was particularly important because Obama was pushing a $775 billion spending package that looked suspiciously like Washington business as usual, an unfocused heap of spending larded with goodies for powerful politicians and their friends.

 Not so, said Obama, vowing Killefer would take “unprecedented measures to ensure that taxpayers keep track of how this money is spent.” Obama allowed that his plan would cause the deficit spending about which had been so bitterly complaining under his predecessor to further skyrocket.

 The new president promised, though, that best practices imposed by Killefer and her fellows would ensure that the tide of red ink would soon be turned back and balanced budgets would return.

 But then **poof** both she and Daschle were gone.

 They had both failed to pay some of their taxes and having just pushed through Timothy Geithner’s nomination as treasury secretary despite his own tax foibles, the president and his administration had no appetite for further embarrassments of the same kind.

 And in one day, the narrative changed. The transformational technocratic president and his team became bumblers whose arrogance and lack of experience was putting everything at risk. By April, the health law was a mess and the stimulus was a “shovel-ready” joke.

 Now, we have no idea what twists and turns will follow Flynn’s late-night ejection from the Trump bubble. But we can know that this is one of those moments when the impossible expectations of a presidency come hurtling earthward.

 Of course, the narrative around Trump was quite the opposite of the one that welcomed Obama. Trump was greeted as a fascistic destroyer who would turn the federal government into a ruthlessly efficient engine of sadistic racism and cruelty.

 If Obama was going to turn America into “Star Trek,” Trump was staging a remake of “The Man in the High Castle.”

 The good thing about the stumbles of presidential administrations is how they remind Americans of the real limits of practical power in our system. Remember that the best argument against conspiracy theories is the rank evidence of human incompetence everywhere.

 If the Nixon administration couldn’t cover up a botched burglary do you think it really faked the moon landing?

 Flynn’s tumultuous tenure was an easily avoided mistake. The president and his aides had been warned repeatedly about Flynn’s unnerving proximity to the Kremlin and bent toward other controversial views.

 Trump, understandably grateful that Flynn had long ago staked his then-considerable reputation on backing Trump’s once-improbable presidential bid gave his “favorite general” the benefit of the doubt and assigned Flynn to the plum post

 When Flynn was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about – of all subjects! – his contacts with Russian officials, the mistake was plainly evident. And, quite understandably, Flynn had to go before he further compromised the trust of the national security team or did more damage to the administration on the already fraught subject of Kremlin ties.

 **Poof**

 Trump has work to do in buttoning up his White House and finding some way to plug the leaks that so often plague factious administrations such as this one, but that’s not why Flynn is gone. He’s gone because he lived down to the expectations of his critics and proved to be a liability that exceeded his value to the president.

 And that is the most normal thing of all for a new administration. And like every other administration this one will make more mistakes as it learns the ropes of governance. The failure of Flynn is just one of many moments in which the missed expectations of the new team will be painfully revealed.

 Remember, it’s not just the press and the public with outsized ideas about what a new president is capable of...

His name is more widely recognized than that of any living performer. According to a report published by Billboard, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart broke all records this year thanks to the publication of a new collection containing his entire musical work. Released in October, Mozart 225: The New Complete Edition is a 200-disc collection containing the complete catalogue of the Austrian genius: symphonies, concertos and even unfinished fragments are all included. Priced just over $300, the collction became the year’s top seller, leaving Beyoncé, Kanye, and Adele way behind. Although a little more than 6,000 copies of the collection have been sold, because it consists of 200 discs the total number of sold records amounts to 1,250,000. Not bad for an artist who has never made a music video or shown up at the Grammy Awards in a rhinestone tuxedo, huh?”

TRUMP LABOR NOMINEE TEETERING
WaPo: “Andrew Puzder, the fast-food executive whom President Trump nominated to be labor secretary, emerged Monday as Democrats’ last, best hope of defeating one of Trump’s Cabinet choices as four key Republicans are on the fence about his nomination. … Puzder has also been accused of domestic abuse — an accusation that was later recanted — and has acknowledged hiring an undocumented worker for his home.  … The Republican senators who were noncommittal about Puzder’s nomination on Monday — Susan Collins (Maine), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Tim Scott (S.C.) — sit on the committee that will hold his confirmation hearing Thursday. If they oppose him, his nomination is all but certainly dead.”

Mnuchin minted as new Treasury chief - NYT: “The Senate confirmed Steven T. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film financier, to be Treasury secretary on Monday, putting in place a key lieutenant to President Trump who will help drive the administration’s plans to overhaul the tax code, renegotiate trade deals around the world and remake financial regulations. By a vote of 53 to 47, the Senate confirmed Mr. Mnuchin, who was Mr. Trump’s top campaign fund-raiser. … The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration’s tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government’s borrowing limit. The administration has said it will release a comprehensive plan to rewrite the tax code in the coming weeks, and it will have to deal with the debt ceiling next month.”

McMahon steps into the ring - The Hill: “The Senate on Tuesday cleared pro wrestling magnate Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration (SBA). McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder and former CEO, was approved by an 81-19 vote. She needed a simple majority vote to be confirmed. Despite her lack of government experience, McMahon found bipartisan support, clearing through the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee with only Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) voting against her.”

NETANYAHU SEEKS ‘NO GAPS’ AHEAD OF TRUMP MEETING
Reuters: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, preparing for his first meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, will work with advisers on Tuesday to align Israeli and U.S. thinking on the Middle East and ensure ‘no gaps’ remain…Those reassurances came as Netanyahu took a cautious line on whether he would support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the bedrock of U.S. diplomacy for two decades, when he sits down [Wednesday] with Trump. During the presidential campaign, Trump was often unabashedly pro-Israel, promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, backing David Friedman, a supporter of settlements, as his envoy to Israel, and saying that he wouldn’t apply pressure for talks with the Palestinians. But in the three-and-a-half weeks since taking office, positions have shifted.”

 [Watch Fox: New Fox News poll numbers on President Trump’s job performance, top priority in the first 100 days and the president’s executive order on immigration are released at 6 p.m. ET on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”]

FROM THE BLEACHERS
 “If the phone calls are recorded and listened to, why all the hullabaloo?  Just listen and report.” – Geraldine Ross, Pennsylvania

[Ed. note: Oh, don’t I wish I had access to them, Ms. Ross! The point I was aiming for on Monday was that while the secrets are seldom divulged, they are known to someone. Presidents often succeed in keeping things secret from the public, but their work requires that those around them are aware of what’s happening. That’s not just to help them implement the orders but also protect the boss from spies and the release of false information. It’s a lonely life there in the middle of the presidential fishbowl. We should be grateful that so many good men throughout our history have been willing to pay the price.]

 “You and Dana are outstanding. I wish you were on more than once a week. If you weren't a Cardinal fan, i would give you even more compliments about
 your outstanding work on Fox, but enough is enough. Looking forward to pounding the Cardinals again this year and listening to you and Dana continue.” – George Lesniak, Chicago

[Ed. note: Your note reaches me just as pitchers and catchers report so I am awash with the good spirits that always emerge from the start of another season. I am full of hope and good cheer. So I have decided: I’m fine with the Cubs keeping up their current pace of championships. One every 108 years sounds just right to me!]

UNABASHED HABERDASHER
Daily Mail: “An angry tailor has sent its customer a shirt emblazoned with male genitalia after she complained about its alteration work to her $2,000 suit. Perth lawyer Francesca Bucolo said the shirt – featuring dozens of penises - was personally delivered to her Perth office on Friday. … The delivery comes three months after Ms Bucolo sued LGFG Fashion House over a $2,000 three-piece suit which she bought in May last year. … Ms Bucolo said she was forced to return the suit to the Canada-based tailor eight times, before she finally gave up and resorted to taking legal action to get her money back. LGFG Fashion House offered Ms Bucolo a 50 per cent refund on the suit and five free tailored shirts to settle the lawsuit out of court. But when the shirts were personally delivered to her office on Friday, three months after the settlement, Ms Bucolo said she was disgusted.”

 DONALD TRUMP, EXCEPTIONALIST 
If you wondered what American exceptionalism looks like, the 59,000 pounds of U.S. warheads raining down on Syria’s air force is a pretty good snapshot.

 America, the apex power of the world, does not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. We forbid it. Another country used chemical weapons – repeatedly – in its civil war, so the United States punished that nation by depleting its military.

 There are other countries in the world with the capability to deliver that kind of firepower and spend something approaching $100 million to send a message about the rules of war. But only the United States has the wherewithal to do so without even breaking a sweat.

 And, we dare say, that no other country in the world combines such capabilities with our moral authority.  As much maligned, sometimes rightly, as America’s overseas interventions have been, no great power in history can match our track record of the use of force without conquest. 

 Members of Congress, Democratic and Republican, want President Trump to get congressional authorization if he intends to keep up the strikes or undertake, ahem, a forward strategy of freedom to remove Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from power and install a Western-style liberal democracy in his place.

 But as for the legality of this attack, there’s not much to debate. As when the British Empire unilaterally decided in 1807 to use its navy to stop the slave trade, powerful nations have special privileges when confronting moral odium. Right and might together are hard to beat.

 And that is what the traditional understanding of American Exceptionalism has been, not the more recent vintage that held that it was a little different from patriotism. Exceptionalism does not here refer to the qualities of the nation, but rather that there are exceptions to the rules for this nation because of its qualities. 

 America can have nuclear weapons but says that others can’t. America can sail its navy when and where it pleases, but forbid others so to do. And so on…"

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!      
 
TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI   
CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”

Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”

Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”

Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”

Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”

WARREN REELING
Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”

Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”

Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”

Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”

THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44

TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE 
The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.

[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY
WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”

Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

AUDIBLE: THE LEFTOVERS ARE THE BEST 
“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving 

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.

[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

LOOK OUT KERMIT!
CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me? We have a pig here that has been chasing us since this morning ... folks, sorry, I can't stand (still) because it's biting me.’ The segment begins with studio journalist Giorgos Papadakis introducing the reporter.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“We ask ourselves, why do we do this to ourselves? Because dogs make us better people.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a conversation with Dana Perino in 2012 after her dog Henry passed away. Dana was reminiscing with Daniel Krauthammer, son of Charles Krauthammer, on her Fox Nation show “Dana Perino's Book Club” this week.

On the roster: Trump casts Louisiana vote as impeachment referendum - Trump operative Stone convicted of lying, obstruction - Time Out: And now you know the rest of the story - Biden breaches Warren’s Nevada firebreak - See, cows


TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM
USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ …  Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”

Will black voters rally for Edwards? -  FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”

Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”

New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”

TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION
Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”

Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine…  Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”

Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”

Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

THE RULEBOOK: THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY, INDEED

“If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 61

TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY
Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”

Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one.  The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four.  Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”

North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority.  … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority.  He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.


[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers.

SEE, COWS
AFP: “Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home… The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles before placing hoof on land – in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks… The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore... Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6. The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat…”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“France does not expect to rival America but to tame it, restrain it, thwart it — and to accept the world's laurels for having led the way.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on March 17, 2003.

“Why did it take John Cena so long to propose marriage to Nikki Bella? And remember you’re under oath.” – Rep. Rod Blum shares a lighter moment with Linda McMahon head of the Small Business Administration and the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO.

 FROM THE BLEACHERS
“I enjoy reading your Halftime Report and here's an Alexander Hamilton thought that's quite timely: “If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority...[the government's] situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.” I found that in an Atlantic article about Cato turning the Roman senate into a morass. The authors posited that the Founding Fathers were familiar with what Cato's actions led to (the First Triumvirate) and the Feds had no desire for the minority to lead the majority around by the nose. Bipartisan actions are preferable to one-party rule and I hold out hope that senators will seek to serve country rather than party, but what's America without hope? France? The filibuster is not in the U.S. Constitution and deserves the boot. And the absence of the filibuster gives the New York Times one less opportunity to be hypocritical -- sweet!” – Michael Friend, Atlanta, Ga. 

[Ed. note: You are quite right, Mr. Friend. There is nothing magical about vote thresholds in the U.S. Senate. But I would argue that the increased thresholds have been a good check on the factionalism intensified by direct election over the past century. I do believe the Senate will endure, and may even thrive in this new era. But I still cannot help thinking that the loss of comity, though perhaps unavoidable, will come at some greater cost, especially for the court. A bad idea is not made good by virtue of bipartisan support. It is possible for both parties to be wrong at the same time. What pains me to see, however, is that with the rise of mobocracy, there is so little room for leadership.]  

“Any chance you could describe the difference between partisan and ‘rank partisan’? Possibly you might look to see if there is a correlation between the rise of the demos replacing the republic and the loss of the ‘most free’ nation on earth to out of the top 10.” – George Chapogas, Rivas, Nicaragua 

[Ed. note: I think you’re on to something, Mr. Chapogas! At the risk of sounding sanctimonious, I will say that the difference between a partisan and a rank partisan is ordinal in nature. Partisanship is fine if it still leaves room for putting your country first.]

 “I think you are trying to prove we live in a multiverse. My version of the universe has the last three Democrat Supreme Court nominees getting approved, mostly along philosophical lines, without a talk-a-thon or filibuster. In your version of the universe it’s OK for the Democrats to act like 2 year old, crying because they didn't get their way, because their nominee for the Supreme Court wasn't considered? The lack of getting their nominee considered was  exactly because they laid out a set of rules about 40 years ago and then amplified by their ex VP, that said that no Supreme Court nominee from the opposing party would be consider in the last year of their President's term..... Is there a remote possibility that we could bring these two universes back to one, where we can all conduct our conversation based on one set of data, not multiple sets?” – Paul Hill, New Bern, N.C.

[Ed. note: There’s no debate that Democrats had it coming on the nuclear option. But whatever universe you live in, it sometimes proves helpful to consider things from a view outside of tu quoque arguments. I don’t blame Republicans for taking the step that they did, but I still lament the deterioration of republican ideals.]

 ORGIES ARE A YOUNG SNAKE’S GAME
Nat Geo: “Right now in Manitoba, Canada, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes are emerging from their winter dens to mate in massive, roiling throngs. While this bizarre reproductive strategy seems like it might be dangerous for the females, who may have upwards of one hundred males trying to mate with each of them at once, a new study published this week in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B finds that it’s the males who suffer most in the long-term. ‘Our results suggest that the male snakes may face a cost of such intense reproductive investment in the form of shortened telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes,’ says Emily Uhrig, a behavioral ecologist who coauthored the study while completing a PhD at Oregon State University.”

NYT: “When Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, sought the top-secret security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years. But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak’s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner’s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F.B.I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates.”

 Tell us how you really feel, Steve Bannon - The Daily Beast: Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon has called the president’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner a ‘cuck’ and a ‘globalist’ during a time of high tension between the two top aides, several Trump administration officials told The Daily Beast. The fighting between Kushner and Bannon has been ‘nonstop’ in recent weeks, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It’s been an ‘open secret’ that Bannon and Kushner often clash ‘face-to-face,’ according to senior officials.”

On the roster: Biden buoyed amid Trump attacks - Giuliani’s woes mount - Trump legal team trashes Gowdy - Dems divided on timing of impeachment vote - ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge’

BIDEN BUOYED AMID TRUMP ATTACKS
Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”

Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”

Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”

Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”

Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

THE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER 

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 64

TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’
Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT
ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”

Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”

Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”

Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”

Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”

TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY
Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”

And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”"
