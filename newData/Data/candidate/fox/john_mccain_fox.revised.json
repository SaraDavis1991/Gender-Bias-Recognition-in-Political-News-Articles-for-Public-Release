      "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Bill Weld acknowledges that he\u2019s the longest of long-shot candidates as he prepares to challenge President Trump for the GOP\u00a0primary nod. But the former two-term Massachusetts governor points to another one-time GOP long shot who twice won New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential primary \u2013 the late Sen John McCain, R-Ariz. WELD MAKES IT OFFICIAL, LAUNCHING A LONGSHOT PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST TRUMP In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday \u2013 the day after he formally launched his campaign to be the GOP's 2020 standard bearer\u00a0\u2013 Weld pointed to McCain\u2019s tireless style of politics, which fueled his\u00a0primary victories in New Hampshire in 2000 and again in 2008, when he captured the nomination. \u201cJohn McCain made that work here twice. Not once but twice. He was the underdog both times,\u201d Weld pointed out. Weld \u2013 he's so far the lone GOP politician to announce a primary challenge to Trump's re-election campaign\u00a0--\u00a0faces a sharp\u00a0uphill climb to defeat the president,\u00a0who remains popular with Republican voters in New Hampshire and across the country. Still, Weld said he can beat Trump, emphasizing that he\u2019s used to being the underdog, as he was in his state's gubernatorial election some 30 years back. \u201cWhen I ran for governor of Massachusetts, I was less than an asterisk,\u201d Weld said. \u201cAnd I went out to every event all summer long and into the fall and I was often all by myself. And little by little, people said, \u2018This kid keeps showing up.\u2019 And the same thing would be the plan here\u201d in New Hampshire Minutes before he sat down with Fox News, Weld was implementing his plan, going table to table to talk with voters at Manchester\u2019s Airport Diner, seen by many as a must-stop for White House hopefuls. He had just come from the fabled Red Arrow Diner in downtown Manchester, his first stop in a two-day swing through the Granite State. TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED 2020 CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST Weld was in New Hampshire just two days after Trump\u2019s re-election campaign announced it had raised $30 million in the first three months of this year -- it now boasts\u00a0a war chest of more than $40 million. Asked how he can compete, Weld said that \u201cmy calls have been going well. I\u2019m been making some finance calls. I\u2019m calling some people who were supporters of Mitt Romney, people who were supporters of Jeb Bush, and they\u2019re supportive.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t think New Hampshire is a primary you can buy.\u201d Weld has\u00a0made visits to the state almost every week since announcing in February that he was setting up a presidential exploratory committee. And he said that\u2019ll\u00a0continue. \u201cI could be in New Hampshire all day, every day and still sleep in my own bed in Massachusetts every night,\u201d he said. Independents \u2013 some 40 percent of the state\u2019s electorate \u2013 are allowed to vote in either the Democratic or Republican presidential primaries, which could help Weld as he tries to pull the ultimate upset in the GOP nomination race. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be here part of every week between now and next February,\u201d he said. But Weld also insisted\u00a0that his message could also resonate on the West Coast and in some of the Rocky Mountain states. Weld, who\u2019s been a very vocal critic of the president, told Fox News: \u201cI think I can do a better job than he can. I can cut spending. I have the political will to do it. I did that in Massachusetts. ... Mr. Trump, whatever his other virtues might, he is not an economic conservative.\u201d What's more, Weld said he \"wouldn\u2019t turn my back on climate change and global warming the way Mr. Trump has. ... The Republican Party should not put its head in the sand on\u00a0climate change.\u201d The president's re-election campaign adviser and daughter-in-law, Lara Trump,\u00a0said the president\u2019s 2020 team hasn\u2019t been worried at all about a Republican primary challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t know why someone would be dumb enough to challenge Donald Trump,\u201d she\u00a0told Fox News recently when asked about Weld. \u201cI don\u2019t know why anybody would waste their time and money on the Republican end trying to challenge the president. We\u2019re not worried about that at all.\u201d Weld also isn\u2019t making any friends with the New Hampshire GOP. State party chairman Steve Stepanek points to Weld\u2019s insistence\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t support Trump in the 2020 election, and to Weld\u2019s time in 2016 as the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee (Weld re-registered as a Republican earlier this year), and asked, \u201cHow can he call himself a Republican.\u201d But Stepanek \u2013 he\u00a0was New Hampshire co-chairman of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign -- said Weld would\u00a0get a fair shake, adding that \u201cessentially I am neutral in the primary as far as Governor\u00a0Weld is concerned.\u201d Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, another vocal Trump critic, has also been mulling a GOP primary challenge against Trump. So has Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who heads to New Hampshire next week to headline \u201cPolitics and Eggs,\u201d another important event\u00a0for White House hopefuls. \u201cI spoke to both of them in the last few days. Very pleasant conversations,\u201d Weld shared. Asked if he would exit the race if either Kasich or Hogan jumped in, he quickly answered: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get out. I\u2019d compete, but it would be an honorable competition.\u201d He said\u00a0multiple primary challengers \u201ccould be good for President Trump, sharpening him up a little bit so that he wouldn\u2019t take everything for granted. ... It might be harder for President Trump to duck debates if there were three other candidates here.\"",

      "content": " In 2008, she was chosen to be his running mate \u2013 potentially just a heartbeat away from the presidency. But now former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, like President Trump, has been left off the list of invitees to the funeral of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, according to multiple reports. \u201cMy guess is, it came from Cindy,\u201d a source close to the McCain family told People magazine, referring to the late senator\u2019s widow. \u201cShe is very protective of John\u2019s memory and legacy. She\u2019s also a grieving widow. I think she wants to get through this as best she can.\u201d The message was sent through an intermediary, not directly from the McCain family, according to the report. An NBC reporter tweeted that a Palin \"family source\" said,\u00a0\u201cOut of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d Palin did not immediately respond to a Fox News email sent early Thursday. A decade ago, it was McCain\u2019s selection of Palin to be his vice president that catapulted Palin to the national political spotlight from relative obscurity in Alaska. But their relationship quickly grew strained, amid accusations that Palin was often unprepared for media interviews, or had \u201cgone rogue\u201d by ignoring the advice of McCain campaign handlers. Some critics charged that Palin was more interested in advancing her own career \u2013 and popularity among conservative voters -- than assuring the success of the McCain-Palin ticket, led by the more moderate McCain. In May, McCain published a book titled \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d in which he wrote that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of his close friend, former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. McCain and Palin ultimately lost the White House in 2008 to Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Ironically, Biden is scheduled to speak Thursday at a McCain memorial service in the senator\u2019s home state of Arizona, while Obama has been invited to deliver a eulogy Saturday at a McCain memorial service in Washington, D.C. Following McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last Saturday at age 81, Palin issued a pair of Twitter messages. \u201cToday we lost an American original,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life - and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.\u201d Later, she wrote: \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d",

      "content": "  President Trump initially decided against releasing an official White House statement on Sen. John McCain following his death, two administration sources confirmed to Fox News. The statement would have praised him for his decades of service and his heroism as a Vietnam War POW. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and other senior aides all had pushed for such a statement, which would have called McCain a \u201chero.\u201d The president, however, rejected the statement and instead issued a brief tweet Saturday night following the legendary Arizona Republican senator\u2019s death. The tweet said, \u201cMy deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!\u201d The decision on the statement was first reported by The Washington Post. The president eventually issued a statement late Monday afternoon announcing top officials will attend McCain's service, Vice President Pence will speak at a Capitol ceremony on Friday and U.S. flags will fly at half-staff until his internment. \"Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain\u2019s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag\u00a0of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,\" Trump said, in a statement largely focused on the services of the coming days. Trump\u2019s decision to nix the earlier statement speaks to the longstanding feud between the two men, dating back to when Trump, as a candidate, said McCain was not a war hero and seemed to fault him for being captured during the Vietnam War. McCain endured five years in captivity, an experience that later shaped his views, as a senator, on interrogation techniques. Known as the Senate\u2019s \u201cmaverick,\u201d McCain often bucked party ideology, earning him praise on Democratic side of the aisle and sometimes criticism from his own party \u2013 but he remained an influential voice even through his battle with brain cancer. He twice ran for president and was the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008. Tributes to McCain, meanwhile, poured in from other world leaders and statesmen including former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. \u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own,\u201d Barack and Michelle Obama said in their statement. \u201cIn an era filled with cynicism about national unity and public service, John McCain\u2019s life shone as a bright example. He showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacrifice are not outdated concepts or clich\u00e9s, but the building blocks of an extraordinary American life,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. McConnell also announced that McCain will lie in State at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.",

John McCain, R-Ariz., responded Friday after conservative commentator Michelle Malkin criticized the senator's legacy on immigration issues during a speech\u00a0at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). In her remarks, Malkin took aim at both Democrats and moderate Republicans regarding immigration, arguing\u00a0that both parties have failed to address the\u00a0issue adequately, with\u00a0many GOP lawmakers adopting left-wing views. GOP SENATOR SUBPOENAED AT CPAC WAS TARGET OF 'POLITICAL STUNT,' HIS SPOKESWOMAN SAYS \u201cIt's the GOP sell-outs, not just the radical, open-borders left, that is in bed with immigration saboteurs,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cLike the ones who hijacked the tea party movement to shill for amnesty. Those are the real grifters cashing in and practicing deceit at the expense of their base and at the expense of our country. \u201cSanctuary cities have metastasized and both parties are to blame,\u201d Malkin continued. \u201cAnd yes, I'm looking at you, retired Paul Ryan, and yes, I'm looking at you, Mitch McConnell.\u201d \u201cAnd yes, I'm looking at you, Bush family, and yes, I'm looking at you, the ghost of John McCain,\u201d she added -- with the McCain reference receiving cheers and applause from many in the crowd. McCain served in the U.S. Senate from 1987 until his death from brain cancer last August at age 81.

      "content": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan opposes President Trump's pardoning of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an aide said Saturday, joining Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain in criticizing the decision. \"The speaker does not agree with this decision,\u201d said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan. \u201cLaw enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rights of everyone in the United States. We should not allow anyone to believe that responsibility is diminished by this pardon.\" Trump on Friday spared Arpaio, from the Phoenix area, the prospect of serving jail time in granting the first presidential pardon of his turbulent tenure, wiping away the lawman's recent federal conviction stemming from his immigration patrols that focused on Latinos. \u201cThe president has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions,\u201d McCain said after the Friday pardon announcement. The pardon has received support from other Arizona Republicans, including Rep. Trent Franks, who said the ex-lawman is a \u201cpatriot.\u201d \u201cIn his last days, (President) Obama commuted the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning -- a treasonous intelligence analyst who shared a trove of intelligence with the infamous Wikileaks,\u201d Franks, R-Ariz., said Saturday in a statement to Fox News. \u201cWhile no one can dispute Manning acted to undermine our country's national security, Joe Arpaio has spent a lifetime trying to maintain it. \u2026 It is easy to discern that Arpaio is a patriot, while Manning is a traitor.\u201d Beyond McCain and Ryan, top congressional Republicans -- including frequent Trump target Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky -- have yet to issue public statements on the pardoning. However, top congressional Democrats seized on the pardoning in their continuing efforts to throttle Trump\u2019s presidency and lay ground work for the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 White House contest. \"We\u2019re sick to our stomach. Donald Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a fundraising letter Saturday. Anne Kirkpatrick, a former prosecutor trying to unseat Arizona GOP Rep. Martha McSally, late Friday night said Arpaio instituted \u201cracist\u201d police policies and attacked Republicans for not opposing the pardon. \u201cThose who remain silent are complicit,\u201d the Arizona Democrat said in a fundraising letter. The White House said Friday that the 85-year-old Arpaio was a \"worthy candidate\" for the pardon, citing his \"life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.\" Trump granted the pardon less than a month after a judge found Arpaio -- the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County until losing re-election last year -- guilty of a misdemeanor contempt-of-court charge in a trial that was prosecuted by the president's own Justice Department. \"Pardoning Joe Arpaio is a slap in the face to the people of Maricopa County, especially the Latino community and those he victimized as he systematically and illegally violated their civil rights,\" said Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said Arpaio should be given credit for his crime-fighting efforts and allowed to \"move on\" and enjoy his retirement. Arpaio earned a national reputation by taking aggressive action to arrest immigrants in the country illegally. But years of legal issues and related costs took a toll on his political power at home, and he was handily defeated by a Democrat in the 2016 election. Arpaio defied court orders that he stop the patrols. Trump issued the pardon seven months after taking office, though it is not unprecedented for a president to issue a pardon in their first year in office. George H. W. Bush granted clemency after seven months in office, said Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of politics at American University who wrote a book on presidential pardons. President Bill Clinton ignited a major controversy on his final day in office with a last-minute pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich, the ex-husband of a major Democratic fundraiser.

      "content": " Newly unsealed court filings show how the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and an\u00a0associate shared with the FBI and a host of media outlets the unverified\u00a0dossier that alleged the Russians had compromising information on now-President Trump. McCain had denied being the source for BuzzFeed after it published the dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, but had acknowledged giving it to the FBI. RUSSIAN TECH FIRM USED IN HACKING OF DEMOCRATS, MCCAIN'S ASSOCIATE DISSEMINATED STEELE DOSSIER, UNSEALED DOCUMENTS In a newly unsealed\u00a0declaration from September, former senior counterintelligence FBI agent Bill Priestap confirmed\u00a0that the FBI received a copy of the first 33 pages of the dossier in December\u00a02016 from McCain. In another filing, David Kramer\u00a0-- a former State Department official and McCain associate\u00a0-- said in a Dec. 13, 2017, deposition that the dossier was given to him by author and former British spy Christopher Steele, which he then provided to multiple\u00a0journalists at outlets including\u00a0CNN, BuzzFeed and The Washington Post. The details were first reported by\u00a0The Daily Caller. The report was also shared with State Department official Victoria Nuland, Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. The filings were unsealed as part of a libel case against BuzzFeed by a Russian businessman. In his deposition, Kramer said that McCain gave a copy of the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey on Dec. 9. Kramer told investigators that it was the sense from Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson that \u201chaving Senator McCain provide it to the FBI would give it a little more oomph than it had had up until that point.\u201d MCCAIN ASSOCIATED SHARED UNVERIFIED STEELE DOSSIER WITH BUZZFEED, COURT FILING SAYS \u201cI think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was that it would have been dismissed as a political attack,\u201d he said. Kramer also described how BuzzFeed News reporter Ken Bensinger came to get hold of the dossier, before the outlet became the first to publish it in its entirety. INSIDE THE TRUMP DOSSIER HANDOFF He said that he showed Bensinger the dossier in December at the McCain Institute,\u00a0but did not allow him to take pictures of it. But Kramer\u00a0said he left Bensinger\u00a0alone to read the memos and, in that time, Bensinger took photos of the dossier. Kramer said he panicked when he saw that BuzzFeed News had published the document in its entirety online on Jan. 10, and immediately sought to have it taken down. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI called Mr. Bensinger, and my first words out of my mouth were \u2018you are gonna get people killed,\u2019\u201d he said. U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro recognized\u00a0in a December 2018 opinion on the libel case that there had been a dispute whether Kramer gave Bensinger a copy of the dossier, or if Bensinger took photos when Kramer was not looking. However, in a later declaration, \"Kramer stated that he had no objection to Bensinger taking a hard copy and had provided hard copies to other journalists,\" Ungaro wrote. The FBI extensively relied on the dossier in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court in seeking to surveil Trump aide Carter Page -- even though some of the dossier\u2019s claims have been called into question, including a claim that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to pay off Russian hackers and other more salacious claims about Trump himself.

But Trump and McCain repeatedly sparred with one another. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had \"fired up the crazies,\" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: \"I like people that weren't captured.\" But since McCain\u2019s death last year of brain cancer, Trump has not abandoned the feud. DONALD TRUMP'S FEUD WITH MCCAIN FAMILY ESCALATES: 'I WAS NEVER A FAN' \u201cI was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, citing in particular McCain\u2019s vote against the repeal of ObamaCare in 2017. \u201cHe campaigned on repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years and then it got to a vote and he said thumbs down,\u201d Trump said. Over the weekend, he blasted McCain for giving\u00a0to the FBI an uncorroborated dossier alleging that Moscow held compromising information on Trump. He quoted former Independent Counsel Ken Starr as saying this was \"unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.\" \"He had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!\" he tweeted. That caused Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to say he \u201ccan\u2019t understand\u201d why Trump would go after McCain, whom he called \u201cheroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God.\u201d On Tuesday, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., told conservative outlet The Bulwark that \"America deserves better\" and that nobody \"is above common decency and respect for people that risk their life for your life.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better, I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s president of United States, owns all the real estate in New York, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. Nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Democrats joined in pushing back against Trump\u2019s comments, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. announcing Wednesday that he intends to introduce a resolution re-naming the Russell Senate Building after McCain -- calling him an \"American hero.\" Fox News' Liam Quinn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " President Trump\u2019s posthumous pardon of former heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson sparked support from both politicians and the boxing community on Thursday. Johnson, the sport\u2019s first black heavyweight champ, was convicted in 1913 by an all-white jury of violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport a woman across state lines for \u201cimmoral\u201d purposes. Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but he agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence. He died in 1946. In recent years, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have called for Jackson to be pardoned. But it wasn\u2019t until Thursday when Trump, who was intimately involved with the promotions of Mike Tyson fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s, issued the pardon. McCain said he applauded Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cThis action finally rights a historical wrong, restores a great athlete's legacy & closes a shameful chapter in our history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJack Johnson! It\u2019s about time,\u201d former heavyweight champion George Foreman tweeted. \u201c2 things he loved Boxing and America. Now he will be rewarded by both.\u201d \u201cThank you one and all,\u201d actor Sylvester Stallone, who attended the White House ceremony and urged Trump to consider the pardon, said on Instagram. \u201cJustice has been done! Keep punching.\u201d Current WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder, who joined Stallone and former champion Lennox Lewis at the White House Thursday, labeled Johnson \u201ca pioneer, not just in this sport, but for African-Americans throughout the country. \u201cThe things that he had to endure, made it possible for me and my family to live the lives we lead today,\" Wilder said in a statement provided to Fox News. \u201cEverything we do in this sport is in honor of the legacy that he left behind. In many ways, we\u2019re still fighting that same fight that Johnson fought a century ago. We have to continue to try to speak truth to power and keep pushing towards a better tomorrow despite rhetoric that\u2019s meant to split us apart. Hopefully this pardon is something symbolic that can help unify, but the most important thing we can do is stay engaged every day and live our values so that our culture doesn\u2019t repeat these mistakes.\u201d Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, who made a much lauded film about the former champion, said the \u201cpardon reminds us of a racist past and how even today racist remarks and coded words are used to imperil African Americans and to advance an Un-American agenda.\u201d Former two-division title-holder Paulie Malignaggi\u00a0criticized\u00a0Trump\u2019s predecessors for not issuing the pardon sooner. \u201cremember when Obama was being petitioned to do this and passed on it?\u00a0 I do, so don't pretend yous don't.\u201d",

John McCain, Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen argued Wednesday. Earlier in the day, at an event in Ohio, Trump continued his attacks against McCain, the longtime senator and former prisoner of war who died of brain cancer last August at age 81. Trump lamented\u00a0that no one said \u201cthank you\u201d to him for approving Washington-area funeral arrangements for McCain. During Wednesday's \"Special Report\" All-Star\u201d panel, Thiessen -- along with\u00a0former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile and Washington Examiner chief congressional correspondent Susan Ferrechio -- weighed in on Trump\u2019s handling of his constant attacks against the late senator.

      "content": "Sen. Jon Kyl is resigning from the seat he was appointed to less than four months ago following the death of John McCain, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced Friday. Kyl's decision means the Republican governor will need to appoint another replacement lawmaker. The decision by Kyl, 76, was not unexpected. He had retired from the Senate in 2012 and said when he took the appointment in September that he only committed to serving until the end of the year. His resignation is effective Dec. 31. Ducey sidestepped selecting a longer-term replacement after McCain died on Aug. 25, saying he picked Kyl because he was \"the best possible person, regardless of politics\" for the job. But Kyl made it clear he only agreed to the appointment out of a sense of duty and had no plans to stay in the job for long. The choice of the well-respected former senator to fill McCain's seat allowed the Republican governor to avoid controversy in the midst of his re-election bid, but also nearly assured that another vacancy would come soon. Now all attention is on Ducey's pick, who will serve until a special election in 2020 allows voters to select the person who fills the final two years of McCain's six-year term. Ducey said he will pick a replacement \"in the near future.\" Speculation has centered on Ducey's former chief of staff, Kirk Adams, a former state lawmaker who recently resigned from the governor's office; Rep. Martha McSally, who narrowly lost the race for the state's other U.S. Senate seat in November; and Arizona State Treasurer Eileen Klein. Excited about McSally's defeat and the election of Kyrsten Sinema as Arizona's first Democratic senator since the 1990s, several Democrats are already thought to be testing the waters to run in 2020 for the seat. The list includes U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, former astronaut Mark Kelly and former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who left the GOP and became a Democrat this year. Kyl's brief resignation letter said he decided to resign at the end of 2018 so that Ducey's new appointee \"can begin the new term with all other senators in January 2019 and can serve a full two (potentially four) years.\" Kyl noted that when he accepted Ducey's appointment that he agreed to serve through December and then re-evaluate whether to serve longer. \"Senator Kyl didn't need to return to the Senate,\" Ducey said in a statement. \"His legacy as one of Arizona's most influential and important political figures was already without question. But he did return, and I remain deeply grateful for his willingness to step up and serve again when Arizona needed him. I wish him and his family all the best.\" McCain died at age 81 at his ranch near Sedona, Arizona just over a year after he announced he had glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer that came with a dire diagnosis.",

In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had \"fired up the crazies,\" Trump\u00a0mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: \"I like people that weren't captured.\" The two continued to be at odds until McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last year.

      "content": " Arizona\u2019s Republican governor is navigating a political minefield as he weighs whom to appoint to the late Sen. John McCain's seat. Required by state law to name a replacement to fill the seat until the 2020 election,\u00a0Gov. Doug Ducey will have to balance the demands of state conservatives \u2013 some of whom have soured toward McCain\u2019s criticisms of President Trump and his immigration stance \u2013 with the desire to respect the legendary GOP senator's legacy and family by appointing a successor in his image. And he has to do this while the state is in the middle of a heated midterm race to fill the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Primaries for both parties are being held Tuesday. \u201cDucey\u2019s job is both simple and complex at the same time,\u201d Jason Rose, a political consultant and founder of Rose + Moser + Allyn Public Relations in Scottsdale, told Fox News. \u201cIt needs to be someone who can step into McCain\u2019s very big shoes, and that won\u2019t be easy.\u201d While talk of McCain\u2019s replacement has been churning since he was diagnosed with brain cancer more than a year ago, Ducey has refused to discuss possible successors out of respect for McCain and his family. Ducey\u2019s office also noted on Sunday that he will make no announcement of a replacement until after McCain\u2019s burial at his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, later this week. \u201cOut of respect for the life and legacy of Senator John McCain and his family, Governor Ducey will not be making any announcements about an appointment until after the Senator is laid to rest,\u201d Daniel Ruiz II, a senior adviser to Ducey, told PBS. \u201cNow is a time for remembering and honoring a consequential life well lived.\u201d Ducey\u2019s silence on the matter, however, has not stopped analysts from weighing in on who could make the shortlist to replace McCain in the Senate, with everyone from former U.S. Senate Republican whip Jon Kyl to former Rep. Matt Salmon to former ambassador to Finland Barbara Barrett to McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy, being floated. Other names being mentioned: Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire, who heads the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs and is the adjutant general of the state's Army and Air National Guards; Karrin Taylor Robson, whom Ducey appointed to the state Board of Regents in 2017; and Kirk Adams, the former state House speaker who now serves as Ducey's chief of staff. Some analysts say the choice by Ducey boils down to whether he wants to appoint someone for the long-term or a caretaker who would step aside during the next general election in 2020, in case Ducey himself decides to run for the seat. \"Do I appoint a caretaker or do I appoint someone who will stand for election?\" asked Doug Cole, a former McCain staffer and veteran Arizona strategist. \"Does he choose from the family?\" Some observers predict the governor will be solicitous to the McCain family's wishes. That's led to widespread speculation that Cindy McCain could be selected, likely under the assumption that she would not run for the seat in 2020. But Cindy McCain's politics are largely unknown. Despite his role shepherding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court and Republican reticence to upend that process, another caretaker option would be Kyl, now a Washington lobbyist viewed as a safe, uncontroversial choice. \u201cMcCain was an exception to the rule is so many ways,\u201d Rose said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really fill his shoes so you have to get someone as close to him as possible. And that would be Jon Kyl. You can\u2019t go wrong with Kyl.\u201d Arizona operatives speculate that one of two former congressmen from the state, John Shadegg and Matt Salmon, also have a chance to fill the seat. They're both GOP stalwarts who don't have a history of feuding with the base. State Treasurer Eileen Klein could also be a strong candidate in 2020 if Ducey wants to pick someone who'd run for election rather than a caretaker, according to Republican operatives. \u201cIf Ducey decides to appoint a moderate senator, that could help him in the long-term,\u201d Rose said, adding that the governor faces a weak primary challenge from his right in the state's primary elections Tuesday. The person who previously was seen as McCain's most likely successor is Arizona Rep. Martha McSally. Like the late senator, she's a former fighter pilot \u2014 one of the first women to fly in combat and an air force colonel. But she is running for the Senate seat vacated by Flake, who, like McCain, riled the state's conservative base by bucking Trump on immigration and other issues. Like Ducey, McSally faces a primary on Tuesday, but her challenge from the right has been stiffer than the governor's. It's also illustrated how fraught the McCain issue is for Arizona Republicans. One of her rivals, former state senator Kelli Ward, ran against McCain in the 2016 GOP primary. On Saturday, hours before McCain died, Ward speculated on Facebook that the McCain family announced the senator was ending medical treatment on Friday to distract from her final push in the primary. Earlier this month, McSally even avoided mentioning McCain's name while boasting that she'd been with Trump at the signing of the defense bill named in McCain's honor. McCain supporters and the senator's daughter Meghan lacerated McSally for following the president's lead in not mentioning McCain. Whomever gets the nod from Ducey will be in office until the next general election in November 2020. The interim senator would not be obligated to run in that election. The candidate who is then elected to the Senate seat in November 2020 would complete McCain's term, which expires in January 2023. If Ducey chooses one of the state\u2019s current congressional members to fill the seat, then a special election would need to be held to fill that empty spot.\u00a0According to the Arizona State Legislature,\u00a0that election would have to be held \u201cnot less than 120 nor more than 133 days\u201d after the vacancy occurs.

Cindy and the McCain family have lost a loving husband and father. I have lost a wonderful friend.\" President Barack Obama, who ran against McCain for the presidency in 2008, said that Americans remain in the former senator\u2019s debt because of all that he did for the country. \u201cJohn McCain and I were members of different generations, came from completely different backgrounds, and competed at the highest level of politics,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher \u2013 the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants, alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed.\u201d \u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,\u201d Obama stated. \u201cBut all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own.

Bush wrote that McCain \"was a patriot of the highest order.\" \"Few sacrificed more for, or contributed more to, the welfare of his fellow citizens \u2014 and indeed freedom-loving peoples around the world,\" Bush wrote. Former President Jimmy Carter also released a statement calling McCain \u201ca true patriot.\u201d \u201cAmericans will be forever grateful for his heroic military service and for his steadfast integrity as a member o the United States Senate.\u201d McCain, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \"showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacifice are not outdated concepts or clich\u00e9s, but the building blocks of an extraordinary American life.\" \"It's an understatement to say the Senate will not be the same without our friend John,\" McConnell said. \"I will treasure the many memories we've shared together through the years.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan called it \u201ca sad day for the United States.\u201d \u201cOur country has lost a decorated war hero and statesman \u2026 he was one of the most courageous men of the century,\u201d he said in a statement.

Jan Brewer wrote that McCain's death was \"heartbreaking news.\" She called McCain \"a warrior who fought for his country and for his beloved state of Arizona.\" Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was McCain's running mate in 2008, said that on Saturday, the world \u201clost an American original.\u201d Palin said McCain \u201cwas a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs \u2026 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.\u201d \u201cI will remember the good times,\u201d Palin added.",

Obama's jabs were more subtle but still appeared to be directed at the current occupant of the White House. He derided those in politics who traffic in \"bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.\" He also attacked \"a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear.\" \"John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that,\u201d he said. It was Meghan McCain who had the most searing swipes at the president however. Notably she said that her father's passing represented the passing of \"American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\" Former President George W. Bush also paid tribute to McCain. \"John \u2013 as he was the first to tell you \u2013 was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived,\" he said. \"He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.\" The funeral service notably did not feature President Trump, who had feuded with McCain, particularly during the presidential campaign. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had \"fired up the crazies,\" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: \"I like people that weren't captured.\" Trump has also fumed about McCain's vote last year to kill off a bill to reform ObamaCare. Both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance. Trump, meanwhile, went to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. He also tweeted about subjects including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Russian investigation. A six-term senator and a Vietnam veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, McCain pushed for bipartisanship on the Hill. He ran against Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He clinched the nomination in 2008 but was defeated in the presidential election by Obama. FAREWELL STATEMENT FROM JOHN MCCAIN Other notable speakers included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman. \"His death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life, \" Lieberman, who McCain considered for his vice-presidential nominee, said. McCain\u2019s pallbearers included actor Warren Beatty and Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Earlier Saturday, his casket traveled to the cathedral after stopping at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where McCain\u2019s wife Cindy laid a wreath. Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly accompanied her. On Friday colleagues, family and friends paid tribute to his service both in the military and the Congress as he lay in state underneath the Capitol rotunda. JOHN MCCAIN HONORED AT US CAPITOL, LAWMAKERS PAY TRIBUTE TO 'GENERATIONAL LEADER' With members of McCain\u2019s family in attendance, Vice President Mike Pence said Americans \u201cmarveled at the iron will of John McCain\u201d and praised him for holding fast \u201cto his faith in America through six decades of service.\u201d \u201cGenerations of Americans will continue to marvel at the man who lies before us, the cocky, handsome naval aviator who barely scraped through school, and then fought for freedom in the skies; who witnessed to our highest values, even through terrible torture; and who became a generational leader in the United States Senate, where our nation airs its great debates,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

      "content": " Former Arizona senator Jon Kyl was tapped to replace Sen. John McCain, who recently lost his battle to an aggressive form of brain cancer. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced the news Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he is \u201cdeeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years.\u201d Kyl will serve as a placeholder and is not expected to run in 2020 \u2014 the year voters will decide who will fill McCain\u2019s seat for the following two years. After that, the seat will be open for a full six-year term. McCain's widow, Cindy, tweeted:\u00a0\"Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John's. It's a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.\" ARIZONA PRIMARIES FOCUS ON EDUCATION, IMMIGRATION: RACES TO WATCH Kyl was a longtime Republican senator in Arizona, serving from 1995 to 2012 before retiring from Congress in 2013. He left as the second highest-ranking Republican senator. Kyl, a longtime friend and colleague of McCain, wrote in The Weekly Standard following McCain\u2019s death that the former Vietnam war hero \u201cfaced his inevitable end with courage and grace.\u201d In light of the news, here are three things to know about Kyl. After retiring from Congress in 2013, Kyl, 76, joined the law firm Covington & Burling as part of its \u201cexpansion of its public policy and government affairs practice,\u201d Politico reported that same year. According to his biography on the firm\u2019s website, Kyl \u201cadvises companies on domestic and international policies that influence U.S. and multinational businesses and assists corporate clients on tax, health care, defense, national security and intellectual property matters among others.\u201d The same year he joined the firm, he told Politico he received \u201cseveral offers\u201d but \u201chad [his] eye on Covington from day one.\u201d \u201cI had a serious law practice, and with the experience I gained in Congress, I think I have acquired the knowledge and judgment to help clients that reflects my legal training and experience in Congress,\u201d he told the publication. Rather recently, in March, Kyl was one of the leading attorneys from the firm who helped scrap Broadcom Limited\u2019s hostile takeover of Qualcomm, Inc. The firm secured the deal after Trump blocked the proposed acquisition, citing national security reasons, the firm said in a statement. Unlike McCain \u2014 who opposed a partial repeal of former President Obama\u2019s health care law before he died, for example\u00a0\u2014 Republicans are hopeful Kyl will be a \u201creliable partisan vote,\u201d The Associated Press reported. \"I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now,\" Doug Cole, a longtime Republican consultant and former McCain aide, told The Associated Press. In July, the former senator agreed to serve as President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201csherpa\u201d during his confirmation process. TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT PICK NEEDS SENATE APPROVAL: A LOOK AT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS As \u201csherpa,\u201d or escort, Kyl \u201cwill be tasked with shepherding Trump\u2019s pick through the Senate, much in the same way former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte helped to pave a path for Justice Neil Gorsuch last year,\u201d The National Law Journal previously reported. This isn\u2019t the first time Kyl has served in this role. The National Law Journal also reported the former senator, who has a \u201cdeep knowledge of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d previously served on the committee during \u201cfour of the last five Supreme Court justices\u2019 confirmation hearings.\u201d In fact, The Arizona Republic reported\u00a0Kyl also served as Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 sherpa ahead of his confirmation hearing.

McCain, 81, who is also battling brain cancer, is said to be in \u201cstable condition\u201d after he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. \u201cOver the last few months, Senator McCain has been participating in physical therapy at his home in Cornville, Arizona, as he recovers from the side effects of cancer treatment,\u201d McCain\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cHe has remained engaged on his work as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and has enjoyed frequent visits from his family, friends, staff and Senate colleagues. \u201cSenator McCain and his family are grateful to the senator\u2019s excellent care team, and appreciate the support and prayers they continue to receive from people all over the country,\u201d his office said. Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter and current co-host of \"The View,\" noted her father's \"intense grit and determination\" in a Monday evening tweet. \"Thank you to the doctors at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and to everyone who is praying for him,\" she wrote. McCain, the long-time Republican Arizona senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee, was diagnosed in July with brain cancer. \u201cThe prognosis is very, very serious,\u201d McCain said at the time. \u201cSome say three percent, some say 14 percent. It\u2019s a very poor prognosis. So, I just said, \u2018I understand, now we\u2019re going to do what we can, get the best doctors we can find, and do the best we can.\u2019 And, at the same time, celebrate with gratitude a life well-lived.\u201d According to the American Brain Tumor Association, more than 12,000 people a year are diagnosed with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor. The American Cancer Society puts the five-year survival rate for patients over 55 at about 4 percent. Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.\" Fox News contacted the White House for comment on the report. The Journal reported, citing a photo, that a tarp had covered the ship's name before the president's trip. The paper also reported that after the tarp came down, a barge moved nearby, obscuring the name. However, the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet,\u00a0Cmdr. Clay Doss, said: \"The picture of the Tarp is from Friday and it was taken down on Saturday. Paint barge was also removed ahead of the visit. All ships remained in normal configuration during the President's visit.\" Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan\u00a0\"was not aware of the directive to move the USS John S McCain nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive,\" his spokesman,\u00a0Joe Buccino, said.

      "author": "Kaitlyn Schallhorn",
      "content": " John McCain was a U.S. senator for more than three decades. Before that, he was a congressman. And during his tenure in the Senate, he became the Republican nominee for president. McCain died Saturday at age 81 after suffering from glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. Before McCain was a politican, he served in the U.S. Navy in the Vietnam War. He was a prisoner of war for more than five years and suffered lasting injuries, including to his arms and right leg. Here's a look at some things McCain accomplished throughout his lengthy political career. While McCain's job as a liaison to the Senate was supposedly more of a \"glorified valet,\" according to the Los Angeles Times, the Navy veteran turned the position into what the newspaper called \"an apprenticeship\" that would help launch his political career. The Arizonan won his first campaign in November 1982 when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. McCain had\u00a0moved to Arizona\u00a0in 1982. He was re-elected to the House in 1984. McCain replaced longtime Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater in the Senate in a 1986 election. He would continuously be re-elected to the Senate until his death. The Keating Five scandal refers to a group of senators who were accused of meeting with federal banking regulators on behalf of financier Charles Keating Jr. Aside from McCain, the Keating Five included: Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald Riegle, D-Mich. The five senators allegedly attempted to pressure federal regulators on behalf of Keating \u2013 who was a massive campaign contributor to the five and would eventually spend time in prison for fraud related to his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The FBI and Senate Ethics Committee investigated. McCain was given a mild rebuke for his involvement in the scandal. At the time of his death, McCain was\u00a0the only one of the five\u00a0still serving in the U.S. Senate. McCain is credited with being instrumental in helping to revive a diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam. He also praised former President Bill Clinton for restoring that tie in 1995. \u201cHuman rights progress in Vietnam should also be better served by restoring relations with that country,\u201d McCain said in a 1995 statement. \u201cThe Vietnamese have already developed complex relations with the rest of the free world. Instead of vainly trying to isolate Vietnam, the United States should test the proposition that greater exposure to Americans will render Vietnam more susceptible to the influence of our values.\u201d McCain sponsored the\u00a0Veterans Hospice Benefit Act\u00a0in 1991 that, in part, created a pilot program that provided hospice care for terminally ill veterans. McCain co-sponsored\u00a0the\u00a0Agent Orange Act\u00a0in 1991 \u2013 legislation that affirmed certain diseases suffered by veterans could be the result of harmful chemical exposure related to their service. That recognition would make those veterans eligible for specific benefits. Following McCain\u2019s brain cancer diagnosis,\u00a0there was speculation\u00a0his illness could be related to chemicals he came into contact with while in Vietnam. McCain\u00a0would serve as chairman\u00a0of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation from 1997 until 2001. He would also resume the role from 2003 to 2005. The committee handles issues such as: aviation, communications, transportation security, fisheries, disasters, space, tourism, consumer issues and product safety, among many other things. TIME magazine named McCain\u00a0one of the \u201c25 Most Influential People in America\u201d in 1997. In Nashua, N.H., McCain\u00a0officially announced\u00a0his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president on Sept. 27, 1999. \u201cI don\u2019t begin this mission with any sense of entitlement. America doesn\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI am the son and grandson of Navy admirals, and I was born into America\u2019s service. It wasn\u2019t until I was deprived of her company that I fell in love with America, and it has been my honor to serve her and her great cause of freedom.\u201d \u201cIt is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am a candidate for president of the United States,\u201d he said. McCain would eventually endorse eventual President George W. Bush, but the two didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on issues, according to\u00a0reports at the time. Bush said McCain as his primary opponent made him \u201ca better candidate.\u201d Along with then-Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., McCain introduced the\u00a0Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\u00a0\u2013 or the McCain-Feingold Act. The legislation enacted regulations of political campaign financing, particularly with soft money contributions. McCain served as the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee from 2005 to 2006. McCain was part of the so-called \u201cGang of 14\u201d \u2013 a group of senators who worked together to end a kerfuffle over judicial nominations. Aside from McCain, the group included: Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Lincoln Chaffee R-R.I.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Mike DeWine, R-Ohio; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.; Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; Ken Salazar, D-Colo.; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; and John Warner, R-Va. Only Graham and Collins remain in the Senate today. Along with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., McCain\u00a0pushed for immigration reform\u00a0that would include, among other things, a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. The bill also called for Mexico to crack down on its own border security and take steps to combat immigrant smugglers, the\u00a0Washington Times reported\u00a0then. In 2006, McCain and Kennedy signed onto\u00a0another immigration reform bill\u00a0that would make it out of the Senate. This bill, too, would call for a strengthening of the U.S. border with Mexico and provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. After teasing his announcement on news programs, McCain\u00a0officially announced\u00a0\u2013 again from New Hampshire \u2013 that he was putting his hat in the ring for the presidency. Surprising many,\u00a0McCain picked then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u00a0as his running mate. \u201cShe\u2019s not from these parts, and she\u2019s not from Washington, but when you get to know her, you\u2019re going to be as impressed as I am,\u201d McCain said then. McCain lost the presidency to Barack Obama, a senator from Illinois. Joe Biden \u2013 who is a friend of McCain\u2019s \u2013 was Obama\u2019s running mate. McCain was part of the bipartisan so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who came up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. Aside from McCain, the group included: Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Bob Menendez, D-N.J.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Their bill passed the Senate but would die in the House of Representatives. It would also become a point of contention for Republicans in the future. McCain traveled to Syria in 2013 to meet with rebels in the conflicted country \u2013 becoming the\u00a0highest ranking U.S. official to do so\u00a0at the time. McCain also traveled to Egypt in 2013 and said the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsi was a \u201ccoup.\u201d Along with longtime colleague and friend Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., McCain\u00a0pushed for the U.S.\u00a0to \u201csuspend assistance to Egypt\u201d after the military removed Morsi from office. McCain traveled to Ukraine in 2013 and\u00a0talked to anti-government protesters\u00a0who wanted the country's government to align more with Europe than Russia. \"We are here to support your just cause, the sovereign right of Ukraine to determine its own destiny freely and independently. And the destiny you seek lies in Europe,\" McCain said during his address. McCain served as the chairman of the Senate\u2019s Armed Services Committee since 2015. At the time, the\u00a0New York Times described\u00a0the opportunity as McCain\u2019s \u201cdream job\u201d and the \u201cthe only job in Washington, other than being president, that he ever wanted.\u201d McCain\u00a0made a secret trip\u00a0to Syria in February 2017 to \u201cvisit U.S. forces deployed there and to discuss counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing operations,\u201d his spokesperson later said. McCain came back to the Senate following his brain cancer diagnosis to deliver crucial votes on Republicans\u2019 efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s health care law. He first voted to move ahead the debate on the law and was warmly received by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. But when push came to shove,\u00a0McCain voted no\u00a0on the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \u201cI believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,\u201d McCain said at the time. \u201cNor could I support it without knowing how much it would cost, how it will affect insurance premiums and how many people would be helped or hurt by it.\u201d McCain received the annual Liberty Medal award in Philadelphia for his \u201clifetime of sacrifice and service.\u201d The award is \u201cgiven to men and women of courage and conviction who have strived to secure the blessings of liberty to people the world over,\u201d the Constitution Center said. Biden\u00a0presented the award\u00a0to McCain.",

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT \u201cMy roommate didn\u2019t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,\" the candidate recalled as his bus made its\u00a0way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

It was Buttigieg\u2019s first cup of coffee Sunday morning\u00a0when\u00a0he began comparing politics to football. \u201cI think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. \"You\u2019re protecting the quarterback but it\u2019s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you\u2019re in trouble.\" The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen.\u00a0Mitt Romney,\u00a0and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used.\u00a0President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff. It wasn\u2019t typical bus seating. The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye.\u00a0The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi\u00a0for the press to file\u00a0stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee. \u201cI like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,\u201d he said. When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters. \u201cI looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,\" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas\u00a04 Pete, said after Buttigieg\u2019s meet-and-greet in Dubuque.\u00a0\u201cI was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.\u201d \u201cI think he would make a great president, I mean he so\u2019s smart,\u201d Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler\u00a0said after a campaign rally in Clinton.\u00a0\u201cHe speaks seven\u00a0languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.\u201d While\u00a0the yellow and blue bus rolled\u00a0through\u00a0rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him\u00a0fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cOh, it\u2019s a four-way race,\u201d Buttigieg said. Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five\u00a0people say they\u2019ve made up their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the important thing is that people know you, know what you\u2019re about, do they like what they see -- and we\u2019re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.\u201d As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in\u00a0New Hampshire,\u00a0Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters.

His resignation came three days after House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the House would begin a full-fledged impeachment investigation. \"Today, I informed ASU President Crow and Mrs. McCain that I believe the recent media focus on my work as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute, and therefore, I am stepping down as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership,\" Volker said in a statement. \"I know the Institute is well equipped with a first rate team of staff and trustees to continue its progress in the future. \" ENGEL SAYS POMPEO FAILING TO COMPLY WITH HOUSE INQUIRY Cindy McCain, chair of the McCain Institute's board of trustees and the widow of the late Sen.

Her appointment means she will now serve alongside her opponent, something Ducey noted in his statement. \u201cI thank her for taking on this significant responsibility and look forward to working with her and Senator-Elect Sinema to get positive things done,\u201d Ducey said. McSally will serve until the 2020 election, when voters will elect someone to serve the final two years of McCain's term. Democrats hope that the state swings again in 2020 and are expected to target it both in the presidential race and the contest for McCain's seat. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, former astronaut and current gun control advocate Mark Kelly and former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who left the GOP this year, have all considered running as Democrats for the post. The intense interest in the seat was a factor in Ducey's convoluted decisions. He initially appointed Kyl while the governor himself was campaigning for re-election. By picking Kyl, Ducey dodged tough political decisions that could have complicated his own re-election bid. McSally is a two-term congresswoman who was long considered for the Senate by the state's GOP establishment. The first female combat pilot, McSally rose to the rank of colonel in the Air Force before entering politics. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "President Trump on Monday signed a $716 billion defense policy bill named for ailing Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. The measure signed by Trump will boost military pay by 2.6 percent, the largest hike in nine years. \u201cFor the new authorization, we will increase the size and strength of our military by adding thousands of new recruits to active duty, reserve and National Guard units, including 4,000 new active duty soldiers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we will replace aging tanks, aging planes and ships with the most advanced and lethal technology ever developed, and hopefully we'll be so strong that we'll never have to use it.\u201d The bill is titled the \u201cJohn S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.\u201d While Trump praised the military during his remarks at New York's Fort Drum, the president did not address McCain. In a statement, McCain, who is battling brain cancer, said he was \u201chumbled that my colleagues in Congress chose to designate this bill in my name.\u201d \u201cServing as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and working on behalf of America's brave service members has been one of the greatest honors of my life,\u201d he said. The bill weakens a bid to clamp down on Chinese telecom company ZTE. It allows Trump to waive sanctions against countries that bought Russian weapons and now want to buy U.S. military equipment. The bill provides no money for Trump's requested Space Force but authorizes the military parade he wants in Washington in November. The measure also addresses child-on-child sexual assault at U.S. military bases worldwide. Fox News\u2019 Alex Pappas, Tamara Gitt and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, the self-styled \"maverick\" of the Senate who has served three decades in Congress, will discontinue medical treatment for brain cancer, his family said in a statement Friday. The Vietnam War veteran, who survived five years as a prisoner of war and went on to become his party's presidential nominee in 2008, was diagnosed last July with a brain tumor following a procedure earlier in the year to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He has not voted since last December. In Friday's statement, his family revealed how the disease has worsened: \u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.\" They said, \"With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\" Reaction poured in after the family's announcement. \"The entire McCain clan is doing exactly what the McCains have done through generations \u2014 rise to the meet the challenge,\" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend. \"John McCain is an American hero, always putting country before self. From Vietnam to the halls of the U.S. Senate, the spirit of service and civility that has guided Senator McCain's life stands as a model for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation,\" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tweeted: \"Very sad to hear this morning\u2019s update from the family of our dear friend @SenJohnMcCain. We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague. John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour.\" The Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix last summer said that the original blood clot was associated with a primary brain tumor, known as a glioblastoma. McCain, 81, has served in the U.S. Senate for more than two decades and ran for president twice. He lost the GOP nomination to George W. Bush in 2000 and was the Republican nominee in 2008 before losing to Barack Obama in the general election. McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years. Injuries from being tortured left him unable to lift his arms above his head. Last December, McCain returned to the Senate for the first time since his brain cancer diagnosis. He delivered powerful remarks on the Senate floor addressing the need for bipartisanship amid gridlock in the chamber. \u201cMake no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege\u2014for the honor\u2014of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love,\u201d McCain said, acknowledging senators he\u2019s \u201cknown and admired.\u201d \u201cBut they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively.\u201d McCain has criticized the Senate\u2019s deliberations in the last year, calling them \u201cmore partisan, more tribal\u201d than any time he remembered. McCain blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the lack of cooperation. Earlier this year, McCain penned a memoir titled \u201cThe Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,\u201d written by himself, and Mark Salter, who had collaborated with McCain on all seven of his other books. \"I don't know how much longer I'll be here. Maybe I'll have another five years. Maybe, with the advances in oncology, they'll find new treatments for my cancer that will extend my life. Maybe I'll be gone before you read this. My predicament is, well, rather unpredictable,\" he wrote. \"But I'm prepared for either contingency, or at least I'm getting prepared. I have some things I'd like to take care of first, some work that needs finishing, and some people I need to see. And I want to talk to my fellow Americans a little more if I may.\" McCain, who has repeatedly been at odds with President Trump and criticized his rhetoric and leadership, said this year that he doesn\u2019t want the president to attend his funeral, and prefers that Vice President Pence be there instead. Last week, Trump signed a $716 billion defense policy bill, titled \u201cJohn S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019,\u201d though did not mention the senator.

      "content": " Sen. John McCain was laid to rest Sunday \u2014 on a grassy hill at the U.S. Naval Academy within view of the Severn River and earshot of midshipmen present and future, and alongside a lifelong friend. McCain picked the historic site, not Arlington National Cemetery, where his father and grandfather, both admirals, were buried. Years ago, Chuck Larson, an admiral himself and an ally throughout McCain\u2019s life, reserved four plots at the cemetery \u2014 two for McCain and himself, and two for their wives, now widows. Larson died in 2014, and McCain wrote in a recent memoir that he wanted to be buried next to his friend, \u201cnear where it began.\u201d A horse-drawn caisson carrying the senator\u2019s casket led a procession of mourners from the academy\u2019s chapel to its cemetery following a private service. The senator\u2019s widow, Cindy, and his children were among those who walked behind the caisson. Joining them were family and friends as well as members of McCain\u2019s Class of 1958, military leaders and academy midshipmen. Around 4 p.m., a flyover of military aircraft honored the Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam, and held more than five years as a prisoner of war. The burial was private as per the wishes of McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee who died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81. Vehicles that had carried mourners began leaving the area between 4:30 and 5 p.m. One scheduled speaker at the service, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said before the service that he would tell the audience that \u201cnobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten.\u201d Other scheduled speakers included David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, and McCain\u2019s son Jack. As the hearse carrying McCain passed through a gate and into the academy, loud applause rang out from the several hundred people lining the street outside on the hot and muggy summer day. Many held their hands over their hearts and waved American flags. Some shouted, \u201cGod bless you.\u201d People in the crowd held signs that read: \u201cSenator John McCain Thanks For Serving! Godspeed\u201d and \u201cRest In Peace Maverick.\u201d Among the pallbearers on a list provided by McCain\u2019s office were Frank Gamboa, his academy roommate; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; and two men who were POWs with McCain in Vietnam, John Fer and Everett Alvarez Jr. Tributes to McCain began Wednesday in Arizona and continued for the remainder of the week. On Saturday, speeches by his daughter Meghan and two former presidents \u2014 Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama \u2014 remembered McCain as a patriot who could bridge painful rivalries. While their remarks made clear their admiration for him, they also represented a repudiation of President Trump\u2019s brand of tough-talking, divisive politics. Trump and McCain were at odds during the 2016 campaign, and for much of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain,\u201d said Graham, R-S.C. \u201cNo. 1, Americans appreciate military service. ... If you work hard and do your homework and know what you\u2019re talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you\u2019ll be remembered,\u201d he\u00a0told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That\u2019s the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do we remember this man? Because of the way he conducted his public life.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Former Republican senator Jon Kyl was named Tuesday to succeed the late Sen. John McCain, with the announcement coming at the start of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh -- which could be the new senator's first big vote. Arizona GOP Gov. Doug Ducey announced the selection via Twitter, while saying during a subsequent news conference that Arizonans needed a person who would be able to \"hit the ground running.\" \"I am deeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years. Every single day that Jon Kyl represents #Arizona in the U.S. Senate is a day our state is well-served,\" he tweeted. Kyl, 76, may be a short-term pick. He only committed Tuesday to fill the Senate seat until early next year out of a \"sense of duty.\" \"I haven't been able to get that assurance from Kyl yet, what I have gotten is a commitment to serve Arizona through at least this session of Congress,\" Ducey told reporters, adding that he hoped that Kyl \"serves longer.\" Kyl told reporters he did not want to commit for a longer period because when he left his Senate seat previously he had no intention of returning. \"In that spirit I am certainly willing to serve through the end of this session,\" he said. Voters in 2020 will get to decide who fills the remainder of McCain's term through 2022. Then the seat will be up again for a full six-year term. McCain's widow Cindy McCain had revealed the choice in an earlier tweet, saying, \"Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John\u2019s. It\u2019s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.\" Kyl was the GOP whip for a number of years, and also served as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s escort or \u201csherpa,\u201d as the Senate sometimes calls it, taking Kavanaugh around to meet with senators. He was absent at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing on Tuesday, but Ducey told reporters that Kyl is ready to cast a vote after working with the White House for months on the\u00a0Kavanaugh nomination. The political stakes are high since Kyl could participate in the vote on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, and will be rejoining the Senate at a time when Democrats are eager to take control of the chamber in this year's midterms. A representative for Ducey told the Arizona Republic that if Kyl opted to step down at the end of the session, the Republican governor would have to appoint another replacement. JOHN MCCAIN BURIED AT NAVAL ACADEMY NEXT TO LIFELONG FRIEND Kyl retired in 2013 after becoming the No. 2 ranking Republican senator, and served alongside McCain during his 18 years in the Senate. Filling McCain's seat marks a turning point in Arizona political history. That seat in particular has been held by two men who were heralded as giants of the Senate: McCain took the seat once held by Sen. Barry Goldwater after he had served in the House of Representatives. Outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called Kyl a \"great pick\" as McCain's replacement, and that it was Ducey's selection entirely. \u201cThey worked together for eighteen years they served together so you know I think he\u2019ll fit right in and he obviously shared Senator McCain\u2019s view on most things and [is the] perfect, perfect guy to succeed him,\" Flake told Fox News. McCain was buried on Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in a private ceremony, as per the wishes the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee who died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81.

      "subtitle": "Trump grounds Boeing plane, but can't move on from John McCain",
      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " President Trump is picking a whole lot of fights in recent days, including one with a dead senator. Some of these are battles he should be engaging in, despite what much of the media say. And some are the kind he would be better off avoiding. Take, for instance, Trump\u2019s involvement in the decision to ground the Boeing plane that has been involved in two fatal crashes, the 737 Max 8. The Washington Post says \"it was extraordinary for a president to intervene in matters typically left to the FAA or the Department of Transportation.\" And the story quotes a former DOT secretary as saying Barack Obama was never involved in such safety decisions. Rather than simply being briefed by the FAA, the Post reports, \"Trump played an active role, participating in phone calls with Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and other stakeholders, and offering his thoughts about the aviation industry.\" I don't know about you, but that's what I would want a president doing \u2014 not substituting his judgment for that of the experts but taking a hands-on role in crisis management. Aviation safety is a crucial issue. And if a Max 8 had crashed in the U.S., Trump would have shouldered enormous political blame. Now there's an argument to be made that the president waited too long to ground the planes, acting after other major industrialized countries. Maybe he was too solicitous toward Boeing. And maybe the FAA should have more tightly regulated the airline giant. Recent reports about Boeing dragging its feet on pilot training for the planes' new software \u2014 and a sensor that may have been sending the wrong signals to prevent stalling \u2014 suggest that the two crashes may have been avoidable. But I'd argue Trump's personal involvement is a good thing. LORDSTOWN, OHIO PONDERS LIFE AFTER GENERAL MOTORS' DEPARTURE I also have no problem with Trump doing what used to be called jawboning to keep auto jobs in America. But he's taking some flak for blaming the latest plant closure on the United Auto Workers. After GM shut down a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, Trump tweeted: \"Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce. G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% Unemployment!\" Trump said he also called GM's CEO, Mary Barra: \"I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union \u2014 I don't care, I just want it open!\" But ultimately this was a business decision (though not final) by the automaker, which is moving away from small sedans like the Chevrolet Cruze, made at that plant, in favor of bigger cars. The Lordstown plant workers agreed more than a decade ago that newly hired workers would be paid $20 an hour, not the standard $30. So the president's criticism seems like deflection. And then there is John McCain. He and Trump couldn't stand each other. But Trump unloaded on him over the weekend, despite the fact that McCain died last August. First, he lambasted the late Arizona senator for giving the uncorroborated Steele dossier to the FBI. Trump quoted Ken Starr as saying this was \"unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.\" Trump added: \"He had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!\" And there was another shot against \"'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Those tweets prompted stinging personal criticism from McCain's former aides and from his daughter Meghan. McCain, who often joked about being a poor student at the Naval Academy, was a controversial figure in the GOP. The onetime nominee was a maverick who often took on his own party, starting with George W. Bush. He did cast that late-night thumbs-down against abolishing ObamaCare, but that was the third repeal attempt that, if not for divisions among Republicans, would never have come down to one vote. But whether Trump's grievances against McCain are justified is beside the point. He was a war hero who served his country for decades. He is no longer with us. Perhaps it's time for the president to let it go.",

During a speech to workers at an Army tank plant in Ohio Wednesday, Trump ripped into McCain again. \"I endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted, which as president of the United States I had to approve,\u201d Trump said at one point. \u201cI don\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t get a thank you.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump told Bartiromo that his McCain criticism took up \"a very small portion\" of his time and blamed the media for bringing up the issue. \"When I went out [Wednesday]\u00a0to the scrum, they asked me the question,\" he said. \"When they ask me the question, I answer the question. But you people bring it up, I don't bring it up.\" Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly and Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.",

      "content": " We hear from the dead all the time in Congress. Those who have passed are part of the daily lingo on Capitol Hill. The senator\u2019s office is over in Hart. Republicans are meeting in the Mansfield Room. Cannon Rotunda? I thought you said the live shot was in the Russell Rotunda. Are you going to the hearing in Longworth? Here\u2019s a key to decode the references: The Hart Senate Office Building is named for the late Sen. Phil Hart (D-MI). The Mansfield Room is a formal space in the Capitol, named after the late Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT). The Cannon Rotunda is in the Cannon House Office Building, named after the late House Speaker Joe Cannon (R-IL). The Russell Rotunda is in the Russell Senate Office Building, the namesake of Sen. Richard Russell (D-GA). TV news crews often do live hits and interviews from both rotundas. And the Longworth House Office Building is named after the late Speaker Nicholas Longworth (R-OH). JOHN MCCAIN'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SLAMS TRUMP IN RARE PUBLIC STATEMENT Statues of late Congressional figures, American presidents and other persons of historical importance saturate the Capitol complex. President Ronald Reagan and Martin Luther King Jr. in the Capitol Rotunda. Rosa Parks and Thomas Edison in Statuary Hall. Sakakawea and Helen Keller in the Capitol Visitor\u2019s Center. I recently unearthed two dusty CD\u2019s of public radio stories I did about Congress between 2004 and 2006. What struck me about these aural time capsules was how many lawmakers spoke from the grave in the reports: Sens. Ted Stevens (R-AK), George Voinovich (R-OH), Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Craig Thomas (R-WY), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), along with Reps. John Dingell (D-MI), Steven LaTourette (R-OH), Vern Ehlers (R-MI), Leonard Boswell (D-IA) and Julia Carson (D-IN). We talk about the departed all the time. Senators invoke the \u201cByrd Rule\u201d when discussing the complex, budget reconciliation process, named after the late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-WV). The \u201cByrd Rule\u201d bars provisions attached a budget reconciliation measure which would add significantly to the deficit. Joe Cannon has come up a lot of late. Cannon faced a rebellion from lawmakers after he ran the House with an iron fist. The creation of the \u201cmotion to recommit\u201d or \u201cMTR\u201d grew out of that uprising. An MTR is the last chance for the minority party to kill or alter legislation on the floor. Some Democrats want to change the MTR as Republicans have recently prevailed on two MTR\u2019s on the floor, against the wishes of most Democrats. DIRECTOR JUDD APATOW SLAMS DONALD TRUMP'S 'CULT-LIKE' FOLLOWERS OVER JOHN MCCAIN JABS We bring this all up because President Trump is again railing about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). McCain has seemingly crept under the President\u2019s skin. And so Mr. Trump is\u00a0unloading broadsides against the late senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee. President Trump has said he \u201cnever liked McCain,\u201d rekindling an old feud with the Arizona Republican. The President lashed out at McCain for not supporting a Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. As a result, a host of lawmakers from both sides are now rallying to the defense of McCain, who laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda late last summer. Senate Minority\u00a0Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wants to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after McCain. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is one of President Trump\u2019s biggest backers and perhaps McCain\u2019s most loyal colleague. But Graham says he doesn\u2019t \u201clike it\u201d when the President attacks his late friend. TRUMP SAYS JOHN MCCAIN 'WAS HORRIBLE, WHAT HE DID WITH REPEAL AND REPLACE' In an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) called Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught about McCain \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cdamaging.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called McCain \u201ca rare patriot and genuine American hero\u201d via Twitter. Yet some criticized McConnell for only defending McCain and not denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s disparagements. The President\u2019s aggressive condemnations of McCain even compelled the McCain Institute for International Leadership, associated with Arizona State University, to publish a news release titled \u201cThe Facts About John McCain.\u201d The missive talked about McCain\u2019s military service, time as a prisoner of war and included a lengthy justification about the senator\u2019s position on health care. \u201cJohn McCain opposed Obamacare and fully supported \u2018repeal and replace,\u2019\u201d punched back the release. \u201cJohn McCain voted against the bill presented to the U.S. Senate \u2013 his famous \u2018thumbs down\u2019 \u2013 because it was \u2018repeal,\u2019 without \u2018replace.\u2019\u201d In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, President Trump reiterated that he is \u201cnot a fan\u201d of McCain, even suggesting that the furor over McCain is the press\u2019s fault. \u201cYou people bring it up,\u201d said the President. Yet it was President Trump who again began tearing into McCain after a period of dormancy. \u201cWhat he did to the Republican party and to the nation, the sick people who could have had great health care\u2026 Not good,\u201d said Mr. Trump. It\u2019s not strange to hear about deceased lawmakers in Washington. So many of them are etched into the day-to-day patter of Capitol Hill that most who utter their names probably don\u2019t even know much about the name of a room or a building they\u2019re talking about. Rayburn. Dirksen. LBJ. And it may not be long until something in the Senate is named after John McCain. It\u2019s as though these figures are kind of still living, influencing events. There\u2019s a thing in Star Wars about the dead. On multiple occasions, those who have passed on sometimes return as a \u201cForce ghost.\u201d They speak to the living and stage-manage events from the grave. After Darth Vader cut down Obi-Wan Kenobi in a lightsaber duel, the latter returned via metempsychosis as a Force Ghost. Kenobi periodically re-emerges, instructing Luke Skywalker from the great beyond. Death in Congress is a little bit like what happens in Star Wars. People still talk about \u201cSarbanes-Oxley,\u201d a major piece of consumer and financial regulation legislation. It\u2019s named after former Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) and the late Rep. Mike Oxley (R-OH) who crafted the measure. Every college student in the country knows about \u201cPell Grants,\u201d named after the late Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-RI). Americans have long held tax-free \u201cRoth IRA\u2019s,\u201d engineered by the late Sen. William Roth (R-DE). The \u201cHyde Amendment\u201d is a provision sponsored by the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) prohibiting the use of federal dollars for abortions. There is even \u201cMcCain-Feingold.\u201d McCain teamed up with former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) to regulate campaign financing. Legislation and Congressional infrastructure are usually where we continue to hear from former leaders, impacting the daily lives of Americans, long after they died. President Trump\u2019s fixation with McCain is different. Mr. Trump routinely changes the ground rules in politics. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP No one can recall if other Presidents lobbed opprobrium toward late Senate Majority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) or late House Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-TX). But it\u2019s likely historians will remember the invective President Trump lobbed at McCain.",

      "content": " A Republican congressman who lost his bid for re-election last week took to the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal last weekend to blame the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives on the late Sen. John McCain. \"The Republican Party lost its House majority on July 28, 2017, when Sen. John McCain ended the party\u2019s seven-year quest to repeal ObamaCare,\" Rep. Jason Lewis, R-Minn., wrote to open his piece, which went on to describe McCain's vote as \"inscrutable.\" He added that McCain's vote \"prompted a 'green wave' of liberal special-interest money, which was used to propagate false claims that the House plan 'gutted coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.' \"That line was the Democrats\u2019 most potent attack in the midterms,\" Lewis said. McCain, who died this past August at the age of 81, joined fellow Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to vote against the repeal legislation in the Senate, which was defeated 51-49. Democrats regained control of the House after\u00a0hammering Republicans on pre-existing conditions, citing the GOP's repeal efforts and an ongoing lawsuit from 20-plus Republican attorneys general to repeal former President Barack Obama's health care law. Lewis, who was elected in 2016 to represent Minnesota's 2nd District, was among the Republicans unseated last week, losing to Democratic challenger Angie Craig in a rematch of his contest from two years ago. Lewis is no stranger to controversy. His past career as a conservative talk show radio host was a campaign issue in his 2016 election and resurfaced again during this year's campaign. In July, CNN reported on\u00a0years-old remarks in which he wondered aloud why he couldn't call a woman \"a slut\" and said it's not the federal government's place to ban slavery. McCain's daughter,\u00a0Meghan McCain, called Lewis's remarks \"abhorrent\" on Twitter. Julie Tarallo, John McCain's former communications director, was more effusive, tweeting: \"Things that contributed to Lewis losing his seat by 6 points: calling women \"sluts\" & shaming sexual assault survivors Things that DIDN'T contribute: John McCain\".

      "content": " President Trump once again took a shot at\u00a0John McCain during a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night. During a discussion on healthcare, Trump brought up his failed attempt to repeal\u00a0and replace the Affordable Care Act, also referred to Obamacare, before renewing his ongoing criticism of the late former Senator. \"The fake news doesn't want to say it. We will always protect pre-existing conditions, very important. By the way, we got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare and we almost had it repealed and replaced but we had one man that after campaigning for eight years, he decided to go thumbs down at two o'clock in the morning,\" Trump said. DONALD TRUMP'S FEUD WITH MCCAIN FAMILY ESCALATES: 'I WAS NEVER A FAN' \"That's all right, but we'll end up, we'll end up with even better because we have plans that are even better than that.\" The comment was seemingly in reference to former Sen. McCain, R-Ariz., who famously voted against the repeal in 2017 giving it a thumbs down. This isn't the first time Trump has been critical of McCain after his death. During a speech in Ohio this past March Trump tore into McCain\u2019s legacy and in an unusual remark, took credit for the late senator\u2019s state funeral in Washington last year. \u201cI endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted, which as president of the United States I had to approve,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d \u201cI never liked him much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really probably never will.\u201d TRUMP INVITES SUPPORTER WEARING WALL SUIT TO PENNSYLVANIA RALLY STAGE Trump\u2019s feud with McCain dates back to well before he was elected president. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had \"fired up the crazies,\" Trump mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: \"I like people that weren't captured.\" The two continued to be at odds until McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last August.

McCain to be \u201cout of sight\u201d during President Trump\u2019s recent visit to U.S. troops stationed in Japan, where the ship was docked. On Wednesday, both President Trump and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan denied any knowledge of the order, which led to the ship\u2019s name first being covered with a tarp and then being obscured by a paint barge prior to Trump\u2019s visit over Memorial Day weekend. \u201cI was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S.

The newspaper\u2019s story claimed that orders referring to the USS John S. McCain originated from \u201cthe White House,\u201d but named no specific official. The ship is named for the father and grandfather of the late U.S. Sen. John S. McCain III, with whom President Trump had feuded prior to the Arizona Republican\u2019s death from cancer last year at age 81. The emergence of the Journal story apparently infuriated Meghan McCain, daughter of the late senator and a co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d \u2013 who, like her late father, is a frequent Trump critic. MEGHAN MCCAIN DISMISSES 'VIEW' CONVERSATION: 'I'M NOT CHANGING YOUR MINDS THIS MORNING' In a tweet Wednesday that preceded the president\u2019s message, Meghan McCain appeared to insinuate that the order to obscure the ship's\u00a0name had come from the president. Meghan McCain retweeted the Journal story, adding the following comment: \u201cTrump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads [sic] incredible life. There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.\" Since McCain\u2019s death, the late senator\u2019s 34-year-old daughter has been quick to defend his legacy. Just two days earlier, Meghan McCain aimed her ire at Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a candidate for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Klobuchar recently claimed that the late senator \u201ckept reciting to me names of dictators\u201d during President Trump\u2019s inaugural address in 2017, suggesting that the elder McCain dreaded the thought of a Trump presidency. But Meghan McCain said she and her family would prefer if the late senator\u2019s name not be invoked at all during the 2020 election season. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"On behalf of the entire McCain family, [Amy Klobuchar],\u00a0please be respectful to all of us and leave my father's legacy and memory out of presidential politics,\u201d the late senator\u2019s daughter wrote. Ultimately, the Journal reported, the tarp that covered the name of the USS John S. McCain was removed Saturday and the paint barge that obscured the name was removed as well \u2013 both ahead of Trump\u2019s visit, Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a spokesman for the Navy\u2019s Seventh Fleet, told the newspaper.

The Journal\u00a0also reported that a tarp was hung over the ship\u2019s name ahead of the visit and sailors were directed to remove any coverings from the ship with its name on it.

Last year, the Navy rededicated the ship to honor Sen. McCain. According to the Journal, sailors on the ship were given the day off and a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. But a spokesman told the Journal that the tarp was taken down and the barge removed before\u00a0the presidential visit.

      "content": " U.S. Sen. John McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday.\u00a0He was 81 years old. In his last hours, the Arizona Republican turned down further medical treatment, his family announced in a statement. McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Doctors discovered the tumor during a medical procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He remained upbeat after the diagnosis, flying back to Washington days after surgery with a large scar visible above his eye to partake in the Senate\u2019s health care debate. \u201cI greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!\u201d McCain tweeted on July 20 after his diagnosis. On Friday, his family issued a statement saying,\u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.\" They added, \"With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\" McCain's wife, Cindy, tweeted that her \"heart is broken\" following her husband's death. \"I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,\" she said. \"He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the the place he loved best.\" The senator's daughter, Meghan, posted a heartfelt note online, in which she said the \"task of [her] lifetime is to live up to [McCain's] example, his expectations, and his love.\" \"My father is gone, and I miss him as only an adoring daughter can,\" she wrote. \"He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lives in his light and warmth for so very long. We know that his flame lives on, in each of us. The days and years to come will not be the same without my dad \u2014 but they will be good days, filled with life and love, because of the example he lived for us.\" McCain was born in 1936 in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed in the Navy. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1958, McCain went to Vietnam. In 1967, his A4 Skyhawk was hit by a surface-to-air missile over Hanoi. McCain was captured by the North Vietnamese, who tortured and beat him for more than five years. He was in solitary confinement for several of those years. \u201cMy room was fairly decent-sized - I\u2019d say about 10 by 10,\u201d McCain would later write. \u201cThe door was solid. There were no windows. The only ventilation came from two small holes at the top in the ceiling, about 6 inches by 4 inches. The roof was tin, and it got hot as hell in there.\u201d His captors offered him early release after learning his father was a notable naval officer. But McCain refused to leave before the other prisoners. He was released in 1973. McCain\u2019s injuries from his imprisonment were visible the rest of his life, most noticeably the restricted movement of his arms. McCain got a taste of politics in 1976, when he served as the Navy\u2019s liaison to the Senate. In 1982, McCain was elected to the House of Representatives. Only a few years later, in 1986, he won the race to replace Arizona\u2019s conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater. He was implicated in what became known as the Keating Five Scandal in 1989, accused with several other lawmakers of helping the owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, who had donated to his campaign. McCain ran twice for president. In 2000, he ran for the Republican nomination for president, winning New Hampshire\u2019s primary but losing the nomination to George W. Bush. In 2008, he defeated a host of Republican candidates to win the GOP nomination for president. He was responsible for introducing then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to a national audience by tapping her as his running mate. The McCain-Palin ticket went on to lose the general election to Barack Obama, who became the country\u2019s first black president. For years, McCain declined to call his choice of Palin a mistake. But in his upcoming book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d McCain reportedly writes that he regrets not choosing his friend, then-U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running mate,\u00a0calling it \u201canother mistake that I made.\u201d\u00a0Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, was an independent who caucused with Democrats. After the 2008 loss, McCain returned to the Senate, embracing his role as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During his last years in politics, he had a complicated relationship with President Trump, who infamously attacked McCain during the GOP primary. In May, the McCain family was offended when it was reported that Trump aide Kelly Sadler dismissed McCain's opposition to the president\u2019s choice for CIA director by quipping during a private meeting, \"It doesn't matter, he's dying anyway.\" According to the New York Times, McCain has made clear to the White House he doesn\u2019t want Trump to attend his funeral, and would instead prefer Vice President Mike Pence at a service. McCain is survived by his wife Cindy, seven children and five grandchildren.",

      "content": "The following farewell statement from the late Sen. John McCain was read aloud Monday at a press conference in Phoenix, by his former campaign manager Rick Davis: \u201cMy fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans, \u201cThank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them. \u201cI have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else\u2019s. \u201cI owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America\u2019s causes \u2013 liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people \u2013 brings happiness more sublime than life\u2019s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves. \u201c\u2018Fellow Americans\u2019 \u2013 that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world\u2019s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process. \u201cWe weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been. \u201cWe are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do. \u201cTen years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still. \u201cDo not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. \u201cFarewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.\u201d",

      "content": " Meghan McCain had a sharp response for President Trump on Saturday after he posted an unflattering tweet about her late father, saying that late Sen. John McCain had \u201cfar worse \u2018stains\u2019\u201d against him than reports that he'd helped share\u00a0the infamous Russia dossier. Quoting former Independent Counsel Ken Starr, the president got the ball rolling when he tweeted about new\u00a0reports involving Senator McCain. Those reports said that the senator and an associate had shared with the FBI and various media outlets the unverified dossier alleging that Moscow held compromising information on Trump. COURT FILES REVEAL ROLE OF MCCAIN, ASSOCIATE IN SPREADING ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER \u201cSpreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier \u2018is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.\u2019 Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe had far worse \u2018stains\u2019 than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace [of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act] after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!\u201d Meghan McCain, bristling at the remark,\u00a0fired back with her own Twitter post, in which she said that \u201cno one will ever love you the way they loved my father.\u201d MEGHAN MCCAIN DECRIES TRUMP\u2019S INFLUENCE ON REPUBLICAN PARTY, PREFERS TO CALL HERSELF A CONSERVATIVE She continued: \u201cI wish I had been given more Saturday\u2019s with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d In a newly unsealed declaration from September, former senior counterintelligence FBI agent Bill Priestap confirmed that the FBI received a copy of the first 33 pages of the dossier in December 2016 from Senator McCain. McCain had denied being the source for BuzzFeed after it published the dossier, but acknowledged giving it to the FBI.
