BRIT HUME SLAMS MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S MUELLER COVERAGE \u201cI don\u2019t know why the media isn\u2019t calling Barack Obama\u2019s office and asking him for a comment after this entire charade has been exposed,\u201d Watters said. Brennan, who led the CIA from 2013-2017, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday and lamented he may have received \u201cbad information\u201d that led him to predict the president or members of his staff would be indicted. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I received bad information but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was,\u201d Brennan said.\u00a0\u201cI am relieved that it\u2019s been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election.\u201d Brennan, one of President Trump\u2019s loudest critics, wrote in the New York Times last year that the president colluded with Russia and his claims stating otherwise were \u201chogwash.\u201d Brennan earlier this month appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Last Word\u201d and admitted that a \u201ccriminal conspiracy involving the Russians\u201d was developing during his tenure as CIA director. \u201cIt was in terms of looking at what was going on with the Russians and whether or not U.S. persons were actively collaborating, colluding, cooperating and involved in a conspiracy with them or not, but also if there is going to be any member of the Trump family...\u201d Brennan said to host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\n\u201cDid you see enough at that stage to believe that there would now, that that would result in indictments once investigated?\u201d O\u2019Donnell interjected. \u201cI thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes. And I think we\u2019ve already seen a number of individuals who have been indicted, either have pled guilty or have been convicted now. So again, I don\u2019t have any inside knowledge. I\u2019m not talking with anybody in the special counsel\u2019s office,\u201d Brennan answered. WATCH FOX NEWS' LIVE COVERAGE Watters accused Brennan of trying to hold onto his job and preserve Obama\u2019s legacy by helping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton get elected to the White House. \u201cJohn Brennan the CIA director ran point on the whole thing and they wanted Hillary in there. He wanted to keep his job as CIA director and Obama wanted a third term, it was about legacy for him,\u201d Watters said.",

      "content": " Jeh Johnson, a\u00a0Homeland Security secretary under former President Barack Obama, defended the use of holding facilities on Friday, indicating that immigration law put both President Trump and his predecessor in a tough situation for housing immigrants. Johnson said that chain link fences or \"cages\" weren't ideal but were one of the ways authorities dealt with a mass immigrants that had to be transferred to Health and Human Services (HHS) within 72 hours. \"During that 72 hour period, when you have something that is a multiple -- like four times of what you're accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you've got to find places quickly to put kids,\" he said before suggesting the alternative was putting them on \"the streets.\" Johnson made those comments at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Friday after Congress passed a massive spending package designed to help improve conditions at migrant holding facilities. DHS, CBP OFFICIALS PUSH BACK ON DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION'S CLAIMS OF GRIM CONDITIONS AT MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS Trump's administration has received intense criticism for the way it treated migrant children -- including\u00a0putting kids in \"cages\" -- but some have noted that migrants faced similar facilities under Obama. \"Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,\" Johnson said, referring to the month of Trump's inauguration. Numerous reports surfaced in June, claiming that migrants faced inhumane conditions under the president's administration. The issue came to a head after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., visited a facility and claimed that migrants were forced to drink toilet water. Current and former\u00a0officials have since pushed back on her claims. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., also called for federal authorities to\u00a0face child abuse charges for the way they treated migrants.

It violates probably half a dozen laws,\" he said. Republicans, however, have pointed out that their party pushed an aid package for migrants -- something Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats seemed reluctant\u00a0to approve. \"How many migrant women did [Ocasio-Cortez]\u00a0help by voting AGAINST the $4.6 billion bipartisan humanitarian aid that is FOR THEM?\" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted on Tuesday.",

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama\u00a0said on Saturday that he is worried\u00a0that progressives\u00a0are creating a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d as prospective Democratic presidential candidates race to the left on a number of hot topic issues ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cThe way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don\u2019t agree with you,\u201d he said at an Obama Foundation town hall event in Berlin, according to The New York Post. \u201cAnd that by definition means you\u2019re not going to get 100 percent of what you want.\u201d BARACK OBAMA STILL BELIEVES BIDEN WOULD BE 'AN EXCELLENT PRESIDENT' AMID INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING ALLEGATIONS: REPORT \u201cOne of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives \u2026 we start sometimes creating what\u2019s called a \u2018circular firing squad\u2019 where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues,\u201d he said. Obama\u2019s remarks come as freshman House Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have pushed once-fringe positions on Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal and reparations for slavery. In turn, 2020 presidential hopefuls have also taken some of those positions. In that climate, candidates have come under criticism for their past stances from activists. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was forced this week to address remarks he made in 2015 when he said that \u201call lives matter\u201d -- which some activists say is a counterslogan to the \u201cblack lives matter\u201d slogan Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., meanwhile has been hit by controversy over her\u00a0past as a prosecutor. A scathing op-ed published in January in The New York Times, written by law professor Lara Bazelon, has kickstarted renewed scrutiny. Bazelon says Harris previously \"fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.\" Bazelon further suggested that Harris should \"apologize to the wrongfully convicted people she has fought to keep in prison and to do what she can to make sure they get justice\" or otherwise make clear she has \"radically broken from her past.\" Former vice president under Obama, Joe Biden, meanwhile has faced criticism for inappropriate past physical contact with women, as well a a 1993 speech on crime in which he warned of \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d \"They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\" Biden continued. \"And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\" The latter was reminiscent of heat 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton took from activists for her description of some gang members as \u201csuperpredators\u201d in 1996. Obama himself may not escape criticism in the election cycle. His signature health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, is quickly being eclipsed by calls from Democrats for single-payer and Medicare-for-all plans. Meanwhile, a number of Democrats have said they are open to reparations for black Americans for slavery -- something that Obama opposed when he was in office.

Every time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders; that they won\u2019t stop every deranged individual grom getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places.\" Continuing, Obama wrote: \"But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak. We are not helpless here. And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening.\u201d DEM REP FOR EL PASO: TRUMP 'NOT WELCOME HERE' AS CITY MOURNS MASSACRE Obama also referenced the El Paso suspected gunman\u2019s alleged motives, saying: \u201cWhile the motivations behind these shooting may not yet be fully known, there are indications that the El Paso shooting follows a dangerous trend: troubled individuals who embrace racist ideologies and see themselves obligated to act violently to preserve white supremacy.\u201d The former president closed the statement with a call for tolerance and diversity, saying both \u201cshould be the hallmark of our democracy,\u201d before he also seemingly critiqued President Trump. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don\u2019t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people,\" Obama said. 2020 DEMS UNLEASH PROFANE ATTACKS ON TRUMP, REPUBLICANS OVER MASS SHOOTINGS \u201cSuch language isn\u2019t new -- it\u2019s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, here in America and around the world,\" he said. \"It has no place in our politics and our public life.

      "content": " HANOVER, NH \u2013 Joe Biden\u00a0often touts his relationship with former President Barack Obama.\u00a0But at a campaign event Friday night in New Hampshire, the former vice president took a very unusual turn. The former vice president\u00a0asked\u00a0the audience what would have happened if his former boss had been assassinated. Toward the end of the town hall at Dartmouth College, Biden - as he often does on the campiagn trail - spotlighted two of his political heroes, Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy \u2013 who were both murdered\u00a0five decades ago. Biden hypothetically asked \u201cImagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee? What would have happened in America?\" TRUMP UPS THE ANTE IN CHINA TRADE WAR The event was held on the 11th anniversary of Obama choosing then-Sen. Biden of Delaware as his running mate in the 2008 election. Senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders quickly took to Twitter to explain the former vice president's unusual comment. \"He was putting into perspective, for young folks in the room, about how traumatic the assassinations of RFK and MLK were for the country,\" she wrote. Biden kicked off the event in Hanover criticizing the current president, not his predecessor. He took aim at\u00a0the Republican president, speaking as\u00a0President Trump\u00a0prepared to head off to the G-7 summit of the world\u2019s top economic powers. \u201cAs long as this man is president,\u00a0and this is no hyperbole,\u00a0we are in trouble,\u201d Biden said. Reacting to Trump\u2019s comments during a news conference this week \u2013\u00a0when he said\u00a0\u201cI am the chosen one\u201d \u2013\u00a0Biden imitated the president, saying, \u201cI am the savior.\u201d The front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination then said, \u201cIf anybody took this administration so far and made a movie about it \u2013 it would never happen \u2013 do you think anybody would believe it?\u201d At a later campaign stop in Croydon, N.H.,\u00a0Biden accused the president of continuing \u201chis irrational and self-defeating campaign to make America less respected around the world.\u201d \u201cWe wake up wondering what tweet the president is going to unleash. He\u2019s insulted and denigrated Denmark, a culture that has repeatedly fought side-by-side with us, sacrificing men and women along with our troops including in Afghanistan and he calls the Danish prime minister in a misogynistic way \u2018nasty woman.\u2019\u201d Biden's\u00a0comments came as he spoke and took questions for over an hour at a town hall focused on health care, a top issue among Democratic presidential primary voters. He once again highlighted the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, the signature domestic achievement during Biden\u2019s eight years in the Obama\u00a0administration. \"We made significant progress. We have to finish the job,\u201d he argued. Biden, the only top-tier candidate in the Democratic field who doesn\u2019t support a government-run, single-payer \"Medicare-for-all\" plan, noted that for him, \"building on ObamaCare with a public option is the way to go. We should not walk away.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people running in our party, good people, who want to get rid of ObamaCare, starting over with something new. I\u2019m not for that,\" he said. \"My health care plan sets out in detail how we can protect and build on ObamaCare to make sure every American has affordable, quality, health care\u00a0options, while at lowest possible health care costs.\u201d BIDEN JABS AT SANDERS AND WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL Taking an indirect jab at one of his top rivals for the nomination \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2013 Biden said his plan \u201ccosts a lot of money \u2013 almost $740 billion to do what I want to do over 10\u00a0years. It\u2019s not $30 trillion. It\u2019s not $30 trillion.\u201d That\u2019s the price tag \u2013 at a minimum \u2013\u00a0that Sanders has acknowledged his \"Medicare-for-all\" plan would cost. Biden has used the line since last month\u2019s second round of Democratic primary debates. Pushing his public option, Biden explained, \u201cWe\u2019ll build a new public health option like Medicare within the Affordable Care Act. Only everyone will have a chance to buy in if they wish to. If you have plans already working, if you have a generous union-backed insurance plan\u00a0and you\u2019re giving up wages to get it, you are in fact entitled to keep it as long as it exists.\u201d Earlier in the week, Sanders campaign made a tweak to its \"Medicare-for-all\" plan to address concerns from unions that under a single-payer system they would be giving up their hard-fought\u00a0health care benefits and getting nothing in return. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Biden also vowed to take on the pharmaceutical giants over the high costs of prescription drugs, saying \u201cWe\u2019re going to throw the book quite frankly at the pharmaceutical companies that have abused the power to make outrageous profits off the backs of Americans.\u201d Biden\u2019s stop in Hanover,\u00a0the first in a two-day swing in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state,\u00a0comes as his campaign touted their candidate\u2019s standing as the Democratic White House hopeful with the best chance of beating Trump in next year\u2019s general election. In Biden\u2019s first TV commercial of his 2020 campaign \u2013 which started running on Iowa airwaves Tuesday \u2013 the announcer in the ad says, \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump and all the polls agree Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job. No one is more qualified.\u201d As the announcer speaks, graphics pop up on the screen\u00a0showing a series of polls where Biden\u2019s beating the Republican president in hypothetical 2020 matchups. The ad started playing on Iowa a day after another obvious appeal to electability by the Biden campaign. On Monday the candidate\u2019s wife, Jill Biden, said at a Granite State campaign event in Manchester: \u201cI want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who's going to win this race.\" \u201cYour candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is, but you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'OK, I personally like so-and-so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump,\u201d she stressed. Democratic voter Karen Summer said as she entered the event on Friday that beating Trump\u2019s \u201cnot all that matters but that\u2019s the number one [issue]. Absolutely without a question.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She added\u00a0 she came to see Biden to gauge whether he has the fire in his belly to defeat Trump in next year\u2019s election. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m here is I want to see if he actually has any kind of spark or vigor,\u201d she said. Dartmouth business school student Hailey Durno \u2013 who like Summer is undecided on who she\u2019ll support in the primaries \u2013 explained that for her \"it\u2019s a little bit of both.\" \"I think you need someone who\u2019s not only going to beat Trump but someone who\u2019s also going to be the right candidate for the job,\" Durno said. \"You don\u2019t want to select someone out of default because you think that they have the potential to win.\u201d Fox News' Rob DiRienza contributed to this story",

A spokesperson for the protesters said they belonged to the New Hampshire Youth Movement and added that they were allied with Movimiento Cosecha, which describes itself as a \u201cnonviolent movement fighting for permanent protection, dignity, and respect for all immigrants.\u201d The spokesperson, who said her name was Quincy, explained that \u201cwe\u2019re here because we do not find many of Joe Biden\u2019s actions acceptable, in terms of his record on immigration under the Obama administration.\u201d ANTI-DEPORTATION ACTIVISTS 'OCCUPY' BIDEN HQ IN PHILADELPHIA, 6 ARRESTED She added that \u201cwe need a person who\u2019s going to champion issues like Medicare for all, free college for all, and the Green New Deal, that are going to save my generation\u2019s life and we don\u2019t believe Joe Biden is the person to do that.\u201d While the Obama administration \u2013 with Biden as vice president \u2013 is praised by many Democrats for implementing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2014, it\u2019s criticized by many immigration advocates for the increase in deportations. Later, Biden told reporters \"I think the policy of the boarding felons makes sense.\" He explained that the Obama administration was under orders that required the deportations but that the president made sure \"to only deport people who were, in fact, committing a felony.\" Biden remains the front-runner in the Democratic nomination race, but he\u2019s seen his big lead in the national and early primary and caucus voting state polls slip in the wake of last month\u2019s first round of primary debates when he was cold-cocked by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat\u2019s breakthrough debate moment came as she criticized recent comments by Biden spotlighting his ability to find common ground during the 1970s with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed, and over his opposition decades ago to federally mandated school busing. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Biden told the crowd in Dover that \u201cthe good news about being a front runner is that you\u2019re a front runner. The bad news about being a front runner is everyone\u2019s behind you, they\u2019re looking. You know what I mean.\u201d And he warned his rivals that the last thing the Democratic White House hopefuls need to do is \u201cfall in a circular firing squad here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m getting skewered by the new Democrat party and I respect them, by the way,\u201d he emphasized. And he said he was getting attacked by some of his rivals for preaching about\u00a0his ability to work with Republicans across the aisle to get things accomplished. \u201cSomehow the idea we are able to cooperate with the other side is considered na\u00efve,\u201d he lamented. Biden also repeatedly took aim at Republican President Donald Trump, saying he\u2019s \u201cembracing these oligarchs, embracing these thugs, poking his finger in the eye of NATO, the single most consequential alliance we\u2019ve ever had. Folks, it is incredibly dangerous.\u201d And he emphasized that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to stop this guy. We\u2019ve got to keep him from having a second term.\u201d SOUTH BEND POLICE CALL OUT BUTTIGIEG FOR SENDING PIZZA RATHER THAN APOLOGY OVER RACE COMMENTS The former vice president told the audience \u201cI hope you\u2019ll vote for me,\u201d but also highlighted that if he doesn\u2019t win the nomination, \u201cwhoever our nominee is, I\u2019m going to break my neck to make sure they get elected.\u201d Biden arrived in the Granite State a few days after he released his tax returns, which showed he made $15 million in the two years after leaving office. Asked by Fox News' Peter Doocy if he can still call himself \"Middle-Class Joe,\" Biden touted he was raised with \"middle-class values.\" \"The fact of the matter is that the money that I made I made because I got hired as a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And I wrote a book that was number one on the best sellers for a long long time,\"\u00a0he noted. The stop in Dover kicked off a two-day swing by the Biden as he makes his third trip to New Hampshire since launching his campaign in late April. Hours earlier, rival Pete Buttigieg held a large rally a few blocks away. City officials estimated that more than 800 people attended the South Bend, Indiana mayor's event. That crowd was significantly larger than the one gathered for Biden. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But New Hampshire attorney and former ambassador Terry Shumaker, a top Granite State supporter and surrogate for Biden, dismissed talk of a lack of enthusiasm for the former vice president. \"People are coming up to me on the street and self-identifying themselves as Biden supporter,\" he noted. Shumaker explained the most people are \"interested in some of the newer names and what the excitement is and they want to go see them. But literally everybody I know is still shopping. Nobody\u2019s buying yet.\"",

Enter President Obama,\u201d which essentially begs the former president to take action against his successor. \u201cMr. President, it is time. You must speak. Your country needs you,\u201d Tumulty wrote before referencing controversial tweets the current president recently sent in which he told four congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from.

MSNBC GUEST BIZARRELY DECLARES PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 'MORE RACIST\u2019 THAN NEO-NAZIS \u201cTrump\u2019s tweets over the weekend were the basest kind of bigotry, the oldest of racist tropes.

Tumulty then said she understands Obama\u2019s \u201creluctance to weigh in on Trump\u2019s latest transgression\u201d but feels \u201csilence now is unacceptable\u201d and declared\u00a0it\u2019s time for the former president to speak up -- and speak out. \u201cFor Trump, racism is not a moral failing; it is a political tactic. None of us can really claim to understand what is in his heart, but the cynicism of his actions is apparent, and it must be exposed for what it is,\u201d Tumulty wrote. \u201cNo one knows that better than you do.\u201d THIS IS CNN? NETWORK APPARENTLY RECENTLY GLORIFIED ICE DETENTION CENTER ATTACKER Tumulty then lists a variety of Trump\u2019s actions that have been criticized by the left, such as \u201cspreading a blatantly racist lie\u201d that Obama was not born in the United States, referring to some Mexican immigrants as rapists and calling for ban on Muslim\u2019s entering the country. \u201cThere was a political calculation behind every one of those vile statements, and as repulsed as we are with his latest racist rant, it is possible to see the calculation that is at work here as well,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPresident Obama, what we need more than anything else right now is someone who can lift the country\u2019s sights again.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Post\u2019s column concluded with an appeal to Obama: \u201cFind your voice again.

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama reportedly warned freshman Democrats this week on the cost of their sweeping proposals, urging them to figure out how to pay for them. Obama, who has largely stayed out of the public eye\u00a0since leaving office, encouraged a group of freshman Democrats to continue to pursue \u201cbold\u201d ideas, according to The Washington Post, but also to home in on the details of funding them. FROM REPARATIONS TO GREEN NEW DEAL, LIBERAL LITMUS TESTS PUT 2020 DEMS IN RISKY TERRITORY \u201cHe said we [as Democrats] shouldn\u2019t be afraid of big, bold ideas \u2013 but also need to think in the nitty-gritty about how those big, bold ideas will work and how you pay for them,\u201d one person familiar with Obama\u2019s remarks told The Post. While the former president did not call out any specific proposals by name, some reportedly took his advice as a note for those new lawmakers pushing \"Medicare-for-all\" and the Green New Deal\u2014both liberal policies popularized by House freshmen, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. The Green New Deal is a massive overhaul of the nation\u2019s economy and energy use, with an estimated cost that could reach well into the tens of trillions of dollars. The resolution, which is nonbinding, is co-sponsored by nearly all major 2020 Democrats in Congress and was introduced in the House last month. The rollout of the proposal caused headaches for Democrats, as it included FAQs from Ocasio-Cortez containing promises of economic security for those \u201cunwilling to work\u201d and talk of abolishing air travel in favor of high-speed rail. But Ocasio-Cortez has not yet explained a plan for how to fund the program. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday will put the Green New Deal to a test vote, in a move that will force Democrats to take an official stand on the measure\u00a0and pit the party\u2019s moderate members against its progressive wing. MCCONNEL TO PUT GREEN NEW DEAL TO VOTE, FORCING DEMOCRATS TO GO ON RECORD Obama, later, reportedly encouraged the freshman lawmakers to find a policy and fight for it. The Post said Obama said that The Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, was the policy that Obama said he was willing to lose his office over. Obama also reportedly talked about the importance of working with constituents and \u201cstaying in touch\u201d with them. But while Obama is typically a unifying voice in the Democratic Party, freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has criticized the former president in recent weeks, reportedly suggesting in an interview his message of \u201chope and change\u201d is a \u201cmirage.\u201d \u201cRecalling the \u2018caging of kids\u2019 at the U.S.-Mexico border and the \u2018droning of countries around the world\u2019 on Obama\u2019s watch,\" Omar\u00a0charged that Obama \"operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor,\u201d the recent article in Politico said. Omar later claimed she was misquoted by Politico, tweeting that she is a fan of Obama. But the move immediately backfired as the recording of her interview confirmed the comments she made to the news outlet. She later deleted her tweet.

In a new interview, Trump wondered if there was a \u201cbig secret\u201d as to why Obama has not backed Biden. \u201cHow he doesn\u2019t get President Obama to endorse him, there has to be some reason why he\u2019s not endorsing him,\u201d Trump told The Hill. \u201cHe was the vice president. They seemed to have gotten along. President Obama not endorsing him is rather\u2026 a big secret.\u201d FLASHBACK: BIDEN ENTERS WHITE HOUSE RACE WITHOUT OBAMA'S ENDORSEMENT After the ponderance, the president accused Biden of lying when he previously stated he asked Obama not to endorse him. \u201cThen he goes and lies and says, 'I asked the president not to endorse me'\u2026 give me a break,\u201d Trump told The Hill. \u201cHe\u2019s embarrassed that Obama\u2019s not endorsing him, so he goes out and says, 'I asked President Obama not to endorse me.' \u201cSo, it could be that President Obama knows something because there is something going on in that brain of his.\u201d LARA TRUMP: JOE BIDEN TANKING EARLIER THAN EXPECTED, 'MAYBE HE REGRETS NOW EVEN DECIDING TO RUN' In April, shortly after he officially announced his long-expected 2020 run, Biden told Fox News he had asked his former boss not to support him publicly. \"I asked President Obama not to endorse,\u201d Biden said at the time outside an Amtrak station in Delaware, adding that \u201cwhoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.\u201d Obama's team released a statement praising Biden; the statement stopped short of endorsing him. \u201cPresident Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,\u201d Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill said. TRUMP: 'SLEEPY JOE BIDEN' HASN'T 'APOLOGIZED' FOR INVOLVEMENT IN 1994 CRIME LAW \u201cHe relied on the Vice President\u2019s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency.

      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " Former Defense Secretary James Mattis, in stark terms, lambasts Barack Obama and Joe Biden for faulty leadership\u00a0in his new book, and suggests their naivete and ignorance of reality\u00a0contributed to the rise of ISIS in Iraq, according to excerpts reviewed by The Washington Examiner. The book, \"Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,\" co-written with Bing West, does not delve into Mattis' discussions with President Trump. Mattis, speaking to \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday, said only that he did not have a \"tense\" relationship with the president. \"I try not to talk, having parted ways with the administration over matters of policy,\" Mattis said. \"I don't want to talk from the cheap seats now\u00a0and make their job more difficult.\" Mattis resigned\u00a0from the Trump administration\u00a0last December after clashing with the president\u00a0over the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and after two years of deep disagreements over America's role in the world. But Mattis, in his book, did open\u00a0up about his tenure as head of\u00a0U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, and zeroed in on the Obama administration's desire to wind down the U.S. troop presence in Iraq, no matter the cost. Mattis wrote that Obama's\u00a0tenure \"was to be a time when I would witness duty and deceit, courage and cowardice, and, ultimately, strategic frustration.\" ISIS USING BOOBY-TRAPPED BOVINES, DONKEY-BORNE EXPLOSIVES\u00a0TO TARGET ENEMIES IN IRAQ \u201cIn Washington, the debate swirled throughout 2011 about how many, if any, U.S. troops should remain in Iraq,\u201d Mattis recounted. \u201cCentral Command, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs\u00a0and the new defense secretary, Leon Panetta, who had replaced Bob Gates, continued to recommend to the White House retaining a residual force, as did Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\" All of them, Mattis asserted, were \"talking to the wind,\" as Obama was singularly focused on living up to his public promises to end the war in Iraq. In late 2011, Obama said confidently in a speech to the nation that\u00a0some 40,000 servicemen and women still in Iraq\u00a0\"will definitely be home for the holidays.\" The administration's faith in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Mattis said, was also misplaced. \u201cPrime Minister Maliki is highly untrustworthy, Mr. Vice President,\u201d Mattis said he warned Biden.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s devious when he talks to us. ...\u00a0He looks at our ambassadors and military advisers as impediments to his anti-Sunni agenda. He wants to purge or marginalize Sunnis and Kurds from the government.\" Mattis wrote that\u00a0\u201cVice President Biden and his assistants listened politely. But as we spoke, I sensed I was making no headway in convincing the administration officials not to support Maliki. It was like talking to people who lived in wooden houses but saw no need for a fire department. ...\u00a0 I found him an admirable and amiable man. But he was past the point where he was willing to entertain a \u2018good idea.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to hear more; he wanted our forces out of Iraq. Whatever path led there fastest, he favored. WATCH: MATTIS SAYS HE DIDN'T HAVE 'TENSE' RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP \"He exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly,\" Mattis concluded. According to Mattis, Biden countered that \u201cMaliki wants us to stick around, because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise. I\u2019ll bet you my vice presidency.\u201d Afterward, Mattis said, \"Iraq slipped back into escalating violence. It was like watching a car wreck in slow motion. ... All of this was predicted \u2014 and preventable.\u201d In 2016, faced with the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Iraq power vacuum that he had once dismissed as a \"junior varsity\" effort,\u00a0Obama sent 5,000 troops back to Iraq. ISIS' major\u00a0strongholds fell under the Trump administration, although experts warn that the group remains dangerous. Nevertheless, Biden -- who was nominally in charge of overseeing troop withdrawals from Iraq\u00a0under the Obama administration -- has touted his efforts in that capacity as he runs for president.\u00a0\u201cI made sure the president turned to me and said, \u2018Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq,'\" Biden said in Miami in June. \"I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq, and my son was one of them.\u201d In July, Biden claimed,\u00a0\u201cWhen I was vice president, the president gave me all the easy jobs, like \u2018take care of getting all our troops out of Iraq,\u2019 which we did.\u201d TRUMP SLAMS OBAMA FOR NOT ENFORCING 'RED LINE' AFTER 'ANIMAL' ASSAD APPARENTLY USES CHEMICAL WEAPONS The Washington Post's fact-checker has noted that Biden has preferred not to mention on the campaign trail the\u00a0troops' eventual return to Iraq under his watch. In his book, Mattis also faulted Obama's failure to enforce his own self-imposed \"red line\" upon the use of chemical weapons in Syria had weakend the U.S. globally. \u201cOld friends in NATO and in the Pacific registered dismay and incredulity that America\u2019s reputation had been seriously weakened as a credible security partner,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cWithin 36 hours, I received a phone call from a friendly Pacific-nation diplomat. \u2018Well, Jim,\u2019 he said, \u2018I guess we\u2019re on our own with China.'\u201d He continued:\u00a0\u201cOver the next several years, Syria totally disintegrated into hell on earth. The consequences included an accelerated refugee flow that changed the political culture of Europe, punctuated by repeated terrorist attacks. And America today lives with the consequences of emboldened adversaries and shaken allies.\u201d Mattis separately recounted his own ignominious firing by Obama, after months of disagreement over military policy. \u201cIn December 2012, I received an unauthorized phone call telling me that in an hour, the Pentagon would be announcing my relief,\u201d Mattis said. \"I was leaving a region aflame and in disarray. The lack of an integrated regional strategy had left us adrift, and our friends confused. We were offering no leadership or direction. I left my post deeply disturbed that we had shaken our friends\u2019 confidence and created vacuums that our adversaries would exploit.\u201d CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Speaking to \"Fox & Friends,\" Mattis emphasized that his book was not entirely about disagreements over geopolitics and strategy. \"It's about leadership,\" Mattis said. \"It's about allies, it's about how do you set the vision as a leader so that all your young people, right down to the youngest 18-year-olds, feel a sense of ownership?\"",

      "content": "  Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that Greg Craig, a prominent Washington lawyer and former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, misled his then-law firm and the Justice Department about his work for the pro-Russian government of Ukraine in 2012. Craig, 74, faces one count of lying to the DOJ's\u00a0Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) Unit\u00a0when it approached the\u00a0firm --\u00a0Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom -- with concerns that it should have registered as a foreign agent for its Ukraine work. Defense attorney William Murphy, in closing arguments that lasted about two hours, maintained that Craig\u00a0\"did not knowingly and willfully act to deceive\" the FARA Unit and\u00a0allegations that his legal services crossed a line into foreign lobbying were untrue. \"Did he really have a motive to lie and impugn his own reputation?\" Murphy asked. \"He had no motive to lie and he didn't lie.\" Craig\u00a0took the stand in his own defense last in a case that emerged as an offshoot of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and that has spotlighted the lucrative universe of foreign lobbying in Washington.\u00a0The case has centered on a\u00a0report\u00a0commissioned by the government of Ukraine's then-leader Viktor Yankovych\u00a0that reviewed the criminal prosecution of\u00a0opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko. Craig said the report identified significant flaws with the handling of Tymoshenko\u2019s case. That conclusion went against the interests of the Ukrainian government, which clearly wanted the trial to be depicted as fair in order to counter international\u00a0criticism of the proceedings. Craig said he discussed the report\u2019s findings with Western journalists, including from The New York Times, only because he was concerned the media would portray it in Ukraine\u2019s favor. He testified that because his position was contrary to that of the Ukrainian government, he did not view himself as a foreign agent and did not think it necessary to register as one with the Justice Department. WHITE HOUSE SLAMS CHINA'S 'HIGHLY DUBIOUS' INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AS BOLTON WARNS UKRAINE Prosecutors have argued that Craig lied about his interactions with New York Times reporter David Sanger, claiming that Crag\u00a0told his partners at Skadden and\u00a0officials at the FARA Unit that he did not reach out to Sanger. However, emails between the two men revealed at trial show that Craig did contact Sanger about the report, even hand-delivering the report to Sanger's home before publication. \"He chose to conceal the facts and that was the crime,\" prosecutor Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez said of Craig during closing arguments.\"When the FARA Unit asked him questions, he concealed because at the end of the day, his reputation would have been tarnished.\" \"It's not a crime to work on a report, or even to get $4 million out of a bank account in Cyprus,\" Campoamor-Sanchez added. \"It is a crime to conceal. It is a crime to craft your answers so they don't even make sense. That is a crime.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Mr. Craig schemed to deceive his law firm and then the FARA Unit about what had actually happened... He wanted a result that he thought he was entitled to,\" prosecutor Jason McCullough said during the rebuttal. \"Hold him accountable ...\u00a0Find him guilty.\" The jury is set to receive instructions from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson Wednesday morning and will begin deliberations immediately after.

      "content": " Greg Craig, a prominent Washington lawyer and former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, was found not guilty by a jury Wednesday of false statements to the Justice Department about his work for the pro-Russian government of Ukraine in 2012. The verdict, which came after approximately four hours of deliberations in a Washington, D.C. federal courthouse, was a major setback for the DOJ's recently\u00a0redoubled efforts to scrutinize\u00a0unregistered overseas lobbying work. Craig, 74, hugged his attorneys after the verdict was read. One juror remarked after the verdict: \"What infuriates me, is that the special counsel wasted so much time on an issue like this one, while the republic itself is under assault.\" Other jurors said they found Craig to be credible if not entirely forthright in some of his communications, and that it was difficult to find Craig had specifically committed a crime within the \"narrow\" period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations.\u00a0Jurors would have needed to find criminal conduct after October 3, 2013 -- although some said they had concerns about Craig's conduct before that cutoff date. \"He walked up to the line and may very well have crossed it,\" another juror said. Craig attorney\u00a0William Taylor\u00a0told reporters after the verdict that it was a \"tragedy\" and a \"disgrace\" that the DOJ had decided to \"hound\" Craig even after the Southern District of New York passed on prosecuting him. But for his part, Craig struck an upbeat tone. \"I have a few things to say,\" Craig said.\u00a0\"One is, I first want to thank the jury for your service, and for doing justice in this case, I am thankful for them in so many ways. I want to thank my family and my friends who were with me throughout all of this, and I want to thank my lawyers who made it all possible. and that's all. Thank you.\" In April, Craig became the first prominent Democrat to be\u00a0indicted\u00a0in a case arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's\u00a0now-completed probe\u00a0into Russian election interference. Mueller\u00a0referred the Craig case to prosecutors in New York last year\u00a0after uncovering possible wrongdoing while he investigated former Trump campaign manager Paul\u00a0Manafort's Ukraine lobbying. The grand jury indicted Craig on\u00a0two counts of making false and misleading statements to\u00a0investigators -- including Mueller's team and the DOJ National Security Division's FARA\u00a0Unit -- in connection with his\u00a0work on behalf of Russia-backed former President of Ukraine\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych. One of those counts was\u00a0dismissed before trial. The work that drew the Justice Department's attention occurred in 2012, when Craig and his law firm at the time \u2014 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom \u2014 were engaged by the government of Ukraine to review the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister, and produce a report on whether the trial met Western standards of justice. Tymoshenko was a political opponent of Yanukovych, a longtime Manafort patron and a political figure whom Manafort associate Rick Gates said he and Manafort had helped get elected. The report was billed as independent, but critics have said it whitewashed a politically motivated prosecution, and Gates acknowledged on the witness stand that the document was conceived as a way to counter international criticism that Tymoshenko had been denied a fair trial. WHY DID MICHAEL FLYNN FIRE ALL HIS LAWYERS? Craig did not register his work with a Justice Department unit tasked with enforcing FARA. Prosecutors said he resisted registering because he feared it would prevent him or others at the firm from getting federal jobs in the future, and because he believed doing so would have meant disclosing that a third party had paid more than $4 million for the report. Though prosecutors did not charge\u00a0Craig with failing to register, they had said he gave misleading information when the Justice Department's FARA unit contacted the firm about the work and whether it required registration. In February 2012, prosecutors said, Craig emailed the co-author of the report, writing,\u00a0\"I don't want to register as a foreign agent under FARA. I think we don't have to with this assignment, yes?\" Two months later, Craig emailed,\u00a0\"I don't really care who you ask [about the FARA requirements] but we need an answer from someone who we can rely on with a straight face.\" On December 15, 2012, after the report's release, a lobbyist wrote to Craig that media coverage on the report was glowing: \"You are back in the headlines internationally. ... People in Kiev are very happy. You are 'THE MAN.'\" Prosecutors have argued that Craig lied about his interactions with New York Times reporter David Sanger, claiming that Crag\u00a0told his partners at Skadden and\u00a0officials at the FARA Unit that he did not reach out to Sanger. However, emails between the two men revealed at trial showed that Craig did contact Sanger about the report, even hand-delivering the report to Sanger's home before publication. \"He chose to conceal the facts and that was the crime,\" prosecutor Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez said of Craig during closing arguments.\"When the FARA Unit asked him questions, he concealed because at the end of the day, his reputation would have been tarnished.\" \"It's not a crime to work on a report, or even to get $4 million out of a bank account in Cyprus,\" Campoamor-Sanchez added. \"It is a crime to conceal. It is a crime to craft your answers so they don't even make sense. That is a crime.\" During the trial, Craig took the stand in his own defense, and said the report identified significant flaws with the handling of Tymoshenko\u2019s case. That conclusion went against the interests of the Ukrainian government, which clearly wanted the trial to be depicted as fair in order to counter international\u00a0criticism of the proceedings. Craig said he discussed the report\u2019s findings with Western journalists, including from The New York Times, only because he was concerned the media would portray it in Ukraine\u2019s favor. He testified that because his position was contrary to that of the Ukrainian government, he did not view himself as a foreign agent and did not think it necessary to register as one with the Justice Department. Defense attorney William Murphy, in closing arguments that lasted about two hours, maintained that Craig\u00a0\"did not knowingly and willfully act to deceive\" the FARA Unit and\u00a0allegations that his legal services crossed a line into foreign lobbying were untrue. \"Did he really have a motive to lie and impugn his own reputation?\" Murphy asked. \"He had no motive to lie and he didn't lie.\" Alex van der Zwaan, a former Craig associate at Skadden, pleaded guilty to lying to authorities and served a 30-day prison sentence last year. Craig also likely would have faced little prison time had he been convicted. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Craig prosecution came\u00a0amid an ongoing Justice Department crackdown on unregistered lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of foreign governments and other entities. The Mueller team relied on FARA to pursue top former Trump aides, including Michael Flynn and Manafort, even though FARA had\u00a0rarely been enforced\u00a0in the past. The FARA law, enacted in 1938 to unmask Nazi propaganda in the United States, requires people to disclose to the Justice Department when they advocate, lobby or perform public relations work in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign government or political entity. Craig, who is now retired, has represented a litany of powerful political figures in his decades-long legal career. He worked on President Bill Clinton's defense during impeachment proceedings, and also represented former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and James Cartwright, a retired general and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Craig also served as an adviser to the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Fox News' Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Chris Stirewalt",
      "content": " President Obama wants you to buy health insurance. Like, a lot. The president has undertaken a months-long effort to convince people, particularly the Millennials who populate his political base, to give their business to America\u2019s largest insurance companies. This sounds odd for a guy who used a populist pitchforking of \u201cbig insurance\u201d to goose his health law over the finish line in 2010. But it\u2019s not as odd as you might think. Obama built his law in private in conjunction with the same companies he was skewering in public. The same goes for the drug companies that were the preferred targets of Democrats for most of the pre-ObamaCare era. Why? Unable to unite his party behind his vision for a government-run insurance program open to all Americans, Obama outsourced the sales job to insurance and drug companies to get the deal done. His pitchfork routine was in part about gaining an upper hand in negotiations with his insurance and PhRMA \u00a0partners, but mostly about appeasing liberal lawmakers who were unhappy that Obama\u2019s more liberal vision had vanished. They got Hillary Clinton\u2019s health law even though they elected Obama. But it was insurance and drug lobbyists who did the hard work of squeezing moderates into the already unpopular plan. They sold what Obama could not. Now, it\u2019s his turn. Polifact\u2019s latest scorecard found that Obama has kept 45 percent of his campaign promises. But one promise on which he absolutely needs to deliver is the one to insurance and drug companies to send millions of young, healthy customers through their doors. Even with lots of free stuff to give away, it\u2019s proving difficult. Republicans once worried a great deal about ObamaCare\u2019s mandates, and perhaps one day the penalties under the law will be so great that people will be dragged into coverage. But for now, the problem with the law is more about people blowing off the mandate. [pullquote] This is understandable since the law actually provides a perverse discouragement from people buying insurance. The president, who sounds like their parents, is telling young people to take precautions and buy insurance, just in case. But his law has eliminated the \u201cin case\u201d part. Starting Tuesday, insurance companies can no longer deny anyone coverage. If you go your whole life without a policy and get diagnosed with a terrible ailment, you will still be able to purchase insurance, which kind of defeats the whole idea of insurance. What had been an exercise in risk tolerance now includes no risk at all. The solution was supposed to be that the federal government would force people to buy insurance, thereby evening out the waves in the risk pool. But, again, because the president couldn\u2019t build a coalition for his law among Democrats, he ended up with a half-hearted mandate. The result is that people who didn\u2019t want to buy insurance before have lost the risk formerly attendant to not buying coverage and it will only cost them $95 next year. And since every day brings some new, unhappy headline about the law \u2013 the IRS losing track of tens of millions of dollars in funds, more employers dumping workers or coverage, more unions demanding fixes, more worries about data security, more confusion about costs and coverage and always more news about higher and higher premiums \u2013 it may sound like a good idea to wait, enjoy the new mandatory coverage rules, pay the small fine out of your 2015 tax refund and see what happens. So, Obama is hitting the sales circuit, knocking on the doors of his supporters to ask that they check out the latest offerings from his partners at big insurance. And by the way, try some of these delicious new full-price pharmaceuticals. Guaranteed non-imported. It\u2019s not as if Obama likely feels some deep desire to make good on his word to insurance companies and drug makers. There\u2019s no commission arrangement. But what he does know is that if he can\u2019t get enough of his supporters through the doors for his partners, premiums are going to rise even more than expected. And that means broad-based resistance to the law will grow and that means the chances for it eventually being entirely or substantially replaced grow, too. Like Ashton Kutcher and other early-adopting celebrities on Twitter, Obama has turned his onetime grassroots network into a sales platform for product placement and for steering fans into the grasp of marketers.

      "content": "Before Barack Obama ever met his wife, Michelle, at her Chicago law firm, the future 44th president of the United States asked another woman to marry him in 1986\u2014while the two were visiting her parents' home, a new biography claims. \u201cRising Star,\u201d which is written by David J. Garrow, was reviewed Tuesday in The Washington Post. The review said, \"Garrow portrays Obama as a man who ruthlessly compartmentalized his existence; who believed early on that he was fated for greatness; and who made emotional sacrifices in the pursuit of a goal that must have seemed unlikely to everyone but him.\" According to the review, Sheila Miyoshii Jager, his love interest, refused his advances at the time because her mother said she was too young. She was 23 and Obama was 25. The two continued to see each other, but Jager told Garrow that shortly after the proposal, Obama became more ambitious. \u201cI remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president,\u201d she said, according to the book. She told Garrow that Obama\u2019s \u201cresolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,\u201d according to the review. Jager is of Dutch and Japanese ancestry. The review pointed out that Obama-- who was a community organizer at the time-- was eyeing a political run for mayor of Chicago or a U.S. Senator. The review pointed out another book that said at the time, it could be seen as a political liablity for a black politican in the area to have a wife that was not African-American. The review pointed out that Jager, now a professor at Oberlin College, was all but written out of Obama\u2019s famous book \u201cDreams From My Father.\u201d Obama went off to Harvard Law School and met Michelle Robinson at the Chicago law firm where she was employed, wrote Garrow, who received the Pulizter Prize for his biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. \u201cBarack and Sheila had continued to see each other irregularly throughout the 1990-91 academic year, notwithstanding the deepening of Barack\u2019s relationship with Michelle Robinson,\u201d Garrow wrote, according to the review. \u201cI always felt bad about it,\u201d Jager reportedly said.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama still aren't saying what they will\u00a0do with money they received from Democratic megadonor\u00a0Ed Buck, even after he was charged Tuesday with running a drug house where two men died of overdoses -- and months after other top Democrats have tossed aside Buck's contributions. Buck, 65, has donated more than $500,000 to a range of Democratic groups and politicians, including\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates such as Gov. Gavin Newsom. Buck is also well known in LGBTQ political circles. He\u00a0came under investigation in January after 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead of an accidental methamphetamine overdose in his apartment. It was the second such death in two years, following the July 2017 death of Gemmel Moore, 26. The January episode\u00a0prompted many Democrats to cut ties with Buck.\u00a0The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) told Fox News at the time it was \"deeply disturbed\" by Buck's alleged conduct, and quickly donated his thousands of dollars of contributions to the NALEO Education Fund. Other politicians also distanced themselves from Buck, and vowed to get rid of his campaign contributions. \u201cI am deeply disturbed by the latest revelations of a second death by overdose at the home of Ed Buck,\u201d California Democratic Rep.\u00a0Ted\u00a0Lieu said\u00a0in January,\u00a0announcing plans to donate more than $18,000 in contributions to civil rights charities. \u201cI received a campaign contribution from Ed Buck and have donated the amount I received to a local charity, the Kenneth Young Center, to combat drug addiction,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois also said earlier this year. But\u00a0former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama remained quiet on the subject in January -- and their spokespeople on Wednesday didn't\u00a0respond to Fox News' request for comment on what they would do with their donations from Buck. Buck donated at least $1,500 to\u00a0Obama and $2,950 to Clinton, according to federal records. Obama has recently waded into the 2020 presidential race, and met this week with youth climate activist Greta Thunberg. 'DEEPLY DISTURBED': DEMS CUT TIES WITH BUCK AFTER BODIES KEEP PILING UP Even as Clinton and Obama stayed silent,\u00a0The Los Angeles County Democratic Party praised Buck's arrest on Wednesday\u00a0and said progressive activists deserved credit. \"For our community, a predator with a Jekyll and Hyde personality is now off the streets,\" the LACDP said. \"And it is due to the ongoing support and pressure from many activists and community groups including Black Lives Matter, Jasmyne Cannick and more.\" The LACDP\u00a0told Fox News that they had not received money from Buck, and urged other Democrats to \"be conscientious\" on the matter. \"The LA Dems have not received money from Ed Buck in my tenure,\" LACPD Chair Mark J. Gonz\u00e1lez said in an email. \"Outside our County party, I would strongly encourage Democrats to be conscientious of the contributions they receive.\" Meanwhile, a black member of Congress on Wednesday called it\u00a0\"incomprehensible\" that the\u00a0wealthy gay activist has skirted punishment for so long.\u00a0Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif.,\u00a0on Wednesday specifically called Buck a predator and said authorities let him roam free even after two people died at his house. Prosecutors say Buck used his position of power to manipulate male victims into participating in sexual fetishes that involved injecting them with meth. In a motion Wednesday, prosecutors said Buck should be held on $4 million bail because he is a \"violent, dangerous sexual predator\" who offered drugs, money and shelter to mainly addicted and homeless men in exchange for participating in sexual fetishes, including a fetish that involved administering dangerous doses of drugs. Buck \"has no regard for human life,\" the motion said. Messages to Buck's attorney, Seymour Amster, were not returned. Buck's attorney had said Dean came to Buck's home under the influence and didn't ingest any drugs while there. In their bail motion, however, prosecutors specifically blamed Buck's actions for the two deaths and they alleged he personally gave a dangerous dose of methamphetamine to a man who survived an overdose earlier this month. On Sept. 11, the man returned and Buck injected him with two more dangerous doses, refused to help him and \"thwarted\" his efforts to get help until the man fled the apartment and called 911 from a gas station, prosecutors alleged. \"His deadly behavior has not stopped,\" prosecutors contended.

Cory Booker and Kamala Harris on Thursday defended their criticisms of former Vice President Joe Biden at Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, arguing that the presidency of former President Barack Obama, who remains wildly popular among Democrats, is not above criticism. \u2026 While there was virtually no criticism of Obama by name, attacks on his record were directed regularly at Biden\u2026 Booker argued that no politician, no matter how well-liked, should be above reproach. Asked in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 whether it \u2018made sense\u2019 for Democrats to be carping about Obama\u2019s tenure instead of President Donald Trump, Booker insisted that the intra-party criticism should not be out of bounds. \u2026 [Harris\u2019] criticisms of Obama were rooted more in her desire to replace the Affordable Care Act with a transition to a Medicare for All-style health care plan\u2026 [In] an interview on CNN\u2019s \u2018New Day,\u2019 Booker framed his critiques as mere tough love, and had even more praise for the former president\u2026\u201d\n\nKraushaar: Democrats rebuke Obama\u2019s legacy at their own peril - National Journal: \u201cAny Democrat watching the last two nights of presidential debates would be struck by the absence of praise for the party\u2019s most popular president in memory: Barack Obama. Aside from Joe Biden, none of the 20 candidates on the debate stage had many fond memories of the legacy of the man that no Democrats dared criticize during his eight years in office. That\u2019s political malpractice. When President Obama has become too conservative for the Democratic Party is the day the Democratic Party has lost touch with mainstream America. And it\u2019s why Biden, one of the few candidates to proudly tout his associations with the former president, came out on top Wednesday night. As former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder warned after the two-day debate extravaganza: \u2018To my fellow Democrats. Be wary of attacking the Obama record.\u2019 \u2026 That this needs to be explained is incredible.\u201d\n\nEdward-Isaac Dovere: The Democratic primary is right back where it started - Atlantic: \u201cThere\u2019s an elevated train [in Detroit], in the city\u2019s downtown, called the People Mover. \u2026 It\u2019s a lot like the Democratic primary, after two rounds of formal debate and seven months of campaigning. There have been flashes of dynamism in the campaign so far, candidates who\u2019ve popped for a news cycle or two. But take a step back, and the race has barely changed since before the weather grew warm. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the front-runner in every poll, but he\u2019s a weak front-runner\u2026 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is holding on to his core voters, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be expanding their ranks. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Senator Kamala Harris of California; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are always in the mix in third or fourth place. And then there\u2019s everyone else\u2026 The only major change is that former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, a onetime front-runner, is now firmly a part of the latter tier.\u201d\n\nOn to the next debate - NYT: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee has set stricter criteria for the third set of debates, which will be held on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 in Houston. If 10 or fewer candidates qualify, the debate will take place on only one night. Candidates will need to have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls. They have until Aug. 28 to reach those benchmarks. These criteria could easily halve the field: The first two sets of debates included 20 of the 24 candidates, but a New York Times analysis of polls and donor numbers shows that only 10 to 12 candidates are likely to make the third round. Seven candidates have already met both qualification thresholds and are guaranteed a spot on stage. They are: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Cory Booker \u2026 Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2026 Senator Kamala Harris \u2026 Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2026 Senator Bernie Sanders [and] Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2026\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: PREPAREDNESS IS KEY\n\u201cNo form of government can always either avoid or control [mortal feuds].

The legislation increases spending caps and suspends the debt ceiling, allowing for more government borrowing until July 31, 2021 \u2013 after the next presidential election. The measure, once signed by the president, would permit the government to resume borrowing to pay all its bills and would set an overall $1.37 trillion limit on agency budgets approved by Congress annually. It also would remove the prospect of a government shutdown in October and automatic spending cuts. \u2026 Many conservatives were torn between supporting the president and risking their political brand with an unpopular vote to add such a tremendous sum to the government\u2019s credit card. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, supported the deal, along with other establishment leaders including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\u201d\n\nSenate confirms 13 Trump judges before recess - The Hill: \u201cThe Senate confirmed 13 of President Trump's judicial picks this week, helping clear the deck ahead of the five-week August recess. The nominees were split up throughout the week with four confirmation votes taking place on Tuesday and nine on Wednesday, three of which were by voice votes. \u2026 Republicans have placed a premium on confirming Trump's judicial picks, arguing that they are the best shot at having a long-term impact on the direction of the country. \u2026 The confirmation of 13 nominees is down from the 19 judges Senate Republicans had planned to confirm before leaving Washington until September. The other judges are expected to get a vote once the Senate returns in September.\u201d\n\nDEMS, DOJ REACH AGREEMENT FOR MUELLER EVIDENCE \u00a0\nPolitico: \u201cHouse Democrats weighing the impeachment of President Donald Trump have agreed to a two-month schedule of court filings with the Justice Department in an effort to obtain special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury material. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, who say accessing Mueller\u2019s files is necessary to determine whether they will ultimately recommend articles of impeachment against Trump, agreed to the timetable, which would likely result in an October ruling. Though that\u2019s a reasonable pace for legal argumentation, it\u2019s sure to frustrate Democrats agitating for Trump\u2019s impeachment, who have argued that the closer their effort gets to presidential primary season, the more impractical it becomes. \u2026 Under the schedule, jointly proposed by the committee and Justice Department, department lawyers would file their first brief in the matter by Sept. 13 and the Judiciary Committee would reply by Sept. 30. Justice Department officials said they expected no oral argument would be necessary in the case, but it\u2019s up to the judge \u2014 Chief U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia Judge Beryl Howell \u2014 to decide.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nDOJ will not prosecute Comey for leaking memos after IG referral - Fox News\n\nKelly Craft confirmed to become next US ambassador to UN - AP\n\nCorey Lewandowski strongly considering run for Senate in New Hampshire - Fox News\n\nWhite House scrambling to find health care wins for Trump campaign - WaPo\n\nAUDIBLE: HOMEWARD BOUND \n\u201cAll of us want to get back to where there\u2019s a lot of sanity.

The impeachment probe was launched\u00a0last month after an intelligence community\u00a0whistleblower's complaint\u00a0raised concerns about the\u00a0call.

      "content": " President Trump has met resistance from both parties after his decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, but some of the rhetoric coming from Democrats is almost the opposite of what came from party members when President Barack Obama pulled forces out of Iraq. California Democrats Rep. Maxine Waters and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, have been vocal opponents of Trump's troop withdrawal, after supporting Obama's efforts almost exactly eight years later. ERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM \u201cAs the war in Iraq draws to a close, it is my hope that this conflict will serve as a solemn reminder of the costs of war,\u201d Waters said in a statement issued Oct. 21, 2011.\u00a0\u201cWe must carefully reexamine our approach to national security and how we view the United States' role in promoting international peace and security.\u00a0 If we are to remain leaders in the world, we must always use our best judgment to determine when and how we engage other nations and other actors \u2013 particularly if we are considering the use of military force.\u201d Waters\u2019 approach to the United States\u2019 role in world affairs is similar to Trump\u2019s recent warnings against \u201cfighting other people\u2019s wars.\u201d Cut to Oct. 7, 2019, and Waters blasted Trump for leaving Kurdish forces to fend for themselves against Turkish attacks. \u201cIf the United States abandons the Kurds, these courageous allies will never trust us again,\u201d Waters said in a statement, adding that \u201cTrump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is a gift to Russia, Iran and ISIS.\u201d That same day, Pelosi came out against Trump, warning that leaving northern Syria could lead to an ISIS resurgence. DEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH' \u201cThis reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS\u2019s tyranny,\u201d she said. But while Republicans had similar concerns about withdrawing from Iraq in 2011, Pelosi praised Obama \u201cfor a promise made and a promise kept, honoring the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year.\u201d Pelosi stormed out of a meeting with Trump Wednesday after what she said was a \"meltdown\" by the president. One of the Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also critical of Trump, despite being historically anti-war. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn your back on an ally that lost 11,000 troops fighting against terrorism through a tweet and a discussion with Erdogan,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. This criticism came despite Sanders acknowledgment that \u201cI am a strong opponent of endless wars.\u201d That position was made evident in 2011 when Sanders backed Obama\u2019s Iraq withdrawal. \u201cI applaud the president's decision and have been advocating that position for quite a while,\u201d adding, \u201cNow is the time to bring our troops home, lower our military budget, and use those funds to create jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure and lowering our national debt.\" On Thursday, Trump vented about Democratic criticism. \"I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it,\" he said. Republicans have been equally critical of Trump, with 129 GOP members voting for a resolution in opposition to the withdrawal, joining a unanimous Democratic contingent. Sen. Lindsey Graham has been particularly vocal, leading Trump to accuse the senator of wanting to \u201cstay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Graham, however, was no supporter of Obama, and lumped Trump and his predecessor together in making what he believes to be critical foreign policy errors. \u201cPresident Trump is being told EXACTLY what President Obama was told before he withdrew from Iraq,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. \u201cHe appears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq.\u201d",

Jan Brewer on Thursday took aim at \u201chypocrites\u201d in the media who she says have branded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0a hero for pointing her finger at President Trump -- despite calling Brewer a racist for doing something similar to former President Obama. \"The news media hails @SpeakerPelosi as a hero for pointing her finger at @POTUS @realDonaldTrump but when I stood up to @BarackObama I was vilified as rude and racist,\" she tweeted. Trump on Wednesday tweeted a picture of the contentious White House meeting on Syria, showing Pelosi, D-Calif., pointing her finger at him as they argued back-and-forth. Democrats eventually stormed out of the meeting, accusing Trump of having called the speaker a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he tweeted with the photo. But Pelosi soon made it her Twitter banner, and it was quickly hailed by some in the media as a win for the speaker. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nancy Pelosi \u2018meltdown\u2019 tweet was the perfect self-own.

According to Brewer, the president had objected to her portrayal of him as dismissive and patronizing in her book, \"Scorpions for Breakfast.\" The cameras caught her waving her finger at Obama, something for which she received a flood of criticism. A New York Times op-ed, for instance, accused Brewer of treating the president \u201cas if he were some errand boy and not the commander-in-chief.\u201d The Washington Free Beacon\u00a0on Friday\u00a0published a video called \"A Tale of Two Fingers,\" contrasting the treatment of Brewer and Pelosi, showing anchors and commentating praising the \"iconic\" photo of Pelosi \"standing in a room full of men,\" before contrasting that with media voices complaining about Brewer's \"incredibly disrespectful\" treatment of Obama. \u201cI was vilified as rude and racist.

      "content": " Joe Biden insisted he\u2019s still the front-runner in the Democratic presidential nomination race, downplayed the lack of an endorsement by former President Barack Obama, defended his son\u2019s actions in Ukraine, and called President Trump an \u201cidiot,\u201d as he faced tough questions during an interview broadcast Sunday night on \"60 Minutes.\" The former vice president \u2013 who was the unrivaled front-runner from even before he announced his candidacy in late April\u00a0\u2013 is now tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0at the top of many national and early voting state polls. BIDEN SUPER PAC REVERSAL COMES AMID FUNDRAISING STRUGGLE Biden said he still considers himself the leader in the race for the nomination, emphasizing, \u201cI know\u00a0I'm\u00a0the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable \u2014 a couple exceptions (sic).\u00a0But\u00a0look, this is a marathon.\" Yet Biden has been underperforming when it comes to another key metric \u2014\u00a0fundraising. He raised just $15.2 million during the July-September quarter, far behind top-tier rivals Warren and\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\u00a0And as of Oct. 1,\u00a0he had just $9 million cash-on-hand, far behind Sanders \u2013 who had nearly $34 million in the bank \u2013 and Warren,\u00a0who had $26 million in her campaign coffers. Asked by CBS'\u00a0Nora O\u2019Donnell how he can compete against that, the former vice president answered, \"I just flat beat them,\u201d as he laughed. \u201cWe're\u00a0on\u00a0a course to do extremely well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0not worried about\u00a0being able to fund this campaign.\u00a0I\u00a0really am not, truly.\" Biden was also pressed on the lack of endorsement from Obama,\u00a0his boss for eight years in the White House. \"I\u00a0want to\u00a0earn this on my own,\" he stressed. But asked if the former president offered to back him, Biden said, \u201cNo, we\u00a0didn't\u00a0even get there. I asked him not to. He said, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d Biden added: \u201cI think\u00a0it's\u00a0better \u2014 I think he thinks it's better for me. I have no doubt when\u00a0I'm\u00a0the nominee he'll be out on the campaign trail for me.\" THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN The former vice president took aim at Trump over the president\u2019s repeated comments that Russian interference in U.S. elections is a hoax. \"He's an idiot, in terms of\u00a0sayin' that. Everybody knows this. Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it,\u201d Biden highlighted. And asked how he would respond to Trump\u2019s accusation that \u201cJoe Biden and his son are stone-cold corrupt,\u201d Biden said, \u201cLet's see how straight you are, OK old\u00a0buddy? I put out 21 years of mine.\u00a0So show us your tax returns ... what are you\u00a0hidin'? You\u00a0want to\u00a0deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release\u00a0your tax returns or shut up.\" As the president faces an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and as support for impeaching and removing the president increases, Trump and his allies have repeatedly tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how\u00a0Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 who had been\u00a0widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office\u00a0\u2013 was later dismissed. Pressed by O\u2019Donnell on whether he considered the optics of his son working for the Ukrainian company during his years in the White House, Biden contended that Hunter was already on the board when he took office. Biden has said repeatedly that the only thing he asked his son about regarding sitting on the board of the company was, \"I hope you know what you're doing.\" Asked what he meant by that, Biden answered, \u201cWhat I meant by that is I hope you've thought this through.\u201d \"I hope you know exactly what you're doing here. That's all I meant. Nothing more than that, because I've never discussed my business or their business, my sons' or daughter's. And I've never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgments,\u201d he explained. And Biden took aim at Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner,\u00a0 who serve as top advisers in the administration. Biden vowed that he if gets \u201celected president,\u00a0my children are not\u00a0going to\u00a0have offices in the White House. My children are not\u00a0going to\u00a0sit in on Cabinet meetings. ... It's\u00a0just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you're doing is for them. For them.\u00a0And\u00a0the idea that\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0going to\u00a0have\u00a0his children\u00a0his \u2014 son-in-law, etcetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of\u00a0things they know nothing about.\u201d TRUMP CAMPAIGN RETURNS FIRE AFTER BIDEN '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW Trump\u2019s reelection campaign defended Ivanka and Jared and took aim at Hunter Biden, saying, \u201cHunter Biden would never have an office in the White House because he\u2019s proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden.\u201d",

And how we approach that I think will be important.\u201d The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race last year. Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama\u00a0has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party. On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform\u00a0as examples of\u00a0where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d respectively in recent weeks. Warren\u2019s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders\u2019 immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations. SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. The comment about\u00a0Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at \u201cwoke\u201d virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to \u201cget over\u201d their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

      "content": "CHICAGO\u2014 Former President Barack Obama, free of a job that forced him to move to Washington for eight years, showed up to a downtown Chicago courthouse for jury duty on Wednesday morning. The 44th president\u2019s motorcade \u2014 considerably shorter than the one he had when he lived in the White House \u2014 left his home in the Kenwood neighborhood on the city\u2019s South Side and arrived at the Richard J. Daley Center shortly after 10 a.m. Obama \u2014 wearing a dark sport coat, dress shirt, but without a tie \u2014 waved to people who gathered outside after hearing reports that he would be reporting for jury duty. Whether he will be selected to sit on a jury, and presumably be selected jury foreman, was not known. But if he is like other would-be jurors, Obama will have to watch a decades-old video in which a much younger Lester Holt, who was a local news anchor before he became a national news anchor, explains the ins-and-outs of jury duty. Obama is also in line to receive the $17.20 a day that jurors are paid for performing their civic duty. Obama is the highest-ranking former public official to be called to jury duty in Chicago, and almost certainly the only one who ever arrived with a Secret Service detail. But he is not the first former president to be called to jury duty. In 2015, former President George W. Bush answered the jury duty call in Dallas. He was not selected to sit on a jury. And in 2003, former President Bill Clinton reported for jury duty in federal court in New York City. He also was not selected. Nor is he the first famous Chicagoan to be called to jury duty. In 2004, Oprah Winfrey was on a Chicago jury that convicted a man of murder. A decade later, Lawrence Tureaud, better known as Mr. T, showed up to a suburban Chicago courthouse for jury duty, sporting his usual Mohawk, but without the gold chains for which he is known. But despite the more subdued outfit, Mr. T was not chosen to sit on a jury.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner. Obama\u00a0has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders. But a\u00a0new Politico\u00a0Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win. OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM' \"Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,\" the report says.\u00a0An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is. One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action. \"I can't really confirm that,\" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. \"He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.\" This aversion to\u00a0Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political \"wokeness\" and cancel culture. \"This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,\" Obama said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama\u00a0warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not\u00a0want to \u201ctear down the system.\u201d Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump. The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded.\u00a0He reportedly added, \u201cAnd you know who really doesn\u2019t have it? Joe Biden.\u201d Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement. Fox News' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Former\u00a0President Barack Obama is back in the political arena, announcing a new initiative to combat partisan gerrymandering \u2014\u00a0though Republicans say the efforts are really about helping Democrats. The \"Redistricting U\" program, which\u00a0is part of the \"All on the Line\" campaign,\u00a0aims to recruit and train individuals to take up the fight against drawing congressional districts based on partisan interests. SUPREME COURT SAYS FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE NO ROLE IN POLICING GERRYMANDERING, LEAVING POLITICAL MAPS IN PLACE \u201cTraining is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2014\u00a0from my 2008 campaign until now,\" Obama tweeted Monday. \"And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U.\" Republicans, though, have accused Democrats of making it sound like they want fairness\u00a0\u2014\u00a0when in reality they are hoping to place\u00a0their party in a better position. \u201cIf anyone tells you that @EricHolder is \u2018fighting against gerrymandering\u2019 and for \u2018fair maps,\u2019 just look at the form his organization filed with the IRS,\u201d former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted last week. \u201cThe truth: their mission is to \u2018FAVORABLY POSITION DEMOCRATS FOR THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS.\u2019\u201d \"Redistricting U\" was created in February after Obama merged his Organizing for Action\u00a0group with former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s National Redistricting Action Fund. According to \"All on the Line's\"\u00a0website, \"Redistricting U\" will be \u201csending dedicated trainers to cities across the country to train volunteers, give them the tools to impact the redistricting process in their state, hear from them on how to best make change in their communities, and empower them to be leaders in the movement for fair maps.\u201d 2020 HOPEFULS DEFEND THEIR OBAMA-ERA CRITICISMS The organization is focused on impacting the redrawing of congressional districts, which will take place in 2021 following the collection of data in the 2020 census. They warn against \u201crigged electoral maps drawn with surgical precision by politicians to preserve their party\u2019s political power and silence the will of the people.\u201d Partisan gerrymandering was a hot topic in the spring, when the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the issue, determining in a ruling in two cases that the judiciary should not get involved because it is a political issue best left to lawmakers. One of the Supreme Court cases, Benisek v. Lamone, involved North Carolina, where Republicans had benefited from gerrymandering. \"All on the Line\" identified North Carolina as one of 10\u00a0\u201cpriority states,\u201d along with Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. OBAMAS PLACED AN OFFER ON 'MEGA-EXPENSIVE' ESTATE IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD Not on that list is Maryland, where Democrats had been accused of unfairly drawing district maps at the expense of Republicans in the Supreme Court\u2019s other partisan gerrymandering case, Rucho v. Common Cause. Since leaving office in January 2017, Obama has largely stayed\u00a0out of the political limelight, though he has occasionally weighed in on political issues, like gun control. He has been known to enjoy the perks of his post-presidency: it\u00a0was reported last week that the Obamas placed an offer\u00a0on a 29-acre\u00a0estate in Martha's Vineyard that had been listed at nearly $15 million.

Obama has not endorsed Biden in the race. \"You don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\" Obama reportedly told Biden in early 2019. Biden had been leading the Democratic pack in primary polls, but lately has been sharing the lead with Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.",

The new rule, proposed Thursday, reverses regulations under the Obama administration that required religious organizations to get a waiver in order to apply for an\u00a0HHS grant, unless they include sexual orientation as a protected trait\u00a0under anti-discrimination protections. EVANGELICAL LEADERS GATHER TO PRAY FOR TRUMP AT WHITE HOUSE, BLASTING IMPEACHMENT EFFORT The move angered LGBTQ activists and progressives, who argue\u00a0it will decrease the number of available homes \u2014\u00a0something that actually happened as local government and states enacted the Obama-era rule largely targeting Roman Catholic\u00a0and evangelical Protestant organizations, according to The Wall Street Journal. In an op-ed for WSJ Monday, Russell Moore said the Trump administration \"took a major step toward addressing the problem\" of religious organizations that hold a biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman being punished in \"proxy culture wars\" that don't focus on the \"welfare of children.\" FEDERAL JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLIC ADOPTION AGENCY IN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CASE AGAINST MICHIGAN Moore points to the city of Philadelphia barring Catholic Social Services from placing children in homes in March 2018 because of the Catholic Church's teaching on marriage, and Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel citing the rule when attempting to cancel a state-approved foster care and adoption services contract with St. Vincent Catholic Charities. \"Charities shouldn't have to choose between their religious views and beliefs, in putting that before helping the needy,\" Stephanie Hamill, Daily Caller video columnist, told Shannon Bream on \"Fox News @ Night.\" Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said the \"need for this action is unfortunately evident as various state and local governments have trampled upon religious freedom protections\u00a0and the First Amendment, forcing the shutdown of faith-based adoption providers that decline to leave their faith at the door.\" The Catholic Association told Fox News the rollback helps \"free\" religious organizations to help \"needy kids\" without having to violate their belief that children do best in a home with a married mom and dad. PAULA WHITE ON HOW SHE BECAME TRUMP'S SPIRITUAL ADVISER AND WHY HE'LL CARRY EVANGELICAL VOTE IN 2020 \"Agencies that find loving foster and adoptive homes shouldn\u2019t be subject to ideological shakedowns by the government,\u201d said Andrea Picciotti-Bayer, a legal adviser for The Catholic Association Foundation. Left-wing activists, however, argue\u00a0the administration's plan will reduce the number of qualified parents who want to adopt or foster a child. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"You really need to be the needs of needy in front of religious beliefs when it comes to these issues,\" Cathy Areu, Catalina Magazine founder, a Catholic herself, told Bream. \"Religious liberty is not a license to discriminate,\" the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a tweet. \"The needs of children in our foster care system must come first.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Barack was like the\u00a0\"responsible parent -- the one who told you to eat your carrots and go to bed on time,\" the former first lady said at the Simmons Leadership Conference in Boston, clearing her throat. \"And now perhaps we have the other parent in the house.\" Obama suggested those who voted for Trump did so because they thought it'd be \"fun.\" \u201cWe thought it\u2019d feel fun -- maybe it feels fun for now because we can eat candy all day and stay up late and not follow the rules,\" she continued. \"And we're going to at that point in time look at those two experiences and see how we feel.\" Earlier, the 54-year-old said her husband was \"born\" with patience and applauded his temperament. \"We're at a point in time where we have to figure out who we want to be as a nation, and we've had two stark examples of what we can be,\" Obama said. \"I certainly know what direction I want to go.\" The former first lady then went on to praise Hillary Clinton, who she deemed \"the best qualified candidate\" in the 2016 presidential race. She blamed poor voter turnout for Clinton's loss, urging young voters to turn out and vote their \"interests\" in upcoming elections. \"The question is: What's your interest now, young people?\" Obama said. \"And we've got some clear choices to make.\" Clinton \"wasn't perfect,\" Obama admitted. \"But she was way more perfect...\" Obama said, pausing with a grin as some audience members laughed and applauded \"...than many of the alternatives.\" Some applauded Obama's \"refreshing\" comments, calling her a \"truly amazing woman\" and someone who is \"deeply missed.\" Others, however, dismissed the former first lady's remarks and called the parenting metaphor \"rude.\" \"Literally why should a former First Lady trash talk in such a way and get attention for it?\" one Twitter user asked. \"She is sadly mistaken,\" another added. This isn't the first time Obama's comments have sparked controversy. Obama critcized women who voted for Trump, suggesting they voted against their own interests, in September 2017. \u201cAny woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice,\u201d Obama told the audience during a talk at a marketing conference in Boston, according to\u00a0Boston.com. The former first lady\u00a0insinuated female Trump supporters were just following suit. \"What does this mean for us as women?\u201d she asked, according to the\u00a0Washington Times. \u201cThat we look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, \u2018He\u2019s better for me. His voice is more true to me.\u2019 To me that just says, you don\u2019t like your voice. You just like the thing you\u2019re told to like.\u201d While Obama does not shy away from offering her political views, the former first lady did confirm -- once again -- that she does not plan on running for office in 2020, The Hill reported Thursday.",

Dan Pabon, D-Denver, presented the bill to the House Transportation and Energy Committee on Thursday. Democrats likely hope the bill will follow the same path that similar Republican proposals have taken.

Greg Abbott and the acting director of the Social Security agency, a Texas woman was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison Monday, a report said. Julia Poff, 47, who pleaded guilty to the charges in July, told District Judge Vanessa Gilmore, she and her family have helped dozens in need over the years and began citing Bible verses she and her husband, a co-defendant in the case, live by, The Houston Chronicle reported. WOMAN ACCUSED OF TRESPASSING AT CIA HQ, ALLEGEDLY BREAKS COURT ORDER, SHOWS UP AT OBAMA'S HOUSE \u201cMy problem is that I have a huge heart and I\u2019m too trusting of people,\u201d she told the judge. After Poff began citing the Biblical verses, Gilmore shut down Poff, asking her to explain her actions, the report said. \u201cTalk to me, don\u2019t be reading me Bible verses,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cI need to understand why you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve done good for so many people and how that squares with the fact that you made bombs and sent them ... with the intent to kill.\u201d At that point, Poff denied committing the crimes, The Chronicle reported. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing here. We had nothing to do with this. We did not do this,\u201d she said through tears.

The package was intercepted at a White House handling facility at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington D.C. The handling facility was evacuated and an FBI explosives expert confirmed it was a bomb, the report said. Investigators were able to link the box to Poff and her husband using a stray cat hair they found taped under the box\u2019s address label. Tests found the hair was consistent with hair taken from Poff\u2019s cat, according to prosecutors. Poff\u2019s daughter identified a cell phone found in the box as her old device. In addition, authorities found a transaction on Poff\u2019s debit card for a micro-USB box with the same barcode as the one found in the package, the report said. Two similar packages were mailed by Poff to Abbott and the acting Social Security Administration director. The package sent to Abbott, which contained explosives stuffed into a cigarette pack, was mailed in September 2016. The device did not explode because it was not opened in a way designed to set off the explosion. The Governor\u2019s Mansion was evacuated because of the incident, prosecutors said. Poff was angry with Abbott because she had not received child support from her ex-husband, court filings say. Her frustration with the governor stemmed from a legal battle with the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office, which began when Abbott led the agency. One month later, an explosive package was sent to the Social Security Administration, after Poff was denied Social Security disability benefits for a third time, court documents say. Poff worked at a fireworks stand for nine years, according to prosecutors, and \u201cknew what she was doing.\u201d This past July, Poff admitted she was solely responsible for sending the bombs, pleading guilty to transportation of explosives with intent to kill.

The resolution and the drama surrounding its passage exposed chasms in the Democratic caucus regarding Israel and marked a coup of sorts for a tight-knit band of House freshmen who \u2013 in a matter of hours \u2013 were able to shift the spotlight away from Omar\u2019s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks and refocus on issues like Islamophobia and pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. \u201cThe week was supposed to start off with a rebuke of Omar's anti-Semitic comments and it ended up turning into a long list of other hateful actions,\u201d House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News on Friday, saying the final product \u201cfell short of addressing the real problem.\u201d But the broadside delivered at Obama is highly unusual for any Democrat, especially one who has been in the House for two months and has already ticked off party elders with her outspokenness. DEM FROSH TURN TABLES ON ANTI-SEMITISM REBUKE, SHIFT SPOTLIGHT TO ISLAMOPHOBIA AND AIPAC POWER The House resolution, following a week of Democratic infighting over the language, was approved on a 407-23 vote. The measure originally was drafted in response to Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, suggesting last week that Israel supporters want U.S. lawmakers to pledge \u201callegiance\u201d to the Jewish state \u2013 which was widely condemned as echoing the age-old \u201cdual loyalties\u201d smear against Jewish politicians. Yet after Speaker Nancy Pelosi faced a rebellion in the ranks amid concerns the resolution would unfairly single out Omar, a Muslim, and increase security threats against her (she was recently the subject of an inflammatory poster at the West Virginia capitol falsely tying her to the 9/11 attacks), the resolution was overhauled. The result was a broad rebuke of bigotry, including anti-Semitism as well as \u201canti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities\u201d perpetrated by white supremacists and others. The resolution condemned \u201cdual loyalty\u201d accusations, but did not mention Omar by name. The fight exposed deep divisions in the party. But on the 2020 campaign trail, heavyweights came to Omar's side. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was raised Jewish, defended Omar, arguing that \u201cwe must not, however, equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel. MEGHAN McCAIN SLAMS REP. ILHAN OMAR'S 'BLATANTLY ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC' AMID BITTER TWITTER SPAT \u201cWhat I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate,\" the senator added. \u201cThat's wrong.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also slammed anti-Semitism but defended Omar. \u201cBranding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d she wrote in a statement obtained by Fox News. Many Democrats, while strong supporters of Israel, have concerns with the country\u2019s long-time prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CIRCLE THE WAGONS AROUND OMAR There was a similar response from Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who called out all instances of bigotry and worried about possible violence directed at Omar. \u201cYou can both support Israel and be loyal to our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.\" Harris spotlighted that \u201clike some of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, I am concerned that the spotlight being put on Congresswoman Omar may put her at risk.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was more critical of Omar in response to the controversy, while also accusing the GOP of \"hypocrisy.\" Fox News contacted President Obama\u2019s office for comment.

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama is staying silent on allegations surrounding Joe Biden, but he still has his ex-VP\u2019s back, a new report claims. Obama hasn\u2019t commented publicly on allegations from a number of women that the former vice president touched them inappropriately. But someone close to Obama said the former president still views Biden as someone who could be an \u201cexcellent\u201d commander-in-chief, according to a new report. \u201cHe's spent an infinite amount of time talking about his character, and they remain in touch and good friends,\u201d a source close to the former president said, The Hill reported. STACEY ABRAMS DEFENDS BIDEN AMID ALLEGATIONS, SAYS 'PERFECTION' CAN'T BE 'LITMUS TEST,' PEOPLE SHOULD 'FORGIVE' \u201cPresident Obama thinks the world of him and thinks he'd be an excellent president.\u201d The source reportedly continued: \u201cPresident Obama is not going to be weighing in on the primary and the day-to-day stories around it. \u201cAnd Joe Biden would be the first to tell you that he'll have to earn the nomination on his own.\u201d The report comes as Biden prepares to make his first public appearance since a number of women came forward this week accusing him of inappropriate touching. DEM STRATEGIST: REPUBLICANS FOCUS ON JOE BIDEN ALLEGATIONS BECAUSE HE'S THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATE 'DONALD TRUMP FEARS THE MOST' Biden, who is expected to formally announce his candidacy for president after Easter, is scheduled to speak at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The first woman to accuse Biden of inappropriate behavior was Nevada politician Lucy Flores, who said he came up behind her at a 2014 campaign event and kissed her on the back of the head. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Another accuser told the Washington Post that, when she was a White House intern in 2013, Biden put his head against hers and called her a \"pretty girl.\" Another accuser, writer D.J. Hill, said Biden put his hand on her shoulder and dropped it down her back in a way that made her \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d at a 2012 fundraiser. In a video tweeted Thursday, Biden said, \u201cSocial norms are changing. I understand that, and I\u2019ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That\u2019s my responsibility and I will meet it.\u201d",

      "content": " Illinois government offices remained open Saturday as the home state of former President Barack Obama commemorated his birthday under a new state law. The bill marking Aug. 4 as \u201cBarack Obama Day\u201d throughout the state was enacted without making the date a full-scale holiday. The Illinois House narrowly rejected a plan to make Obama\u2019s birthday a state holiday amid worries that the cash-strapped state could not afford to give state state employees another paid day off. Obama turned 57. The law hailed Obama\u2019s efforts to protect the rights of Americans and build \u201cbridges across communities.\u201d \"It's incredibly proud for Illinois that the president came from Illinois. I think it's awesome, and I think we should celebrate it,\" Gov. Bruce Rauner said in signing the measure into law, according to TheHill. \"I don't think it should be a formal holiday with paid, forced time off, but I think it should be a day of acknowledgment and celebration.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, wished Obama a happy birthday on Twitter, saying \u201c57 never looked so good,\u201d according to the publication. Former first lady Michelle Obama also wished her husband a happy birthday on Twitter, saying, \u201cThe view is always better with you.\u201d Illinois, California and Wisconsin celebrate Ronald Reagan Day every Feb. 6 in honor of the late Republican president\u2019s birthday, USA Today reported. An Obama spokeswoman said Obama plans to celebrate his birthday with a family dinner in Washington on Saturday night, according to the paper. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
