Levin, a best-selling author whose daily broadcast is heard by more than 10 million listeners on nearly 400 stations and who also hosts Fox News\u2019 \u201cLife, Liberty & Levin,\u201d delivered the charge during \u201cHannity\u201d on Monday night just one day after Attorney General William Barr released a summary of Mueller's findings, showing there was no evidence Trump or anyone close to him colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. \u201cHillary Clinton, she's been silent for three or four days hasn't she. Barack Obama's been silent throughout all this hasn't he,\u201d Levin said. \u201cFor all the talk of the Democrats who run these committees they don't want to talk to Hillary Clinton. They don't want to talk to Barack Obama.\u201d WATCH FOX NEWS\u2019 LIVE COVERAGE Levin then turned his attention to the Democratic Party, accuses it of being anti-American. \u201cWe have a big problem in this country. The Democrat Party is not a pro-American party. They lost an election,\u201d he charged. \u201cThey want to destroy the president and the presidency. Listen to their candidates: anti-American, anti-capitalism, anti-Liberty, anti-security, anti-immigration. This is the problem. And the media is the mouthpiece. \u201cThis country does not belong to Adam Schiff and Nadler and Pelosi. Big deal, they got one half of one-third of that government. [The country] belongs to us.\u201d MARK LEVIN; 'SICK' DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE 'GREATEST THREAT TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM' On Sunday, AG Barr released a letter stating definitively that Mueller did not establish evidence that President Trump's team or any associates of the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 election -- \"despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\" President Trump said\u00a0Sunday that the release of a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe findings represented a \"complete and total exoneration,\" calling it \"an illegal takedown that failed.\"",

Daou, who also led the left-leaning outlet ShareBlue, has been an outspoken critic of the president\u00a0and\u00a0criticized the media in 2017 for its \"disdainful coverage\" of Clinton's 2016 campaign.

He listed a series of other complaints, including \"systematic voter suppression.\" \"The list goes on...\" he tweeted. Daou's tweets echoed many of Omar's previous criticisms of Republican leadership. She has, for example, accused immigration enforcement of \"killing\" children under Trump.

Fans became hooked on the dramatic tales of royals committing incest, dragons, flawed kings and even zombie armies all vying for power. Its final season begins airing Sunday. While Clinton\u2019s extensive political career may fall a few dragons short of \"Game of Thrones\" level controversy, the former Secretary of State addressed other dramas she\u2019s faced in her pursuit of her own Iron Throne, most notably her experience with disgraced WikiLeaks creator Julian Assange.

      "content": " Jess McIntosh, a former aide to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0for what she suggested was a hypocritical response to concerns over his own financial success amid his campaign's populist messaging. McIntosh's comments came after a Fox News townhall in which the Sanders defended the\u00a0profits he made from his bestselling book as the result of his own success.\u00a0\"His message is capitalist!\" McIntosh told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s literally saying \u2018I made a product the market wanted, and I got rich off of it, and you can do that too,'\" she added. Sanders, among other 2020 Democrats, received a wave of criticism after a series of financial disclosures revealed just how much money they made in previous years. During her Monday broadcast, Burnett\u00a0labeled\u00a0Sanders a \"hypocrite\" for railing against the wealthy while contributing little in charitable donations. \"The problem is when you're Bernie Sanders and you rail against people paying their fair share, and you don't have the huge charitable donations, and you're not donating money to the IRS, you are a hypocrite,\" Burnett asserted. BERNIE SANDERS, AT COMBATIVE FOX NEWS TOWN HALL, MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR MAKING MILLIONS For McIntosh, Sanders' hypocrisy didn't come so much from the fact that he made as much money as he did.\u00a0\u201cI actually don\u2019t see too much of a contradiction between being a millionaire and railing against a class that produces millionaires,\" she said. Part of Sanders' earnings, as he pointed out during his town hall, came from \"Our Revolution,\" the book he co-authored with his wife Jane. The book's sales reportedly contributed substantially to the couple's more than $1.1 million in earnings made during 2017. \"If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it,\" Sanders said while defending himself. That defense, in addition to his\u00a0attitude towards allegations surrounding the verbiage in his speeches,\u00a0\"undermines the integrity of his message.\" BERNIE SANDERS' PLANS WILL COST $20G PER TAXPAYER, BLOW HOLE IN BUDGET: NONPARTISAN GROUP'S PRESIDENT \"When he spent the weekend attacking a liberal outlet for correctly citing that he has changed in his speeches railing against 'millionaires and billionaires' to railing against 'multi-millionaires and billionaires,' the defensiveness [...] it really undermines the integrity of his message,'\" she said. Her comments appeared to highlight long-standing tension between Sanders' and Clinton's campaigns -- something that surfaced once again when a left-leaning publication\u00a0released a video insinuating that Sanders made millions of dollars through hypocritical messaging. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's all very off-brand and embarrassing, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is a millionaire. Turns out railing against 'millionaires and billionaires'\u00a0can be quite the lucrative enterprise,\" the video from ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with a think tank led by former Clinton aide Neera Tanden, said. Although Tanden eventually backed away from the video, the incident seemed to recall conflict between\u00a0establishment Democrats and the party's\u00a0more progressive wing during the 2016 election.",

Clinton said Congress should not be quick to vote on beginning impeachment proceedings without holding the proper public hearings to fill in the gaps of the Mueller report, something she blamed on Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s redactions. Clinton slammed the 1998 impeachment of her husband as \u201ca mistake then\u201d and claimed that if voted on today, it \u201cwould be a mistake now,\u201d arguing that the Republican-led House \u201crushed to judgment\u201d then.

The tour, dubbed \u201cAn Evening with the Clintons,\u201d rolled through DC\u2019s DAR Constitution Hall on Saturday night. But this time, the event featured a video with comedian Jordan Klepper in which Clinton reads portions of the Mueller report. The video, shot for Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cKlepper,\u201d shows Hillary and Bill discussing different crowdfunding options they could take part in, one of which is an audiobook of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report read by Secretary Clinton. \u201cGosh, I would definitely contribute to that,\u201d Hillary said in the video. TRUMP THOUGHT PRESIDENCY WAS OVER WHEN TOLD OF MUELLER'S APPOINTMENT: 'THIS IS THE END... I'M F---ED' After Klepper pointed out he had a copy of the report available, Clinton kicked off the dramatic reading by saying: \u201cAll right, let me start it.\u201d \u201cOh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I'm f---ed,\u201d Hillary read, while seemingly attempting to adopt a Trumpian tone.

The former adviser served 12 days in prison for lying to investigators. Clinton appeared on MSNBC's \"Rachel Maddow Show\" Wednesday where she ripped Attorney General William Barr and vented her frustration with Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation. Steyn chastised Clinton for being unable to lose and criticized Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein, who also appeared earlier in the show, for brushing off Papadopoulos' situation. \"We now know Donald Trump invited the Russians to help and they did and it benefited him. I am troubled that no one in the administration is as upset about that as they are about Carter Page and George Papadopoulos,\" Goldstein argued earlier.

Mueller\u2019s report \u201cnot only decisively proves, but goes chapter and verse\u00a0about how the Russians \u2014 in the words of the report \u2014 conducted \u2018a sweeping and systemic interference in our election,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said, according to the Seattle Times. \u201cAnd then you wake up and your president is spending an hour on the phone with Vladimir Putin, who was the mastermind of the interference and attack on our election.\u201d TRUMP THOUGHT PRESIDENCY WAS OVER WHEN TOLD OF MUELLER'S APPOINTMENT: 'THIS IS THE END... I'M F---ED' The president and Putin on Friday discussed what Trump again dismissed as the \"Russian Hoax\" in their first known phone call since the release of Mueller's report. Trump said that, at no point, did he warn Putin not to meddle in the next election. And while he and Putin did discuss\u00a0Mueller's findings, they appeared to gloss over Mueller's description of the extensive efforts Russia took to interfere in the 2016 election, including the 25 Russians indicted for that effort. \"We discussed it,\" Trump said of the report. \"He actually sort of smiled when he said something to the effect that, 'It started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse,'\" Trump said of Putin. \"But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. So pretty much that's what it was.\" The Clintons, however, did not take such a light-hearted view of the situation, with Hillary Clinton telling the Seattle crowd that the country is in the midst of a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI really believe that we are in a crisis, a constitutional crisis,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. \u201cWe are in a crisis of confidence and a crisis over the rule of law and the institutions that have weathered a lot of problems over so many years. And it is something that, regardless of where you stand in the political spectrum, should give real heartburn to everybody.

The best seats in the house at Seattle\u2019s WaMu Theater on Friday could be had for $829, a steep 54 percent\u00a0drop from the $1,785 that the former first couple\u00a0fetched when the tour was announced\u00a0in early November.",

Because the committee didn't delay the hearing, the administration invoked executive privilege in refusing to comply with Democrats' subpoenas \u2014 including releasing the unredacted Mueller report.

      "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u00a0says it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to be \u201ccommenting directly\u201d about her party\u2019s current contenders for the White House. Yang also called the push to eliminate private insurance by rivals Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts,\u00a0as part of their \"Medicare-for-all\" plans, \u201ctoo disruptive.\u201d And the tech entrepreneur and 2020 longshot, who has\u00a0seen his campaign soar in recent months, said that if he doesn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination, he\u2019d \u201cbe open to\u201d serving as running mate. CLINTON-GABBARD CLASH RAISES ROLE ABOUT 2016 NOMINEE'S ROLE IN 2020 RACE Yang made his comments while taking questions from reporters Tuesday evening in Hollis, N.H., and Wednesday morning after headlining \u2018Politics and Eggs,\u2019 a must stop for White House hopefuls campaigning in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state. His swing through the Granite State comes days after Clinton firmly inserted herself into the 2020 campaign\u00a0\u2013 arguing without\u00a0evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d and mocking President Trump\u2019s direct interactions with foreign leaders. Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had \u201csmeared\u201d her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s endorsement of\u00a0Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle. The former first lady, senator from New York and\u00a0secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she\u2019s served as a longtime foil for Republicans. But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to\u00a0a new level \u2013 renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president. Yang said that \u201cnominees of the party from past cycles remain very important figures in the party, in that Hillary would have a lot of value to add.\u201d But he then emphasized that \u201cshe's not a candidate and it strikes me as a little bit inappropriate for her to be commenting directly about candidates since we're all Democrats. And you think that she\u2019d be neutral unless she decided to endorse a particular candidate.\u201d WARREN SAYS SHE'LL SOON RELEASE PLAN ON HOW TO PAY FOR HER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROPOSAL On health care, Yang announced that \u201cwe\u2019re going to release a detailed health care plan in the days ahead.\u201d And specifically on the \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal introduced in the Senate by Sanders and backed by Warren, Yang said: \u201cI support the spirit of what Bernie is trying to accomplish. I do think that outlawing private insurance in a very short period of time is a bit too disruptive, and I would not do it.\u201d He reiterated that \u201cI've been on the record for a long time saying that there would be a role for some private insurers\u00a0in my plan. I think most private insurers will disappear if we do a good enough job with the public plan, but that there would be some companies that genuinely do add value and adapt to the new circumstances.\u201d As Yang arrived in New Hampshire, his staff in the state was in the process of expanding. Yang\u2019s team in the crucial early-voting state stood at around 15 at the beginning of the month, but a senior adviser told Fox News they planned to add at least 10 new hires by the end of October or early November. Yang\u2019s campaign has been fueled by his unconventional style and his push for what he calls the \u2018Freedom Dividend,\u2019 a universal basic income system that would pay all adult Americans $1,000 per month. The plan would help Americans cope with the loss of jobs due to the increased impact of automation and artificial intelligence. Asked if he\u2019d be open to serving as the Democratic Party\u2019s running mate if he fails to win the nomination, Yang told Fox News \u201cmy goal is to solve the problems of the 21st century.\u00a0I believe the best way I can do that is as president. But if it's in some other capacity, I'd be open to that. The goal is really just to make sure that this country is in a condition that I'm proud to pass along to my kids.\u201d Yang,\u00a0along with many other of the Democratic presidential candidates,\u00a0has disavowed outside super PACs as he pledges to combat the influence of dark money in politics. But a new group \u2013 called the Math PAC \u2013 has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang\u2019s campaign. Yang told Fox News and CBS News that \u201cI know very little about the Math PAC, genuinely.\u201d \u201cI'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help,\u201d he added. Yang\u2019s come a long way since the early days of his campaign, when the outsider and first-time candidate was the longest of long shots. He said he now feels like he\u2019s being taken seriously by the Democratic establishment \u201cI've been thrilled by the momentum that the campaign has gotten;\u00a0certainly we might have started as something of a newcomer/outsider, but I feel like I'm becoming more and more part of the establishment, as we get more support,\u201d he noted. But there continue to be moments when the candidate \u2013 who\u2019s qualified for all of the presidential primary debates to date \u2013\u00a0is snubbed by the mainstream media. His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, have started a trending hashtag on Twitter dubbing what they are calling unfair coverage of the candidate a #YangMediaBlackout. The latest example they cite is The Weather Channel, which did not invite Yang to participate in their\u00a0climate change special set to air Nov. 7. \u201cAnother mystery, given that by any objective standard, I am either fourth, fifth or sixth in this race. And so why would you invite, I believe, nine candidates or ten candidates and not invite Andrew Yang? I do not know. I have a very extensive climate change plan. I like the Weather Channel just as much as the next American,\u201d Yang told Fox News when asked about the lack of an invite.",

      "content": " A growing number of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are rallying to fellow\u00a0candidate Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s defense after Hillary Clinton claimed\u00a0the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d the Hawaii congresswoman to be a third-party spoiler in the race and suggested Gabbard is really a Russian asset -- a claim Gabbard has decried as an unfounded smear. \"Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,\" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said over the weekend. Speaking to The Hill, O'Rourke added: \"Obviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.\" Gabbard, a Hawaii Democratic congresswoman, and Clinton have been sparring since\u00a0the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee went on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe last week and\u00a0said she wasn\u2019t \u201cmaking any predictions, but [thinks Russians] have got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton added, saying they \u201chave a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. \u201c Clinton\u2019s podcast performance prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully on Twitter, calling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!\u201d An increasing number of other\u00a02020 Democratic candidates have positioned themselves in Gabbard's camp, rejecting Clinton's claims, defending Gabbard\u00a0and attempting to shift the conversation to other topics. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang defended Gabbard, saying she \u201cdeserves much more respect and thanks than this.\u201d \u201cShe literally just got back from serving our country abroad,\u201d Yang tweeted. Gabbard is a Hawaii Army National Guard major\u00a0who served in Iraq. Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, told Gabbard to \"stay strong\" and said she's the victim of attempted \"character assassination.\" \u201cThe Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient!\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine.\u201d South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also a veteran, was asked on CNN whether he felt Gabbard was a Russian asset and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the basis is for that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d prefer to have the conversation be about policy, about what we\u2019re going to do, and about how American lives are going to be different,\u201d Buttigieg said Sunday. \u201cWhen it comes to any of my Democratic competitors, that\u2019s my focus, making sure that we make very clear the differences\u2014and there are very real differences among us\u2014and making it clear to voters what their choices are. That\u2019s where I\u2019d like the focus to be.\u201d But some candidates like John Delaney -- while making clear he doesn't agree with Clinton's claim -- trod carefully as to not upset either Gabbard or Clinton. \u201cI consider Tulsi to be a very good friend. As best I can tell, there\u2019s absolutely no basis for any of those allegations,\u201d Delaney said, while noting he holds Clinton \u201cin the highest regard\u201d and \u201cwas a huge supporter for 2016.\u201d Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer brushed off the feud altogether. \u201cIt seems to me to be a sideshow. And so as a sideshow, I figure if I continue my schedule, I\u2019ve got enough things to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I feel as if this is something that\u2019s going to go on and it\u2019s going to go on without me.\u201d Others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are distancing themselves from the issue.\u00a0His campaign declined to comment Monday Meanwhile, Gabbard herself\u00a0posted a video message over the weekend\u00a0claiming Clinton\u2019s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cIf they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone\u2014and in fact, that\u2019s exactly the message they want to get across to you,\u201d Gabbard said in the video. \u201cIf you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers\u2014if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d She added: \u201cBut, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.\u201d Gabbard started the video by referencing her time as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016, before she quit and endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the 2016 Democratic primary. At the time, Gabbard accused leaders of the party of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton. \u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my \u2018political career\u2019\u2014they said Clinton would never forget\u2026that she and her rich and powerful friends\u2014her allies in politics and the media\u2014will make sure you\u2019re destroyed,\u201d she said in the video. She went on to say that \u201ccountless hit pieces full of smears\u201d have been published in an effort to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation, which includes years of military and congressional service. For his part, Sanders tweeted Monday evening: \"Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\" Meanwhile, President Trump blasted Clinton on Monday, saying she's \"accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.\" \"These people are sick,\" Trump told reporters from the White House. \"There's something wrong with them.\" The claim of Gabbard being a Russian asset first hit the mainstream during last week\u2019s CNN Democratic presidential primary debate when Gabbard called out news outlets for what she called a propaganda campaign against her. \u201cThe New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,\" Gabbard said. \"Just two days ago, The New York Times\u00a0put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a\u00a0CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\" Clinton herself, meanwhile, has\u00a0come under scrutiny\u00a0for raising money secretly from Russians when she was secretary of state. \"Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,\"\u00a0read a 2015 headline in the Times. CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Gabbard's argument on-air, and called out Clinton's \"disinformation\" -- saying \"she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and someone who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts.\" Jones continued: \"This is a very, very dangerous game -- and there's a backstory here. Let's not forget: Tulsi Gabbard was picked out by the Democratic Party establishment and put at the top of the DNC, and they thought she was going to be their golden girl. And, she got in that position in the DNC, and she looked around, and she saw [then-DNC Chairwoman] Debbie Wasserman-Schultz\u00a0and other people, Clinton allies, doing stuff they shouldn't have been doing in the primary. \"And, Tulsi publicly quit and then endorsed Bernie Sanders, and it's been payback hell ever\u00a0since,\" Jones said.

      "content": " America's heroin crisis has risen to levels that are demanding attention on the 2016 campaign trail as candidates from both sides of the aisle call for action, particularly in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire where heroin overdoses have soared. In town hall forums and diners, the candidates repeatedly are confronting the issue, even putting out campaign platforms on addiction. Even as the Paris terror attacks bring national security and foreign policy back to the forefront of the campaign, heroin addiction remains one of the biggest domestic issues in the vital New England primary state. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton admits the focus took her by surprise. \"I never expected that substance abuse and mental health would be major issues in my campaign until I came to Keene on my very first trip,\" she said, speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention earlier this fall. \"And then I started listening.\" Heroin addiction has affected New Hampshire in profound ways. On average, one person dies every day from a drug-related overdose in the state. The epidemic is growing at a staggering rate -- heroin-related emergency visits have increased by 76 percent this year. Nationally, heroin use among young adults has more than doubled in the past decade. The CDC reports that heroin overdose deaths increased by 286 percent from 2002 to 2013. Presidential candidates have heard intimate stories from families who have been torn apart by drug addiction, and they are responding in kind. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush opened up about his own daughter's struggle. \"I've had the personal experience of dealing with the challenges of drug addiction and it wasn't easy,\" Bush said at a substance abuse roundtable in Manchester, N.H., in October. He echoed voters' concern, saying: \"When people are addicted to painkillers and then resort to a lower-cost alternative and then die? I mean, there should be a little more outrage about what's going on.\" Voters remain vigilant as they seek to raise candidates' awareness, fighting to take away the stigma associated with drug addiction. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has made advocacy and awareness his pledge. \"I'm going to be the kind of president who is going to talk about this. Because I want to remove the stigma,\" he said at a recent town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Christie's call for compassion and action was featured in a web video published by the Huffington Post that went viral, receiving over 8 million views. The issue hits close to home for the governor. \"I've dealt with this personally with people in my life,\" he said at a substance abuse roundtable in New Hampshire earlier this month. \"We have no tolerance for the dealing and the violence and all the rest ... [but] for those of you who become addicted we're going to do the best we can to get you treatment.\" The issue is building common ground between parties as candidates search for solutions. Both Republicans and Democrats are calling for changes that would provide more treatment resources to communities. \"I am glad that Republicans are acknowledging this issue and hope that we can work together to go forward,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told Fox News. Sanders has been an outspoken advocate on the matter, telling voters at a local high school, \"You're not going to be hanging out on street corners doing drugs.\" The Vermont senator is calling for criminal justice reform, arguing that treating addicts instead of incarcerating them is both ethical and economically sound. \"You are not only going to save human lives by the thousands, you also save taxpayers' money,\" he said. Candidates suggest they're not stumbling into the issue as a talking point but truly want to understand. \"I am not here as a candidate. I'm here to listen and learn,\" Bush told a gathering of first responders, law enforcement, and health care providers at a substance abuse roundtable in Manchester, N.H. Similar roundtable discussions with advocates and activists are a priority on many presidential candidate itineraries. Clinton hosted a town hall entirely focused on substance abuse where she heard heartbreaking testimony from families and loved ones who felt powerless against the epidemic that has infested their community. Christie visited a treatment center where he met with recovering addicts who shared their stories. The issue allows candidates to move past stump speeches and connect with voters in an intimate way. Christie spoke frankly at the town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \"I'm sure there is no one in this room that has not made a decision in their life that they wouldn't want to take back,\" he said. \"I'm just lucky that decision didn't involve drugs. Because I could very well be an addict.\" The epidemic has gone beyond the Granite State. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has been on the frontlines combating the issue in his state, where the crisis has grown so large he has threatened to call the National Guard for assistance if lawmakers there don't step up and approve more agents.",

      "content": " Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Saturday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report clearly showed that\u00a0obstruction of justice \"occurred\"\u00a0during the\u00a0Russia investigation. \"If you take the time to read the Mueller report, actually read it ... you come to two inescapable conclusions,\" she said while speaking at her alma mater Wellesley College. Those conclusions, she said, were that Russia conducted a \"sweeping\" attempt to interfere in the 2016 election and that \"obstruction of justice occurred.\" \"You cannot read the report, chapter and verse, fact after fact, without reaching those conclusions,\" she said, according to a video posted by The Hill. Although Clinton has called out Russian interference as a reason for her 2016 loss, Saturday's comments appeared to be the first time she said the Mueller report definitively showed obstruction. ALAN DERSHOWITZ: EX-UK SPY CHRISTOPHER STEELE MUST BE ASKED THESE KEY QUESTIONS BY US INVESTIGATORS Mueller, during a press briefing in May,\u00a0stopped short of exonerating Trump of that allegation but refused to prosecute him at least partially because of a Justice Department rule against charging a sitting president. After the report's release, Republicans like Trump declared victory while his campaign claimed the report fully exonerated the president.\u00a0Trump, who has decried the investigation as a \"witch hunt,\"\u00a0prompted further Democratic inquiry when he granted his attorney general the ability to declassify intelligence as he looked into the probe's origins. Although Republicans mostly stood by the president, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., called for the president's impeachment and accused him of obstructing justice. Democrats, meanwhile, have responded by prolonging the investigation in Congress -- raising questions related to concerns Mueller noted surrounding obstruction of justice. Those concerns included an incident when the president told forrmer White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. \"McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d the report said, referring to a similar event during the Nixon administration. BARR COMPARES HIS RETURN TO DOJ TO D-DAY, LIKENS IT TO TRYING TO 'LAND WITHOUT GETTING SHOT' After both McGahn and Attorney General William Barr refused to comply with subpoenas, House Democrats unveiled a resolution Thursday that would hold them in contempt and beef up Congress' investigatory authority.

That resolution would give Democratic committee chairs like Nadler the ability to unilaterally initiate judicial proceedings in order to enforce subpoenas in court.

The event, expected to be attended by roughly 20-30 people, is being billed as a \u201cdinner and conversation\u201d and comes as Democratic candidates are ramping up their campaigns to challenge President Trump in the 2020 election.

Clinton, a former secretary of State under President Barack Obama, has ruled out running for president in 2020. She previously lost the Democratic nomination to Obama in 2008 and to Trump in the general election in 2016. \"I'm not running, but I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,\" Clinton told a local New York news station earlier this month, but added that she is \"not going anywhere.\" \"What's at stake in our country, the kind of things that are happening right now are deeply troubling to me.

      "content": " Failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will host a pricey fundraiser at her Washington, D.C., mansion as her party struggles\u00a0to match the size of Republicans' growing war chest\u00a0before 2020. The event, set for October 16, seems to mark the first major form of activism in support of the Democratic Party's electoral efforts. Politico reported on Tuesday that the event -- titled \"Dinner and conversation at the home of Hillary Rodham Clinton\" -- will offer tickets as high as $50,000. Most of the 2020 Democrats have focused their attention on bashing President Trump, apparently avoiding\u00a0public criticism of Clinton's attempt to beat him in 2016. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had millions in debt after that election and appeared\u00a0to try and correct the strategy it employed during Clinton's run. In places like Wisconsin -- and other states that went for Trump in 2016 -- Democrats are working to fix the mistakes of 2016 when they\u00a0seemed to take Clinton\u2019s ascent to the White House as a given. Now, they're\u00a0using technology, voter engagement, and local organizing as the\u00a0top tools in the fight to unseat Trump and win local elections. HILLARY CLINTON SLAMS TRUMP FOR SHARING 'DEBUNKED STUDY' THAT GOOGLE MANIPULATED 'MILLIONS' OF 2016 VOTES \u201cWe understand that if we are not only going to win elections at the top of the ticket but also down-ballot, we need to start talking to people now,\u201d Xochitl Hinojosa, the communications director for the DNC, said. \u201cSo that was the biggest thing that we\u2019ve learned is that you have to talk to people, and you have to build a relationship with them.\u201d Meanwhile, Republicans have ramped up their ground game and vastly outpaced fundraising from the DNC. Receipts for June totaled $20.8 million --\u00a0the highest the Republican National Committee (RNC) has\u00a0seen for that month outside\u00a0an election year. That\u00a0record-breaking figure followed\u00a0numbers\u00a0from its second quarter of 2019 when it, along with President Trump's campaign entities, raised\u00a0$108 million. Heading into the 2020 election, the RNC already amassed $117.9\u00a0million for the cycle and had $46.6 million in total cash on hand in July, according to a press release\u00a0from\u00a0Tuesday.\u00a0The party's second quarter saw $123.7 million in combined cash on hand. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By comparison, Democrats raised just $8.5 million in June, less than half the RNC's haul. The party's top presidential candidates\u00a0reportedly raked\u00a0in a combined $96 million during that time. Those included\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0($24.9 million),\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0($22 million),\u00a0Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ($19.2 million),\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0($18 million), and\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif.,\u00a0($11.8 million).

What does all that mean?\u201d Limbaugh, in his retort, accused Clinton\u00a0of pushing a false narrative. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, here is the Hildebeast now claiming that Russian collusion affected votes, changed the outcome of elections, affected voting machines. Mueller never asserted this.

The investigation request was part of a phone call between the two world leaders, but both Trump and Zelensky have insisted there was no pressure involved. The call was the basis for an anonymous whistleblower complaint that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry that has included several closed-door interviews with officials related to U.S.-Ukraine relations.

Elizabeth Warren's \"Medicare-for-all\" plan in comparison\u00a0to adding a\u00a0\"public option,\" a proposed aspect of ObamaCare that later was dropped. \"I\u00a0think the debate within the Democratic Party is a very healthy debate to try to figure out how to achieve the goal of covering everybody with quality, affordable health care,\" Clinton began. \"My view on this, having been working on it for many years now, is that the Affordable Care Act took us to 90 percent of coverage, the highest we have ever gotten in our country after many, many efforts... we have a 10-percent gap to fill and we have a lot of learning to do about the best way not only to fill the gap but then to drive down costs as much as it's possible to do so without undermining quality advancements.\" The former New York\u00a0senator claimed the \"smarter approach\" on health care was to \"build on what we have,\" speaking highly of the\u00a0public option. ABC NEWS' SPIKING OF EPSTEIN STORY DRAWS SCRUTINY TOWARDS CLINTON ALLY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS \"I don't believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100-percent coverage and deal with costs and face\u00a0some tough issues about competitiveness and other kinds of innovation in health care,\" the Democrat continued. \"If you look at the 2018 election, you even look at the gains that were made by\u00a0Democrats [on Tuesday's elections], the people who are saying,\u00a0'You know what, I am determined -- we're gonna get to universal\u00a0coverage, we're going to get to a point where people can afford it, their premiums are not going to be skyrocketing, their deductibles are not going to be overwhelming, et cetera --\u00a0and here's the best way to do it.'\u00a0That is, I think, the best position politically, and I also think it makes the most sense in terms of solving the problem.\" When pressed if she could \"get behind\" Warren's plan, Clinton responded by expressing that it wouldn't pass in the Senate, but stressed that \"the goal is the right goal.\" Clinton continued, \"The details will be litigated out in the campaign, maybe even in court, but certainly in the Congress, if somebody is successfully elected. And, I think it's important to say, what are the overall goals, and how realistic is it that we can achieve the overall goals if we go down Path A compared to\u00a0Path B? And, I think the Affordable Care Act approach is the more likely path to be successful.\" Clinton later\u00a0was asked about the wealth tax that Warren has promoted. After admitting she didn't \"know much\" about the proposal, Clinton\u00a0suggested it wasn't practical. \"I just don't understand how that\u00a0could work, and I don't see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\" Clinton elaborated. \"I would be all in favor of reinstating the estate tax because that is much more measurable. It is not as\u00a0disruptive.\" She went on, \"If you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets... how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with. But, assuming you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied. That would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The former presidential candidate also insisted she would get behind whoever the Democrats nominated for president,\u00a0no matter what. She also said she thought she knew\u00a0\"who it's likely to be.\" Grinning, she added, \"But I'm not gonna go there.\"",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0shared opposing\u00a0views Wednesday regarding Twitter's recent call to ban all political advertisements while gearing up for the 2020 presidential election. Clinton praised the Twitter move and urged Facebook to follow suit, saying such moves would\u00a0prevent a repeat of the spread of false information that occurred during the last presidential election. TWITTER TO BAN POLITICAL ADS WORLDWIDE, CEO JACK DORSEY ANNOUNCES \"Twitter made the right decision to say, 'Look, we don\u2019t want to get into the judging game,'\u201d Clinton said at The New York Times DealBook Conference in New York City. \u201cI think that should be the decision that Facebook makes as well.\u201d But McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor in Washington, slammed the new Twitter policy as an effort to undermine the First Amendment right to free\u00a0speech. McConnell said a ban on paid candidate and issue ads would only hurt \u201cfledgling speakers who are not already famous.\u201d Clinton also encouraged Facebook to ban political ads given its track record during the 2016 presidential election, when Russian operatives\u00a0spread misinformation on American politics prior to the vote. \u201cWe know unfortunately that Facebook has a history of allowing all kinds of disinformation on its platform,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, they were taking ads from a number of sources and later revealing that actually ads paid for in rubles were part of what they were putting out.\u201d Clinton also rejected arguments that by allowing paid political ads, Facebook was protecting free speech. She instead accused the platform of prioritizing its revenue stream instead of fulfilling its duty to American people to stop the spread of misinformation given that \u201cmore than 50 percent of people in this country use Facebook as their only source of news.\u201d \u201cIf you were to say to your expert engineers, out algorithms really favor the explosive, the inflammatory, the blatantly false and we love to hook people into them and they seek more of it and then they get absolutely barraged by all of this information, we need to tweak the algorithms,\u201d she said. She also admitted that the Democratic Party partially to blame given decades-long ties to Silicon Valley. On Wednesday, McConnell said Twitter\u2019s new policy on paid political advertising \u201cwould just amplify the already privileged speakers who already possess multimillion-dollar platforms. It would just help clear the field for those elites by denying the same tools to fledgling speakers who are not already famous.\u201d It does \u201cnot bolster our democracy. It would degrade democracy. It would amplify the advantage of media companies, celebrities and certain other established elites while denying an important tool to the Americans who disagree with them,\u201d he continued, according to The Hill. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \"Twitter's leadership has tried to produce a rationale for banishing paid political speech, but the argument boils down to the same misunderstanding that has been used to undermine free speech for decades,\u201d McConnell continued. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last week that the platform will stop all political advertising \u2014 including candidate ads and issue ads \u2014 globally starting next month.",

The former secretary of state said during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live\u00a0that she hasn't ruled out joining the already-crowded Democratic fray looking to be the nominee to challenge President Trump in next year\u2019s general election. \u201cI, as I say, never, never, never say never,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI will certainly tell you, I\u2019m under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it.\u201d Clinton\u00a0added: \u201cBut as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.\" BLOOMBERG WON'T COMPETE IN EARLY VOTING STATES IF HE RUNS FOR WHITE HOUSE While previous election cycles have seen the list of potential nominees winnow down as the first primaries approach, the 2020 Democratic primary looks different. With no clear front-runner and shifting polls, a number of potential candidates have indicated an interest in launching a late bid for the presidency. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City,\u00a0filed paperwork last week to qualify for the primary in Alabama and has spent the past few weeks talking with prominent Democrats about the state of the 2020 field, expressing concerns about the steadiness of former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign and the rise of liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Former Attorney General Eric Holder has also reportedly been considering entering the primary. Newsweek reported\u00a0last Friday that Holder had spoken\u00a0with strategists about a potential run. And on Monday, sources close to former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told The Associated Press that he's mulling a White House run, as well. If Clinton were to join the race, she would quickly become the biggest figure in the Democratic field. She has twice run for president in the past, losing the Democratic nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 and losing the general election in a close race to Trump in 2016. Rumors about Clinton entering the 2020 race, however, have been circulating for a while, with Mark Penn, an adviser and pollster to Bill and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008, making waves last year by predicting in The Wall Street Journal that Clinton would return in 2020 as a \u201cliberal firebrand.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite the rumors, Clinton\u2019s supporters in early voting states don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be entering the race in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s running again,\u201d incoming New Hampshire Senate President Donna Soucy, a four-term Democratic state senator who backed Clinton\u2019s 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, told Fox News. \u201cI know the rumors floating out there that that\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Soucy added. \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a second that it is.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

The letter was produced by\u00a0The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a nonprofit\u00a0coalition of \"more than 200 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States,\" according to its website. The letter accused Miller of supporting white supremacy and stoking bigotry during his career. REP. ILHAN OMAR CALLS STEPHEN MILLER A 'WHITE NATIONALIST' \"Supporters of white supremacists and neo-Nazis should not be allowed to serve at any level of government, let alone in the White House,\" it read. \"Stephen Miller has stoked bigotry, hate, and division with his extreme political rhetoric and policies throughout his career. The recent exposure of his deep-seated racism provides further proof that he is unfit to serve and should immediately leave his post.\" The SPLC, a liberal nonprofit known for accusing conservatives of \"hate,\" claimed last week\u00a0that Miller sent emails \"promoted white nationalist literature and racist propaganda\" to conservative news site Breitbart in 2015 and 2016 when he\u00a0was working for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. STEPHEN MILLER SAYS TRUMP IS 'REAL WHISTLEBLOWER' AND CALLS COMPLAINT 'PARTISAN HIT JOB' IN CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW \"Every day Hillary Clinton was in office WAS an actual emergency,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to Fox News. \"Lest we forget her policies helped create a massacre in Benghazi, Libya, a humanitarian disaster in Syria, and the rise of ISIS in Iraq. \u00a0Stephen Miller is dedicated to this country and I am proud to work alongside him every single day with the goal of making our nation even greater. \u00a0He is a friend and colleague, and we are lucky to have him in the White House.\" Following the publication of the\u00a0SPLC's report, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0called for Miller's ouster. \"Each day we allow a white nationalist to be in charge of US immigration policy is a day where thousands of children & families [sic] lives are in danger,\" she said. \"This year alone, under Miller\u2019s direction, the US has put almost 70,000 children in custody.\" After Rep.

THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK? The rough\u00a0transcript of the call\u00a0based on notes, released Wednesday morning, shows Trump pushing for Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said in the phone call. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d That refers to\u00a0Biden, while vice president,\u00a0urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where his son Hunter Biden was on the board.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, given that Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Clinton also claimed without evidence\u00a0that Russians were \"grooming her\u00a0to be the third-party candidate\"\u00a0in the 2020 presidential election. \"Hillary, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world -- resulting in the deaths and injuries of so many of my brothers and sisters in uniform, devastating entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises,\" and more, Gabbard said. \"Yet despite the damage you have done to our country and the world, you want to continue your failed policies directly or indirectly through the Democratic nominee.\" She added: \"It's time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and apologize for it. It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.\" Gabbard, an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War, had Monday said she's open to having a\u00a0\"face-to-face\" with Clinton.
