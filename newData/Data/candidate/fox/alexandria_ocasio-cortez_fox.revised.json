In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a \u201cburrito at these b-----s.\u201d Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re threatening violence on members of Congress,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cHow do you think they\u2019re treating caged children+families?\u201d The U.S. Customs and Border Protection condemned\u00a0the posts. \u201cThese posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see\u2014and expect\u2014from our agents day in and day out,\"\u00a0U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said in a statement to Fox News. \"Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\u201d Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general opened an investigation on Monday. \"Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,\" Klein said. \"CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.\" ProPublica did not post the names of those who made the vulgar posts.

      "author": "Lukas Mikelionis",
      "content": " Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not yet been sworn into Congress, but she\u2019s already eyeing a seat at one of the most powerful House committees in charge of taxation laws. The Democratic Socialist\u2019s spokesperson confirmed\u00a0to Vice News that she will seek a seat on the House Ways and Means committee, which is traditionally packed with seasoned legislators with experience in writing tax code. Rep. Joe Crawley, the top Democrat who was unseated by Ocasio-Cortez this year, was among the members of the committee. She is\u00a0eyeing the exact same seat\u00a0that is customarily reserved for New York City. The effort to get on the committee indicates the progressive Democrats\u2019 growing ambition to bring forward actual progressive bills to the vote, as the committee is instrumental in making that happen. Ocasio-Cortez, together with other freshmen Democrats,\u00a0has been pushing for grand policies, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Both measures would need to go through the committee before it could be subjected to a vote. But the Democratic leadership may not be so quick to embrace the rising star of the party and instead opt out for a centrist Democrat who would utilize the membership of the committee better. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents New York\u2019s 3rd district, is also eyeing for the seat, the Intercept reported. He\u2019s deemed a more conservative Democrat, who doesn\u2019t share the hostility of corporations with the progressive wing of the party. \u201cI\u2019m very progressive on a lot of different issues, in support of the Green New Deal, immigration, both those issues, as well as on issues related to poverty,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cAm I fiscally conservative? Yes, I\u2019m fiscally conservative.\u201d OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLED OUT FOR CLAIMING PENTAGON $$ ERROR COULD FUND MEDICARE FOR ALL Ocasio-Cortez's bid for a seat at the committee may also raise some eyebrows following a number of blunders concerning policies she\u2019s advocating. She was recently called out by various fact checkers for suggesting that a reported $21 trillion in Pentagon accounting errors could fund most of her proposed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care program. Multiple fact-checkers and even liberal publications that provide sympathetic coverage of the New York Democrat, slammed her suggestion, noting that The Pentagon\u2019s accounting errors aren\u2019t actual sums of money that could be spent on other programs. The Washington Post said the comment was \u201cswing and a miss!\u201d and awarded her claim \u201cfour Pinnochios.\u201d For House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, the struggle between Ocasio-Cortez and Souzzi will pose a challenge, as she ultimately decides the committee assignments. Members of Ways and Means typically attracts large donations from industries, according to Intercept, yet this wouldn\u2019t be the case with Ocasio-Cortez because\u00a0she doesn\u2019t accept donations from corporations, thus putting Democrats at a disadvantage in future elections. OCASIO-CORTEZ: 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' WOULD SAVE 'VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY,' DESPITE STUDIES SHOWING $30T COST At the same time, Suozzi is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus that threatened to derail Pelosi\u2019s speakership bid if she doesn\u2019t give in to their demands, while Ocasio-Cortez supported Pelosi. The group ultimately supported Pelosi but only after she agreed to legislative rule changes that will give priority to bipartisan measures, while limiting the influence of the far-right and far-left in Congress. Ocasio-Cortez also previously criticized the caucus, saying they are advocating for \u201cGOP-friendly rules that will hamstring healthcare efforts from the get-go.\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday asked President Trump's onetime personal attorney\u00a0Michael Cohen\u00a0if Trump had intentionally devalued his real estate assets to reduce his tax bills, to which Cohen responded,\u00a0\"Yes.\" Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the House Oversight Committee, sought to lay the groundwork\u00a0for lawmakers to potentially subpoena employees of the Trump Organization -- including its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, who Cohen said was privy to Trump's various money maneuvers and who received immunity\u00a0from federal prosecutors in New York to testify against Cohen prior to the attorney's guilty plea on federal campaign finance violations last August. \"What you do is, you deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction,\" said Cohen when Ocasio-Cortez asked how Trump attempted to reduce his tax burden. FLASHBACK: TRUMP ORGANIZATION CFO ALLEN WEISSELBERG GRANTED IMMUNITY IN COHEN CASE \"And would it help for the committee to obtain federal and state tax returns from the president and his company to address that discrepancy?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked. \"I believe so,\" Cohen answered. The freshman congresswoman cited an August 2016 Washington Post report. That report claimed\u00a0Trump had argued that his golf course in Jupiter, Florida. was worth \"no more than $5 million\" for tax purposes despite informally valuing the property at more than $50 million. When asked if the report was true, Cohen said that Trump had used an \"identical\" tactic at his golf club in suburban Westchester County, New York. TRUMP REAPED MILLIONS IN SHADY TAX SCHEMES FROM FATHER'S BUSINESSES, REPORT SAYS In response to questioning from another lawmaker, Cohen said that he had seen Trump's tax returns, but has not gone through them. Trump\u00a0broke\u00a0with decades of tradition for presidential candidates by refusing to release his income tax filings during his 2016 campaign. He has said he won't release them because he is being audited, but Cohen said he never received any documentation to support Trump's claim. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cohen also said that CFO Weisselberg would be best placed to confirm a bombshell New York Times report from October 2018 that Trump and his siblings set up a phony corporation in the 1990s to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents. The report also stated that Trump\u00a0helped his father take millions\u00a0in improper tax deductions and formulated a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings\u00a0to cut\u00a0the tax bill when the properties were transferred.

And that's okay,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Spectrum News NY1. \u00a0\"All of these are not reasons to stop fighting, all of these are reasons to keep fighting.\" Ocasio-Cortez's push for the Green New Deal, a much-debated resolution that addresses climate change and renewable energy among other issues, has opened up the congresswoman to scrutiny from the media and critics. The New York Post reported earlier this week that Ocasio-Cortez elected to take a minivan back to her Queens office Sunday instead of the subway, which was less than four blocks away.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0slamming her \"inappropriate\" suggestion that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is singling out the New Yorker and her \"squad\" of fellow freshman because of their race. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday night, Clay hammered Ocasio-Cortez's suggestion. \"It was such a weak argument to say she was being picked on and that four women of color were being picked on by the speaker,\" he said. \"It tells you the level of ignorance to American history on their part as to what we are as the Democratic Caucus. PELOSI RESPONDS TO AOC SLAM, SAYS CAUCUS HAS HER BACK FOR CONDEMNING CHIEF OF STAFF'S 'OFFENSIVE' TWEET \"It is so inappropriate. So uncalled for. It does not do anything to help with unity. It was unfair to Speaker Pelosi.\" Clay continued his broadside, saying the comment exposed how much Ocasio-Cortez and Reps.\u00a0Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., have to learn when it comes to being \"effective legislators\". \"It\u2019s going to take a process of maturing for those freshman members.

Some come from red districts and those are the ones who gave us the majority. We need them all,\" he said. His comments followed a feud\u00a0between Pelosi\u00a0and freshman congresswomen, like Ocasio-Cortez, that involved racially-charged criticism. Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff,\u00a0Saikat Chakrabarti, previously compared moderate Democrats to racists\u00a0-- prompting Pelosi, at the request of some of her members, warn\u00a0House Democrats not to attack each other on Twitter.

On the same day of that caucus meeting, Ocasio-Cortez called out Pelosi for what she sees as the speaker continually targeting her and other freshmen lawmakers of color. \"Their ignorance is beyond belief,\" Clay also said while in the Speaker's Lobby, according to The Hill. Clay reportedly saw\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff as \"juvenile.\" Clay wasn't the only one to attack Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday. \"The View\" hosts Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg criticized her's and others' decision to attack Democrats like Pelosi.\u00a0\"I think this is more BS,\" Goldberg said of Ocasio-Cortez's comments on race. BERNIE SANDERS SEEMINGLY DIPS TOE INTO DEMOCRATS' FEUD, TELLS YOUNG PEOPLE TO EMBRACE PROGRESSIVE 'POWER' Pelosi, meanwhile, refused to provide further comment on the feud while discussing it during her weekly press briefing. \u201cI've said\u00a0what I'm going to say\u2026What I said in the caucus\u00a0yesterday had an overwhelming\u00a0response from my members,\" she said.

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS Gutfeld took issue with the congresswoman's \"demonization\" of Border Patrol agents and her comments that she didn't feel safe while touring the facility. \"In that last facility, I was not safe from the officers in that facility,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters Monday. \"I think the bigger story too is how the left has this free pass to demonize anyone. We've seen accusations of child abuse directed at people who work there. She's suggested that these guys might sexually assault her, she doesn't feel safe around them. These are horrible things to say about people casually,\" Gutfeld said. \"But if you respond angrily or you... criticize her and suddenly she becomes the victim.\" On Tuesday, having already made the controversial allegations of abusive treatment at the facilities, Ocasio-Cortez again compared them to \"concentration camps.\" Responding to the release of photographs taken inside facilities in Texas, she\u00a0tweeted:\u00a0\u201cThese are concentration camps. \u201cAccording to concentration camp experts, people begin to die due to overcrowding, neglect, and shortage of resources.

OFFICIALS PUSH BACK ON AOC'S BORDER STATION CLAIMS, SAY SHE IS 'MISINFORMING' THE PUBLIC Ocasio-Cortez has battled with immigration officials ever since over the veracity of that claim. But she's also faced criticism over her\u00a0\u201chell no\u201d vote last week on a bipartisan bill that would provide $4.6 billion in funding for the crisis, and for voting against an earlier Democrat-backed aid package. She was insisting that restrictions on immigration enforcement be included. \u201cHow many migrant women did @AOC help by voting AGAINST the $4.6 billion bipartisan humanitarian aid that is FOR THEM?\u201d Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, tweeted Tuesday in response to the lawmaker's accusations. \u201cAll talk, no dollars.\u201d Republican GOP Rep.

DHS, meanwhile, is investigating a reported Facebook group where border officials posted graphic content mocking Ocasio-Cortez as well as migrants -- a development that only fueled the tensions between the lawmaker and immigration agencies. Also on Tuesday, the DHS inspector general released a report revealing that 8,000 immigrants being held in Border Patrol detention facilities in South Texas were subjected to \u201cserious overcrowding\u201d and prolonged detention.\u00a0The report included photos of migrants in several facilities, packed into crowded standing-room-only cells and behind fences.

Some detainees have clogged toilets with the blankets and socks in order to be let out of their cells and some have refused to re-enter the cells after they\u00a0had been cleaned. \"The current situation on the Southern Border represents an acute and worsening crisis,\" Acting Inspector General Jennifer Costello said in a letter to Jim Crumpacker,\u00a0the director of the Government Accountability Office-OIG Liaison Office. \"Our immigration system is not equipped to accommodate a migration pattern like the one we are experiencing now.\" Fox News' Louis Casiano and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

In a tweet on Monday, McConnell seemingly addressed accusations that he was manipulating the vote to divide Democrats. \u201cI could not be more glad that the American people will have the opportunity to learn precisely where each one of their senators stand on the \u2018Green New Deal\u2019: a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy,\" he wrote.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0once again compared border detention facilities to concentration camps on Tuesday, despite facing criticism for invoking the Holocaust by doing so. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., came under fire last month for saying the U.S. government is \"running concentration camps on our southern border\u201d during an Instagram broadcast. The comment was widely condemned, including by two Holocaust survivors, Sami Steigmann and David Tuck, who told Turning Point USA that AOC's comments were ignorant and full of hubris. However, on Tuesday the New York congresswoman again made the shocking comparison. OFFICIALS PUSH BACK ON AOC'S BORDER STATION CLAIMS, SAY SHE IS 'MISINFORMING' THE PUBLIC Responding to the release of photographs taken inside facilities in Texas, she tweeted: \u201cThese are concentration camps. \u201cAccording to concentration camp experts, people begin to die due to overcrowding, neglect, and shortage of resources. \u201cWe saw all three of those signs on our trip yesterday. Another person died yesterday. And those are the deaths we know about.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, current and former immigration officials pushed back on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s recent high-profile accusations of cruel treatment at an El Paso border station, rejecting her claim that agents forced detainees to \u201cdrink out of the toilets\u201d and insisting that their personnel \u201cdon\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS RESPOND TO AOC'S 'CONCENTRATION CAMP' COMMENTS IN NEW VIDEO AOC traveled to the border on Monday with almost a dozen members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as she blasted border officials as \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cinhumane\u201d -- while claiming agents forced migrant women and children being detained in cells to drink toilet water. \u201cThey are not drinking out of the toilet\u2014no Border Patrol agent is going to make anyone drink out of the toilet,\u201d former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan said on Fox News' \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous on its face.\u201d Homan alleged that Ocasio-Cortez was \u201cclearly, intentionally misinforming the American public.\u201d He added, \u201cShe\u2019s lost all credibility.\u201d SEN. JOHN KENNEDY ON AOC'S 'CONCENTRATION CAMP' COMPARISON: 'SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT' Homan suggested she was referring to the \u201capparatus\u201d in holding cells that has an attached sink and toilet, but two separate water lines. Ocasio-Cortez, though, maintained that while she did see the combination toilet-sink facilities, the station had only one of them, and the sink portion wasn't working. \u201cSo the women were told they could drink out of the bowl,\u201d she tweeted. Homan acknowledged that the facilities \u201care jails\u201d and \u201cwere not built for women and children,\u201d saying that was why agents have been \u201cbegging\u201d\u00a0Congress for more funding for beds \u201cso these families can be moved into a proper facility with proper care.\u201d OCASIO-CORTEZ ALLEGEDLY SCREAMED AT BORDER AGENTS DURING RECENT TRIP TO SOUTHERN BORDER: REPORT But, a Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News on Tuesday that CBP agents \u201care not equipped for the sheer volume of people\u201d in facilities. \u201cHHS is backed up with children, so there is a real backlog at the CBP facilities there,\u201d the official explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem. The supplemental funding will help, but it\u2019s a band-aid on a much bigger problem.\u201d The official was referring to a recently passed funding bill for the crisis at the border. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s visit and allegations came after the discovery of a secret Facebook group in which Border Patrol agents allegedly posted vulgar jokes and images about her, as well as illegal immigrants. OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS The website ProPublica posted the story Monday headlined: \u201cInside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.\u201d In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a \u201cburrito at these b-----s.\u201d Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

      "content": " EXCLUSIVE -- Scherie Murray, a New York businesswoman who immigrated from Jamaica\u00a0as a child and is active in state Republican politics, is launching a campaign Wednesday for the congressional seat held by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Fox News has learned. In a phone interview, Murray, 38, confirmed her intention to run for the New York congressional seat as a Republican. TRUMP FIRES BACK AT SQUAD, CHALLENGES HOUSE TO \u2018REBUKE\u2019 THEM FOR \u2018FILTHY AND HATE LACED\u2019 LANGUAGE \u201cThere is a crisis in Queens, and it\u2019s called AOC,\u201d Murray told Fox News. \u201cAnd instead of focusing on us, she\u2019s focusing on being famous. Mainly rolling back progress and authoring the job-killing Green New Deal\u00a0and killing the Amazon New York deal.\u201d Murray, who was born in Jamaica and moved to the United States when she was 9, is officially launching her campaign Wednesday with an introductory video that takes sharp jabs at the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cYour representative in Washington chooses self-promotion over service, conflict over constituents, resistance over assistance,\"\u00a0Murray said in the video. \"Queens and the Bronx needs someone who will create jobs instead of turning them away.\" Asked about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s brand of Democratic socialism, Murray said, \u201cI think it\u2019s far, far to the left and it is not connecting with everyday Americans.\u201d As for \"Medicare-for-all,\" which Ocasio-Cortez has embraced, the Republican said: \u201cMedicare-for-all, I think a lot of people are happy with their current health insurance.\u201d And on the Green New Deal, the left-wing proposal to address climate change pushed by Ocasio-Ortez, she said: \u201cWe know that it certainly will kill jobs.\u201d Murray joins four other Republicans who have filed to run for the seat: former police officer John Cummings, medical journalist Ruth Papazian, construction contractor Miguel Hernandez and entrepreneur Antoine Tucker. No Democrats have yet announced a primary challenge to Ocasio-Cortez, though there's been speculation that establishment Democrats\u00a0could rally behind a primary\u00a0challenger. Ocasio-Cortez shocked the political world in 2018 by defeating longtime Rep. Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary. Whichever Republican candidate emerges from the primary field will face a steep uphill climb in the overwhelmingly Democratic district. But Murray and others are looking to paint Ocasio-Cortez as more of a celebrity than a lawmaker, while stressing their ability to work across party lines. Murray's new campaign video, which doesn\u2019t mention President Trump or the Republican Party, portrays Murray as a bridge-builder.\u00a0She is a former state committeewoman of the New York State Republican Party. Asked during the interview if\u00a0she considers herself a Trump supporter, she said \u201cyes.\u201d She said she is in the process of talking with national Republicans about her campaign, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a prominent black Republican in Congress. She expressed disgust over the recent spat between Trump and Ocasio-Cortez and her allies. Trump has taken heat for telling Ocasio-Cortez and other minority progressives to \"go back\" to where they came from\u00a0\u2013 provoking accusations from Democrats that Trump's comments are racist. \u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting, to be quite honest,\u201d Murray said of the controversy, without specifying which part of it disgusts her. \u201cI think we are missing the point of why we\u2019re elected to public office: to legislate on policy, to deliver results to those kitchen table issues that are affecting everyday Americans.\u201d Murray later clarified her thoughts on the back-and-forth, saying of Trump's tweet, \"Is that how I would have worded it? No. Do I think the president is a racist? No.\" She added, \"But I want to get back to the core of why we\u2019re even talking about this \u2013 there is a crisis at our border.\" Murray, who grew up\u00a0in Southeast\u00a0Queens and worked for the city\u2019s Jamaica Bus Depot as a teenager, founded a television production and advertising company called The Esemel Group in 2004. She said her business generated employment for minorities in New York City. She said she no longer works for the company and is now a full-time mother. The GOP primary will take place in June 2020. Winning a general election in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district would be\u00a0a long shot for any Republican: In 2018, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s GOP opponent, Anthony Pappas, won just 14 percent of the vote. But Murray still insists a Republican could win \u2013 even in a Democratic-controlled district \u2013 because of dissatisfaction\u00a0with\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cA Republican can win the district,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an absolute path to victory when you look at a general election campaign.\u201d",

Sanders has also said he would\u00a0raise taxes, including for the middle class, to pay for Medicare for All, and that \"there will be pain\" in a\u00a0transition\u00a0to a single-payer system. Former Vice President Joe Biden's healthcare plan, released on Monday, does not go as far as Medicare for All. His proposal includes a public option to buy into a Medicare-like plan and wouldn't eliminate private health insurance. Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., thanked those who came out in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., after President Trump tweeted a video edited to suggest that the Minnesota congresswoman was dismissive of the significance of the September\u00a011, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, called on members of Congress to respond to Trump\u2019s \u201cexplicit attack today.\u201d AOC FACES BACKLASH FOR USING \u2018FIRST THEY CAME\u2026\u2019 HOLOCAUST POEM IN DEFENSE OF OMAR \u201cIlhan Omar\u2019s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out,\u201d she tweeted Friday. The freshman congresswoman thanked Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for applauding Omar\u2019s \u201cstrength and courage.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t back down to Trump\u2019s racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her end,\u201d Sanders tweeted. Ocasio-Cortez then thanked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for calling out others who refused to condemn Trump\u2019s video. WHITE HOUSE RIPS OMAR FOR CALLING STEPHEN MILLER A \u2018WHITE NATIONALIST,\u2019 HIGHLIGHTS HER \u2018HISTORY OF ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS\u2019 \u201cThe President is inciting against a sitting Congresswoman \u2013 and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThank you for standing up for all of us, Sen. Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. The New York congresswoman retweeted comments from others who defended Omar including 2020 presidential contender Julian Castro and Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-N.Y. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Trump's video, saying \"The president shouldn't use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack.\" \u201cAs we visit our troops in Stuttgart to thank them and be briefed by them, we honor our first responsibility as leaders to protect and defend the American people. It is wrong for the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe,\" Pelosi said in a statement. Trump\u2019s video pulled a snippet of Omar\u2019s speech last month to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she described the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center as \"some people did something,\" as well as news footage of the hijacked planes hitting the towers. Trump on Friday tweeted, \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET!\" In the speech, Omar, who is one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, told CAIR in Los Angeles that many Muslims saw their civil liberties eroded after the attacks, and she advocated for activism. \"For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,\" she said in the March 23 speech, according to video posted online. \"CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\" CAIR was founded in 1994, according to its website, but its membership increased dramatically following the attacks. Her comments prompted responses from\u00a0Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, who called her remarks \"unbelievable.\" Thursday\u2019s cover of the New York Post\u00a0addressed her remarks with\u00a0a\u00a0front page that featured an infamous\u00a0photo of New York City\u2019s Twin Towers on fire on the day of the attacks.

      "subtitle": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shuns Hollywood elites in West Coast tour",
      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": " New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently one of the leading lights of the Democrats\u2019 left-wing, is on a tour of the West Coast -- but is notably avoiding meeting up with the region\u2019s Hollywood elites. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the party\u2019s democratic socialist wing, has visited homeless areas on Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row neighborhood, and has met with liberal activists. But as she has held low-dollar fundraisers, she has not engaged in glitzy events with high-profile Democratic donors and Hollywood celebrities. The move has already raised eyebrows, with\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0asking: \u201cIs Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Too Far Left for Hollywood?\u201d The outlet reported that it reached out to a number of \u201cpolitical operatives\u201d and \u201cmembers of the industry\u2019s donor class,\u201d who all said they were not aware of any meetings with her -- while others weren\u2019t aware she was in L.A. She also reportedly didn\u2019t reach out to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Instead she held an event with a $27-a-head fee, or $10 for students. The move is is line with her campaign -- which was not supported by the Democratic Party machine, did not receive significant funding, and still managed to upend expectations as she beat Democratic Party mainstay Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y. While she has picked up the backing of some Hollywood celebrities, such as Susan Sarandon and Chelsea Handler, and has engaged in a whirlwind media tour, Ocasio-Cortez has so far held back from getting too close from the Democratic and Hollywood elites -- unlike other key Democratic figures like former President Barack Obama or 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who were both comfortable in such circles. Even Sanders, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has allied, occasionally dabbled in the Hollywood fundraising circuit, despite promising not to raise money from millionaires and billionaires. In 2015 he was\u00a0welcomed\u00a0at a campaign fundraiser at the Hollywood home of real estate agent Syd Leibovitch -- where those who spent $2,700 or who raised $10,000 were invited to a \"pre-event reception.\" SOCIALIST CANDIDATE OCASIO-CORTEZ ONCE SAW HERSELF AS SMITHIAN CAPITALIST, VIEWED FEMINISM AS 'RELIC' She has embraced far-left issues such as Medicare-for-all and calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.) She represents a rising left-wing within the party that has only been growing since democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a surprisingly strong primary challenge against eventual 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s rapid ascension from unknown candidate to political celebrity has raised concerns from more mainstream Democrats about how her brand of hard-left democratic socialism will play outside of left-wing hubs of New York City and Los Angeles. Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000,\u00a0in an interview with Fox News\u00a0last month, said that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s ideas will struggle to gain support across America. \"When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,\" Lieberman said. Former President Barack Obama issued a lengthy list of midterm endorsements last week -- a list which notably did not include Ocasio-Cortez. That nervousness is unlikely to have been soothed by recent media appearances. In a recent interview with \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d she struggled to lay out how she\u2019d fund her agenda -- that interview quickly went viral in delighted right-wing circles. She also got into trouble after she\u00a0referred\u00a0to Israel's \"occupation\" of Palestine, before admitting she was \"not the expert\" on the subject. But in L.A., the enthusiasm for her only appears to be growing. The Hollywood Reporter reported that an event with Ocasio-Cortez quickly sold out with almost no marketing. \"She really inspires me, because she's so young and she's getting so far,\" said Melainey Jane Foerster, 16, a high-school student from suburban Santa Clarita, told The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019s new, she\u2019s a fresh voice \u2014 and we\u2019ve been lacking that,\u2019\u2019 Faith Eberling, a longtime San Francisco Democrat, told\u00a0Politico.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, enabled a racist system after she voted in favor of a Senate border bill not backed by progressives. HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS RIPS AOC'S CHIEF OF STAFF FOR CRITICIZING LAWMAKER: 'KEEP HER NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH' \u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d the House Democratic Caucus' official account tweeted last month. \"Her name is Congresswoman Davids, not Sharice,\" the House Democrats added. \"She is a phenomenal new member who flipped a red seat blue.\" \"Keep Her Name Out Of Your Mouth,\" the tweet concluded -- with interspersed emojis of clapping hands. In July, Chakrabarti described centrist Democrats who blocked a liberal-backed emergency border bill as the \"new Southern Democrats.\" They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent [sic] to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he tweeted in a now-deleted post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Chakrabarti\u2019s comments contributed to the combative relationship between the progressive freshmen Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took a swipe at Ocasio-Cortez along with Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2013 whom she called \"four people\" who don't have any following. Ocasio-Cortez said they were singled out because they are newly elected women of color, further deepening divisions within the party. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, asked Ocasio-Cortez to fire Chakrabarti in an attempt to start over. His resignation came shortly after Ocasio-Cortez met with Pelosi in an effort to ease the tensions in the caucus. Fox News\u2019 Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",

The democratic socialist waded into the issue in response to a tweet alleging boyfriend\u00a0Riley Roberts had been put on staff. The tweet included a screenshot of an official House email address. Ocasio-Cortez insisted that he was only given the email account so he could access her calendar. \u201cActually this calendar designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Calendar. Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote, after political consultant Luke Thompson tweeted the picture showing Roberts having an official account\u00a0like other staffers on the Hill. \"Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense.\" AMAZON BLASTS OCASIO-CORTEZ, SAYS 'WE DON'T WANT TO WORK IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG TERM' Asked about the arrangement,\u00a0David O'Boyle, the spokesperson for the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, told Fox News: \"From time to time, at the request of members, spouses and partners are provided House email accounts for the purposes of viewing the member\u2019s calendar.\" But Jason Chaffetz, former chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Ocasio-Cortez' claims don\u2019t stack up. \"It\u2019s totally na\u00efve and inappropriate \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t allow it in most companies, let alone the House of Representatives.

It should be referred to the ethics committee for further investigation.\u201d Meanwhile, Thompson's tweet touched off a Twitter battle with the congresswoman's staff. Saikat Chakrabarti, the congresswoman\u2019s chief of staff, insisted that the boyfriend isn\u2019t on the payroll and that he\u2019s not doing any work related to the government. \u201cHe's not paid. We have no volunteers in the office. He's not doing any government work.

Still, O'Boyle cited the practice of sometimes allowing spouses access. Chaffetz said that Roberts having email access could also create other security issues and the matter should be referred to the Capitol\u00a0Police for further investigation. \u201cBeing given a password to get into the House computer system has other potentially problematic issues,\u201d he said.

Fresh off helping drive Amazon\u2019s planned headquarters out of New York City, the rising Democratic star has inspired a billboard in Times Square. \u201cAmazon Pullout, Thanks for Nothing, AOC,\u201d the billboard, located on 42nd street near 8th Avenue, reads. OCASIO-CORTEZ GOES ON TEAR DEFENDING ROLE IN AMAZON'S NEW YORK EXIT The high-visibility blast is funded by the Job Creators Network\u00a0and will be up for all to see until next Wednesday. \u201cThe Amazon pullout is a perfect example of what we\u2019ve been saying: socialism takes and capitalism creates,\u201d Alfredo Ortiz, JCN president and CEO said in a release on Wednesday. \u201cThe economic consequences of the HQ2 termination gives America a small taste of the harm that is to come if Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s anti-business canon comes to fruition and is made federal policy.\u201d NEW YORK CITY'S DE BLASIO BLAMES AMAZON FOR CAVING ON DEAL FOR NEW HEADQUARTERS IN CITY It comes after Ocasio-Cortez vigorously defended her role in sinking Amazon\u2019s move to New York City on Tuesday in the face of bipartisan criticism, claiming the deal would have been \u201cone of the biggest giveaways in state history\u201d and would have priced people out of the local community. \u201cFrankly, the knee-jerk reaction assuming that I \u2018don\u2019t understand\u2019 how tax giveaways to corps work is disappointing,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not possible that I could come to a different conclusion. The debate *must* be over my intelligence & understanding, instead of the merits of the deal.\u201d The freshman Democratic New York congresswoman has faced days of criticism from normally friendly media voices and fellow Democrats over her role in Amazon's decision to pull back from building a $2.5 billion campus in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. Amazon had cited the opposition of \u201ca number of state and local politicians\u201d in its decision to abandon the plans. Ocasio-Cortez and others at the local level had pointed to incentives such as a $2.5 billion in tax breaks as a reason for their opposition. \u201cIf we were willing to give away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest those $3 billion in our district ourselves, if we wanted to. We could hire out more teachers. We can fix our subways. We can put a lot of people to work for that money, if we wanted to,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said last week. Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed back on that claim on Sunday. Even as he slammed Amazon for its decision, the mayor said critics wrongly suggested that tax breaks represented money that could be spent on other things. He said it wasn\u2019t \u201cmoney you had over here. And it was going over there.\u201d CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democratic mayor said: \u201cThat $3 billion that would go back in tax incentives was only after we were getting the jobs and getting the revenue.\u201d Fellow Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., accused those who are against the deal, including Ocasio-Cortez, of being opposed to jobs. \"It used to be that we would protest wars. Now we are protesting jobs?\u201d she said on CNN Friday, before criticizing the economic arguments of those opposed to the Amazon move. \"I'm a progressive too, but I'm pragmatic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are $4 billion less than we usually get and yet we are kicking out a company that would have been projected [to pay] over 10 years roughly $27 billion in taxes.\u201d Amazon announced in November that it had chosen the Long Island City section of Queens for one of two new headquarters, with the other in Arlington, Va. Both would get 25,000 jobs. A third site in Nashville, Tenn., would get 5,000. The company planned to spend $2.5 billion building the New York office, choosing the area in part because of its large pool of tech talent. The governor and the mayor had argued that the project would spur economic growth that would pay for the $2.8 billion in state and city incentives many times over.",

Any person who has been abused, assaulted, etc knows that abusers often present as 'upstanding.'\" She added, \"Domestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus, domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence. That\u2019s why 'vouching for friend'\u00a0isn\u2019t a substitute for a background check.\" She also said that \"if a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn\u2019t \u2018lend\u2019 a gun,\u201d while arguing that her state is one of the safest regarding gun violence. \"Try to keep up,\" she tweeted. Crenshaw is now the second Texas lawmaker to get into a high-profile Twitter battle since the Odessa shooting. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP On Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took actress Alyssa Milano to task over her faith-based question about where in the Bible does it say that a person has the right to own a firearm. Cruz responded, telling the anti-gun activist, it was an \"excellent\" question, \"worth considering [without] the snark of Twitter,\" before citing a few examples from the Bible. \"It is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-give [sic] but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right to life is the right to DEFEND your life & your family,\" the Texas conservative began. \"The right to self-defense is recognized repeatedly in the Bible,\" Cruz wrote, for example, \"Exodus 22:2: 'If a thief is caught breaking in at night & is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.' (Note, though, verse 3 says it IS murder if during daylight (ie, not self-defense).\" He also clashed with Chicago's mayor over the gun violence debate.

The tweet barrage came in response to Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0appeared to call out Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, over claims he used the messaging service WhatsApp during a House hearing on Tuesday. The committee met to discuss White House security clearances when the freshman congresswoman brought up media reports alleging that\u00a0Kushner used WhatsApp to conduct\u00a0government business outside official\u00a0channels. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a letter that\u00a0Abbe Lowell, a\u00a0Kushner lawyer, indicated said her client\u00a0had\u00a0used WhatsApp to conduct official business, including by communicating with \u201cpeople outside the United States.\u201d In his response letter, Lowell stressed that he didn\u2019t say if\u00a0Kushner had used WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders or officials. He also said he\u00a0informed the committee that Kushner had complied\u00a0with all protocols involving classified information. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, LIZ CHENEY DISAGREE ON TWITTER OVER KNOWLEDGE OF 22ND AMENDMENT, CONSTITUTION \u201cWe are getting reports from press and from a wide variety of sources that indicate that folks are suggesting that we are conducting foreign relations with folks with security clearances via WhatsApp,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the hearing Tuesday. \u201cEvery day that we go on without getting to the bottom of this matter is a day that we are putting hundreds if not potentially thousands of Americans at risk. I mean, really, what is next, putting nuclear codes in Instagram DMs [direct messages]? This is ridiculous. We have to get to the bottom of this.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said subpoenas were needed because \u201cpeople in this administration are not cooperating.\u201d \u201cAnd every day that there is an insecure line of communication that could be leaked, that could be hacked, that could be screenshot-ed without proper channels is a day that we are putting our national security at risk,\u201d she said. MSNBC, NBC NEWS STAY SILENT ON EDITOR DNC 'BULLYING CONTROVERSY,' EMBRACE OCASIO-CORTEZ WITH TOWN HALL On Monday, Cummings released a memo with details from private committee interview with whistleblower Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversaw the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides. She said she'd compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year but were eventually granted access after senior officials overruled those decisions. Cummings\u2019 panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials\u00a0including Kushner. The letter comes about a month after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner clearance despite the objections of national security officials, and after Newbold spoke to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns. The issue is setting up another clash between the White House and the Democrat-controlled House. Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe. Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms, and, according to The Times, career officials recommended against granting him a clearance before Trump personally overruled them.

      "author": "Andrew Keiper",
      "content": " EXCLUSIVE -- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has been hit with another Federal Election\u00a0Commission (FEC) complaint, this one alleging she and her campaign manager operated a \u201csubsidy scheme\u201d that ran afoul of campaign finance laws. The crux of the complaint, which was given exclusively to Fox News in advance of its filing Wednesday, accused Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign manager, Saikat Chakrabarti, of overseeing a \"shadowy web\" of political action committees (PACs) that allowed them to raise more cash than they could have legally. It also alleged that a limited liability company (LLC) was created to avoid federal expenditure requirements by offering Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic candidates political consulting services at a price so low that the company apparently shut down before the election was even over. AOC DENIES DARK MONEY ALLEGATIONS IN FEC COMPLAINT The complaint named Ocasio-Cortez, Chakrabarti (now her chief of staff), the Justice Democrats PAC, the Brand New Congress PAC and Brand New Congress LLC as the overlapping entities that aimed to \u201csubsidize cheap assistance for Ocasio-Cortez and other candidates at rates far below market value.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez dismissed the complaint when approached for comment by Fox News Wednesday afternoon, saying: \"I mean, it's conservative interest groups just filing bogus proposals\" before walking into a House Financial Services Committee meeting. At the center of the complaint is Brand New Congress LLC, a now-defunct company owned by Chakrabarti that aimed to recruit up to 400 candidates for national office and \u201cfully run all of their campaigns,\u201d according to a post on the Justice Democrats PAC website. \u201cChakrabarti was trying to create the Uber for politics,\u201d said Dan Backer, the conservative attorney behind the complaint. \u201cUber functions because of a massive subsidy from venture capital. Here, it\u2019s subsidized by these PACs to deliver a valuable service that people need and want, but can\u2019t be delivered at the real cost of it.\u201d The Virginia-based attorney has made political hay with recent complaints against Ocasio-Cortez. This is Backer\u2019s second FEC complaint against her in less than a month. He used the first as somewhat of a springboard to launch the Stop the AOC PAC, which he said has raised a few thousand dollars and conducted polling in her New York City district. Backer's Stop the AOC PAC isn't his first political action committee. In recent years, he's registered organizations such as the Stop Hillary PAC, the pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, and the Stop Pelosi PAC. Backer said Brand New Congress LLC was guilty of providing campaign contributions known as \"in-kind\" expenditures by only charging candidates for a portion of the total cost of the service. Essentially, Backer claimed the company operated at a loss to provide its approved candidates with campaign services on the cheap. OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLS OUT JARED KUSHNER'S ALLEGED USE OF WHATSAPP FOR GOVERNMENT BUSINESS This was a problem, he said, because of a series of 1990s-era FEC Advisory Opinions which essentially explained that goods and services provided to political campaigns must be paid for at fair market value \u2013 otherwise they could be considered in-kind contributions. It was unclear what Chakrabarti and Brand New Congress charged for their services --\u00a0and Backer said this was another part of the problem. He said the private company wouldn't be subject to the same disclosure and transparency laws that PACs are. In a May 2018 blog post, the Justice Democrats PAC admitted it was offering services at a rate that would never turn a profit, and that was exactly the point. \"[The] goal of creating the LLC was not to make a profit,\" the post read, \"and as such, we made our prices as low as possible while still satisfying the FEC's requirement that we are charging something reasonable because, again, if we weren't we would essentially be doing heavily discounted work for candidates and that is illegal and immoral since fighting dark money is literally what we want to do.\" Also driving the complaint were the overlapping leadership roles of Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti on the implicated organizations. Ocasio-Cortez was in charge of her campaign while simultaneously serving as a board member of the Justice Democrats PAC. Her dual role isn\u2019t unusual, according to Brendan Quinn, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. He said it hasn\u2019t been out of the ordinary for members of Congress to sit on boards of multiple PACs, nor is it illegal or improper. Backer said Chakrabarti, however, \u201cwas on all sides of the scheme.\u201d He owned Brand New Congress LLC, sat on the board of the Justice Democrats PAC and co-founded the Brand New Congress PAC\u2014all while serving as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign manager. Coming to a conclusion in the complaint may be a lengthy process, though. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThe FEC has only four commissioners out of its usual slate of six,\u201d said Corey Goldstone, media strategist at the Campaign Legal Center, which identifies as a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cSince federal law requires at least four votes on the six-member commission to take official action, the FEC can barely lift a finger even when violations are clear and obvious. In this case, it\u2019s not clear there was any wrongdoing, and the allegations seem speculative. We haven\u2019t seen evidence that the PACs improperly subsidized work for the campaign or have reason to believe that laws were broken.\u201d Backer said he expected the gridlock at the FEC\u00a0and planned to sue if his complaints sit for 120 days and litigation is allowed under law. \u201cAt the end of the day,\" Backer said, \"It would be wonderful if the FEC would get off its dysfunctional ass and rule on these things.\" Fox News' Alex Diaz and Perry Chiaramonte contributed to this report.",

In response to President Trump's comments about the Democrat\u00a0from New York and her proposed climate change reform, the Green New Deal, Payne said Ocasio-Cortez has \"thrown her weight around\" in Congress and terrified those around her. \"We just saw a vote where the Democrats ran away from it [the Green New Deal]\u00a0when they had the opportunity to, but\u00a0as soon as the Green New Deal came out, all of the major presidential candidates jumped on board, and in fact, many of them are doubling down,\" Payne said on \"America's Newsroom\" on Wednesday. CHARLES PAYNE CALLS OCASIO-CORTEZ'S DEFENSE OF GREEN NEW DEAL 'DISINGENUOUS' President Trump has consistently taken aim at Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal, most recently during a speech at the National Republican Congressional Committee's spring dinner on Tuesday. While addressing attendees, he encouraged them not to vote down the Green New Deal just yet because he wants to run against it in 2020. \"If they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose,\" President Trump said. A vote on the Green New Deal was\u00a0set last week by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a bid to divide Democratic senators on the issue, and the majority of lawmakers voted not to begin debate on the non-binding resolution. In response, Payne labeled the Democrats behavior towards the plan as \"absurd,\" and said that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is \"running the show over there, bottom line.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has thrown her weight around on a number of things, and she's dramatically changed the Democratic party, and she has become the de facto leader without a doubt,\" he continued.",

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., appeared in a video on Monday with former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Rep.\u00a0Barbara Lee, D-Calif., to push for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans\u00a0federal money from funding abortions. In the video, which was published on The Root\u00a0to mark\u00a0the amendment's 43rd anniversary, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez enthusiastically back the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act (EACH Woman\u00a0Act), a bill authored by Lee that\u00a0would repeal Hyde. The bill has racked up 169 co-sponsors since its introduction in March. The Hyde Amendment was\u00a0\"an egregious policy rider,\" Pressley said, \"which does not allow Medicaid to include abortion coverage.\" HOUSE REAUTHORIZES HYDE AMDNEMENT, DESPITE PROTESTS FROM 2020 DEMS Hyde, which bans any federal money from paying for abortion except in cases of rape and incest,\u00a0was introduced in 1976 by Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde. Democrats and Republicans have voted to keep the amendment in effect through the years, notably this\u00a0June when the House passed a spending bill to which a Hyde Amendment reauthorization was attached. Some Democrats and most Republicans\u00a0disagree with Lee, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez. \"The Hyde Amendment was historically a great compromise between pro-choicers and pro-lifers,\" conservative commentator Meghan McCain said on \"The View\" in June, soon after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden reneged on his longtime support for the Hyde Amendment. \"I feel slighted as someone who was open to him being president, and I think that it\u2019s a dangerous lane for him to take to go super far left.\" TRUMP CALLS AOC, SCHIFF AND NADLER 'DEMOCRAT SAVAGES' AS IMPEACHMENT CALLS INTENSIFY Lee, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0say the Hyde Amendment particularly harms poor and minority communities. \"I was a staffer in 1977 to the late, great feminist congressman Ron Dellums,\" Lee said in the video for The Root.\u00a0\"I knew exactly what this would do, and that would be to deny low-income women and women of color access to the full range of reproductive rights, including abortion.\" Later in the video, Ocasio-Cortez said\u00a0the trio's effort to repeal Hyde was\u00a0a defense of Roe v. Wade and women's right to abortion. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our access to reproductive justice and reproductive freedom should not be income-based,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Repealing Hyde means that low-income women, women who are incarcerated, nonbinary people who need access to an abortion can get it, not because they are wealthy\u00a0but because they are an American.\"",

House race\u00a0- Audible: A tough old Tom - \u2018This particular collection of crusts\u2019\n\n\nBERNIE, WARREN CLAMBER FOR OCASIO-CORTEZ NOD\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0primary is heating up. For the second time in five days, the star freshman congresswoman is appearing alongside Bernie Sanders at a high-profile event. Rep.\u00a0Ro Khanna, co-chairman of Sanders' campaign, is talking with Ocasio-Cortez's staff about the primary. And Sanders' team told POLITICO that he and Ocasio-Cortez \u2018have had phone calls.\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez's work on Sanders' 2016 campaign \u2014 and the fact that several staffers from that bid went on to work for her and the pro-Ocasio-Cortez group Justice Democrats \u2014 suggest the Vermont senator has the inside track for her coveted endorsement. But Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0is making an aggressive pitch for Ocasio-Cortez's nod, too: She\u2019s met with her privately and wrote a gushing essay about her for Time magazine. An aide to Warren said their teams have been in touch.\u201d Bernie tries to keep his outsider status -\u00a0WSJ:\u00a0\u201cBernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who came up through that state\u2019s democratic socialist party, launched his insurgent campaign for president four years ago as an outsider challenging the Democratic machine. Now, in this early stage of the 2020 presidential race, Mr. Sanders is a Democratic front-runner and newly minted millionaire, with high name recognition and $18 million raised in the first six weeks of his campaign, so far outpacing his rivals.\u201d\n\nDems approach two dozen candidates as Montana governor joins fray -\u00a0HuffPost: \u201cMontana Gov.\u00a0Steve Bullock\u00a0(D) is running for president, he announced on Tuesday. \u2018We need to defeat Donald Trump in 2020 and defeat the corrupt system that lets campaign money drown out the people\u2019s voice, so we can finally make good on the promise of a fair shot for everyone,\u2019 Bullock said in a campaign launch video.\u00a0Bullock \u2026 is the only Democratic candidate who has won a statewide office in a state that went for the president in 2016: In his reelection that year, Bullock won by 4 percentage points even as Trump took Montana by 20. The two-term governor, who has served in that office since 2013, would not be able to run for reelection next year due to term limits. The Montana native and former state attorney general formed a political action committee, Big Sky Values PAC, in 2017, according to MTN News.\u201d\n\nWhile others talk college, Castro zeroes in on pre-kindergarten - AP: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro\u00a0on Monday unveiled an education plan that joins other 2020 candidates in calling for tuition-free higher education, universal prekindergarten and raising teacher pay. The rollout follows the former Obama Cabinet member\u2019s immigration plan that was more detailed than many of his rivals in the sprawling Democratic field. This time, Castro is getting behind education reforms that other candidates have also embraced ahead of the first debates in June that he believes will offer his slow-building campaign a new chance to stand out. Expanding prekindergarten was arguably Castro\u2019s signature mark during his five years as mayor of San Antonio\u2026 Castro has also come around to eliminating tuition at public colleges. He had previously stopped short of championing the idea during his campaign launch in January, instead proposing to make the first two years of college \u2018affordable\u2019 and accessible.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK:\u00a0PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT\n\n\u201cAs long, therefore, as the existing republican forms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the federal Constitution.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 43\n\nTIME OUT: DEEPER MEANING TO MODERN ART\nNatGeo:\u00a0\u201cWhen the Tetraeder was built in 1994, many residents of Bottrop, a post-industrial city in western Germany, thought it a waste of public money.

The higher you climb the staircase within, the more it creaks and sways. This is not by accident, notes\u00a0Wolfgang Christ, the Tetraeder\u2019s architect. The feeling of being unsafe is meant to remind visitors what it was like for miners descending deep into the coal mines. By the time you clamber to the top, you feel exactly what he means.

But the North Carolina State Board of Elections delayed certifying the results in the face of election fraud allegations. \u2026 Harris declined to run for the redo contest, citing health issues. Other big names, including former Gov.\u00a0Pat McCrory\u00a0and Pittenger, also passed on the race, which gave way to a crowded field of 10 Republican candidates. If none of them receive more than 30 percent of the vote, the runner-up may request a runoff, which would be held on Sept. 10, followed by a general election on Nov. 5.

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ripped the \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law Tuesday morning, calling it \u201ca backdoor ban.\u201d The controversial bill, HB 481, technically called the \u201cLiving Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act,\u201d will prohibit abortions in Georgia after a heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The law allows exceptions in the case of rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger. It has been called the most extreme abortion law in the nation. The Republican governor said he was aware that the bill will most likely be challenged in court. The freshman Democrat tweeted Tuesday after news that the bill was signed into law, \u201c6 weeks pregnant = 2 weeks late on your period.\u201d \u201cMost of the men writing these bills don\u2019t know the first thing about a woman\u2019s body outside of the things they want from it. It\u2019s relatively common for a woman to have a late period + not be pregnant. So this is a backdoor ban.\u201d OCASIO-CORTEZ SUGGEST TRUMP 'VULNERABLE TO SHADY ACTIVITY' DUE TO ALLEGED BUSINESS LOSSES DECADES AGO Ocasio-Cortez provided some context in a follow-up tweet. \u201cFor context, this kicks in within days of a typical at-home test working. If you were sexually assaulted (stress delays cycle), took a morning-after pill (throws off cycle), or have an irregular cycle, you\u2019d have no idea. There are a TON of ways this law ignores basic biology,\u201d she wrote. Current law allows women in Georgia to seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. If it\u2019s not blocked in court, the new ban would take effect Jan. 1. Opponents have promised to sue over the constitutionality of the bill and argue that because some women don't know they are pregnant when a heartbeat is detectable that the new law virtually bans all abortions in the state. Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan called the bill \u201can all-out abortion ban.\u201d Jordan said she is particularly worried that the new law will push obstetricians away from practicing in Georgia, worsening health care outcomes for women in a state that already has one of the nation's worst maternal mortality rates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's about the unintended consequences,\" Jordan said. \"They're making policy choices that are going to end up causing women to die, and they're preventable deaths.\" The state has at least 11 abortion providers, according to the National Abortion Federation. Lawmakers in other states including Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and West Virginia, are considering similar proposals. A bill that recently passed the Alabama House would outlaw abortions at any stage of pregnancy, with a few narrow exceptions.

She has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state\u2019s three other freshman members. And it\u2019s unclear whether the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually still lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise \u2014 even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district. OCASIO-CORTEZ GETS FRESH CRITICISM OVER AMAZON AS NEW BILLBOARDS IN NEW YORK EMERGE Ocasio-Cortez has used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, and even posed in the one-bedroom Bronx flat for celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz in a Vogue magazine profile after her stunning November election. But The Post could find little indication she continues to live there. The Post e-mailed the Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 spokesman, Corbin Trent, four times with specific questions \u2014 they were all ignored. On Saturday, The Post reached Corbin by phone. \u201cWe will not be commenting,\u201d he said. Among the queries he refused to answer: Where does the congresswoman live? On Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona. During the event, two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones. \u201cCome downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,\u201d the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off. Ocasio-Cortez was in New York City last weekend and this weekend, with appearances in Queens on both Saturdays \u2014 yet she was not seen coming or going from her Parkchester pad either day. Her apartment\u2019s next-door neighbor said she had never seen Ocasio-Cortez. Another neighbor, who has lived down the hall from the congresswoman\u2019s apartment for the last 40 years, said he\u2019d never seen her or her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, who has claimed the address as his own since last spring. \u201cI would have remembered,\u201d said the neighbor when shown a photograph of Ocasio-Cortez. Workers at Jerry\u2019s Pizzeria, less than a block from her building, and at the local grocery store said she had never patronized their businesses \u2014 and a server at a nearby taqueria said the congresswoman had only come in to be filmed by news crews. A postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently and that several months\u2019 worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. The worker said that Ocasio-Cortez and Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cJust because their names are on the box doesn\u2019t mean they live there,\u201d he said. And in 2017, when Ocasio-Cortez first filed paperwork to become a congressional candidate, she didn\u2019t even know what district she lived in, mistakenly declaring plans to run for neighboring District 15 before correcting the error days later. Meanwhile, in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez has rented a pad in a luxe building in the chic Navy Yard neighborhood, where studios start at $1,840 a month,\u00a0according to the Washington Examiner.

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will have to get through a primary challenger if she wants to hold on to her seat in 2020. Democratic activist Badrun Khan, who has challenged Ocasio-Cortez for the Democratic nomination to represent\u00a0New York's 14th district.\u00a0\u00a0says on her website that she'll provide \"REAL Results... Not Empty Promises\" -- an apparent jab at the socialist darling. When asked about Khan's\u00a0challenge, Ocasio-Cortez said:\u00a0\u201cI just focus on delivering for my district and doing the best job. I try not to focus too much on other folks in the field,\"\u00a0according to The Hill. Khan\u00a0filed her statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Committee in July. The website for New York City's government confirms that Khan serves on\u00a0Queens Community Board 2. AOC HITS NEW YORK TIMES' 'CONDESCENSION' TOWARDS HER, SUGGESTS PAPER IS TRYING TO 'GASLIGHT' THE LEFT Khan's\u00a0website doesn't appear to have an official announcement and she did not respond to Fox News' request for comment by the time of publication.\u00a0Instead, her website detailed her background as a community activist and daughter of Bengali immigrants. \"Badrun has worked towards political and social empowerment for her community,\" her website read.\u00a0\"Her service has gone well beyond the Bengali community. She is an active presence in schools and service to all the residents in her Queens community. She has volunteered and served with honor as a member of Community Board 2. Badrun continues to works diligently each day to help her community and the people of Queens.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khan's website says she wants to enhance Medicare and Social Security but appeared to take a shot at\u00a0\"Medicare-for-all,\" a plan championed by progressives like Ocasio-Cortez. \"She will fight to make sure Health Care is made available for all and that those who have existing coverage can choose to keep what they currently have,\" the site said, apparently referring to concerns that \"Medicare-for-all\" would take away private insurance.",

Just three months after taking office, the Democratic socialist congresswoman\u2019s challengers include an Egyptian American journalist, who has\u00a0already tossed her hat in the ring, and an NYPD cop-turned-high-school-civics teacher and conservative talk-radio producer, both of whom are seriously exploring a run against her.

      "content": " She\u2019s a medical journalist and former publicist with no political background, but Bronx native Ruth Papazian, 61, sees it as her duty \u2013 however much a long shot \u2013 to swipe the seat of\u00a029-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 congressional elections. \u201cIt became clear that if I didn't step up to fight for our district, we'd end up with yet another passive Republican candidate who didn't bother to campaign,\u201d Papazian told Fox News. \u201cAnd Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hasn't lived in the district since early childhood. Those of us who stuck it out, and actually live here, care about our future, and need representation.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, but has since denied reports that she doesn\u2019t live in the Manhattan borough. Meanwhile, Papazian \u2013 the daughter of Egyptian immigrants\u00a0who currently lives with her widowed mother \u2013 has accused the headline-making\u00a0freshman representative of never responding to concerned people in the district \u201cwho have serious questions about her unrealistic and unworkable policies,\u201d and claims\u00a0that she \u201chas a mostly unstaffed office in Queens, and when constituents call her office in DC to ask for help, they get phone recordings with full message boxes.\u201d WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS But for this Bronx Republican, it is\u00a0the incumbent\u2019s economic policies that are the driving force behind her own political aspirations. \u201cIt has been galling listening to Ocasio-Cortez push really hackneyed big government ideas that have failed around the world. These include her Green New Deal and Medicare for all,\u201d Papazian said. \u201cThis district is home to first and second-generation immigrants. It is a middle-class district, because our families came here, worked hard, bought houses, and flourished. Many of us come from families that escaped socialism. No one wants it here.\u201d And as\u00a0Papazian fears, some U.S. businesses also view the Ocasio-Cortez-led socialist economic plug as a possibility rather than\u00a0a delusional fantasy. Independent retailer Metals.com last month surveyed more than 100,000 of its members across the country to gather insights on the attitudes and behaviors of U.S. retirees aged 60 and over, with some 91.5 percent labeling the Democrat party \u201cas more socialist\u201d since the 2018 election. \u201cAs Democrats control the House, they are becoming openly bold about socialist programs \u2013 like Medicare for All, confiscatory tax rates for top earners and a Green New Deal, their hard-left turn is no longer a matter for discernment,\u201d said Metals Vice President Deric Scott. A\u00a0Gallup poll last year found that more Democrats \u2013 some 57 percent \u2013 now have a more \u201cpositive\u201d view of the word socialism than they did ten years ago amid the financial collapse. Papazian insists there is nothing optimistic about what her area\u2019s representative is promoting. \u201cOcasio-Cortez seems to have zero understanding of how our economy works to create the relative wealth and comfort people have made for themselves and their families. The Whitestone Bridge connects the East Bronx and Northwest Queens portions of the district. Her policies are literally a threat to our way of life,\u201d Papazian said. \u201cMontefiore Hospital is the biggest employer in the Bronx part, and her Medicare for All plans would bankrupt them. Tens of thousands of well-paid healthcare workers would be out of work.\u201d BERNIE SANDERS GRILLED ON SOCIALISM BY HARVARD STUDENT WHOSE FAMILY FLED SOVIET RUSSIA She also argued that Jet Blue and the airports are the biggest employers in the Queens part of the Ocasio-Cortez district and that her Green New Deal, \u201cwhich would get rid of air travel, would make tens of thousands of well-paid avionics workers jobless.\u201d Papazian said that she has\u00a0established an \u201cexploratory committee\u201d to begin crafting her running plans, and will file her official papers with the Federal Election Commission in the next few months. She also noted that the issues she intends to run on are centered on \u201cpro-growth tax policies for economic diversity, affordable private health insurance, border control as a national security issue, less government intrusion and regulation, strong defense and fewer wars\u201d and the local matter of fixing the \u201ccrumbling roads and subway system\u201d rather than bolstering the cost for vehicles heading into Manhattan as part of the Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo-backed push for a 2021 \u201ccongestion tax.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And while she is a rookie when it comes to an office run, Papazian is no newcomer when it comes to stymying political correctness and niceties. On her Facebook page, Papazian takes almost daily aim at Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 whom she refers to as the \u201cBronx Bolshevik\u201d \u2013 illuminating her policies with both dismay and derision, lambasting the young Democrat for everything from failing to respond to her constituency and adequately staff her office, to her \u201creality show\u201d struggles to set up IKEA furniture while the people in her district are left languishing amid real-life struggles, to suggesting she move\u00a0to the ravaged socialist nation of Venezuela. \u201cSeeing her in action, my shock turned to indignation at this takeover of an office that exists to meet our needs,\u201d Papazian added. A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but her representatives have previously stated that they \u201cwelcome\u201d competition and Democratic values.",

It got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful. ... The explicit singling out of newly elected women of color,\" Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. Those comments drew reactions Wednesday from\u00a0Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg on \"The View,\" as well as from U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo. \"It is so inappropriate. So uncalled for,\" Clay told Fox News on Thursday. \"It does not do anything to help with unity.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez.

According to Politico,\u00a0a video surfaced in 2014 of Cabrera\u00a0praising Uganda\u2019s restrictive anti-gay laws. In response, Cabrera, who is also a pastor, pointed out that he has voted in favor of every piece of legislation supported\u00a0by the LGBT caucus while on New York's city council. Cabrera was first elected to the city council in 2009, and he lives about a mile outside of the district which he is running to represent.

A number of Republicans have entered the race to challenge Ocasio-Cortez, but Cabrera is the first well-known Democrat to do so.
