By that time I had begun reading Palin’s book, and while I wouldn’t count myself a fan in the sense of being a supporter, I found it compelling and very well done.



My assessment of the book has nothing to do with the accuracy of its accounts. Some news agencies have fact-checkers poring over every sentence, which would be to the point if  the book were a biography, a genre that  is judged by the degree to which the factual claims being made  can be verified down to the last assertion. “Going Rogue,” however, is an autobiography, and  while autobiographers certainly insist that they are telling the truth, the truth the genre promises is the truth about themselves — the kind of persons they are — and even when they are being mendacious or self-serving (and I don’t mean to imply that Palin is either), they are, necessarily, fleshing out that truth. As I remarked in a previous column, autobiographers cannot lie because anything they say will truthfully serve their project, which, again, is not to portray the facts, but to portray themselves."

In response, Commentary’s Jennifer Rubin argued that I was missing the point, and that being perceived as having anything to do with the G.O.P. establishment would doubtless be the kiss of death of 2012. (“The party elders, for better or worse, are being ignored,” she wrote. “Ask [Marco] Rubio,  Rand Paul, Nikki Haley, Sharon Angle, and the rest if endorsements by  the establishment and big-name donors are the key to victory.”) This is true in a sense: Obviously nobody’s going to run for president in ’12 saying “I am the voice of the Republican establishment!”, and no candidate can hope to win the nomination if they’re perceived as a Mike Castle or Lisa Murkowski-style figure. But right now, in autumn 2010, at what seems like a moment of maximal populist outrage and anti-establishment fervor, Sarah Palin can’t crack 20 percent in primary polling, and Mitt Romney (for all his manifold weaknesses) still has the most plausible path to the nomination.
