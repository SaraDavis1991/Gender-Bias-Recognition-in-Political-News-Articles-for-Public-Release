      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump wants the Supreme Court to keep House Democrats from getting his financial records at least until the justices resolve a broader fight over efforts to subpoena a sitting president\u2019s records. Trump filed an emergency appeal with the court Friday in a case from Washington, D.C., over a subpoena from a House committee for financial records held by Trump\u2019s accountants. The request comes a day after he urged the high court to rule that a president cannot be prosecuted or even investigated for crimes while in office. The Thursday filing involves a subpoena issued by the Manhattan district attorney demanding Trump\u2019s tax returns from the same accounting firm. A temporary order blocking the enforcement of the House subpoena could allow the court to consider the two cases together. The New York dispute is on a fast timetable under which the high court is being asked to render a decision by late June. Without an order from the justices, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform would be able to ask for the records from the Mazars USA firm as early as Wednesday. Mazars has indicated it will comply with the subpoena unless ordered not to. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump directed his request to Chief Justice John Roberts because he handles emergency matters arising from courts in the nation\u2019s capital. Roberts could ask the full court to weigh in, but he has the authority to issue an order on his own. The two subpoenas are similar. Indeed, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has said he copied the House subpoena, although he substituted tax returns for the financial records the House is demanding. The House subpoena does not specifically mention Trump\u2019s tax returns.",

      "content": " The New York Attorney General's office announced Thursday that a judge has ordered President Trump to pay $2 million in damages for improper use of funds at the Trump Foundation in connection with the 2016 presidential primaries and his own political purposes, as part of a lawsuit Trump and the foundation settled with state Attorney General Letitia James. James' office had requested $2.8 million in restitution and a $5.6 million penalty, but Judge Saliann Scarpulla decided $2 million was a more reasonable restitution amount and declined to issue a penalty. As part of the settlement, Trump admitted to misusing Trump Foundation funds and agreed to limitations placed on future charitable work. If he chooses to start a new charitable organization, he would have to report it to the state attorney general's office, according to an announcement from James' office. TRUMP FOUNDATION AGREES TO DISSOLVE AFTER LAWSUIT ALLEGED 'ILLEGAL CONDUCT' \"The Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,\u201d\u00a0Attorney General Letitia James said in statement. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain.\" But Trump himself released a statement on Twitter on Thursday night saying James is \u201cdeliberately mischaracterizing this settlement for political purposes.\" The state filed the lawsuit against the Trump Foundation in June 2018, and the settlement includes four stipulation agreements, the first of which was fulfilled when the Trump Foundation agreed to shut down in Dec. 2018. The other three stipulations were added in Oct. 2019. They include distribution of the remainder of the foundation's assets to charities approved by James' office, training for the president's children Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr., and 19 paragraphs of Trump's admissions of illegal activity. Those admissions include failure of the foundation's board to meet or engage in proper oversight, and details regarding coordination with Trump's 2016 campaign, including a Trump Foundation fundraiser that the campaign organized, and use of foundation funds to pay legal obligations, and for a $10,000 portrait of Trump. As part of the settlement, James' office said, Donald Trump Jr. reimbursed the foundation for the portrait. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Attorney General's office stated that the $2 million in damages\u00a0and the remaining $1.78 million that the foundation has will go to\u00a0Army Emergency Relief, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha\u2019s Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. In a statement, a Trump Foundation spokesperson said the foundation was \"pleased to donate an additional $2 million\" to those organizations. \"Following the 2016 presidential election, the Trump Foundation publicly announced its intention to voluntarily dissolve and distribute all of its remaining funds to charity,\" the statement said. It continued: \"Unfortunately, that donation was delayed due to the Attorney General\u2019s politically motivated lawsuit.\u00a0 We are pleased that the Court, in rejecting the Attorney General\u2019s frivolous request for statutory penalties, interest and other damages, recognized that every penny ever raised by the Trump Foundation has gone to help those most in need.\u00a0Now that this matter is concluded, the Trump Foundation is proud to make this additional contribution.\" Fox News' John Roberts contributed to this report.",

The comments comes after Meghan McCain, who on Monday tore into the president during an emotional segment on \u201cThe View,\u201d\u00a0went back on the offensive on social media.\u00a0The 34-year-old shared a Toronto Star cartoon on Instagram\u00a0showing her late father\u2019s military medals side-by-side with a collection of pacifiers under the heading, \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d Shortly afterward, Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson fired back by mocking her post with one of her own.

That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life.\u201d McCain closed out the rebuke by adding: \u201cI genuinely feel bad for his family. I can\u2019t imagine having a father that does this on the weekends.\u201d Trump has repeatedly tweeted about John McCain in recent days, falsely claiming the late senator graduated \u201clast in his class\u201d at Annapolis and slamming his role in the Russia investigation. \u201cSo it was indeed (just proven in court papers) \u201clast in his class\u201d (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election.

While much of our current political condition is extraordinary, the truth is that we have been here before. Or at least in this neighborhood.\n\n We will come back to Flynn and the current discombobulation at the White House, but first, let\u2019s hop in the Wayback Machine.\n\n It was Feb. 3, 2009 that the newly minted Obama administration hit the skids.\n\n Recall the initial promise of the 44th president\u2019s tenure: a cool, technocratic, center-leftism that would deliver liberal policies but with such smart efficiency that even the business world would stand up and cheer.\n\n If you had \u201ctransformative\u201d on your Beltway buzzword bingo game, congratulations.\n\n Here was the idea: The Panic of 2008 and the deepening recession would make America ready for a new, pragmatic leftism powered by newly chic policy geeks, big data and the connectedness of its supporters that would sweep away the grubby, short-sighted politics of the previous 20 years in favor of strategic thinking.\n\nPresident Obama was like FDR. No, wait. Like Lincoln. Hold on. He\u2019s really Mr. Spock.\n\n Front and center on the bridge of the Enterprise and channeling the excitement of the coming technocratic revolution was former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.\n\n Though he had become a Washington influence peddler since getting bounced out on his fodder shocks by the voters of South Dakota in 2004, this transgression could be forgiven. Daschle was serving as the guru of what was and would, unfortunately for the new president, remain the centerpiece of his administration: a massive restructuring of the American health care system.\n\n But revolutionizing American health care was just part of the transformation. The way government itself operated would change as well. Accordingly, the president ordered the creation of the position of \u201cchief performance officer\u201d and tapped management consultant extraordinaire Nancy Killefer to launch the office.\n\n With a master\u2019s in business from M.I.T. and a sterling record at mega-consultancy McKinsey & Co., Killefer was going to give the federal government the equivalent of a colonoscopy to root out waste, inefficiency and outmoded practices.\n\n It was particularly important because Obama was pushing a $775 billion spending package that looked suspiciously like Washington business as usual, an unfocused heap of spending larded with goodies for powerful politicians and their friends.\n\n Not so, said Obama, vowing Killefer would take \u201cunprecedented measures to ensure that taxpayers keep track of how this money is spent.\u201d Obama allowed that his plan would cause the deficit spending about which had been so bitterly complaining under his predecessor to further skyrocket.\n\n The new president promised, though, that best practices imposed by Killefer and her fellows would ensure that the tide of red ink would soon be turned back and balanced budgets would return.\n\n But then **poof** both she and Daschle were gone.\n\n They had both failed to pay some of their taxes and having just pushed through Timothy Geithner\u2019s nomination as treasury secretary despite his own tax foibles, the president and his administration had no appetite for further embarrassments of the same kind.\n\n And in one day, the narrative changed. The transformational technocratic president and his team became bumblers whose arrogance and lack of experience was putting everything at risk. By April, the health law was a mess and the stimulus was a \u201cshovel-ready\u201d joke.\n\n Now, we have no idea what twists and turns will follow Flynn\u2019s late-night ejection from the Trump bubble. But we can know that this is one of those moments when the impossible expectations of a presidency come hurtling earthward.\n\n Of course, the narrative around Trump was quite the opposite of the one that welcomed Obama. Trump was greeted as a fascistic destroyer who would turn the federal government into a ruthlessly efficient engine of sadistic racism and cruelty.\n\n If Obama was going to turn America into \u201cStar Trek,\u201d Trump was staging a remake of \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d\n\n The good thing about the stumbles of presidential administrations is how they remind Americans of the real limits of practical power in our system. Remember that the best argument against conspiracy theories is the rank evidence of human incompetence everywhere.\n\n If the Nixon administration couldn\u2019t cover up a botched burglary do you think it really faked the moon landing?\n\n Flynn\u2019s tumultuous tenure was an easily avoided mistake. The president and his aides had been warned repeatedly about Flynn\u2019s unnerving proximity to the Kremlin and bent toward other controversial views.\n\n Trump, understandably grateful that Flynn had long ago staked his then-considerable reputation on backing Trump\u2019s once-improbable presidential bid gave his \u201cfavorite general\u201d the benefit of the doubt and assigned Flynn to the plum post\n\n When Flynn was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about \u2013 of all subjects! \u2013 his contacts with Russian officials, the mistake was plainly evident. And, quite understandably, Flynn had to go before he further compromised the trust of the national security team or did more damage to the administration on the already fraught subject of Kremlin ties.\n\n **Poof**\n\n Trump has work to do in buttoning up his White House and finding some way to plug the leaks that so often plague factious administrations such as this one, but that\u2019s not why Flynn is gone. He\u2019s gone because he lived down to the expectations of his critics and proved to be a liability that exceeded his value to the president.\n\n And that is the most normal thing of all for a new administration. And like every other administration this one will make more mistakes as it learns the ropes of governance. The failure of Flynn is just one of many moments in which the missed expectations of the new team will be painfully revealed.\n\n Remember, it\u2019s not just the press and the public with outsized ideas about what a new president is capable of...\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE\n\u201cDivide et impera [divide and rule] must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 7\n\nTIME OUT: WOLFGANG LEADS THE PACK\nAletia: \u201cThe artist who sold more albums than anyone in\u00a02016 had no need to promote his work with an international tour.

His name is more widely recognized\u00a0than that of any living performer.\u00a0According to a report published by Billboard, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart broke all records this year thanks to the publication of a new collection containing his entire musical work.

Although a little more than 6,000\u00a0copies of the collection have been sold, because\u00a0it consists of 200 discs the total number of sold records amounts to 1,250,000.

By a vote of 53 to 47, the Senate confirmed Mr. Mnuchin, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s top campaign fund-raiser. \u2026 The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration\u2019s tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit.

As first reported by the New York Post Page Six\u00a0on Thursday and confirmed by Fox News, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law filed in an uncontested proceeding in Manhattan Supreme Court, meaning she does not expect a legal battle over custody of their five children or assets. In a statement obtained Thursday night, the couple said: \"After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways. We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.\u201d Vanessa and Trump Jr. were married in 2005. Page Six reported earlier this week that the couple has been struggling through marital problems. The White House declined to comment to Fox News. Last month, Vanessa was taken to the hospital after receiving a letter containing white powder that was later deemed to be non-hazardous, New York City police told Fox News. The president\u2019s daughter-in-law opened the letter addressed to Donald Jr. in the couple\u2019s Manhattan apartment. It is still unclear what the white powder was. He tweeted at that time that he was \u201cthankful that Vanessa & my children are safe and unharmed after the incredibly scary situation that occurred this morning. Truly disgusting that certain individuals choose to express their opposing views with such disturbing behavior.\u201d Trump Jr. ditched his Secret Service detail for a period of time in September, reportedly because he wanted more privacy. Sources told Page Six that Vanessa is a private person. But his detail was reactivated about a week later.",

Friday's vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall, including numerous projects in GOP districts and states.",

      "content": "A Senate race between Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate and a candidate characterized as the Donald Trump of Virginia is likely to garner massive national attention, even if it isn\u2019t competitive\u2014and for now, polls indicate it isn\u2019t. President Trump\u2019s approval rating took its toll on Republicans in Virginia\u2019s 2017 state elections, while Clinton has drawn little positive attention since her 2016 loss in the presidential race. Nevertheless, both will be paramount in this contest. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton wants to come to Virginia, of course we would welcome her,\u201d Ian Sams, the campaign spokesman for Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told Fox News. \u201cRemember, she did win Virginia in 2016 by five-and-a-half points.\u201d The top Republicans vying to challenge Kaine seem ready for Hillary themselves. Corey Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, is known for battling illegal immigration and defending Confederate statues. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to tie him to her run for president, but to the things she has said since November 2016,\u201d Stewart told Fox News, referencing the recent Clinton comment on married women\u2019s inability to think for themselves if they didn\u2019t vote for her. \u201cThe Clinton campaign outspent the Trump campaign 7-1 in Virginia,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cTrump pulled his resources from Virginia to focus on more competitive states. It was probably the right call, but even after all that, Clinton-Kaine only won by 5 points.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign fired Stewart a month before election day for joining a protest in front of Republican National Committee headquarters. Stewart has name recognition after nearly winning the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2017. That could be changing after state Del. Nick Freitas delivered a viral speech on the Virginia House floor regarding the Second Amendment and Democratic rhetoric. Freitas said he\u2019s gotten an overwhelming increase in volunteers, social media followers and donors since the speech. Republican legislative leaders in Virginia, as well as U.S. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, endorsed Freitas. After a March 17 debate in Richmond between Stewart and Freitas\u2014the only two so far to gain enough signatures for ballot access before the March 29 deadline\u2014Freitas won a non-scientific straw poll of 217 tea party activist by 65 percent to 35 percent. Freitas similarly said Kaine\u2019s presence on a ticket with Clinton should be \u201ca big issue.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton has done her level best to alienate as many Americans as possible by saying they are evil, cruel and bigoted human beings if they didn\u2019t vote for her,\u201d Freitas told Fox News. \u201cSen. Kaine ran alongside her and I am tired of that divisiveness.\u201d Freitas, a veteran Green Beret and Iraq war veteran, could unite Trump voters and Chamber of Commerce voters, said Stephen Farnsworth, director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. \u201cFreitas is the one to watch. He is drawing Republican support to his campaign with the viral video appeals to conservatives, while he\u2019s also appealing to Republican insiders,\u201d Farnsworth told Fox News. The Kaine campaign contends the senator has bridged partisan divide on issues such as immigration and veterans. \u201cHis record of working together to get things done will be a focus of this campaign, regardless of who the Republicans nominate,\u201d his spokesman Sams said. Kaine once referred to the Russia probe as a \u201ctreason investigation.\u201d The June 12 primary could be wide open. The most recent scientific poll, released by Christopher Newport University in early March\u2014before the Freitas speech\u2014found Stewart with 16 percent support against just 6 percent for Freitas and 7 percent for E.W. Jackson, a conservative black pastor who was the 2013 GOP nominee for lieutenant governor. The poll found that 66 percent were still undecided, while 5 percent backed other candidates. Stewart, Jackson and Freitas all lose by a dozen points to Kaine in a hypothetical matchup. \u201cIf I were Tim Kaine, I wouldn\u2019t run as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, but as a successful former governor and a U.S. senator,\u201d Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia told Fox News. \u201cThere are few worse things he could do than bring Hillary Clinton to the state to campaign for him. It wouldn\u2019t gain any Democratic support but it would energize the Republican base.\u201d The Washington Post reported last December on an \u201canybody-but-Stewart\u201d sentiment among some state and national Republicans. \u201cThese so-called strategists that say I can\u2019t win have never won in Virginia,\u201d Stewart said, later adding, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be more controversial than the president himself.\u201d The region of commonwealth where Republicans consistently get hammered is the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia. That\u2019s a region where Stewart has repeatedly won, elected to the board of supervisors for Prince William County\u2014the state\u2019s second most populous county\u2014in 2002, and becoming its chairman in 2006. For his part, Freitas notes that he won in his district by 68 percent last year, despite the statewide wave election that saw Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam win by 9 points and massive down ticket gains for Democrats in the state legislature. Fred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal.",

Cat-ica! Cat-ica!\n\n\nBEVIN LASHES HIMSELF TO TRUMP, SINKS ANYWAY\nLexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: \u201cKentucky voters rejected Gov.\u00a0Matt Bevin\u00a0Tuesday, bucking a statewide Republican trend as they turned their backs on a politician known as much for his blustery personality as his conservative values.\u00a0Democrat\u00a0Andy Beshear, who ran a campaign as the anti-Bevin and stuck to a script of \u2018kitchen table issues\u2019 \u2014 education, pensions, health care and jobs \u2014 declared a narrow victory over the incumbent governor.\u00a0Bevin refused to concede the race.\u00a0\u2026 Beshear\u2019s apparent victory comes even as Bevin clinged tightly to President\u00a0Donald Trump, with several administration officials visiting throughout Bevin\u2019s campaign, including two visits from Trump himself. Trump\u2019s inability to lift an unpopular Bevin in a state the president won by almost 30 percentage points creates a perception the president is weak as he heads into the 2020 elections and as talk of impeachment swirls in D.C.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next? -\u00a0Louisville Courier Journal: \u201cThe first step under Kentucky law\u00a0is a recanvass of the vote, which\u00a0is\u00a0a review of the vote totals by each county clerk\u00a0\u2014\u00a0counting absentee votes and checking\u00a0printouts to make sure the numbers they\u00a0transmitted to the State Board of Elections were correct.\u00a0State law allows for a recanvassing if a county clerk or a county board of elections notices a discrepancy,\u00a0or if a candidate makes a written request to the secretary of state. \u00a0...the next possible step in the process under Kentucky law \u2014 a\u00a0formal\u00a0recount that includes a physical examination of the ballots.\u00a0There is no provision for an automatic recount under Kentucky law. A\u00a0candidate\u00a0must file a petition with the Franklin Circuit Court\u00a0by the Tuesday following the election. If petitioned, the judge would take possession of the paper ballots and voting machines\u00a0and conduct their own recount. After doing so, the judge would make the final decision on who won the race,\u00a0but that would be subject to appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals or the Kentucky Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nSuburban Trump backlash leads Virginia Dems to historic win -\u00a0NYT: \u201cIn capturing both chambers of the legislature in Virginia, Democrats have cleared the way for Gov.\u00a0Ralph S. Northam, who was nearly driven from office earlier this year, to press for measures tightening access to guns and raising the minimum wage that have been stymied by legislative Republicans. \u2026 For the first time since 1993, Democrats control both chambers in the legislature and the governor\u2019s office \u2014 allowing them to redraw the state\u2019s legislative boundaries after next year\u2019s census. Linking Republican incumbents to the unpopular president and criticizing them for opposing gun control measures in the aftermath of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Democratic challengers built their victory with strong showings in suburbs stretching from outside Washington to Richmond and Hampton Roads. In Fairfax County, the state\u2019s largest jurisdiction, the last remaining Republican lawmaker was defeated.\u201d\n\nMississippi Republicans sweep statewide, first since Reconstruction -\u00a0Jackson [Miss.] Clarion Ledger: \u201cRepublican Lt. Gov.\u00a0Tate Reeves\u00a0won the race for Mississippi governor Tuesday night, defeating Democratic Attorney General\u00a0Jim Hood. Republicans were on track Tuesday to control all statewide elected offices in Mississippi and are expected to maintain super-majority control of\u00a0the Legislature. It will be\u00a0the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans control\u00a0all statewide elected offices in Mississippi.\u00a0In incomplete and unofficial results, Reeves led Hood on Tuesday night 52% to 47%. After a race filled with attack ads, Reeves took a conciliatory tone in his victory speech in downtown Jackson. \u2018I will try to do what is right for the future of Mississippi,\u2019 Reeves said. \u2018And I mean all the people of Mississippi.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublicans routed in Pennsylvania -\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer: \u201cThe political forces that shaped last year\u2019s midterm elections showed no signs of abating Tuesday, as voters turned on Republicans and establishment Democrats alike in races from Philadelphia and Scranton to\u00a0the suburbs of Delaware and Chester Counties. \u2026\u00a0Democrats will hold\u00a0all five seats on the Delaware County Council, a Republican stronghold since the Civil War, and also assumed a majority on the legislative body in Chester County. In Bucks County, Democrats captured the Board of Commissioners for the first time since 1983. And in Philadelphia, a third-party insurgent candidate weakened an already marginalized GOP by securing one of the at-large City Council seats reserved for minority parties \u2013 a seat Republicans have held for decades.\u201d\n\nGonzales: Some lessons from Tuesday\u2019s results -\u00a0Roll Call: \u201cKentucky was not an upset. Inside Elections changed its rating on the governor\u2019s race from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid-July after finding Gov. Matt Bevin very vulnerable. So those who were surprised by Democrat Andy Beshear\u2019s declared victory weren\u2019t paying close enough attention. \u2026 Tuesday\u2019s results continued to demonstrate GOP problems in the suburbs since Trump took office. The latest was in northern Kentucky in the Cincinnati suburbs, where Bevin won in 2015 and Beshear won in 2019. Or in northern Mississippi, in the Memphis suburbs where the GOP margin in DeSoto County dropped from 61 points to 20 points... These are just the latest pieces of evidence after Democrat\u00a0Dan McCready\u2019s overperformance in the Charlotte suburbs from 2018 to the 2019 special election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District. It should be particularly concerning for President Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CHECK POINT\n\n\u201cTo what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate [when the president nominates individuals]? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 76\n\nTIME OUT: WHEN EINSTEIN BECAME EINSTEIN\nSmithsonian: \u201cWhen the year 1919 began,\u00a0Albert Einstein\u00a0was virtually unknown beyond the world of professional physicists. By year\u2019s end, however, he was a household name around the globe. November 1919 was the month that made Einstein into \u2018Einstein,\u2019 the beginning of the former patent clerk\u2019s transformation into an international celebrity. On November 6, scientists at a joint meeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical Society announced that measurements taken during a total solar eclipse earlier that year supported Einstein\u2019s bold new theory of gravity, known as general relativity. Newspapers enthusiastically picked up the story. \u2018Revolution in Science,\u2019 blared the\u00a0Times\u00a0of London; \u2018Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.\u2019 A few days later, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0weighed in with a six-tiered headline\u2014rare indeed for a science story. \u2018Lights All Askew in the Heavens,\u2019 trumpeted the main headline. \u2026 The spotlight would remain on Einstein and his seemingly impenetrable theory for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028.2 points (\u2191\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a021.4 points (\u2191\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a016.2 points (\u2191\u00a00.2 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a07.8 points (\u2191\u00a01.4 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a02.8 points (\u2193\u00a02 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nYang:\u00a02.8 points (\u2191 0.6 points from last wk.)\nKlobuchar:\u00a02.8 points (\u2191 1 point from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: NBC News/WSJ, ABC News/WaPo, Fox News, IBD and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a055.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-13.4 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193\u00a02.4 points\n\n[Average includes: Monmouth University: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 39% approve - 59% disapprove; Fox News: 42% approve - 57% disapprove; IBD: 39% approve - 56% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Hale is expected to tell lawmakers that political considerations were behind the State Department's decision to withhold U.S. military aid from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy to adjust committee ahead of hearings - WaPo: \u201cHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is planning to make a last-minute lineup change before open impeachment hearings of President Trump\u2026 Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) \u2026 is not a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which Democrats last week voted to give the sole power to conduct public hearings. According to three Republicans familiar with the talks but not authorized to comment publicly, McCarthy (R-Calif.) is considering placing Jordan on the panel, as well as others \u2014 such as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)\u2026 Matt Sparks, a McCarthy spokesman, confirmed comments that McCarthy made Tuesday to Politico indicating that he planned to \u2018make adjustments to that committee accordingly, for a short period of time\u2019 during the impeachment proceedings. Sparks said [Rep. Devin] Nunes would remain the top Republican in any scenario.\u201d\n\nMore witnesses head to the Hill -\u00a0AP: \u201cHale, who arrived Wednesday morning to testify behind closed doors, will also say that the State Department worried about the reaction from President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, also one of the strongest advocates for removing the ambassador. \u2026 Also scheduled to testify Wednesday was State Department Counselor\u00a0T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and close friend of the secretary. But Brechbuhl did not appear, instead departing with Pompeo on a trip to Germany early Wednesday morning. Two other witnesses who were scheduled for Wednesday \u2014\u00a0Russ Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and\u00a0Rick Perry, the Energy secretary \u2014 also are not expected to show up. Both have strongly criticized the probe.\u201d\n\nSenate GOP looks for ways to tar Bidens during impeachment -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cSenate Republicans are privately debating whether they should use an impeachment trial of President Trump to scrutinize former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as some Trump allies push to call them as witnesses while others dismiss the suggestion as a risky political ploy. The ongoing discussions are a revealing glimpse into the fault lines in the GOP ahead of a possible trial of Trump in the Senate, where there are varying appetites among Republicans for the type of political combat relished by the president and his most ardent defenders. Among a group of Trump\u2019s allies inside and outside Congress, there is intense and growing interest in countering the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry by delving into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China.\u201d\n\nBUTTIGIEG HEALTH PLAN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE\nNYT: \u201cMr. [Pete] Buttigieg, like others in the field, has a plan for expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured. But he also has a plan for limiting the prices that hospitals and doctors can charge to patients, even if they get their insurance from a private company. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s approach is slightly complicated\u2026 But it is a policy clearly intended to lower medical prices. \u2026 His plan would cap medical costs in an indirect way. It would allow insurers and medical providers to agree on whatever prices they wish in a contract. But it would limit how much insurers have to pay when providers are \u2018out of network.\u2019 The limit, double what Medicare pays them, would help patients who end up at a place that is not covered by their insurance. But it will also tend to influence the negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, putting downward pressure on in-network prices.\u201d\n\nGalston: \u2018Elizabeth Warren\u2019s health-care hara-kiri\u2019 -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cMs. [Elizabeth] Warren should be commended for the wealth of detail in her plan, which allows voters to judge it for themselves. This said, she may well have penned the longest suicide note in recorded history. There\u2019s no reason for the entire Democratic Party to sign it.\u201d \u00a0\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nMcConnell insists spending battle won\u2019t deter Senate from confirming judges\u00a0-\u00a0WashTimes\n\nNYC voters adopt ranked-choice voting system\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News\n\nAUDIBLE: WHAT ABOUT A SWEATER FOR A SHOTGUN?\n\n\u201cThe Trump presidency \u2014 it\u2019s like every day is Christmas. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s under the tree. It can be that shotgun you\u2019ve been hoping to get, or it can be a sweater you don\u2019t want. ... There\u2019s something under the tree. ... It makes it fun.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in an\u00a0interview with Politico.\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cWhy don't we have separate polls for both parties and another for independents? These uneven, slanted polls raise the possibility that they are predetermined to show a particular result by design. If we had 3 distinctly separate polls, we could see how strong (or weak) Trump is with registered Republicans and who the Democrats want.\u00a0 The real useful poll though would be who the independents like, which takes us back to how worthless the polls really are, and that it all boils down to who gets out to vote in November.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Weekly, Gilbert, Ariz.\n\n\n[Ed. note: Every poll we use does exactly that, Mr. Weekly. Good surveys break out the various partisan groups. But we need all three groups because: a) some voters go vote against their own party\u2019s nominees and b) voters\u2019 perceptions of themselves are apt to change over the course of time. Someone may consider themselves very independent today but by Election Day will have picked a side.]\n\n\n\u201cI have a prediction. Given: The house will proceed on full investigation for Trump impeachment. Sham or not they will use all means to channel the facts to support their coming up with their version of the articles of impeachment. They will effectively use the media to be the outlet of their opinion of the facts. So far so good. Pelosi will then \u2018decide\u2019 to formally draft the articles of impeachment but she will NOT call for a vote of the house on the articles. Her logic will be that they have all the \u2018facts\u2019 to support a vote and action by the Senate but since we are so close to the election she will leave it up to the voters to get Trump out of office because that is the democratic right way of doing it. Let the people decide. Regardless of the process used to gather the \u2018facts,\u2019 how the hearings are run, cherry picking the witnesses, determining what questions will be allowed, it will be out there for public consumption mostly one sided. No Senate trial to actually determine guilt or innocence but that won\u2019t matter as it is the court of public opinion that will determine Trumps re-electability and the deck will be stacked. Just my silly, but I believe realistic, opinion and it has nothing to do with my political leaning. I just despise the entire process.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alan Edelkind, Dublin, N.H.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I had not thought about that! Hearings but no vote! You could be on to something, Mr. Edelkind. I will explore this possibility further. It certainly would solve several problems for Democrats. I don\u2019t know whether rank and file members would allow it, but it\u2019s certainly quite an idea.]\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nCAT-ICA!

      "content": "During the 2016 campaign, candidate Donald Trump stood in front of largely white crowds and asked black voters to consider, \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" Four years later, the president has a new message for black voters: Look what I've delivered. Trump and his campaign launched a new \"Black Voices for Trump\" outreach initiative in Atlanta on Friday dedicated to \"recruiting and activating Black Americans in support of President Trump,\" according to the campaign. Much of that effort will focus on highlighting ways that African Americans have benefited from the Trump economy, according to advisers. \"The support we're getting from the African American community has been overwhelming,\" Trump told the crowd, which included supporters wearing red \"BLACK LIVES MAGA\" hats. He predicted victory in 2020, and said, \"We're going to do it with a groundswell of support from hardworking African American patriots.\" That prediction is met with skepticism from critics, however, given Trump's consistently dismal approval rating with black voters, who overwhelmingly disapprove of the job he's doing. Trump has spent much of the last four years engaged in racially charged attacks, going after minority members of Congress, claiming \"no human being\" would want to live in rat \"infested,\" majority-minority Baltimore and claiming that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the deadly Charlottesville protest against white supremacists. Shortly after landing in Georgia on Friday, Trump retweeted a call from one black supporter for submissions for a \"#MAGACHALLENGE\" competition featuring Trump-friendly rap songs. Trump said he would be announcing the winners and inviting them to the White House to meet with him and perform. \"I think black Americans are not the audience for these outreach efforts,\" said Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who is an expert in race and politics. While Trump might be able to maintain the low level of black support he received in 2016, or perhaps expand it by one or two points, he sees little evidence the president can change many minds. \"I think this is not going to move the needle at all,\" Johnson said. Before launching the new effort, Trump met with supporters at a fundraiser that was expected to raise about $3.5 million for a joint committee benefiting the Republican National Committee, the Trump campaign and the campaign of Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga. Nearby, a small group of protesters chanted, \"Lock him up!\" Scores of protesters also gathered outside the convention center where Trump was speaking, chanting, \"Impeach and remove.\" Carl Dix, of the group Refuse Fascism, said he thought the launch was aimed at trying to send a message to Trump's white supporters that he's \"not a racist. 'I've got black friends.'\" In 2016, 6% of black voters supported Trump, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of people who participated in its polls and were confirmed to have voted. There is no indication his support is growing. Polling shows that African Americans continue to be overwhelmingly negative in their assessments of the president's performance, with his approval hovering around 1 in 10 over the course of his presidency, according to Gallup. Yet Trump's campaign dismissed the numbers, insisting the campaign has seen favorable movement and arguing the president can increase his margins with black voters by bringing new people into the fold. \"The polls have never been favorable for Trump, and the only poll that matters is on Election Day,\" said senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson. The campaign has launched similar coalitions for women, Latinos and veterans. Darrell Scott, a black Ohio pastor and a longtime supporter of the president who is co-chair of the new coalition and spoke at Friday's event, said that in 2015 and 2016, supporters trying to sell Trump to black voters could only point forward to share things they anticipated from Trump. \"Now that it's 2020, we're able to point backwards and to some very definitive accomplishments that the president has done,\" Scott said. \"He delivered on promises he didn't even make.\" The campaign and White House point to a list of achievements, including passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation, which Trump signed into law last year, along with his ongoing support for opportunity zones in urban areas and new investments in historically black colleges. \"I don't know anyone who's done that kind of work outside of the president on attacking those big issues or trying to stop drugs from coming into the neighborhood and, at the same time, giving people second chances,\" said Ja'Ron Smith, deputy assistant to the president and one of the White House's few minority high-ranked officials. Advisers also point to a series of economic gains, including the fact that black unemployment hit a record low last year, with fewer blacks living in poverty. But Trump and his campaign also have a tendency to exaggerate the gains, giving Trump credit for trends that were years in the making, seizing on momentary upticks, cherry-picking favorable statistics and ignoring more troubling ones, such as black home ownership and net worth. Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said Thursday that contrary to Trump's claims, in the three years of his presidency, African Americans have lost a lot. \"He has never had support from African Americans, but what we know about the president is that he will lie and say that he has,\" said Bass, who noted that Trump rarely appears before black audiences. \"He has to identify a handful of African Americans and take them with him wherever he goes,\" she said. If he were any other Republican incumbent who inherited declining unemployment numbers and was able to sustain them, Trump would have a legitimate case to make to black voters, said Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. But \"because of some of his racial pronouncements ... I think a significant percentage of African Americans are completely turned off.\" A September AP-NORC poll found that only roughly 3 in 10 Americans say the things Trump has done as president have been good for African Americans. And just 4% of African Americans said they think Trump's actions have had a positive impact on African Americans in general, while 81% said they think they've been bad. Yet even if he can't win over black voters, some suspect that's not the point. As long as the campaign can keep on-the-fence voters from casting their ballots for the eventual Democratic nominee, the campaign will be helping Trump inch closer to a second victory. Some analysts have pointed to a precipitous drop in black turnout in 2016 as one of the reasons Trump beat his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who was far less popular \u2014 especially among black men \u2014than former President Barack Obama, the nation's first black president. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 60% of non-Hispanic blacks voted in 2016, versus about 67% in 2012. And that drop was seen in cities with significant African American populations in critical swing states that helped Trump eke out a victory. \"I do think the main objective is to discourage turnout,\" said Johnson. \"I absolutely think this is about creating doubt in black voters' minds about the Democratic nominee\" so people feel like \"there's almost no one worth voting for.\" And he said that fears were growing it might work. \"There is a pretty tangible fear among black Americans that Trump is going to win again because black turnout won't be enough to mute the white turnout,\" he said. \"There's a sense that in 2020 he's going to win again.\"",

John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2018You gotta give me a big win please,\u2019 Trump told the crowd. \u2018Please.\u2019\u201d\n\nWill black voters rally for Edwards? -\u00a0\u00a0FiveThirtyEight: \u201cWhile election forecasters like Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that\u2019s not the only thing that matters for Edwards\u2019 candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. \u2026 And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.\u201d\n\nBevin cries uncle -\u00a0Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: \u201cAn upbeat\u00a0Andy Beshear\u00a0claimed victory \u2014 again \u2014 in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov.\u00a0Matt Bevin\u00a0said he would not contest the results of the close election. \u2018The race is now officially over,\u2019 Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect\u00a0Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.\u201d\n\nNew map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina -\u00a0The [Raleigh] News & Observer: \u201cRepublicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. \u2018I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,\u2019 said Republican Rep.\u00a0David Lewis, one of the legislature\u2019s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps.\u00a0As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.\u201d\n\nTRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION\nFox News: \u201cRoger Stone\u00a0was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from\u00a0Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks\u2019 possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nTensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: \u201cTensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of \u2018gagging\u2019 the lawmaker. \u2026 The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine\u2026\u00a0 Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked \u2018turned bad.\u2019 Trump\u2019s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it \u2018witness intimidation.\u2019 Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: \u2018It's very intimidating.\u2019\u201d\n\nLegal woes mount for Giuliani -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cRudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump\u2019s presidency from a man that former national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton\u00a0has called a \u2018hand grenade.\u2019 A second official said Giuliani\u2019s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn\u2019t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.\u201d\n\nCareer White House budget official to testify -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cA longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine.\u00a0Mark Sandy\u00a0would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director\u00a0Russell T. Vought\u00a0and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY, INDEED\n\n\u201cIf those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 61\n\nTIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY\nSmithsonian: \u201cFounded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol\u2019s] primary product\u2014a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper\u2014was no longer in demand and the firm\u2019s future looked bleak.

That\u2019s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).\u201d\n\nPoll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cNorth Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one.\u00a0 The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four.\u00a0 Each race is within the poll\u2019s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean news agency calls Biden a \u2018rabid dog\u2019 -\u00a0ABC News: \u201cAfter a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied\u00a0Kim Jong Un\u00a0was a \u2018tyrant,\u2019 North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a \u2018rabid dog\u2019 and advocated that rabid dogs \u2018can hurt lots of people\u2019 and \u2018must be beaten to death with a stick.\u2019 \u2026 The ad for Biden said, in part: \u2018We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation.

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday called President Trump's use of the word \"lynching\" to describe the House impeachment investigation \"unfortunate,\" even as some Republicans have accused their Democratic colleagues of flagrant hypocrisy on the issue. In a tweet Tuesday, Trump compared the House impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine to \"a lynching,\" essentially likening the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. The president added: \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching.\" His words have brought bipartisan condemnation. McConnell, speaking to reporters, said \"that was an unfortunate choice of words.\" McConnell added: \"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching.\" But, some Republicans pointed to video showing prominent Democrats, including Reps. Gregory Meeks and Danny Davis,\u00a0calling Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings a de facto \"lynching\" in 1998. GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest also pointed to an October 2008 comment from now-Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, that was published in an Associated Press article. The quote from Nadler read: \"I am the president\u2019s defender in the sense that I haven\u2019t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense. \u2026 I wish we could get this over with quickly. \u2026 In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob.\" This time around, however, Democrats have sounded a sterner tone. \"That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\" said South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. \"That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\" Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., who is also black, called on Trump to delete his tweet. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet,\" Rush wrote. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., tweeted to Trump: \"No sir! No, @realDonaldTrump: this is NOT a lynching, and shame on you for invoking such a horrific act that was used as a weapon to terrorize and murder African Americans.\" The New York Times, in a tweet, condemned Trump for \"using a term that invokes the decades-long racist history of white mob murders of black people to describe a legal process laid out in the Constitution.\" Meanwhile, Republican legislators largely tried to put the focus on what they said was the unfair way in which Democrats are conducting the inquiry. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump's description was \"pretty well accurate.\" He called the impeachment effort a \"sham\" and a \"joke\" because the president does not know the identity of his accuser, and the process is playing out in private. \"This is a lynching in every sense,\" said Graham, who is close to Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate's only black Republican, agreed with Trump's sentiment but not his word choice. \"There's no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing (to) a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process,\" Scott said. He added, \"I wouldn't use the word lynching.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " President Trump\u00a0is beginning\u00a0his 2020 re-election effort\u00a0by trying to woo Hispanic voters with a kickoff event in the crucial swing state of\u00a0Florida. Vice President Mike Pence will visit Miami on Tuesday to roll out the \"Latinos for Trump\" campaign, a nationwide project aimed at engaging Hispanic communities. Florida\u00a0is home to more 2\u00a0million Hispanic voters and could play a key role in next year's presidential election, Politico reported. \"The strong Latino support for\u00a0President Trump\u00a0and his policies will be instrumental in re-electing the president for a second term,\"\u00a0Hannah Castillo, director of coalitions for the Trump campaign, told The Hill in a\u00a0statement. FLORIDA COUNTIES SCRAMBLING AFTER ABRUPT ORDER MANDATING BILINGUAL BALLOTS BY 2020 PRIMARY Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a Cuban American, will co-chair the outreach effort. Trump won Florida in 2016 with 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, bolstered in part by pro-Republican Cubans, according to Politico. More than two-thirds of non-Hispanic\u00a0Cubans voted for Hillary Clinton, The central part of the state has seen an increase in Puerto Ricans -- who tend to support Democrats --\u00a0who've relocated\u00a0from their traditional base in places like New York\u00a0and from the island territory in the wake of a devastating blow by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Castillo pointed to low unemployment rates and his support of\u00a0Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 over President Nicolas Maduro as reasons why Hispanics support Trump. US MILITARY TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING TO PUERTO RICO Trump's effort\u00a0could face barriers. He's\u00a0drawn criticism and scorn from many for\u00a0his previous comments and policies that largely impact Hispanics. During his 2016 campaign launch, he said Mexico was sending \"rapists\" and criminals across the border. He has referred to Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty as \"thugs\" and criminals. On Monday, he tweeted that\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would\u00a0be \"removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States\" next week. His administration has drawn criticism for its response to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. He squabbled with Puerto Rican officials and threatened to withhold aid from the island and has complained about having to do so regularly on Twitter. He's also refused to acknowledge a Harvard study that concluded the death toll from the hurricane was closer to 4,600, more than 70 times the original number reported. In an interview with Spanish-language network\u00a0Telemundo slated to air Thursday night, Trump pushed back on assertions that a sizable majority of Hispanics fear his rhetoric and promises to deport millions of people.

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He\u2019s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that\u2019s up 6 points and a new high for her.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden\u2019s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0at 5 percent,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0at 4 percent,\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke\u00a0at 3 percent, and\u00a0Cory Booker,\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0each at 2 percent.\u00a0Michael Bennet,\u00a0Julian Castro,\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard,\u00a0Tim Ryan,\u00a0Tom Steyer, and\u00a0Marianne Williamson\u00a0receive 1 percent apiece.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s firewall still strong -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201c[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary.\u00a0Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston \u2026 gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is \u2018too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.\u2019 And she doesn\u2019t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.\u201d\n\nWill any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u2019s son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u2019s work and his service as vice president. \u2026 So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. \u2026 In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u2019s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive\u2026 Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u2014 in false ways \u2014 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u2019 ire.\u201d\n\nJane Sanders takes starring role in husband\u2019s campaign -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife,\u00a0Jane Sanders. \u2026 When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u2026 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u2018especially me,\u2019 had told him to slow down. \u2026 In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u2018egotistical\u2019 to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u2018very much a close adviser.\u2019 Above all, she said, she was \u2018his wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nVoter intensity on both sides through the roof -\u00a0Gallup:\u00a0\u201cA year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given \u2018quite a lot of thought\u2019 to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.\u201d \u2013\u00a0John Jay,\u00a0Federalist No. 64\n\nTIME OUT: \u2018A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE\u2019\nParis Review:\u00a0\u201cIn the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as \u2018Sarah the African,\u2019 and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, \u2018the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,\u2019 \u2018an Ethiopian,\u2019 or \u2018a statue of Florentine bronze.\u2019 A \u2018negress\u2019 who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked\u00a0Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by\u00a0Georges Cuvier\u00a0just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer\u2019s hit posthumous opera,\u00a0L\u2019Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. \u2026 On her debut in September she was billed above M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman,\u00a0William Meyer, and even above\u00a0Mlle Ad\u00e8le, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028 points (\u2191\u00a01.2 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a026.2 points (\u2191 3.4 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a014.4 points (\u2193\u00a01.6 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a05.4 points (\u2193\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.2 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Fox News, Quinnipiac University, IBD, Monmouth University and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-10.6 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.4 points\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.\u201d\n\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign -\u00a0AP: \u201cFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch\u00a0told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was \u2018abruptly\u2019 recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a \u2018concerted campaign against me\u2019 and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. \u2018Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u2019 Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.\u201d\n\nReport: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson\u00a0in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic \u2018deal\u2019 to stop the U.S. case against\u00a0Reza Zarrab\u00a0on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson \u2014 including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.\u201d\n\nPete Session\u2019s political revival threatened by Ukraine role -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cFormer Representative\u00a0Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as \u2018Congressman-1\u2019 in the indictment of\u00a0Lev Parnas\u00a0and\u00a0Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of\u00a0Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2026 Mr. Sessions\u2019s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.\u201d\n\nContinetti: We are all Ukrainians -\u00a0Free Beacon:\u00a0\u201cFrom Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nTRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY\nYahoo:\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president,\u00a0Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard.\u00a0\u2018Trey Gowdy doesn\u2019t know s***,\u2019 she said. \u2026 \u2018He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u2018Well, if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, just talk to\u00a0Bob Mueller.\u2019\u2019 Toensing and her husband,\u00a0Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump\u2019s legal team.\u201d\n\nAnd he can\u2019t even join until January -\u00a0WashEx:\u00a0\u201cFormer Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy\u00a0cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, \u2018Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there\u2019s a problem with, he can\u2019t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.\u2019 It was only a day after\u00a0Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. \u2026\u00a0Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession,\u00a0federal law\u00a0prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.\u201d DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cHouse Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0for not holding a vote authorizing the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings \u2014 arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate.\u00a0Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump\u2019s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn\u2019t changed, describing the idea as the latest \u2018Republican canard\u2019 in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. \u2026 Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u2014 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.\u201d\n\nHouse members get an earful from voters back home -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cThe \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep.\u00a0Anthony Brindisi\u2019s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. \u2026 Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can\u2019t avoid it. \u2026 But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u2014 serving as the party\u2019s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u2019 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\u201d\n\nIndependents\u2019 support for impeachment jumps 10 points -\u00a0NPR:\u00a0\u201cA slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split \u2014 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.\u201d\n\nROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cPresident Donald Trump wants to sideline\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0\u2014 but the Utah senator isn\u2019t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 \u2014 headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen.\u00a0Susan Collins, Colorado Sen.\u00a0Cory Gardner\u00a0and Michigan Senate hopeful\u00a0John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u2019s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u2019s efforts to ostracize him.\u201d\n\nDems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cMs. [Nita]\u00a0Lowey\u2019s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including\u00a0Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman,\u00a0David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that \u2018if someone were to step down or retire,\u2019 she would \u2018have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me.\u2019 Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey\u2019s district: Her parents\u2019 house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cA prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member\u00a0Fernando Cabrera\u00a0said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a \u2018no show\u2019 in the district. \u2018Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it\u2019s going to be a moderate Democrat,\u2019 Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. \u2018She\u2019s a no-show in the district. She hasn\u2019t brought about anything except division within the party.\u2019 \u2018Socialism doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 Cabrera added.\u201d\n\nPompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race -\u00a0The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle:\u00a0\u201cA Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months \u2014 renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race.\u00a0Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep.\u00a0Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that \u2018after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.\u2019\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nIt was the foreign policy he promised, but Trump still pays price -\u00a0NYT\n\nLocations and dates for 2020 general election debates announced Friday\u00a0-\u00a0CPD Judges rule in favor of House Dems seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns\u00a0-\u00a0NYT\n\nRead this: The pen pal who changed a president\u00a0-\u00a0Narratively\n\nReese\u2019s dominates Halloween candy favorites poll-\u00a0Monmouth University\n\nAUDIBLE: YOU DO YOU\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that\u2026 And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman.

I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don\u2019t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn\u2019t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.\u201d \u2013\u00a0E\u2019Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa\n\n\n[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small \u2013 measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey\u2019s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president\u2019s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks\u2019 zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as \u2018news.\u2019\u00a0 But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question.\u00a0 That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong?\u00a0 Please explain!\u00a0 And keep up the good work!!!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand\n\n\n[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is not a thing. It\u2019s like a couple being \u201cpre-engaged.\u201d But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and \u201cimpeachment\u201d is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In\u00a0our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]\n\n\n\u201cAll my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.\n\n\n[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c\u2019mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats\u2019 pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year\u2019s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s.\u00a0Matt Carpenter\u00a0is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism,\u00a0Paul DeJong\u00a0is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal,\u00a0Kolten Wong\u00a0surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli\u2019i in his hometown and\u00a0Paul Goldschmidt\u00a0has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And\u00a0Yadi\u00a0is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow \u2018bout them Redbirds!

The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, \u2018Is this your turd? \u2018Cuz that's absurd\u2019 and \u2018This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.\u2019 The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cThe whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it\u2014that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer\u00a0(1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

That\u2019s according to conservative media star Rush Limbaugh, who made the fiery claim during an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d on Thursday night. Limbaugh opened the interview by declaring the Democratic Party is at \u201cwar\u201d with the president and his fellow Republicans, before turning his attention to Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cThe objective remains to get Donald Trump out of office, either by driving his numbers down or impeaching him or defeating him in 2020,\u201d he told Hannity.\u00a0\u201cIt is not over. It is still happening. The Democrat party and the media and all of these people from the Obama Administration that ran this scandal are still running it.\" RUSH LIMBAUGH URGES TRUMP TO TAKE SWEEPING ACTION AT END OF MUELLER PROBE Limbaugh added: \u201cThe New York Times has the story that the Mueller report is 300 pages and the Barr summary is four pages and, therefore, Barr is lying\u2026Pelosi literally said that we cannot trust the attorney general.\u201d Limbaugh continued his denunciation of Democrats, before taking a swipe at the media. \u201cThese people are believing now that there is evidence of collusion in the Mueller report and that Barr is not telling the truth,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe New York Times is leading this effort. The rest of the drive-by media is going to pick it up because it prolongs the narrative that Trump is unworthy, that Trump cheated, that we need to redo the election results of 2016.\u201d GRAHAM DERIDES DEMS 'OLIVER STONE' APPROACH TO MUELLER REPORT The conservative host then posed a question: \u201cSo we are being led to believe that this report does contain evidence of collusion. Barr is lying about it\u2026 this is so silly. If it contains evidence of collusion, then where is Mueller on television all night saying \u2018wait a minute, wait a minute. That is not what my report says. My report says there is plenty of evidence of collusion.\u201d Earlier, Limbaugh appeared on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d and called on the president to declassify everything related to the Mueller report and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\u00a0-- and that only began Limbaugh's list. \u201cYou know what I wish he would do? Declassify everything to do with FISA and everything to do with this investigation, then announcing he's closing the border and shutting down immigration until we can get a handle on it,\u201d Limbaugh told Bret Baier.\u00a0\u201cAnd then pardon everybody that has been abused by this unnecessary investigation.\u201d REP.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThere needs to be an investigation into this. There needs to be accountability for everybody who participated in this from people high up in the Obama administration all the way down and including most of the mainstream media,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cThe people of this country were told their president was a traitor. They were assured their president had colluded and stolen the election. None of it happened. And the special counsel has known there was no collusion since before the investigation began. There has never been any evidence of it.\u201d",

I understand that, and I\u2019ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That\u2019s my responsibility and I will meet it.\u201d The release of the video on Wednesday came amid allegations from numerous women that Biden had made them feel uncomfortable with what was described as inappropriate touching. Moments after Biden tweeted the video, a Washington Post story\u00a0relayed the accounts of three more women claiming improper contact, on the heels of four similar allegations. BIDEN DEFENDED BY INSIDERS, TRASHED BY OUTSIDERS, DEPENDING ON THEIR POLITICS \u201cAnyone who has ever met him (Biden) knows that he is about one of the most kind, caring people you could ever ask for,\u201d said Summers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He added, \u201cHe actually understands your issues and really wants to connect. And I think what he\u2019s realized is that we\u2019re in a place now where the way he has handled that in the past, he can\u2019t do that anymore and he has admitted that and that he\u2019s going to change his ways. I think when you contrast that with our current president, who has been caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and who has still yet to apologize even for the comments much less the actions, I think there is a very clear contrast there and I think that\u2019s refreshing to most people.\u201d",

Trump Jr.\u2019s flurry of tweets on the topic appeared to start with his response to a post from BuzzFeed News that criticized Trump supporters' position on the controversial report. The reaction: one of simple laughter, as he wrote \"haha\" over and over again. The statement from the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was released Friday evening, claiming that \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201d TRUMP ATTORNEY DISMISSES REPORT ALLEGING PRESIDENT TOLD COHEN TO LIE TO CONGRESS; DEMS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION In a story published Thursday, BuzzFeed cited two unnamed federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation on the matter who said Cohen acknowledged to Mueller\u2019s office that he was instructed by Trump in 2017 to lie to Congress about the now-abandoned real estate deal to build a Trump Tower in Russia. The report said Mueller\u2019s office first learned of the directive from interviews with witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company email, text messages and documents.

      "content": " Donald Trump Jr., in an exclusive interview Monday night with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\"\u00a0accused House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff of orchestrating a series of inaccurate leaks aiming to damage the White House, saying there is a \"99.9 percent chance he's the guy that was leaking my testimony as I was testifying\" in 2017. Trump\u00a0Jr. also compared Thursday's\u00a0discredited BuzzFeed article, which alleged that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, to\u00a0the media coverage this weekend surrounding a\u00a0widely documented encounter near the Lincoln Memorial involving\u00a0several pro-Trump\u00a0Catholic high school students, black activists shouting homophobic slurs, and a Native American man. \"You had some Catholic schoolboys that were at a right-to-life march, okay? They were wearing a MAGA hat,\" Trump\u00a0Jr. said. \"They had to pounce because the media wants that to be true. They want a bunch of nice, Catholic kids -- happen to be white -- they want them to be the enemy.\" Many liberal and conservative commentators criticized the students -- and, in some cases, called for them to be personally harassed and their school closed\u00a0-- based on initial, incomplete videos of the encounter,\u00a0 only to walk back their comments after a fuller video showed that the students themselves had been harassed, and that the students did not appear to approach the Native American man or the activists at any point. BUZZFEED REPORTER UNABLE TO EXPLAIN KEY DISCREPANCY IN POST-ARTICLE STATEMENTS; CNN ANCHOR RIPS BUZZFEED'S 'DERELICTION OF DUTY' And after the BuzzFeed article was published, some commentators\u00a0and top Democrats said it raised the possibility the president should be impeached if it were accurate. \"They need it to be true, Laura,\" Trump\u00a0Jr. added. \"They've been pushing this nonsense for two years. They've found nothing. ... If you're not sure it's true, don't push it for 14 hours straight.\" He continued: \"This isn't the first time that happened. You saw it right after I did my testimony, and they said, 'Oh, Donald Trump Jr. had the Wikileaks information,' because presumably, Adam Schiff leaked it right after my testimony to them, and conveniently took out the one before the four, turning the 14th into the 4th, meaning I had it six days before the world saw it, as opposed to four days after the entire world saw\u00a0it.\" In late 2017,\u00a0CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju reported that Trump Jr. had received early, private access to Wikileaks documents -- a story that turned out to be entirely false. Trump Jr. has previously accused Schiff, D-Calif., of leaking details about his closed-door testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. In response, a Schiff spokesman asserted\u00a0that Schiff and his staff \"do not leak classified or confidential information. ... [But] we do not permit witnesses to represent publicly that they are fully cooperating with our committee and privately refuse to answer questions pertinent to our investigation on the basis of meritless claims of privilege.\" Trump Jr.'s longstanding allegations that the media uses unreliable leaks to\u00a0treat the White House unfairly were thrust into the spotlight again this week, after BuzzFeed News\u00a0investigative reporters Anthony Cormier\u00a0and Jason Leopold\u00a0authored their bombshell, since-discredited report\u00a0on Thursday. (Schiff, on Sunday, vowed to launch a probe into the substance of the story.) The article cited two law enforcement officials who said\u00a0Michael Cohen had acknowledged to Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s office that President Trump told him to lie to\u00a0Congress about a\u00a0potential real-estate deal in Moscow, and to claim\u00a0that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trump\u2019s involvement. The article claimed that\u00a0\"internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents\"\u00a0confirmed Trump's instruction to Cohen. But Mueller issued\u00a0his first public statement in more than a year to\u00a0repudiate the BuzzFeed report just one day later,\u00a0asserting in a brief statement that the story's key elements were\u00a0\"not accurate.\" The Washington Post has since\u00a0reported\u00a0that Mueller intended his rare denial to mean that the story was\u00a0\"almost entirely incorrect,\"\u00a0and that the special counsel's office immediately\u00a0\"reviewed evidence to determine if there were any documents or witness interviews like those described, reaching out to those they thought might have a stake in the case.\u00a0They found none.\" And Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u00a0told Fox News on Monday that his team communicated with Mueller's office last week about the BuzzFeed article --\u00a0and agreed a significant portion of it was false. \"There are no texts and emails or other documents to corroborate BuzzFeed's claim for the simple reason that it is not true,\" Giuliani told Fox News. \"Whoever is responsible for this is lying.\" He added: \"We commend them for standing up for the truth,\" referring to Mueller\u2019s team. MUELLER TEAM COMMUNICATED\u00a0WITH TRUMP LAWYERS BEFORE DENYING DISCREDITED BUZZFEED REPORT,\u00a0 GIULIANI SAYS Leopold has been involved in\u00a0numerous scandals during his career\u00a0related to his\u00a0false reports, including one in 2002 for Salon.com about Enron that the outlet said was \"riddled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations,\" and another incorrect\u00a0story in 2006 for Truthout.org about supposedly pending indictments against former George W. Bush aide Karl Rove. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Cormier declined to explain why Leopold had\u00a0claimed to have seen the documents proving that Trump had ordered Cohen to\u00a0lie to Congress\u00a0-- contradicting Cormier's insistence\u00a0in a separate post-article interview on Friday that he had not personally seen the documents. \"We can't get into, like, the details there,\" Cormier, sitting next to BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, told CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" host Brian Stelter. \"We really can't go any further at all, in order not to jeopardize our sources.\" Leopold did not appear for the interview, which occasionally became tense as Stelter openly criticized BuzzFeed's journalistic practices. Smith claimed Leopold, who has been out of the public view since Friday, was busy \"reporting.\" In an interview on Friday, Cormier told CNN, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve not seen it personally,\u201d when asked if he had seen the documents mentioned in the story\u00a0that purportedly showed Trump told Cohen to lie. Cormier only claimed that the two sources he cited were \u201cfully, 100 percent read-in to that aspect of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d However, Leopold, speaking separately to MSNBC, remarked that, \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve said we haven\u2019t seen [the documents]\" and clarified, \"I\u2019ll say we\u2019ve seen documents and been briefed.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Leopold later suggested\u00a0that he meant to say that he has seen the documents, but that Cormier has not,\u00a0telling Mediaite, \"Yes.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Donald Trump, exceptionalist\u00a0-\u00a0Russian outrage over Syria strikes - It\u2019s official: Gorsuch confirmed as Justice -\u00a0\u2018Power Play\u2019 plays on -\u00a0Orgies are a young snake\u2019s game\n\n DONALD TRUMP, EXCEPTIONALIST\u00a0\nIf you wondered what American exceptionalism looks like, the 59,000 pounds of U.S. warheads raining down on Syria\u2019s air force is a pretty good snapshot.\n\n America, the apex power of the world, does not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. We forbid it. Another country used chemical weapons \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 in its civil war, so the United States punished that nation by depleting its military.\n\n There are other countries in the world with the capability to deliver that kind of firepower and spend something approaching $100 million to send a message about the rules of war. But only the United States has the wherewithal to do so without even breaking a sweat.\n\n And, we dare say, that no other country in the world combines such capabilities with our moral authority.\u00a0 As much maligned, sometimes rightly, as America\u2019s overseas interventions have been, no great power in history can match our track record of the use of force without conquest.\u00a0\n\n Members of Congress, Democratic and Republican, want\u00a0President Trump\u00a0to get congressional authorization if he intends to keep up the strikes or undertake, ahem, a forward strategy of freedom\u00a0to remove Syrian dictator\u00a0Bashar al-Assad\u00a0from power and install a Western-style liberal democracy in his place.\n\n But as for the legality of this attack, there\u2019s not much to debate. As when the British Empire unilaterally decided in 1807 to use its navy to stop the slave trade, powerful nations have special privileges when confronting moral odium. Right and might together are hard to beat.\n\n And that is what the traditional understanding of American Exceptionalism has been, not the more recent vintage\u00a0that held that it was a little different from patriotism. Exceptionalism does not here refer to the qualities of the nation, but rather that there are exceptions to the rules for this nation because of its qualities.\u00a0\n\n America can have nuclear weapons but says that others can\u2019t. America can sail its navy when and where it pleases, but forbid others so to do. And so on\u2026 It is not fair, but for more than a century, and in some ways since our founding, it is a right which America has claimed and defended as a privilege merited by our virtue.\n\n Now, you may or may not like that role for our country. You may, as Trump held during his campaign, believe that America is a sap and a sucker that spends money and sheds blood overseas without anything in return, allowing other countries to take advantage of us.\n\n Or you may believe,\u00a0as Trump did\u00a0when his predecessor,\u00a0Barack Obama, contemplated a similar action punishing for atrocities committed four years ago, that such interventions threaten U.S. national security and divert needed resources from rebuilding the United States.\u00a0\n\n And given the ways in which America has failed in the exercise of its power over the decades, these are far from unsupported arguments. In fact, what is happening in Syria today can properly be said to substantially descend from a confused and confusing application of American power.\n\n And here we get to the questions with which human beings always struggle the most.\u00a0\n\n We arrange our thinking and pursuits very much around questions relating to the word \u201ccan.\u201d Those are simpler since they relate more to the other understanding of being exceptional -- can we do it? The hard ones are about \u201cshould.\u201d The application of American power, exceptional or not, should always be governed more by the latter than the former.\n\n But as for the question of what America\u2019s rightful role in the world is, Trump, after many years arguing the opposite, has placed himself firmly on the side of the exceptionalists.\u00a0\n \u00a0\nRUSSIAN OUTRAGE OVER SYRIA STRIKES\nAP:\u00a0\u201cWorld leaders rallied around the United States after it launched a missile strike early Friday on a Syrian air base in response to this week's chemical attack, while Russia condemned the move as \u2018aggression\u2019 and suspended crucial coordination with Washington in Syria's congested skies. The overnight missile attack, which marked the first time the U.S. has directly targeted Syrian President\u00a0Bashar Assad's forces, was condemned by his allies in Russia and Iran but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and its supporters, who expressed hope it signaled a turning point in the devastating six-year-old civil war. The bombing represents Trump's most dramatic military order since taking office and thrusts the U.S. administration deeper into the complex Syrian conflict. The Obama administration threatened to attack Assad's forces after previous chemical attacks, but never followed through.\u201d\n\nBut claim they wouldn\u2019t have been harmed -\u00a0Miami Herald:\u00a0\u201cThe Russian military says its facilities in Syria are reliably protected by cutting edge air defense weapons \u2026 Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen.\u00a0Igor Konashenkov\u00a0said Friday that the S-400 and Pantsyr air defense systems offer a \u2018guaranteed protection\u2019 to Russian warplanes stationed at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's province of Latakia. He added that a Russian navy outpost in Syria's Mediterranean port of Tartus is protected by S-300 air defense systems. Konashenkov has previously said that the Russian military would help the Syrian military beef up its air defenses following the U.S. strike.\n\n And Iran isn\u2019t happy either -\u00a0LA Times:\u00a0\u201cIran on Friday condemned the Trump administration\u2019s missile strikes against Syria, saying the unilateral U.S. action would strengthen terrorists and \u2018further complicate the situation\u2019 in the Middle East. The Islamic republic, a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, said that while it condemned the use of chemical weapons, the U.S. response was \u2018dangerous, destructive and a violation of international law.\u2019 Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman\u00a0Bahram Ghassemi\u00a0rejected the conclusion that Assad\u2019s forces had carried out the poison attack on Tuesday that killed more than 70 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in rebel-held Idlib province.\u201d\n\nSOME MEMBERS OF GOP ARE NOT ON BOARD\nThe Hill: \u201cSen.\u00a0Rand Paul\u00a0(R-Ky.) said Thursday night that President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action in Syria after Trump ordered an airstrike in retaliation for a deadly chemical attack earlier this week. \u2018While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked,\u2019 Paul said in a statement shortly after reports that the U.S. had launched more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles against an airfield in Syria. \u2018The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,\u2019 Paul said.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: ONE COURT TO RULE THEM ALL\u00a0\n\u201cTo avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 22 TIME OUT: HAIL, LEXINGTON!\u00a0\nHistory:\u00a0\u201cOn this day in 1776, Navy Captain\u00a0John Barry, commander of the American warship Lexington, makes the first American naval capture of a British vessel when he takes command of the British warship HMS Edward off the coast of Virginia. The capture of the Edward and its cargo turned Captain Barry into a national hero and boosted the morale of the Continental forces. Barry was born in the seaboard county of Wexford, Ireland, in 1745 and offered his services to the Continental Congress upon the outbreak of the American Revolution. Congress purchased Barry\u2019s ship, Black Prince, which it renamed Alfred and placed under the command of Commodore\u00a0Esek Hopkins. It was the first ship to fly the American flag, raised by\u00a0John Paul Jones.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions. IT\u2019S OFFICIAL: GORSUCH CONFIRMED AS JUSTICE\nAP:\u00a0\u201cThe Senate confirmed\u00a0Neil Gorsuch\u00a0to become the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court Friday, elevating\u00a0Donald Trump's nominee following a corrosive partisan confrontation that could have lasting impacts for the Senate and the court. Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0was presiding as the Senate voted 54-45 in favor of Gorsuch, a 49-year-old veteran of the 10th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Denver whose rulings make him an intellectual heir to the late Justice\u00a0Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill. Gorsuch won support from 51 of the chambers' Republicans as well as three moderate Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won last fall:\u00a0Joe Manchin\u00a0of West Virginia,\u00a0Heidi Heitkampof North Dakota and\u00a0Joe Donnelly\u00a0of Indiana. GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia did not vote.\u201d TRUMP SON-IN-LAW DIDN\u2019T DISCLOSE RUSSIA MEETINGS\u00a0\nNYT: \u201cWhen\u00a0Jared Kushner,\u00a0President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, sought the top-secret security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years. But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador,\u00a0Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak\u2019s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F.B.I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates.\u201d\n\n Tell us how you really feel, Steve Bannon -\u00a0The Daily Beast:\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist\u00a0Stephen Bannon\u00a0has called the president\u2019s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner a \u2018cuck\u2019 and a \u2018globalist\u2019 during a time of high tension between the two top aides, several Trump administration officials told The Daily Beast. The fighting between Kushner and Bannon has been \u2018nonstop\u2019 in recent weeks, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It\u2019s been an \u2018open secret\u2019 that Bannon and Kushner often clash \u2018face-to-face,\u2019 according to senior officials.\u201d\n\n\u2018POWER PLAY\u2019 PLAYS ON\nAnother week, another round of \u201cPower Play with\u00a0Chris Stirewalt.\u201d We liked our addition of the weekly news quiz so much we did it again.

The authors posited that the Founding Fathers were familiar with what Cato's actions led to (the First Triumvirate) and the Feds had no desire for the minority to lead the majority around by the nose. Bipartisan actions are preferable to one-party rule and I hold out hope that senators will seek to serve country rather than party, but what's America without hope? France? The filibuster is not in the U.S. Constitution and deserves the boot. And the absence of the filibuster gives the New York Times one less opportunity to be hypocritical -- sweet!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Michael Friend, Atlanta, Ga.\u00a0\n\n[Ed. note: You are quite right, Mr. Friend. There is nothing magical about vote thresholds in the U.S. Senate. But I would argue that the increased thresholds have been a good check on the factionalism intensified by direct election over the past century. I do believe the Senate will endure, and may even thrive in this new era. But I still cannot help thinking that the loss of comity, though perhaps unavoidable, will come at some greater cost, especially for the court. A bad idea is not made good by virtue of bipartisan support. It is possible for both parties to be wrong at the same time. What pains me to see, however, is that with the rise of mobocracy, there is so little room for leadership.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cAny chance you could describe the difference between partisan and \u2018rank partisan\u2019? Possibly you might look to see if there is a correlation between the rise of the demos replacing the republic and the loss of the \u2018most free\u2019 nation on earth to out of the top 10.\u201d \u2013\u00a0George Chapogas, Rivas, Nicaragua\u00a0\n\n[Ed. note: I think you\u2019re on to something, Mr. Chapogas! At the risk of sounding sanctimonious, I will say that the difference between a partisan and a rank partisan is ordinal in nature. Partisanship is fine if it still leaves room for putting your country first.]\n\n \u201cI think you are trying to prove we live in a multiverse. My version of the universe has the last three Democrat Supreme Court nominees getting approved, mostly along philosophical lines, without a talk-a-thon or filibuster. In your version of the universe it\u2019s OK for the Democrats to act like 2 year old, crying because they didn't get their way, because their nominee for the Supreme Court wasn't considered? The lack of getting their nominee considered was\u00a0 exactly because they laid out a set of rules about 40 years ago and then amplified by their ex VP, that said that no Supreme Court nominee from the opposing party would be consider in the last year of their President's term..... Is there a remote possibility that we could bring these two universes back to one, where we can all conduct our conversation based on one set of data, not multiple sets?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Paul Hill, New Bern, N.C.\n\n[Ed. note: There\u2019s no debate that Democrats had it coming on the nuclear option. But whatever universe you live in, it sometimes proves helpful to consider things from a view outside of tu quoque arguments. I don\u2019t blame Republicans for taking the step that they did, but I still lament the deterioration of republican ideals.]\n\nShare your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n ORGIES ARE A YOUNG SNAKE\u2019S GAME\nNat Geo:\u00a0\u201cRight now in Manitoba, Canada, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes are emerging from their winter dens to mate in massive, roiling throngs. While this bizarre reproductive strategy seems like it might be dangerous for the females, who may have upwards of one hundred males trying to mate with each of them at once, a new study published this week in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B finds that it\u2019s the males who suffer most in the long-term. \u2018Our results suggest that the male snakes may face a cost of such intense reproductive investment in the form of shortened telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes,\u2019 says\u00a0Emily Uhrig, a behavioral ecologist who coauthored the study while completing a PhD at Oregon State University.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n \u201cI'm just saying that when a superpower changes its policy radically because a president is moved by pictures, you've got to wonder about the stability of the foreign policy.\u201d \u2013Charles\u00a0Krauthammer\u00a0on \u201cSpecial Report with\u00a0Bret\u00a0Baier.\u201d Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., after reports appeared to vindicate the younger Trump of Democratic suspicions that he made phone calls to President Trump around the time of the Trump Tower meeting with Russians in June 2016. Senate investigators obtained phone records which appeared to show that Trump Jr. had actually spoken to two longtime Trump family friends \u2013 Brian France, the chief executive of Nascar, and the investor Howard Lorber, the New York Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter. TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW Trump Jr. responded to the reports on Twitter, knocking Schiff. \u201cHas anyone heard from Adam Schiff?\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s busy leaking other confidential info from the House Intelligence Committee to change the subject?!?\u201d Democrats have long suspected the calls were between Trump Jr. and his then-candidate father\u00a0regarding a meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.

The findings marked an\u00a0important development for Trump allies who've seen a challenging week that culminated with the arrest of longtime ally Roger Stone.

      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " No matter when John McCain left this earth, he would have been praised to the skies by the journalists who admired him enormously, even though they liked him far better when he was taking on his own party. But because he died in the Trump era, there is in many of the media tributes an implicit or explicit contrast being drawn with the president who most of these same journalists decidedly do not admire. And President Trump has fueled that story line by balking at saying anything positive about the 81-year-old senator after his death on Saturday\u2014even, according to The Washington Post, nixing a plan by John Kelly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other staffers to have the White House put out a statement praising McCain as a hero. And in final words read by his former campaign chief Rick Davis, McCain appeared to take a subtle shot by saying we shouldn't confuse patriotism with \"tribal rivalries\" and \"weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down.\" Trump, after a fierce backlash, again lowered the White House flag to half-staff yesterday with a statement that \"despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country.\" I'll leave it to readers and viewers to decide which of these two tough-talking adversaries they prefer. But there is simply no question that in giving the onetime Vietnam POW a hero's sendoff, many journalists and commentators are delivering an implicit rebuke of Trump. It's a case study in the disparity between the way the media treat politicians they like, personally and ideologically, and those they dislike. McCain, who once jokingly called the press \"my base,\" provided enormous access and was the most frequent Sunday show guest ever. Trump says 80 percent of the media is fake news and frequently attacks journalists and their outlets, though he does provide more access than is commonly realized because he doesn't hold formal press conferences. None of that should matter when it comes to coverage, but it does. Post columnist David Ignatius, while acknowledging the late senator\u2019s flaws, begins a piece this way: \"John McCain's death offers a moment to think about the insurgency in the GOP that vexed him during his final decade as a politician, and that produced in Donald Trump a man he seemed to loathe, but couldn't figure out how to stop.\" Ignatius, a \"Morning Joe\" fixture, goes on to say he believes McCain was among those who could never imagine that enough Americans \"would actually vote for someone of such low moral character. McCain's refusal to temporize about Trump, as other Republicans have, was one of his finest moments.\" So it becomes a litmus test: If, like McCain, you are a person of moral character, then you must stand up to Trump. New York Times columnist David Leonhardt warily embraces \"McCainism,\" but first feels obliged to tell readers about the conservative lawmaker\u2019s bad side: \"I'm well aware that McCain could be maddeningly inconsistent and flawed. He equivocated about the Confederate flag in 2000. He too often acquiesced to Mitch McConnell's torching of Senate norms. For goodness sake, McCain decided Sarah Palin should be vice president. As he himself admitted, he should have done much more to fight Republican extremism.\" And yet, the piece says, \"the sum total of his career still represents a meaningful alternative to Trump, McConnell and the rest of today's Republican leadership.\" And so, like so much else in today's society, everyone must be judged by where he or she stands on Trump or his policies. The acrimony between the two men makes that an easier story line, but it's not the only story line. John McCain was shot down over Hanoi in 1967. He was first elected to Congress in 1982. He had an entire career, an entire life, before Trump took office last year. To judge this wounded warrior through the lens of Trumpism is unfair, and suggests to me that too many in the media feel compelled to make everything about this president.",

      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " The Huffington Post headline was designed to get its anti-Trump readers to click. \"Kellyanne Conway: Trump\u2019s Anti-Media Attacks \u2018Are Not Healthy.'\" What? Was she saying this publicly? Was even the president's counselor off the reservation? But it turned out to be a blatant distortion. Here's what Conway actually said, when asked by Christiane Amanpour on her new PBS show whether \"the president might take a stance of his own to pull back from this,\" meaning attacks on the media. \"I do agree that it's not healthy for the body politic on either side,\" Kellyanne said. She said that she and others \"have tried, the president has tried, to turn down the temperature, to give more access.\" So Conway's it's-unfortunate-both-sides-do-it-but-we've-tried-to-fix-it sentiment got twisted into her criticizing her boss. And what the short piece didn't mention was that she also said this: \"We see things every single day on TV and in print that I promise you, I swear to God, are patently false.\" This is why people don't trust the press. And yes, the obvious rejoinder to that the White House sometimes struggles with the truth. On Monday, economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the president was wrong when he tweeted that \"the GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\" It's actually 10 years. (But those figures do show a booming economy.) Still, pointing to presidential misstatements and distortions doesn't let the press off the hook when it comes to accuracy and fairness. A new study out yesterday from the Knight Foundation and Gallup shows that most Americans are losing faith in the media, and their reasons largely center on matters of accuracy or bias. A stunning 69 percent of adults say they have lost trust in the media over the past decade, a figure that rises to 94 percent for Republicans. Among Democrats, 42 percent have lost trust, and the number is 75 percent for independents. Those of us in the news business have company. Social media, run by the tech giants, were once seen as a liberating and democratic force. Now there are deep suspicions of Big Tech, and its increasingly maligned leaders have lost their heroic glow. Here, too, self-inflicted wounds play a major role. These outfits were slow to police their sites, combat Russian propaganda, address the scourge of bullying and fabrication and\u2014in an echo of the MSM\u2019s plight\u2014are regularly assailed for discriminating against the right. As NYT columnist Nathaniel Popper puts it: \"Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.\" Now Facebook, Twitter, Google and the like resemble a machine that its makers can no longer control, even if they are willing to spend the vast sums that would require. All these doubts seem weaponized in the age of Trump, given that much of the country distrusts the president and a sizable chunk of the country admires the president while distrusting his adversaries. This constant warfare, which Kellyanne alluded to, leads to sinking confidence in both sides, as the White House and the press routinely trade charges of lying and bias. It\u2019s as though airlines were constantly running ads accusing the others of being unsafe. \n Things have reached the point where not only do many people believe the New York Times shouldn't have published the op-ed by the unnamed senior official, but some accuse the paper of outright deception by saying the author actually works there. That is of a piece with Bob Woodward describing a dysfunctional administration and the president accusing the veteran journalist of writing fiction and making up sources. Maybe, in another time and place, the media and other institutions can regain some of the trust they have lost. Some people in the Knight study, at least, say they're open to that. But it doesn't seem to be on the horizon any time soon.",

Steve Doocy flagged a clip from a September\u00a02007 presidential debate, when then-candidate Biden was asked if he would allow cities\u00a0to ignore federal\u00a0law. Biden answered that so-called sanctuary\u00a0cities ignore federal immigration\u00a0law because they lack the funding to carry out enforcement. \"Part of the problem is you have to have a federal government that can enforce laws,\" he said, calling out the George W.

In a 2006 video that resurfaced last week, Biden is seen\u00a0advocating\u00a0for a southern border wall and punishment for employers who hired\u00a0illegal immigrants.

The things he did are obviously criminal and he\u2019s admitted them,\u201d Hume said. He added: \u201cI think in the end it may have turned out he didn\u2019t do anything with regards to collusion with Russia and perhaps Mr. Trump didn\u2019t either.\u201d",

      "content": " Ask Mark Sanford if any Republican can knock off President Trump in the Republican primaries and he\u2019ll give you an honest answer. \u201cI always like to be real, and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to beat Donald Trump. That\u2019s my personal opinion,\u201d the former South Carolina governor and congressman said in an interview Monday with Fox News. VOCAL TRUMP CRITIC MARK SANFORD MULLS PRIMARY BID AGAINST PRESIDENT But Sanford, who last week announced he was taking 30 days to decide whether to launch a primary challenge against the president, said that if he runs, it\u2019s not about ousting the president. At least not completely. \u201cI think it\u2019s about trying to force a larger national debate and a debate within Republican circles,\u201d he said. That debate, for Sanford, centers on the national debt, which now stands at over $22 trillion. Sanford warned that we\u2019re \u201cwalking our way towards the most predictable financial crisis in history of our country if we don\u2019t do something about the government spending issue. It is profound.\u201d And the longtime deficit hawk predicted that \u201cwe\u2019re setting ourselves up for a real fall that will hurt our retirement accounts, our savings accounts, our jobs and our way of life.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Sanford\u2019s mission, if he launches a primary bid, is to take the GOP back to fiscal issues,\u00a0targeting the national debt and spiraling government spending. \u201cThe idea of financial sanity, the idea of financial prudence, was a linchpin to the conservative movement and by extension the Republican Party, \u201c he said. \u201cThat has been lost of late.\u201d And he noted \u201cI was just dumbstruck to hear Rush Limbaugh\u2019s comments over the weekend that deficits don\u2019t matter. It is something that we have to get back to.\u201d Asked what his deciding factors will be in launching a primary challenge, Sanford listed viability. \u201cThe energy, resources, and the people who come my direction versus not, will tell me a lot as to how viable such a run will be. And by viable, I don\u2019t mean necessarily beating the president, but I mean viable in terms of getting a voice and message out there that I think needs to be heard,\u201d he said. And he argued that \u201cwe need to have a conversation as Republicans about what we\u2019re about.\u201d In a party dominated by Trump, such ideas aren\u2019t welcome words, especially in his home state. After Sanford announced he was mulling a primary challenge, South Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick responded \u201cthe last time Mark Sanford had an idea this dumb, it killed his Governorship\u2026.This makes about as much sense as that trip up the Appalachian Trail.\u201d The \u2018Appalachian Trail\u2019 is a reference to Sanford\u2019s original excuse of where he was during a week-long disappearance in June\u00a02009. It was later revealed that Sanford was out of the country, having an affair with an Argentinian woman. The episode ended his marriage and derailed the political career of the popular two-term governor who was considered an early leading contender for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. But politics is full of second chances and the former governor won back his old congressional seat in a 2013 special election. He won re-election in 2014 and 2016. But Sanford, a vocal Trump critic, was targeted by the president in his 2018 re-election and lost a primary challenge to a pro-Trump candidate. LAST YEAR SANFORD ACKNOWLEDGED HIS POLITICAL CAREER WAS LIKELY OVER Asked if his possible primary challenge against the president is revenge for his 2018 loss, Sanford quickly answered: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Sanford noted that he was concerned with the \u201csend her back\u201d chants at a Trump rally in North Carolina last week that were directed at Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whom the president days earlier on Twitter had urged to go back to her native country, fix things and\u00a0return to \"show us how it's done.\"\u00a0Democrats and even some Republicans have called the tweets racist. After condemning the chants in the wake of the ensuing criticism, Trump later called the crowd \u201cpatriotic\u201d and resumed his attacks on Omar and three other liberal\u00a0freshman congresswomen known as \u2018the squad.\u2019 Sanford said the chant is \u201ca long way from what we all learn about when we go to church Sunday, which is \u2018we\u2019re to love God with all our heart, soul and mind, we\u2019re to love our neighbors as ourselves.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s at odds with what the good book says on that front,\u201d he added. Sanford said\u00a0it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll visit Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar \u2013 during his 30-day listening tour. And he noted that he\u2019s been in contact with conservative Bill Kristol, a leader of the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement. If he runs, Sanford would join former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld in primary-challenging the president. Sanford praised Weld, saying \u201cI admire his courage. I admire that he was willing to step out on the ice first while nobody else was even thinking about it.\u201d Weld, campaigning in New Hampshire on Monday, told Fox News that Sanford \u201ccould be a real factor in the southern states, either in the primary or running as a favorite son in the general election. I think he could certainly deny Mr. Trump enough votes in those states so that Mr. Trump will have a hard time winning those states.\u201d He welcomed a possible Sanford campaign, emphasizing that \u201cthe more people who come in, it makes it seem more like a real primary, harder for the president to duck debates.\u201d",

      "content": "  Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0stood by his prior testimony as he returned Wednesday to Capitol Hill for an interview behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee, following a subpoena from the committee's Republican chairman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. The president's son was called to field questions related to the committee's Russia investigation, and possibly clear up some confusion surrounding his original statements. Queries were expected to\u00a0address issues including Trump Jr.'s knowledge of negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow before the 2016 election. During an earlier 2017 interview on Capitol Hill, Trump said he had only been \"peripherally aware\" of the possible deal. But President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who is currently serving a prison sentence for offenses including lying to Congress, said he spoke to Trump Jr. about the deal multiple times. TRUMP JR. BLASTS OMAR, TLAIB ON TWITTER AS LEADERS OF 'THE HAMAS CAUCUS' When asked Wednesday morning if he was going to correct any of his past testimony, Trump Jr. said there was \"nothing to correct.\" He reiterated this upon completing the interview, saying:\u00a0\"In reality, there was nothing to change. If there needed to be clarification because [of] Michael Cohen, who let's not forget is serving time right now for lying to these very investigative bodies, I'm happy to do that.\" Trump Jr. went on to say he is happy to be done with the matter. \"I'm glad that this is finally over,\" he said. \"We're able to put some final clarity on that, and I think the committee understands that.\" When asked if he was concerned about the risk of perjury, Trump Jr. said, \"Not at all.\" A source familiar with the testimony told Fox News that the interview lasted less than three hours. All of the questions were asked by staff members. Much of the interview focused on\u00a0statements about Trump Jr. that had been made by Cohen and former Trump campaign member Rick Gates. Among these were alleged details surrounding the June\u00a09, 2016 Trump Tower meeting that Trump Jr. set up between a Russian attorney and senior Trump campaign members. Cohen claimed that Trump Jr. had told then-candidate Trump about the meeting beforehand. Gates claimed that Trump Jr. mentioned it at a campaign meeting, saying that he would be getting dirt on Hillary Clinton on that same date from a group in Kyrgyzstan. Trump Jr. denied these claims. Fox News also has learned that Trump Jr. was asked about Roger Stone, Wikileaks\u00a0and Paul Manafort. DONALD TRUMP JR. BASHES MICHAEL COHEN'S MOTIVES DURING HOUSE TESTIMONY Wednesday's closed-door hearing came\u00a0after Trump Jr. already testified for more than 20 hours and provided thousands of documents to Congress. Last month, President Trump supported his son, questioning the need for\u00a0additional testimony. \"I don't know why. I have no idea why. But it seems very unfair to me,\" the president said. Some Republicans even said Trump Jr. should not have complied\u00a0with the subpoena, which is believed to be the first subpoena targeting a member of the president's family. Burr's home state colleague, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted, \"It's time to move on & start focusing on issues that matter to Americans.\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a GOP member of the panel, said he understood Trump Jr.'s frustration. Cornyn's Texas colleague, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said there was \"no need\" for the subpoena.

BIDEN PREDICTS 2020 VICTORY ACROSS THE SOUTH WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T WON IN DECADES The article went on to discuss some of the questionable claims Trump has made throughout his presidency, including his assertion that he lost the popular vote was because of illegal voters, his claim in 2018 that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat, and his quip that windmills cause cancer. It also cited a Washington Post database which claims to have\u00a0tracked Trump's statements over the last few years and claims the president has made more than 10,000 false or misleading statements. \"Trump\u2019s successful assault on truth is the great casualty of this presidency, followed closely by his war on decency,\" the Sentinel\u00a0piece continued. In 2016, the publication endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, but said this year that if a Republican candidate like Mitt Romney or John Kasich were to emerge, they would \"eagerly give them a look.\" TRUMP LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN MACHINE WITH MASSIVE WAR CHEST, DESPITE POLLING LAG Trump has waged a long battle against the media throughout the duration of his first campaign and presidency and frequently slams mainstream news outlets such as\u00a0CNN and the New York Times.

He is sounding like the health care industry in that regard.\u201d BERNIE SANDERS: AMERICANS 'WILL BE DELIGHTED TO PAY MORE IN TAXES' FOR FREE HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION Sanders' slam came after Biden pushed for a modified version of the Affordable Care Act\u00a0which he and former President Obama championed, rather than\u00a0embracing \"Medicare-for-all,\". \u201cI understand the appeal to \u2018Medicare-for-all,\u201d Biden previously said. \u201cBut folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of ObamaCare. And I\u2019m not for that. I was very proud the day I stood there with Barack Obama and he signed that legislation.\u201d Sanders' criticism highlighted how the progressive push for health care expansion has divided the Democratic field. Sanders' campaign has specifically called out Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper for their take on policies like \"Medicare-for-all.\" Jeff Weaver, a Sanders campaign adviser, suggested on Wednesday that Harris was unrealistic in her reluctance to raise taxes to pay for a \"Medicare for all\" program under her would-be administration. BIDEN PROPOSES BIG CHANGE TO OBAMACARE, IN BID TO SAVE IT FROM 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' CROWD \u201cWithout unicorns, magic wands, health care is not free. There\u2019s doctors, nurses that have to be paid. There\u2019s hospitals. You have to pay for it,\u201d Weaver told MSNBC. Weaver's remarks also\u00a0came on the same day that the Vermont senator gave a speech defending his\u00a0health care proposal. That paired well with a speech he gave on democratic socialism in June after another 2020 hopeful, former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., was booed for opposing the program while speaking at California Democrats' annual convention. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weaver's comments echoed a criticism Sanders' campaign issued after Hickenlooper held a press conference\u00a0criticizing\u00a0democratic socialism. Tweeting an old video of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Sanders seemed to suggest that Hickenlooper was unrealistic to expect solutions to major issues without accepting high government spending. Sanders has said he would likely raise both payroll and income taxes to pay for his health care proposal.",

      "content": " President Trump has ensured\u00a0some awkward dinner-table conversations at the Conway household, taking direct aim Tuesday at adviser\u00a0Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband. \u201cA total loser!\u201d Trump tweeted, in response to a post from campaign manager Brad Parscale about George Conway -- who despite his wife's senior role in the administration has emerged as an outspoken Trump critic. \u201cWe all know that @realDonaldTrump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn\u2019t want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn\u2019t even know him!\u201d Parscale had tweeted Monday night. KELLYANNE CONWAY'S HUSBAND RIPS TRUMP FOR 'PATHOLOGICAL' LYING, CLAIMS PRESIDENT HAS 'DISORDER' Conway himself responded shortly afterward, tweeting: \u201cCongratulations! \u00a0You just guaranteed that millions of more people are going to learn about narcissistic personality disorder and malignant narcissism! \u00a0Great job!\u201d The fiery tweets came after George Conway, who has frequently criticized Trump, questioned the president's mental health. Conway elaborated early Monday, saying that Trump\u2019s barrage of tweets over the weekend \u2013 including critiques of the late Sen. John McCain and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2013 were a \u201cproduct of his pathologies\u201d rather than a \u201crational plan or strategy.\u201d He then retweeted a post from \"Duty To Warn,\" which tried to demonstrate that Trump's activities matched the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. GEORGE CONWAY RAMPS UP TRUMP ATTACKS AS KELLYANNE DEFENDS BOSS It was the latest salvo from George Conway, who last week posted a thread that began when he called out Trump for claiming that Judge Amy Berman Jackson's sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort earlier in the day had exonerated the president from the Russian collusion narrative. \u201cHave we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life?\" Conway asked in a tweet. \"One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But instead he lies about it. He denies what the world can see on videotape. Even his donors and supporters wonder, what is wrong with him? Why would he feel compelled to tell such an absurd lie?\u201d The president\u2019s camp has largely avoided responding to George Conway until now, with Eric Trump one of the few to fire back. \"Of all the ugliness in politics, the utter disrespect George Conway shows toward his wife, her career, place of work, and everything she has fought SO hard to achieve, might top them all,\" Eric Trump wrote in December.

      "content": " Sen. Kamala Harris has a long record of political stances from her prosecutor days that don\u2019t quite square with her current national profile as a liberal champion \u2014 but one of the most awkward items from her past may be her acceptance of a $5,000 donation from Donald Trump nearly a decade ago. Now, court records reviewed by Fox News have provided additional details about the circumstances surrounding the contribution from the man she wants to unseat in 2020 and whose policies she now calls \"vile.\" KAMALA HARRIS TURNS TRUMP'S TWEETS AROUND, TELLS HIM TO 'GO BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM' According to sworn affidavits signed by Trump and his daughter Ivanka,\u00a0disgraced former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was behind the hefty contribution to Harris\u2019 re-election campaign for California attorney general. The affidavit was part of an ethics complaint against Schneiderman filed on Dec. 2, 2013, by Trump, who claimed the top prosecutor\u00a0had given him the impression that his investigation into Trump University was over when it was not. Trump argued in his sworn statement that given Schneiderman\u2019s \u201cpersistent, unsolicited and unqualified reassurances that the investigation would never eventuate in a lawsuit, and my sincere belief that there was no wrongdoing on the part of [Trump University], I did not perceive any issue with trying to assist Mr. Schneiderman whenever I or other Trump Org. executives were able.\u201d He described one such case: the donation for Harris\u00a0that a Schneiderman\u00a0aide purportedly solicited and Ivanka helped arrange. \u201cMr. Schneiderman\u2019s former transition committee leader asked my daughter Ivanka if\u00a0she would arrange for me to make a contribution to a fundraising event sponsored by Mr. Schneiderman for newly elected California Attorney General Kamala Harris,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIn response, I made a $5,000 contribution to Ms. Harris\u2019 campaign\u2014the highest level of sponsorship listed in the invitation\u2014and Ivanka attended the event together with some of Trump Org.\u2019s other top executives.\u201d The 2011 donation is one of several Trump made to now-Democratic candidates for president that could cause lingering headaches for their campaigns -- especially considering Trump likes to remind voters of the past financial help and favors he offered to figures who now fiercely criticize him. Trump\u00a0donated to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand twice -- $1,050\u00a0in December\u00a02007 and $2,400 in September\u00a02010. And Trump donated $1,000 to then-Sen. Joe Biden in December\u00a02001. But the Trumps donated to Harris' attorney general re-election campaign three times. Aside from the $5,000 donation in 2011, Trump donated $1,000 on Feb. 20, 2013,\u00a0and Ivanka Trump donated $2,000 on June 3, 2014. The Sacramento Bee and other publications reported on those donations earlier this year, but the affidavits provide\u00a0more context for the transactions. Those donations also could prove distinctly awkward for a candidate who lately has assailed Trump for his comments suggesting Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and other minority congresswomen\u00a0\u201cgo back\u201d where they came from, fix things and return to show how it's done. Harris slammed Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cvile,\u201d \u201cignorant,\u201d \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201chateful.\u201d But Harris did not publicly condemn Trump in 2011\u2014when he was pushing \"birther\" conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama.\u00a0A spokesperson for the Harris campaign told The Sacramento Bee\u00a0in March that Harris donated the $6,000 she received from Trump to a nonprofit that focuses on the rights of Central Americans but did not do so until 2015\u2014one year after she won her re-election campaign. It is unclear at this point if Harris ever returned or donated the $2,000 contribution from Ivanka Trump. Asked Wednesday for any further comment on the donation, a spokesman told Fox News: \"All Trump's money was donated to an immigrants' rights charity.\" The main 2011 fundraising event was held on Sept. 22 of that year at law firm SNR Denton\u2019s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. The invitation, seen by Fox News, showed tiers\u00a0of donations: $1,000 to be considered a \u201cDonor,\u201d $2,500 to be considered a \u201cSponsor,\u201d and $5,000 to be considered a \u201cHost.\u201d According to the invitation, Schneiderman was the \u201cSpecial Guest Speaker.\u201d A copy of Trump\u2019s check, also obtained by Fox News, shows the check dated\u00a0Sept. 13, 2011; it was stamped on Sept. 26, 2011. The check, for $5,0000, was signed by Trump and made out to the order of: \u201cRE-ELECT ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA D HARRIS 2014.\u201d Ivanka Trump\u2019s sworn affidavit also reflected Schneiderman\u2019s involvement in soliciting the funds for Harris\u2019 campaign. \u201cIn September 2011, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s former transition committee leader again contacted me and said that Mr. Schneiderman would \u2018greatly appreciate\u2019 if I attended a fundraising event for newly elected California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris as Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s guest,\u201d Ivanka said. \u201cIn response, my father made a $5,000 contribution to Ms. Harris\u2019 campaign and I attended the fundraiser,\u201d she continued. \u201cAt the event, an intimate gathering of New York business people, I was one of only a small handful of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s personal guests.\u201d Ivanka added that \u201cnot wanting to disappoint\u201d Schneiderman, she \u201cpersonally contributed $500 to Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s reelection campaign in honor of his birthday.\u201d The $5,000 donation to Harris came amid Schneiderman's investigation into Trump University after receiving complaints from nearly a dozen students about the school. It was not until August 2013 that Schneiderman filed a civil suit accusing Trump University of employing illegal business practices. The case ended in April 2018 with a $25 million settlement. Schneiderman was later forced to resign from his post as New York\u2019s attorney general in May 2018, after he was accused of physically abusing several women. An\u00a0investigation launched by Gov. Andrew Cuomo ended in December\u00a02018\u00a0and resulted in no criminal charges against him --\u00a0the statute of limitations prevented any form of prosecution. But Harris also led an investigation into several for-profit colleges,\u00a0including Trump University, which was revealed in October 2013. No charges were filed in connection with the probe.",

The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into Russian election interference and Trump's ties to Russia for the last two years.

DAY ONE OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS \"You see exactly what America voted against in 2016, career government bureaucrats doing their thing,\u201d the executive vice president of the Trump Organization said. \u201cEverything was hearsay, \u2018I heard it from a friend, who heard it from a friend, how heard it from a friend.\u2019 I\u2019m saying, \u2018this is a joke.\u2019\u201d At one point in Wednesday's\u00a0hearing, Rep.
