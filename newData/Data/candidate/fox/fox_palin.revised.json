      "content": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin went to bat for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump at the Milwaukee County GOP dinner Friday night. Palin called on Republicans to unify behind Trump\u2019s candidacy. She said he\u2019s the only candidate who understands that \u201ccommon sense is an endangered species in Washington.\u201d She also touted Trump as the only candidate who has created private-sector jobs, saying \u201cHe builds big things.\u201d \"Donald Trump is the only one who really understands this reality. He's the only one who creates private sector jobs, balances budgets and builds things, he builds big things,\" she said. Trump didn\u2019t attend the dinner. Palin also attacked the other Republican candidates on their immigration policies at the dinner. She accused Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich of \u201cseducing (illegal immigrants) with gift baskets.\u201d There were also some chuckles in the crowd when Palin said Trump is the only one who \"talks rationally\" about foreign policy and national security. Cruz received high praise at the dinner from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. He endorsed Cruz Monday and called the senator a \u201crock star\u201d before Cruz took the stage. Walker is also planning to join Cruz on the campaign trail in Wisconsin Sunday. Cruz noted that Walker is one of five former Republican presidential candidates who are now backing his campaign. The others are Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham. \"That is the very real manifestation of the unity we need across this country,\" he said. \"If we are divided, we will lose the primary and hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.\" Cruz said nominating Trump would be a \"train wreck.\" \"That's actually not fair to train wrecks,\" Cruz said. \"Nominating Donald Trump elects Hillary Clinton.\" In his speech at the same event, Kasich cast himself as an independent-minded Republican, saying he understands the frustration felt by Trump backers. \"The Republican Party has been my vehicle and not my master,\" Kasich said. \"I've never wanted to be a professional politician \u2014 in fact, I don't even like politics.\" Kasich, whose only primary victory has come in his home state of Ohio, is hoping to survive the primary season and win the nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland in July. \"We are going to have a contested convention,\" said former four-term Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson when he introduced Kasich, noting that Abraham Lincoln won the nomination 156 years ago going into the convention as the underdog. The anti-Trump forces have been working to stop the billionaire businessman in Wisconsin, a state that will help determine whether he can emerge from the primaries with enough delegates to avoid a contested convention. Wisconsin awards 18 delegates to the statewide winner, and divides 24 delegates among the winner in each eight congressional districts. If Cruz sweeps all the delegates in Wisconsin, Trump will need to win 57 percent of the remaining delegates in other states to collect the 1,237 he needs to clinch the nomination. So far, he has won 48 percent of all delegates awarded. In the latest Fox Business Poll, Cruz holds a 10-point lead over Trump in Wisconsin. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Sarah Palin might reach the White House yet -- albeit for a short stay. The 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate on Sunday gamely answered the question about how she might serve in a Donald Trump administration by saying she wants to be the Energy secretary. \u201cI think a lot about the Department of Energy, because energy is my baby,\u201d Palin, a former governor of Alaska, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cOil and gas and minerals, those (are) things that God has dumped on this part of the Earth for mankind's use, instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations, for us to import their resources.\u201d However, Palin then pivoted to the familiar less-government, states-right position that the agency should be shuttered, which would end her Cabinet-level position. \u201cIf I were head of that (agency,) I'd get rid of it,\u201d Palin said. \u201cAnd I'd let the states start having more control over the lands that are within their boundaries and the people who are affected by the developments within their states.\u201d To be sure, the oil and gas industry is the biggest part of Alaska's economy. And nearly 85 percent of Alaska\u2019s budget is funded by oil revenues, according to the state. Palin and GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain lost the 2008 White House race to President Obama. Palin has already shown her support for Trump, the billionaire businessman and GOP presidential front-runner with whom she appears to share an anti-Washington sentiment. And Trump suggested as far back as June that he would consider appointing Palin to an Executive Branch post.",

      "content": " We interrupt our continuing coverage of Chris Christie to examine which Republicans have a better shot at the presidency if Christie is damaged goods. Which is sheer speculation, of course. And that happens to be the media\u2019s specialty. Bill Kristol stirred up a bit of a fuss yesterday by declaring that there\u2019s no reason Sarah Palin shouldn\u2019t run for president. Kristol, whose Weekly Standard was a major Palin booster in 2008, didn\u2019t predict she would win, but he said she'd have a major impact on the race. Kristol, a former Fox News contributor, also forecast on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that two other Fox contributors would run: Mike Huckabee and former U.N ambassador John Bolton. (Both have said they\u2019re looking at the race.) I have no inside information here, but Palin certainly wouldn\u2019t lack for media attention. Kristol, who worked in the Bush 41 White House, is a well-connected Republican, and if this was a trial balloon, it raises intriguing questions. On the MSNBC morning show, Chuck Todd pushed back, saying that if Palin ran it would be for \u201ca financial reason, to get back into the spotlight. Get the speaking fees back up.\u201d This annoyed Kristol, who said that the establishment takes seriously such candidates as Jon Huntsman (who flopped), but dismisses the likes of Palin and Huckabee as people who \u201cjust want to make money.\u201d Host Joe Scarborough (also named by Kristol as a 2016 dark horse) said Palin\u2019s populist message could resonate in the GOP primaries but that she hurt herself by resigning as Alaska governor. There are, of course, multiple reasons that folks jump into a White House race, from increased visibility to boosting career prospects to positioning for a VP slot. Just ask Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton and many others. Palin has a passionate following among Tea Party types, but she would also expose herself again to mockery from the mainstream media. She would have to decide whether the grueling nature of a campaign is worth giving up her television gigs. Much of this talk is being spurred by the Christie vacuum in the wake of the bridge scandal. Even Mitt Romney, who\u2019s been on the TV circuit after that favorable Netflix documentary, is being asked whether he\u2019d give it a third try. His answer is no way. There is chatter now about other governors, such as Scott Walker. Perhaps the most important name on Kristol\u2019s list is Jeb Bush, who says he is looking at the race but won\u2019t decide soon. The media would immediately treat Bush as a heavyweight and he would in effect become the establishment candidate. The dilemma for the former Florida governor is that he has openly questioned how far to the right his party has moved. He would be, fairly or not, saddled with defending his brother\u2019s presidential record. And, by the way, Bush\u2019s own mother doesn\u2019t want him to run. In The Week, Damon Linker all but declares the primaries over: \u201cIt's beginning to dawn on me that Jeb Bush is probably going to be the Republican Party's nominee for president in 2016. \"Consider: With the ongoing implosion of Chris Christie's political career, the GOP establishment has lost its best hope for a candidate who could stop a libertarian-populist insurgency during the primaries. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker \u2014 the list of viable fire-breathers is longer (and less dominated by\u00a0incompetents,\u00a0crazies, and one-note\u00a0sideshow acts) than establishment types would like.\u201d As for the last-name problem, he says: \u201cYes, Jeb would be freighted by bad memories of his brother's failed presidency. But he might be helped by warm memories of his father's presidency.\u201d But American Conservative\u2019s Daniel Larison strongly disagrees: \u201cLike his brother when he ran for president, Jeb Bush has no foreign policy experience to speak of, and to the best of my knowledge he has never shown much interest in the subject. Given his brother\u2019s disastrous record, I doubt that enough Republicans would want to take that kind of chance again. \u201cConsidering the state that the last Bush left the GOP in, there can\u2019t be very many Republicans that want to turn to that family a third time for leadership.\u201d Bottom line: The Republican Party is trying to find someone who can beat Hillary Clinton. A Palin-Hillary race would be absolute gold for the press. And a Bush-Clinton race would conjure memories of 1992, a clash between two royal political families that never seem to leave the scene. Assuming, that is, that one or both of them run. Click for more from Media Buzz.",

      "subtitle": "Sarah Palin seizes the media spotlight by playing the impeachment card",
      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " There is simply no downside for Sarah Palin in calling for Barack Obama\u2019s impeachment. She grabs a nice bit of media attention. She rallies her conservative base. She gets to talk about it on Fox. And since she holds no elective office, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about whether her rhetorical broadside has the slightest chance of succeeding. In fact, the chances that the House will impeach a second straight Democratic president are extremely remote. But so what? Palin gets the issue and positions herself on the leading edge of anti-Obamaism. The former Alaska governor and Fox News contributor launched her attack yesterday on the conservative Breitbart News website, and she came out swinging: \u201cEnough is enough of the years of abuse from this president. His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, \u2018no mas.\u2019\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment.\u201d The 2008 VP nominee made the case last night on \u201cHannity\u201d as well, guaranteeing a second bump. But while various GOP congressmen have openly mused about impeachment, the House leadership hasn\u2019t given any indication that such proceedings would be seriously considered. With the Republicans appearing to be in a strong position in the 2014 midterms, why introduce an explosive new element that would divide the country and enable critics to turn the spotlight on their motivation? The impeachment of Bill Clinton didn\u2019t work out so well from the GOP point of view, as the country turned against the effort and the Democrats actually picked up House seats in the 1998 midterms. I\u2019m sure a chunk of the country would love to see Obama run out of office. But being a bad president isn\u2019t grounds for impeachment. The Constitution requires evidence of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d\u2014say, like authorizing burglaries and orchestrating a coverup, as Richard Nixon did. The IRS scandal certainly carries a strong whiff of Watergate-style political retaliation. But with all those missing Lois Lerner emails, no one has tied the misconduct to the president or top White House aides. Interestingly, Palin\u2019s Breitbart column doesn\u2019t offer a legal bill of particulars for impeachment. It\u2019s more of a laundry-list indictment of his conduct in office: \u201cOpening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate.\u00a0This is his fundamental transformation of America\u2026 \u201cThe federal government is trillions of dollars in debt, many cities are on the verge of insolvency, our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max.\u00a0.. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s rewarding of lawlessness, including his own, is the foundational problem here. It\u2019s not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along.\u201d Will this have a political impact? The Washington Post sees Palin putting her Capitol Hill colleagues on the spot: \u201cIf a significant pro-impeachment portion of the conservative base does materialize \u2014 and that's\u00a0a big \u2018if\u2019 \u2014 it will put Republican lawmakers in the unenviable position of responding to questions about whether they, too, agree with the idea of impeachment\u2026 \u201cIt lends credence to Democrats' argument that Republicans are controlled by the extreme wing of their party. And to the extent that Democrats can make the 2014 election a referendum on the GOP's conduct in Congress (see: government shutdown), it's to their benefit.\u201d On the right, Hot Air's Allahpundit suggests the effort isn\u2019t worth it because the president would most likely be acquitted in the Senate: \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure there\u2019d be a majority in favor of convicting Obama even if Republicans retake the Senate. The usual centrist suspects \u2014 Collins, Murkowski, Kirk, et al. \u2014 will be chilly to the idea. And now that Thad Cochran owes his reelection to black Democrats in Mississippi, it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019d turn around and vote to remove the first black president. To even have a bare majority willing to convict, I suspect you\u2019d need at least 57 or so seats in GOP hands next year, which is a tall order for November. \u201cBut again, this is mainly about constructing a true conservative/RINO litmus test, so if a bunch of RINOs end up voting to acquit, no biggie. That\u2019ll simply be taken as proof of the underlying point that the Senate needs more tea partiers\u2026 \u201cDoes John McCain agree with his former running mate that the president should be impeached? Inquiring minds want to know!\u201d (McCain said yesterday he doesn't support impeachment.) On the left, Salon laments the extreme polarization of such efforts: \"We\u2019ve gotten into the habit of delegitimizing our presidents \u2014 not just contesting their election or pushing back against their policies, but denying their very claim to the White House. From the farcical (birthers) to the faux-serious ('anti-American socialist!'), we\u2019ve moved beyond mere opposition and into a deeper civic sickness, where casting aspersions on the policies of an opposition president has given way to challenging his very right to implement those policies. \"It didn\u2019t start with Barack Obama. This new kind of cynicism has been gaining ground for years.\" Sarah Palin was a powerful force in the 2010 elections, boosting some candidates to victory with her coveted endorsements and still being talked about as a presidential possibility. But with the rise of figures like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, she hasn\u2019t been talked about much in 2014 at all. That, at least for now, has suddenly changed. Click for more from Media Buzz.",

Speaking to the pro-Trump crowd in Tulsa, Okla., Palin referred to her son\u2019s case as the \"elephant in the room.\" After telling the crowd they deserved a commander-in-chief who \u201cwill let [military members] do their job and go kick ISIS\u2019 ass\u201d and not \u201cleave our wounded warriors behind,\u201d the former Alaska governor asked if she could \u201cget a little bit personal.\u201d \u201cI guess it\u2019s kind of the elephant in the room because my own family going through what we\u2019re going through today, with my son, a combat vet having served in the striker brigade fighting for you all, America, in the war zone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened. They come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have sacrificially given to this country and that starts at the top.\u201d Palin said military members look at Obama and question whether he knows the sacrifices they make to \u201csecure America and to secure freedoms.\u201d \u201cSo when my own son is going through what he is going through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kinda feel these ramifications of some PTSD,\u201d she said. Track, a 26-year-old Iraq veteran, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of domestic violence assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence crime and possession of a firearm while intoxicated. According to the police affidavit posted by KTVA-TV, officers were called to the residence Monday night following two 911 calls \u2013 the first from Track\u2019s girlfriend and the second from him. The woman claimed Track had \u201cpunched her in the face and that a firearm was involved,\u201d according to police records. The charges against Track were filed the same day Palin appeared at an Ames, Iowa, rally to endorse Trump, the current GOP frontrunner. Palin, a Tea Party favorite and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, told the crowd that \u201cthings will change under President Trump.\u201d She went on to criticize the GOP establishment as well as Obama\u2019s foreign policies.",

      "content": "In a dustup between former GOP vice presidential candidates, Sarah Palin said Sunday she will work to unseat House Speaker Paul Ryan after Ryan refused last week to endorse Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump, asked about Palin's remarks on Monday, called her a \"free agent\" and said he had nothing to do with that push. Palin, who was on the 2008 Republican ticket, earlier said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d she \u201cwill do whatever I can\u201d to support Ryan\u2019s primary challenger in Wisconsin\u2019s first district. Ryan\u2019s snub of Trump was \u201cnot a wise decision of his,\u201d Palin said. \u201cHis political career is over, but for a miracle, because he has so disrespected the will of the people,\u201d said Palin, who was governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009. She suggested that Ryan would be \u201cCantor-ed,\u201d referencing ex-Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s June 2014 Virginia primary loss to an upstart challenger and his ousting from GOP leadership. Both Palin and Trump were speaking on CNN. Ryan is facing businessman Paul Nehlen in the Aug. 9 Republican congressional primary. Palin said she has not yet spoken to Nehlen, but Nehlen had obviously heard the news Sunday morning, retweeting two links to the Palin interview from his personal account. Ryan's spokesperson declined to comment on the Palin remarks when contact by FoxNews.com. Ryan, who was a vice presidential candidate in 2012, was first elected to Congress in 1998 and was chosen as speaker of the house in 2015. Though he has been somewhat critical of several Trump statements in the past, Ryan still stunned many in the political world on Thursday when he declined to throw his weight behind his party\u2019s likely November standard bearer. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point,\u201d Ryan said on CNN. \u201cI\u2019m not there right now.\u201d Palin told host Jake Tapper she believes Ryan\u2019s own presidential ambitions are keeping him from supporting Trump. \u201cYou know, I think why Paul Ryan is doing this, Jake, it kind of screws his chances for the 2020 presidential bid that he\u2019s gunning for,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the GOP were to win now, that wouldn\u2019t bode well for his chances in 2020 and that\u2019s what he\u2019s shooting for. So a lot of people with their \u2018Never Trump\u2019 or \u2018Now Right Now Trump\u2019 mantra going on, they have different reasons. I think that one is Paul Ryan\u2019s reason.\u201d",

The team at New Analytics has built unique tool to measure which candidates are being talked about the most and the data are compiled into a single score and provided to Fox News First.\n\n Here are their rankings for media mentions this week, with their gain or decline from last week in brackets. See the full results\u00a0here.\n\nDonald Trump, 27.05 [+1.55];\u00a0Ted Cruz, 15.68 [+4.24];\u00a0Ben Carson, 13.97 [+1.32];\u00a0Marco Rubio, 12.12 [+1.68];\u00a0Jeb Bush, 9.32 [-2.79]; Chris Christie, 5.83 [-1.37];\u00a0Rand Paul, 5.04 [-.23];\u00a0Carly Fiorina, 4.69 [-1.88];\u00a0John Kasich, 4.38 [-.83];\u00a0Mike Huckabee, 3.95 [-1.17] CONSERVATIVES RAISE ALARM, BUT IS IT TOO LATE?\nAfter a 60-year struggle, the conservative movement seemed to be at the threshold of its long-sought aim of the final takeover of the Republican Party. And then along came Donald Trump. With increasing signs that the GOP establishment is lining up behind Trump for fear of right-wing favorite Ted Cruz, the conservative movement is belatedly moving to try to save itself. National Review lowered the boom on Trump Thursday night with an all-star collection of conservative thinkers denouncing Trump\u2019s candidacy. The magazine is being joined by other luminaries of the movement, including a searing compilation from Matt Labash. \n\n The audience here includes those in the punditocracy and the world of politics who have been willing to either dismiss or enable Trump as a means to an ideological end, especially on immigration, or exploiting the vacuum he leaves to prop up dead candidacies. \n\n Ten days away from the Iowa caucuses is a little late for conservatives to come to the realization that they are on the brink of disaster. But there\u2019s still enough time, if\u2026. The conservative revolt against Trump only really matters if the two thirds of the Republican Party not supporting Trump can unite behind one or even two candidates.\n\n Most Republicans are quite conservative. But if they split their votes between three or even four other candidates, Trump can use his minority share of the party plus the many Democrats who support him for leveraged buyout of the GOP.\u00a0\n\n This is where the lack of a functional establishment or party hierarchy is really damaging the GOP. There is no check on candidates like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie and no seeming way to divert them from their course.\u00a0In a world of billionaire PAC men, there are no more power brokers to force rational action.\n\nTrump, Cruz ad war escalates - Donald Trump has unveiled his first attack ad of the cycle, a spot hammering rival Sen. Ted Cruz for what Trump says is weakness on the issue of illegal immigration. But Cruz was ready with an attack of his own.

Some 500 protestors were massacred on \u2018Bloody Sunday,\u2019 setting off months of protest and disorder throughout Russia. By January 1905, discontent with the czar\u2019s regime permeated nearly all classes in Russia, especially after the crushing January 2 defeat of the Russian navy at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War. In October 1905, Nicholas, embattled on all sides, was forced to grant basic civil liberties and a representative national body, which would be elected by narrowly limited suffrage. However, this Parliament, known as the Duma, was dissolved after it opposed Nicholas\u2019 authority, and the remnants of the revolutionary movement were brutally suppressed by czarist troops. A decade later, czarist Russia was bogged down in the mire of World War I, prompting the Bolshevik-led Russian Revolution of 1917, which crushed the czar\u2019s opposition and proclaimed Russia the world\u2019s first Marxist state.\u201d\n\nGot a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

      "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2013 The oldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was arrested in a domestic violence case in which his girlfriend was afraid he would shoot himself with an AR-15 assault rifle, according to court documents filed Tuesday. Track Palin, 26, is charged with assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident Monday night at the Wasilla home of his parents, where he lives, according to an affidavit by police. The girlfriend told authorities she was punched in the face by Palin, who is the oldest child of Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and conservative icon. The charges were filed Tuesday, the same day Sarah Palin endorsed Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump before voting begins with the Iowa caucuses. There is no telephone listing for the girlfriend. The court documents say the woman, Track Palin's girlfriend of one year, had bruising and swelling around her left eye, and she said her right knee hurt after Palin kicked her there. Palin family attorney John Tiemessen declined to comment on the matter other than to say in an email that respect for the family's privacy is appreciated \"as Track receives the help that he and many of our returning veterans need.\" Palin's arraignment was held Tuesday, but Tiemessen was not sure if he entered a plea yet. According to the three-page affidavit, both Palin and his girlfriend called 911 that night. Police Officer Andrew Kappler wrote that he arrived at the Wasilla home and found Track Palin walking outside and talking on a phone. The officer said Palin had an injury to his right eye and surrounding area, smelled strongly of alcohol and acted with escalating hostility, prompting Kappler to put him in handcuffs. Police say a breath sample provided by Palin showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.189. The affidavit says other officers found the girlfriend hiding under a bed inside the home and crying. The argument continued at the home, according to the affidavit, which says Palin struck the woman with his fist on the left side of her head near her eye. She curled up in the fetal position because she didn't know what else he would do, the woman told police. She said he then kicked her in the knee and threw her phone across the driveway, according to the court document. The woman said she went inside after getting her phone. Inside, Palin held the rifle, with the barrel just away from his face pointed to the side, the affidavit states. The affidavit adds that the woman told police Palin was yelling \"Do you think I won't do it?\" The girlfriend \"was concerned that he would shoot himself and ran outside and around the house,\" the affidavit says. \"She didn't see where Palin went, so she went inside and up the stairs, where she hid under a bed.\" It's not the first encounter with the law for Palin or other members of his family. In September 2014, he and other Palins were involved in a brawl that broke out at a party in Anchorage. No arrests were made in the melee, and no one wanted to press charges. But according to a police report, Palin had blood around his mouth and his hands. He was belligerent until his mother told him to talk to a police officer.",

      "author": "Howard Kurtz",
      "content": " When I first saw a headline about what Martin Bashir said, I figured it must be exaggerated. No responsible cable news host would call for defecating on a public figure. That\u2019s just beyond the pale, right? But that\u2019s exactly what Bashir did on his MSNBC show, while spewing venom at Sarah Palin. He made an abject apology yesterday, and we\u2019ll get to that in a moment. I\u2019ve long been amazed by Bashir\u2019s brand of name-calling. He despises Republicans, we get it. But the highly personal nature of his assaults, while delivered in an erudite British accent, stands out even by the loose standards of cable news. This guy was a co-anchor of \u201cNightline\u201d when he was at ABC, but was apparently seething with liberal resentment that we now see displayed daily on his weekday show. MSNBC once suspended Ed Schultz for calling Laura Ingraham a \u201cright-wing slut\u201d; why on earth does it tolerate Bashir's brand of bile? Bashir once said that the NRA \u201cdeserves to be equated with Hitler,\u201d so he\u2019s practiced at incendiary comparisons. What happened last week is that Bashir used his hatred of Palin\u2014calling her the country\u2019s \u201cresident dunce\u201d and a \u201cworld-class idiot\u201d\u2014to descend deeper into the gutter than I ever thought he\u2019d go. Now the issue on which he went after the former Alaska governor and Fox News contributor is fair game. Palin had spoken in Iowa of borrowing from China to pay for the national debt, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t racist. But it\u2019s going to be like slavery when that note is due.\u201d Lots of people didn\u2019t approve of Palin likening government borrowing to the awful legacy of buying and selling African-Americans. But Bashir chose to tell his audience of the diary of a plantation overseer in Jamaica named Thomas Thistlewood. \u201cIn 1756, he records that a slave named Darby \u2018catched eating kanes had him well flogged and pickled, then made Hector, another slave, sh** in his mouth.\u2019 \u201cThis became known as \u2018Darby\u2019s Dose,\u2019 a punishment invented by Thistlewood that spoke only of inhumanity. And he mentions a similar incident in 1756, his time in relation to a man he refers to as Punch. \u2018Flogged punch well, and then washed and rubbed salt pickle, lime juice and bird pepper, made Negro Joe piss in his eyes and mouth.\u2019\u201d And that brings Bashir to his disgusting denouement: \u201cWhen Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn\u2019t just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.\u201d That\u2019s right. Wrapped in the language of literary allegory, Bashir is saying he\u2019d like to see someone assault and abuse Sarah Palin in this horrifying fashion. And no one at MSNBC bats an eye? This is deemed acceptable discourse? What would MSNBC say if a conservative had talked about defecating on, say, Hillary Clinton? In his televised apology, directed to both Palin and to viewers, Bashir said his remarks were \u201cunworthy\u201d and \u201cdeeply offensive,\u201d and that he is \u201cdeeply sorry.\u201d He said he wished he had been \u201cmore thoughtful\u201d and \u201cmore compassionate.\u201d He said \u201cthe politics of vitriol and destruction is a miserable place to be and a miserable person to become,\u201d and promised to learn a lesson. An abject apology is all well and good. But as Mediaite\u2019s Joe Concha writes, invoking MSNBC President Phil Griffin: \u201cCould you imagine if\u00a0Neil Cavuto\u00a0or\u00a0Jake Tapper, who occupy the same timeslot on Fox and CNN, respectively, suggested\u00a0anyone\u00a0s*it in anyone\u2019s mouth on national television, as Bashir did last week? \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as he\u2019s killing it in the ratings. Day after day, Bashir easily owns the lowest-rated show in his timeslot among the big three. If Griffin were smart, he\u2019d use this episode as an excuse to get rid of Bashir.\u201d MSNBC rightfully suspended Alec Baldwin for two weeks for hurling an anti-gay slur at a photographer. But the corporate attitude is different because Palin is the target? This is nothing short of shameful, as even Martin Bashir now seems to recognize. All Ford All The Time You might think a mayor might lay low for awhile after admitting to smoking crack, getting too drunk, threatening to murder someone, and using a sexually explicit term on live television while denying that a female friend was a hooker. Not Rob Ford. Instead, Toronto\u2019s hard-living chief executive gives interviews to Fox and CNN as he prepares to launch his own Canadian TV show. Oh, and he knocked over a female City Council member yesterday as he rushed to help his brother in an \u201caltercation.\u201d Oh, and he\u2019s thinking of running for prime minister. \"I\u2019m seeking professional help, I\u2019m not an alcoholic, I\u2019m not a drug addict,\" Ford told Fox\u2019s John Roberts. \"Have I had my outbursts in the past? Absolutely I have John. But you know what I\u2019m only human. I\u2019ve made mistakes I\u2019ve apologized. That\u2019s all I can do.\" Ford also turned on CNN\u2019s Bill Weir, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not an addict. You can spin it. You can tell me whatever you want. These people know that I\u2019m not\u2014have you ever got drunk before, Bill?\u201d After Weir allowed that he had, Ford said: \u201cI don\u2019t look at myself as the mayor. I look at myself as just a normal, regular person.\u201d \u201cNormal\u201d and \u201cregular\u201d are not the first words that come to mind. There\u2019s a reason that \u201cSNL\u201d is lampooning Ford, who crashed a Toronto Argonauts Canadian football game despite a request by the league\u2019s commissioner that he stay away. Why do we give Ford all this coverage? Most politicians are boring, and this one is a slow-motion train wreck. Every day he seems to top himself. And Canada, usually ignored by the American media, hasn\u2019t gotten this much coverage since the War of 1812. Click for more from Media Buzz.",

      "content": " Sarah Palin\u2019s decision to sue the New York Times over an utterly irresponsible editorial underscores an unfortunate reality: This has been a truly awful stretch for the mainstream media. The former governor\u2019s lawsuit came shortly after CNN forced the resignation of three journalists over a story on the Russia investigation that prompted a retraction and apology to Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci. And that followed erroneous reports by CNN and ABC that James Comey was going to testify that he never told President Trump he wasn\u2019t under FBI investigation on the Russia matter\u2014except that Comey actually backed up Trump on that point. CNN also got tarred, through no fault of its own, by Kathy Griffin holding up a severed \u201cTrump\u201d head and host Reza Aslan calling Trump a piece of excrement and an \u201cembarrassment to humankind.\u201d The network cut ties with both of them. Every mistake, misstep and overreach gives ammunition to a president who takes a very dim view of the media and has unleashed a torrent of \u201cfake news\u201d tweets in the last two days. And each blunder further convinces Trump supporters that the press has no interest in being fair to this president and his people. Trump seized on the CNN retraction on Twitter, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders teed off in responding to a question on the subject. \u201cI think it\u2019s the constant barrage of fake news directed at this president probably that has garnered a lot of his frustration,\u201d she said. Sanders added that \u201cwe have gone to a place where if the media can\u2019t be trusted to report the news, then that\u2019s a dangerous place for America.\u201d Her answer prompted a lengthy interruption from Brian Karem, executive editor of Maryland\u2019s Sentinel newspapers, who declared: \u201cWe\u2019re here to ask you questions, you\u2019re here to provide the answers, and what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, see, once again, the president is right and everybody else out here is fake media.\u201d Karem\u2019s rant got him a bunch of cable bookings. He said on MSNBC: \u201cWe can\u2019t take the bullying anymore. It\u2019s undermining the Fourth Estate, the First Amendment, the reporters in the room, even Breitbart\u2014those people are responsible.\u201d Is it \u201cbullying\u201d when administration officials criticize the media, given that the media rip the administration every day? I don\u2019t like many of the press briefings being moved off camera, but does that amount to bullying? One person who has refused to be bullied is Sarah Palin. Her lawsuit, filed yesterday, deals with a Times editorial that was utterly false and had to be corrected. That editorial was reprehensible, mean-spirited and utterly tone-deaf, coming as it did the same day that Steve Scalise was nearly killed and four other people wounded at a Virginia baseball field. It accused Palin of \u201cincitement\u201d in the 2011 wounding of Gabby Giffords, and the killing of six others, because her political committee circulated a map with crosshairs to mark 20 targeted Democratic districts--with no evidence the gunman ever saw the map. Palin has every right to be furious and every right to sue\u2014but whether she can win is another question. The lawsuit says that the paper\u2019s response \u201cdid not approach the degree of the retraction and apology necessary and warranted by the Times\u2019s false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited murder.\u201d The paper tweeted a \u201csorry\u201d to its readers but did not apologize to Palin, which might have averted the lawsuit. A Times spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cWe have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously.\u201d Palin\u2019s problem is that the Supreme Court sets a very high bar for suing public figures for libel, ironically set out in the 1964 case of New York Times v. Sullivan. A public figure, which the former VP nominee most assuredly is, must prove that something was published with actual malice or with reckless disregard for the truth. Having run a correction the next day, the Times might be able to mitigate the charge of malice. What\u2019s sad is that the Times was trying to deflect attention from criticism of left-wing rhetoric, since the Virginia shooter two weeks ago was an avowed hater of Republicans, to right-wing rhetoric by resurrecting this false liberal charge from six years ago. But at the very least, Palin\u2019s lawsuit casts a harsh spotlight on what the Times editorial board did. Journalists are entitled to push back against over-the-top attacks from the Trump administration. But perhaps they should engage in some reflection about all the unforced errors that are fueling the criticism.",

      "content": "Todd Palin, the husband of Sarah Palin, was hospitalized after a serious snowmobile accident Sunday night, temporarily taking the former Alaska governor off the campaign trail for Donald Trump. Sarah Palin, though, made a surprise appearance in Tampa, Fla., on behalf of Trump later Monday afternoon -- despite an initial statement from the Trump campaign saying she was returning to Alaska. In the appearance, Palin thanked the public for their prayers as her husband recovers. She went on to slam the media for their coverage of unrest at Trump rallies and urged voters to back the primary front-runner, calling him a \u201crevolutionary\u201d that the country needs. Palin later confirmed the snowmobile accident on her Facebook page calling her husband \u201cthe toughest guy I know.\u201d \u201cAs any adventurous Alaskan knows, while you may be down, you\u2019re never out,\u201d she said. Todd\u00a0Palin's\u00a0father said late Monday that his son suffered eight fractured ribs and other injuries in the snowmobile accident. Jim\u00a0Palin\u00a0told The Associated Press in a phone interview that his son also had injuries to his collarbone and lungs, but he doesn't know the extent of those injuries. He added that Todd\u00a0Palin\u00a0is scheduled for surgery Monday at a hospital near the\u00a0Palins' hometown of Wasilla. He says he expects his son to recover fully. The father called the crash Sunday night \"one of those freak accidents\" and says it happened around Petersville, about 70 miles north of Wasilla. Jim\u00a0Palin, who splits his time between California and Alaska, says he plans to return to Alaska at the end of the month unless his son wants him there earlier. The Trump campaign confirmed earlier Monday afternoon that Todd Palin is currently hospitalized. \u201cGovernor Palin is returning to Alaska to be with her husband and looks forward to being back on the campaign trail soon. Mr. Trump\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with the Palin family at this time,\u201d the campaign said. The statement came shortly after the campaign abruptly announced that the Sarah Palin appearance originally scheduled for noon at The Villages in Florida had been cancelled. Just two days earlier, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee had posted on Facebook that she was heading out to the Sunshine State to stump for Trump, ahead of the state\u2019s Tuesday primary. \u201cSurrendering my ice fishing hole on our still-frozen solid lake to other anglers for the next few days, I'm humbled to be able to hit the campaign trail again for our next POTUS, Donald J. Trump,\u201d she wrote. The details on her husband\u2019s accident are unclear. NBC News reported that he is in intensive care, describing the accident as \u201cvery serious.\u201d Nick-named during Palin\u2019s term as governor as the state\u2019s \u201cfirst dude,\u201d Todd Palin is also an avid snowmobile competitor. He has won the grueling Iron Dog snowmobile competition several times. Sarah Palin, meanwhile, has become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters since endorsing him in January. Before cancelling Monday\u2019s noon event, she appeared on Trump's behalf at the Arcadia All-Florida Championship Rodeo and Florida Strawberry Festival on Sunday.

But some conservatives say he has gone native in Washington. Still, it's not clear that this campaign will turn into the same insider/outsider fight that has unfolded in other Republican primaries over the last few years. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., predicted that Shannon wouldn't make it that kind of race. \"I know Shannon well enough to know that it's not going to be that way,\" he told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday.

The deal purportedly involves the furnace and air conditioning manufacturer getting $6 million in tax subsidies and $1 million in training grants over 10 years. Fiscal conservatives repeatedly criticized outgoing Democratic President Obama of \u201cpicking winners and losers\u201d for providing tax credits and other incentives to so-called green energies like solar and wind power while introducing more federal regulations on coal-firing plants. \u201cRepublicans oppose this, remember?\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cWe support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.\u201d Palin is purportedly being considered for the post of Veterans Affairs secretary. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to help military veterans receive better health care through the agency and to keep the Carrier jobs from going to Mexico, part of his overarching promise to stop U.S. companies from moving operation from Midwest manufacturing states to countries with lower costs.

      "content": " MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2013 Sarah Palin returned to the campaign trail Thursday night to rally support for Judge Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, armed with a pitch heavy on anti-GOP establishment criticism. \u201cWe\u2019re sending Trump someone who has our back -- not Mitch McConnell\u2019s,\u201d Palin told a raucous crowd of hundreds. President Trump endorsed the other candidate in this race, Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed in February to fill the seat left open by Jeff Sessions when he became attorney general. But Palin, the former 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, insisted that backing Moore is not an act of defiance toward Trump. \u201cA vote for Judge Moore isn\u2019t a vote against the president, it is a vote for the people\u2019s agenda that elected the president,\u201d Palin said. And there are former Trump administration officials and current Republican members of Congress who agree. Sebastian Gorka, who served as a White House adviser until August, joined Palin on stage in Montgomery last night. \u201cAll you need to know is that Luther Strange is endorsed by Mitch McConnell,\u201d Gorka told Fox News in an interview.\u00a0 \u201cHe is a creature of the establishment, that\u2019s why we can\u2019t support him.\u201d Gorka says Moore stands for the things that made Trump popular as a candidate, so he isn\u2019t afraid to buck his former boss in this race. ALABAMA CANDIDATES SPAR OVER TRUMP ENDORSEMENT \u201cThis isn\u2019t about endorsements, this is about the original agenda that got a billionaire real estate mogul from New York elected to the White House,\u201d Gorka said. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, was here for Moore as well, and suggested the president\u2019s endorsement of Strange was a miscalculation. \u201cSometimes he gets bad advice,\u201d Gohmert said on Trump, before insisting he wants him to win re-election in 2020. The president gets a chance to make his case Friday in Huntsville, where he plans to take Air Force One for an arena rally on behalf of Sen. Strange. On Friday morning, Trump posted the latest in a string of pro-Strange tweets: \u201cWill be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close.

Steve King thinks of his friend Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement of billionaire Donald Trump and laments what he depicts as a missed opportunity to have her back his choice for president, Sen. Ted Cruz. It was early this year, the congressman said Wednesday during an interview at an Iowa hotel with Fox News Latino, when King, Iowa\u2019s conservative kingmaker, and the group \u00a0Citizens United hosted the Freedom Summit, dubbed on its website as an effort \u201cto bring grassroots activists from across Iowa to hear directly from conservative leaders on how we can get America back on track by focusing on our core principles of pro-growth economics, social conservatism, and a strong national defense.\u201d \u201cI had Sarah Palin and Ted Cruz together at dinner then,\u201d King said. \u201cWe were planning a pheasant hunt for the next day, and I just didn\u2019t press hard enough to hold Sarah for the next day (hunt).\u201d \u201cIf we had gone out to the field together with a shotgun, I think she would have endorsed Ted Cruz,\u201d King said, smiling. \u201cSo I\u2019m taking the blame.\u201d Palin and Cruz and King are avid hunters, a chance, the congressman suggested partly in jest and partly seriously, for the firebrand former Alaska governor and the firebrand Texas senator to bond \u2013 especially in a way that city slicker Trump can\u2019t with the former governor who boasts about liking the rough and tumble outdoors. Palin has defended hunting, saying: \u201cI especially love moose and caribou. I always remind people from outside our state that there\u2019s plenty of room for all Alaska\u2019s animals \u2013 right next to the mashed potatoes.\u201d Last November, amid the cornstalks of the Hawkeye State, Cruz and King, who every year hosts pheasant hunts, participated in one, posing at the end with photos of their dead prey. Palin, a Tea Party conservative who was Sen. John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, and became known for her irreverent one-liners and bashing of establishment Washington politics, announced her endorsement of Trump on Tuesday. The endorsement came as Trump is locked in a dead heat with Cruz in Iowa, the first state to vote for the selection of the nominee of each party for the presidential race. King, one the House\u2019s most conservative members and an influential figure in Iowa whose endorsement is pursued by Republicans running for president, says that in all seriousness, Palin shares more fundamental qualities and views with Cruz than with Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will move Trump forward very much,\u201d King said, referring to poll numbers or his standing in Iowa, where Cruz has for the most part enjoyed a lead over the other GOP candidates. \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s endorsement does move the focus of the press on her and [Trump] while she\u2019s in town. I wish her well, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s back in public life.\u201d",

Sarah Palin picked up on the real estate mogul\u2019s theme by saying that people should \u201cspeak American\u201d if they live in the United States. In a CNN interview on Sunday, Palin said she agreed with Trump\u2019s criticism of Bush\u2019s frequent Spanish-speaking on the campaign trail, and the billionaire\u2019s declaration that Bush should set an example for immigrants in the United States by speaking English. \u201cI think that it's a benefit of Jeb Bush to be able to be so fluent in Spanish, because we have a large and wonderful Hispanic population that, you know, is helping to build America. And that's good,\u201d Palin said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" when asked her opinion of Trump\u2019s comments about Bush and language. \u201cAnd that's a great relationship that he -- and connection that he has with them through his wife and through his family connections.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, you know, I think we can send a message and say, \u2018You want to be in America? A, you'd better be here legally or you're out of here. B, when you're here, let's speak American,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI mean that's what's -- let's speak English and that's a kind of a unifying aspect of the nation is the language that is understood by all.\u201d Trump recently hired Michael Glassner, who worked for Palin's vice presidential campaign, as his national political director. Last week, Trump told Breitbart News that Bush should \"set the example\" by speaking English on the campaign trail. \"I like Jeb,\" Trump told Breitbart News. \"He's a nice man. But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.\" Bush is Trump's chief Republican contender. For his part, Bush said his first reaction was to laugh at Trump's criticism of him for speaking Spanish. Bush dismissed Trump\u2019s criticism last week, telling ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Thursday, \"I laughed. I mean this is a joke.\" Bush said he had been responding to a reporter's question in Spanish this week when he replied in Spanish to criticize Trump. Bush called Trump's comments bizarre, adding that Trump is appealing to people's angst and fears rather than their higher hopes. The former Florida governor said that Trump is trying to \"insult his way to the presidency.\" He added that Trump doesn't believe in the country's set of shared values like diversity and tolerance.

Turkel and Vogt were part of the team that secured Hulk Hogan a $115 million award at trial from Gawker Media Group. Gawker appealed, but the two sides eventually settled for $31 million and Gawker and its founder, Nick Denton, were forced to file for bankruptcy. The editorial, attributed to The Times' editorial board and titled \"America's Lethal Politics,\" initially linked Palin's rhetoric to the shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The paper posted a correction the next day admitting that \"no such link was established.\" The editorial also claimed, incorrectly, that a now-infamous ad from Palin's political action committee put \"Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs[sic].\" The Times also corrected that statement, admitting that the crosshairs on the map targeted \"electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers.\" \"The Times used its false assertion about Mrs. Palin as an artifice to exploit the [Scalise] shooting,\" Palin's attorneys stated in the suit. \"The Times published and promoted its Editorial Board's column despite knowing ... the false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited [Tucson shooter Jared] Loughner to murder six people,\" the suit added. \"In doing so, the Times violated the law and its own policies.\" Palin is seeking damages in an amount to be determined by a jury.",

Palin\u2019s legal team also reportedly plans to ask the Times to produce \u201cevery internal communication it has had about her since 2011,\u201d in an effort to obtain \u201cdocuments that might reveal, among other things, their \u2018negative feelings\u2019 toward her,\u201d the Times reportedly told the judge on Wednesday. The former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate is suing the Times after the newspaper published an editorial on June 14, hours after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was shot and wounded at a Republican congressional baseball practice. Palin claims that the editorial tied her to the January 2011 shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The editorial, attributed to the Times\u2019 editorial board and titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d initially linked Palin\u2019s rhetoric to the shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. The Times posted a correction the following day, admitting that \u201cno such link was established.\u201d The editorial also claimed, incorrectly, that a now-infamous ad from Palin\u2019s political action committee put \u201cGiffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.\u201d The Times also corrected that statement, admitting that the crosshairs on the map targeted \u201celectoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers.\u201d \u201cThe Times used its false assertion about Mrs. Palin as an artifice to exploit the [Scalise] shooting,\u201d Palin\u2019s attorneys stated in the lawsuit. \u201cThe Times published and promoted its editorial board\u2019s column despite knowing\u2026the false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited [Tucson shooter Jared] Loughner to murder six people,\u201d the suit added. \u201cIn doing so, the Times violated the law and its own policies.\u201d The New York Times has reportedly claimed that Palin has no case because she cannot claim malice, which is the legal standard for claiming defamation. Asked for comment on Thursday, a New York Times spokesperson told Fox News: \"We raised our concern about the subpoenas in a section of the brief that quotes Judge Robert Bork as saying 'a freshening stream of libel actions, which often seem as much designed to punish writers and publications as to recover damages for real injuries, may threaten the public and constitutional interest in free, and frequently rough, discussion.'\" The representative then referred to an earlier response to the suit, saying: \"It is agonizing to get something wrong, but as soon as our editors become aware of the error, they corrected it. We are confident that the First Amendment protects publishers in these circumstances, and we intend to defend the action vigorously.\"",

      "content": "Former vice-presidential nominee and governor of Alaska Sarah Palin made her first foray into the 2016 presidential race Tuesday by announcing she is endorsing Donald Trump. \"I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America,\" Palin said in a statement from the Trump campaign announcing the endorsement. She later appeared alongside Trump at a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa \u201cYou\u2019re putting relationships on the line for this country because you\u2019re willing to make America great again,\u201d she said at the rally. \u201cI am here because like you, I know it\u2019s now or never.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it because we believe in America,\u201d she added. Trump told supporters he was \u201cgreatly honored\u201d to receive Palin\u2019s support. \u201cShe\u2019s the woman that from day one I said I needed to get her support,\u201d he said. Palin, who became a symbol of the Tea Party movement following the 2008 presidential election, is the highest-profile backer for a Republican contender so far in the race. In her endorsement speech, Palin praised Trump for bringing up controversial issues to create \u201ca good, heated primary,\u201d while taking aim at what she called \u201cestablishment candidates\u201d in the race. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wearing political correctness kind of like a suicide vest,\u201d she said. The endorsement comes less than two weeks ahead of the critical lead-off Iowa caucus, where Trump is locked in a dead heat with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In the statement announcing the endorsement, Trump's campaign described Palin as a conservative who \"helped launch the careers of several key future leaders of the Republican Party and conservative movement.\" The statement also quoted Cruz as once saying he \"would not be in the United States Senate were it not for Gov. Sarah Palin...She can pick winners.\" Campaigning in New Hampshire, Tuesday, Cruz responded to Palin's endorsement of Trump, saying \"regardless of what Sarah intends to do in 2016, I will remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin.\" Trump's national political director Michael Glassner previously worked with Palin, who was a virtual newcomer to the national political arena when McCain named her as his running mate. Palin is expected to join Trump on Wednesday for campaign events in Norwalk, Iowa and Tulsa, Okla. \u201cEven with a record number of candidates and internal calls to become more inclusive as a party, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin remain two of the GOP\u2019s most influential leaders,\" Mark Paustenbach, Democratic National Committee Press secretary, said in a statement responding to the endorsement. \"Their divisive rhetoric is now peddled by everyone from Ted Cruz to Marco Rubio. \u00a0Americans deserve better than what Trump and Palin have to offer, but it seems like the other Republican candidates would rather follow in their footsteps,\u201d the statement continued. Palin's endorsement was not the only one Trump received Tuesday. While campaigning at Iowa's John Wayne Birthplace Museum, he received an endorsement from the western film actor\u2019s daughter, Aissa Wayne. Wayne said the country needs a strong and courageous leader like her father, and that he would be offering his endorsement if he were still alive. Trump said he was a big fan of Wayne and that the actor represented strength and power \u2014 which, he said, the American people are looking for. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was arraigned Sunday after being arrested a day earlier on charges of domestic violence. Palin, 28, was charged with first-degree burglary, one charge of fourth-degree assault and one charge of fourth-degree criminal mischief, KTUU reported. The news station also reported Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility in Palmer, about 20 miles northeast of Wasilla. He was charged with misdemeanor mischief for allegedly causing up to $500 in property damage, according to the Los Angeles Times. SARAH PALIN'S OLDEST SON ARRESTED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE Palin\u2019s arrest on charges of domestic violence isn\u2019t his first. In January 2016, he was charged with assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident. At the time, Palin\u2019s girlfriend told law enforcement he punched her in the face, and said she was scared he would shoot himself with an AR-15. The girlfriend reportedly had bruising and swelling around her left eye, and she said her right knee hurt after Palin kicked her there. Sarah Palin, the vice presidential candidate alongside Sen. John McCain in 2008, took heat after the arrest for seemingly saying President Obama was at fault for her son\u2019s issues following his service in the Iraq War. \u201cMy son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened,\u201d Sarah Palin said. \u201cThey come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have sacrificially given to this country and that starts at the top.\u201d She added that military members look to Obama and question whether he knows the sacrifices they make to \u201csecure America and to secure freedoms.\u201d 'ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM': PALIN DEFENDS SON AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARREST Track Palin served in Iraq for one year in 2008 as part of the Alaska-based 25th\u00a0Infantry Division\u2019s 1st Stryker Brigade, according to KTUU. He\u00a0also made headlines in Sept. 2014 after reports circulated that the well-known family got into a brawl at a house party in Anchorage in which Track, who had blood near his hands and mouth, initially appeared \u201cbelligerent\u201d when speaking to a police officer.

The president has endorsed Moore\u2019s opponent, incumbent Luther Strange. Breitbart News broke the news of the Palin endorsement of Moore on Thursday. Moore and Strange will face off Sept. 26 in a runoff after they finished first and second in the Republican primary earlier this month. The winner will face Democratic nominee Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, in the Dec. 12 general election. Moore is leading most polls in Alabama, AL.com reported. Perhaps taking a jab at the president, Palin invoked his \u201cmake America great again\u201d slogan in her endorsement statement about Moore: \u201cGlad he\u2019s running and am honored to endorse Judge Roy Moore for the US Senate. Judge Moore has shown he has what it takes to stand up to the out-of-touch political establishment. The Judge has proven he\u2019s not afraid of a fight for what is right, and he\u2019s ready to take on DC\u2019s swamp monsters and help make America great again. We need more bold leaders like Judge Moore who will fight for all of us in the US Senate.\u201d Strange was appointed to the Senate after former Sen. Jeff Sessions was named U.S. attorney general. Moore was Alabama's chief justice but was removed from office for defying a federal order related to same-sex marriage. In a statement, Moore thanked Palin for her support. \"Governor Palin has a strong record of speaking out for conservative causes and standing up to the Washington establishment. Having her support shows how conservatives across the country are uniting behind our campaign to send a message to Mitch McConnell and the Washington elites who are trying to buy this election,\" he said.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "A federal judge on Tuesday tossed out a defamation lawsuit by Sarah Palin against The New York Times, saying the former Alaska governor failed to show the newspaper knew it was publishing false statements in an editorial before quickly correcting them. The written ruling by Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said the lawsuit seeking unspecified damages \"fails on its face to adequately allege actual malice.\" The decision came weeks after the onetime Republican vice presidential nominee sued over an editorial titled \"America's Lethal Politics.\" It was published in June after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers in Virginia, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise. The Times' editorial was corrected twice when readers complained that it appeared to blame a political action committee belonging to Palin, a former Republican vice presidential candidate, for \"political incitement\" after it distributed a map depicting Democratic lawmakers beneath crosshairs before the 2011 shooting of Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords in Arizona. The newspaper issued corrections the next morning to remove those references and note the map showed electoral districts, not people, in crosshairs. \"What we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly corrected. Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not,\" Rakoff said. Rakoff, known for philosophical asides, wrote: \"Nowhere is political journalism so free, so robust, or perhaps so rowdy as in the United States. In the exercise of that freedom, mistakes will be made, some of which will be hurtful to others.\" He said if political journalism is to achieve its constitutionally endorsed role of challenging the powerful, lawsuits by public figures must be limited to when there is a \"plausible factual basis for complaining that the mistake was made maliciously.\" Lawyers for Palin did not immediately comment. In a statement, the Times said it was delighted with the ruling and regretted the errors. \"Judge Rakoff's opinion is an important reminder of the country's deep commitment to a free press and the important role that journalism plays in our democracy,\" the newspaper said. Rakoff had previously heard testimony from James Bennet, the Times' editorial page editor, saying he thought the editorial was accurate when he approved its publication but later learned otherwise. The judge dismissed an argument by Palin's lawyers that the newspaper might have been trying to boost sales by attacking Palin. \"As to the alleged 'hostility,' it goes without saying that the Times editorial board is not a fan of Mrs. Palin. But neither the fact of that opposition, nor the supposition that a sharp attack on a disfavored political figure will increase a publication's readership, has ever been enough to prove actual malice,\" he wrote. Rakoff added: \"There is not a shred of factual support, either in the complaint or in the evidentiary hearing, for the supposition that considerations of attracting readership ever entered Mr. Bennet's mind when he was drafting this particular editorial. Indeed, if that were his goal, one would have expected him to mention Mrs. Palin's name more than once in the editorial or use her name in the social media promoting the editorial, neither of which was done.\"",

      "content": " Sarah Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times over an editorial that linked her political action committee to the shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., has been revived, after a lower court judge previously had dismissed it. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday that Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York strayed from procedural norms before tossing out Palin\u2019s libel complaint in August 2017. Rakoff held a hearing to learn more facts about the case before ruling on the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss, when such decisions typically rely solely on what is alleged in court documents. PALIN SUIT AGAINST NY TIMES SPOTLIGHTS A FLOOD OF MEDIA MISTAKES \u201cWe find that the district court erred in relying on facts outside the pleadings to dismiss the complaint,\u201d Second Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr. wrote. The former vice presidential candidate\u00a0sued the Times for libel after a June 2017\u00a0editorial about the shooting of GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and others\u00a0mentioned a map put out years earlier by SarahPAC that had crosshairs over different Democratic congressional districts. While the map had been used in reference to ObamaCare, the editorial connected it to Jared Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting of Giffords, whose district was among the ones identified in the map. The editorial said that the SarahPAC map had Giffords and other Democrats under crosshairs (though the targets were over their districts). In discussing the Scalise shooting, the Times said, \u201cThough there\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack, liberals should of course hold themselves to the same standard of decency that they ask of the right.\u201d \u201cNo evidence ever emerged to establish that link; in fact, the criminal investigation of Loughner indicated that his animosity toward Representative Giffords had arisen before SarahPAC published the map,\u201d Walker noted Tuesday. The Times published a correction after receiving backlash for the editorial, noting that there was no link between the map and the shooting. Rakoff had originally held the hearing in question in order\u00a0to learn whether there was enough support for Palin\u2019s claim that the editorial was published with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2013 knowledge that a statement is false or reckless disregard for whether it is true \u2013 which is the standard for public figures to bring defamation claims. GREGG JARRETT: SARAH PALIN VS. THE NEW YORK TIMES -- FIVE REASONS WHY EX-GOVERNOR MIGHT JUST WIN HER CASE Rakoff brought in the author of the editorial, James Bennet, who answered questions about his knowledge that the Times had previously published articles that said there was no link between the map and the shooting. Bennet said he was unaware at the time he wrote the editorial. The information Rakoff learned from the hearing was enough for him to dismiss Palin\u2019s claim with prejudice, meaning she was not permitted to file an amended complaint. The Second Circuit ruled that this was improper as it ran \u201cheadlong\u201d into the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Times\u00a0spokesperson told The Associated Press that the newspaper is disappointed and will vigorously fight the lawsuit. The Second Circuit sent the case back down to the Southern District of New York, ordering it to move forward\u00a0with discovery. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

John McCain, according to multiple reports. \u201cMy guess is, it came from Cindy,\u201d a source close to the McCain family told People magazine, referring to the late senator\u2019s widow. \u201cShe is very protective of John\u2019s memory and legacy. She\u2019s also a grieving widow. I think she wants to get through this as best she can.\u201d The message was sent through an intermediary, not directly from the McCain family, according to the report. An NBC reporter tweeted that a Palin \"family source\" said,\u00a0\u201cOut of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d Palin did not immediately respond to a Fox News email sent early Thursday. A decade ago, it was McCain\u2019s selection of Palin to be his vice president that catapulted Palin to the national political spotlight from relative obscurity in Alaska. But their relationship quickly grew strained, amid accusations that Palin was often unprepared for media interviews, or had \u201cgone rogue\u201d by ignoring the advice of McCain campaign handlers. Some critics charged that Palin was more interested in advancing her own career \u2013 and popularity among conservative voters -- than assuring the success of the McCain-Palin ticket, led by the more moderate McCain. In May, McCain published a book titled \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d in which he wrote that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of his close friend, former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. McCain and Palin ultimately lost the White House in 2008 to Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Ironically, Biden is scheduled to speak Thursday at a McCain memorial service in the senator\u2019s home state of Arizona, while Obama has been invited to deliver a eulogy Saturday at a McCain memorial service in Washington, D.C. Following McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last Saturday at age 81, Palin issued a pair of Twitter messages. \u201cToday we lost an American original,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life - and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.\u201d Later, she wrote: \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d",

Palin, who was tapped as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president during the 2008 race, opened up about the funeral during an interview on \u201cGood Morning Britain.\u201d TRUMP RIPS INTO MCCAIN'S LEGACY, SUPPORT FOR IRAQ WAR DURING SPEECH TO OHIO PLANT WORKERS \u201cI was kinda surprised to be publicly disinvited to the funeral. I think that was an unnecessary step,\u201d Palin told Piers Morgan. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to embarrass me and embarrass others. That was all weird. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen to other people. It\u2019s kind of a gut punch.\u201d McCain, who died last August from brain cancer, reportedly planned his own funeral. According to reports, Palin learned she was not invited to the services through an intermediary, not directly from the McCain family. A Palin family source, at the time, told NBC News that, \u201cOut of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point.

DONALD TRUMP'S FEUD WITH MCCAIN FAMILY ESCALATES: 'I WAS NEVER A FAN' When he died, Palin posted a pair of tweets touting McCain and his record. \u201cToday we lost an American original,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSen.

I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Meanwhile, McCain also reportedly requested that President Trump not attend his funeral, and instead, send Vice President Pence. Last month, Trump tore into McCain\u2019s legacy\u00a0and took credit for the late senator\u2019s state funeral in Washington last year. \u201cI endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted, which as president of the United States I had to approve,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d He added: \u201cI never liked him much. I really probably never will.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain drew a rebuke from Republicans, who defended the late senator and his accomplishments.

LARGE ALASKA EARTHQUAKE JOLTS RESIDENTS, SHAKES BUILDINGS The U.S. Geological Survey said the first and more powerful quake was centered about seven miles\u00a0north of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. Cracks could be seen in a two-story downtown Anchorage building. It was unclear whether there were injuries. Photographs posted to social media sites showed damage that included collapsed ceiling tiles at an Anchorage high school and buckled roads.

Court papers appear to show that Todd Palin filed for divorce Friday from his wife - and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee \u2013 Sarah Palin in the Anchorage Superior Court with the Anchorage Daily News reporting the reason being\u00a0\u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife.\u201d MATT LAUER AND ANNETTE ROQUE OFFICIALLY DIVORCED The news of the divorce\u00a0was first reported by Alaska blogger Craig Medred, who noticed that the court filing records only indicated a certain TMP was seeking a divorce from a certain SLP. The former governor\u2019s full name is Sarah Louise Palin, while her husband\u2019s name is Todd Mitchell Palin. The birthdays of the plaintiff and defendant in the court filing also align with those of Todd and Sarah Palin. The couple is reportedly seeking joint custody of their 11-year-old son,Trig, while their other four children \u2014 Bristol, Willow, Piper and Track \u2014 are all adults. The Palins, who surged to national prominence when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., selected the Alaska governor as his running mate in the 2008 presidential election against Barack Obama and Joe Biden, have faced rumors of a\u00a0strained relationship. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rumors of a divorce once again began to swirl when Todd failed to show up alongside Sarah last month during an appearance at the famed Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota. Sarah Palin said that her husband \u2013 a well-known motorsport enthusiast and Irondog snowmachine race winner \u2013 was flying around Alaska, according to reports. Since resigning as governor in 2009 amid controversies and ethics investigations, Palin has largely remained out of state politics,\u00a0but has become a prominent figure in conservative politics \u2013 penning a number of books and making frequent appearance on television and during speaking engagements.",
