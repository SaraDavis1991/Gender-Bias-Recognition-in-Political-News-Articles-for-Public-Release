 Most Republicans are quite conservative. But if they split their votes between three or even four other candidates, Trump can use his minority share of the party plus the many Democrats who support him for leveraged buyout of the GOP. 

 This is where the lack of a functional establishment or party hierarchy is really damaging the GOP. There is no check on candidates like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie and no seeming way to divert them from their course. In a world of billionaire PAC men, there are no more power brokers to force rational action.

History.com: “In Russia, the revolution of 1905 begins when czarist troops open fire on a peaceful group of workers marching to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to petition their grievances to Czar Nicholas II. Some 500 protestors were massacred on ‘Bloody Sunday,’ setting off months of protest and disorder throughout Russia. By January 1905, discontent with the czar’s regime permeated nearly all classes in Russia, especially after the crushing January 2 defeat of the Russian navy at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War. In October 1905, Nicholas, embattled on all sides, was forced to grant basic civil liberties and a representative national body, which would be elected by narrowly limited suffrage. However, this Parliament, known as the Duma, was dissolved after it opposed Nicholas’ authority, and the remnants of the revolutionary movement were brutally suppressed by czarist troops. A decade later, czarist Russia was bogged down in the mire of World War I, prompting the Bolshevik-led Russian Revolution of 1917, which crushed the czar’s opposition and proclaimed Russia the world’s first Marxist state.”

Wilton (Conn.) Bulletin: “A large group of emergency responders … conducted a missing-person search Tuesday evening, Jan. 19, only to find out later that the distress signal they were told about was actually the GPS beacon of a high-end watch. Headquartered in Wilton, Breitling USA is an international supplier of technical watches and chronographs. According to Lt. Stephen Brennan of the Wilton Police Department, it was a watch in the company’s 206 Danbury Road location that emitted the signal. … Four Wilton police cruisers and three Wilton fire department units were dispatched, along with 23 CERT members. An additional nine firefighters were called, among them the Wilton Fire Dive, who deployed their boat to search the reservoir. The New Canaan Police Department aided with seven police, including its K-9 unit. A New Canaan fire unit also responded.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“I think we’re getting to a moment where there’s a scenario that one can see. Which is, you get Bob Dole, who represents the old establishment, if you like, essentially choosing Trump over Cruz. Now, if Cruz loses Iowa, Trump wins convincingly, I think all he will need at that point is to have a single current establishment figure. Meaning a sitting governor or a sitting Senator endorse him.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”","null"
