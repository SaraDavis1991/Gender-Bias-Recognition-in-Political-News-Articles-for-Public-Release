      "content": "President Donald Trump is donating his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Trump chose to give the department $100,000. His first-quarter salary donation went to the Department of Interior. \"It's that time again, as many of you have probably noticed, for us to announce where the president will be donating his quarterly salary,\" Sanders said Wednesday during the daily White House press briefing. \"This quarter the president will be donating his salary to the Department of Education.\" Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says the donation is being used to pay for a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) camp sponsored by the department. As a candidate, Trump had promised not to take a salary if elected. But by law he must be paid, so he is donating the money. Taxpayers can write off such donations, potentially lowering their income taxes. DeVos says she is grateful for the donation. \"The president is committed to our nation\u2019s students, and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a high-quality education,\" she said after receiving the check from Sanders during the briefing. The Trump administration has also proposed a 13 percent cut to the Education Department's budget, slashing it by $9.2 billion. The Associated Press contributed to this story.",

      "content": " Two years into the Trump administration, aggrieved activists are not only accosting Cabinet members or driving them out of restaurants -- they're increasingly taking out their frustration on inanimate objects. A burst of anti-Trump vandalism against possessions and property associated with administration officials is the latest flare-up in a \u201cresistance\u201d that has taken many forms. Last year, protesters marked the anniversary of President Trump's election by screaming at the sky. Lately, the tactics have become more confrontational, touching off a national debate over civility in politics. But smashing and spray-painting are yet another outlet. Here are some of the items that have been the focus of anti-Trump activists\u2019 rage. Trump\u2019s Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Trump\u2019s star on the Walk of Fame has been subjected to repeat acts of vandalism, with one protester going so far as to smash it with a pick ax\u00a0last month. Brawls have since broken out at the spot after crowds of Trump supporters and protesters gathered near the contentious marker. But this isn\u2019t the first time the star has been under assault. Back in 2016, before Trump was elected, the star was defaced by a vandal who scratched off his name and a TV icon. The vandal told TMZ he was doing it so that the removed parts could be auctioned for the legal defense of Trump accusers. Earlier that year, the star was defaced in February of 2016 when someone spray-painted it with a swastika. Betsy DeVos\u2019 Yacht A $40 million boat owned by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was untied from its Ohio dock last week, causing it to drift into a dock and incur up to $10,000 in damages. The vessel, named the Seaquest, ended up with large scratches before the crew was able to get control of it. DeVos is unlikely to be too troubled by the damage -- the Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family. Ben Carson\u2019s House Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a Facebook post last August that his home in Virginia, along with his neighbor\u2019s house, was vandalized by anti-Trump types who \u201cwrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump.\u201d \u201cWe were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned,\u201d Carson said. Trump Golf Courses Of all the officials in the Trump administration, President Trump will always be the main villain in the eyes of his opponents. This, in turn, makes his properties a prime target. The Trump International Golf Course near his Florida estate was hit by splotches of red paint in April, obscuring some of the letters on the sign at the entrance of the club in \u00a0West Palm Beach. In October, a Hawaii man reportedly was charged with criminal mischief for defacing four golf courses owned by the Trump Organization, by allegedly carving messages into the greens. Trump International Hotel In October 2016, Trump's hotel in downtown Washington D.C. was vandalized with the phrases \"black lives matter\" and \"no justice, no peace.\" In May 2017, the same hotel briefly had messages in light projected onto the hotel, including one that said \"Pay Trump Bribes Here.\" Another read \"emoluments welcome,\" in reference to the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged financial conflicts. Trump Paraphernalia Make America Great Again? Well, don't declare it too loudly, as there have been multiple reports of Trump supporters being accosted for wearing a MAGA cap, or other signs of Trump support. Just this week, a woman in Massachusetts was taken into custody after allegedly deliberately ramming into a car sporting a Trump bumper sticker. \u201cShe said, \u2018You voted for Trump?\u2019\u201d the man she hit recalled her saying. \u201cI said yes. She called me a racist and several other names.\u201d\u00a0The man then claimed that the woman repositioned her vehicle and hit his car with hers, the Cape Cod Times said, citing the police report. After this, the woman reportedly left the scene. Fox News\u2019 Morgan Evans, Frank Miles and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " The viral clip of conservative commentator Candace Owens accusing Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., of distorting her comments in such fashion that he must \u201cbelieve black people are stupid\u201d has become the most-viewed C-SPAN Twitter video from a House hearing. The Twitter video of the exchange so far accumulated nearly 6.8\u00a0million\u00a0views and appears to be on track to be most watched C-SPAN clip from a House hearing on all platforms. CANDACE OWENS EXPLODES AT TED LIEU MID-HEARING AFTER HE PLAYS SHORT CLIP OF HER HITLER COMMENTS \u201cIn less than 24 hours, this video is the most watched C-SPAN Twitter video from a House hearing (4.47 million views),\u201d tweeted Jeremy Art, C-SPAN\u2019s social media senior specialist, before the video got another 2.3 million views. He added that it\u2019s not yet the most watched C-SPAN video from a House hearing ever as it still lacks a couple of millions views \u2013 5 million at the time of the tweet, though the gap has been cut in half since \u2013 to be on par with a video from a House hearing in 2017 in which Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was criticized for not being able to \u201ccome up with one example of discrimination that you would stand up for students.\u201d In the explosive video, Lieu fired the first shot at Owens by playing a short audio recording of her previous remarks at a conference in December, which were widely circulated in February, where she argued that she doesn\u2019t have a problem with \u201cnationalism.\u201d \u201cI think the definition gets poisoned by elites that want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want.\u00a0 When we say \u2018nationalism,\u2019 the first thing people think about \u2014 at least in America \u2014 is Hitler,\u201d she is heard saying. \u201cYou know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK then, fine. The problem is, he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everyone to be German. ...\u201d CANDACE OWENS: HEARING WAS A HOAX, DEMOCRATS WANT AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO FAIL Owens fired back at Lieu, accusing him of intentionally misrepresenting her views to drive a false narrative. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHe is assuming that black people will not go and pursue the full two-hour clip. He purposefully cut off -- and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me. He's trying to present as if I was launching a defense of Hitler in Germany, when in fact the question that was presented to me was pertaining to whether I believed in nationalism, and that nationalism was bad,\u201d she continued.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Education Department said Monday that it has opened an investigation into how Michigan State University handled allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Larry Nassar, a longtime employee who has been sentenced to decades in prison for molesting young athletes and possessing child pornography. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said investigators will look at \"systemic issues\" with how the school has dealt with such complaints. In a statement, she called Nassar's actions \"unimaginable.\" She added, \"The bravery shown by the survivors has been remarkable.\" DeVos, who is from western Michigan, said she appreciates that the university's acting president, John Engler, has ordered the school to cooperate fully with the investigation. The Education Department was already reviewing separate complaints about the school's compliance with Title IX, the law that requires schools to prevent and respond to reports of sexual violence, and compliance with requirements about providing campus crime and security information. The Michigan Attorney General's office also is investigating Michigan State's handling of Nassar, who was a campus sports doctor. Later Thursday, some of Nassar's victims will join Michigan lawmakers in announcing new bills in the wake of the scandal. One measure would add college employees and youth sports coaches, trainers and volunteers to Michigan's list of people who must report suspected abuse or neglect to child protective services. Other proposals would eliminate certain time limits for victims of childhood sexual abuse to sue, lift the statute of limitations for prosecutors to file charges in certain cases of criminal sexual misconduct, and eliminate governmental immunity for people and entities that allow sexual assaults to occur.",

      "content": "  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal\u00a0investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin. In a statement, the committee said it had \u201cidentified at least six categories of materially false statements\u201d\u00a0Prince made about the meeting with\u00a0Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017. In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u201cstrongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,\u201d\u00a0which Schiff argued\u00a0\u201chindered the Committee\u2019s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.\u201d SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE' \u201cI do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,\u201d Schiff told The Washington Post\u2019s\u00a0Bob Costa during a panel event earlier\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cThe evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.\u201d Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time. \u201cWe know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday. \u201cWe know there were communications after he returned.\u201d Schiff added that Prince had \u201cdiscussions\u201d with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and \u201ccommunications\u201d after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report. SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS \u201cSomehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIn very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there\u2019s a prosecutable case.\u201d Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he \u201crefused to answer almost all of our questions.\u201d \u201cHe said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,\u201d Schiff said. Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince\u2019s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on any others.\u201d Schiff\u2019s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff\u2019s panel is currently investigating the president\u2019s finances. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Recipients included novelist James Patterson, actor Jon Voight, and the musicians of the U.S. military, among others. \u201cThese are the highest honors available for contributions to American art and culture,\u201d the president stated. Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were in the audience for\u00a0the ceremony. Trump began by honoring actor\u00a0Voight, whom he called a \u201cgreat friend\u201d and \u201cone of America\u2019s greatest living legends.\u201d Trump called Voight\u2019s movie \u201cThe Champ\u201d \u201cthe greatest boxing movie of all time.\u201d \u201cEveryone was crying at the end of the movie but I tried not to, John,\u201d Trump added. Voight has starred in dozens of feature films since the late 1960s, when he rose to prominence for his Oscar-nominated role in \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d Voight, the father of actors Angelina Jolie and James Haven, is also known for his roles in \u201cComing Home,\u201d \u201cHeat,\u201d \u201cThe Rainmaker,\u201d and \u201cAli.\u201d More recently, he was seen in the \u201cNational Treasure\u201d series, \u201cZoolander,\u201d and \u201cFour Christmases,\u201d among others. Voight was an outspoken liberal in his early career, protesting the Vietnam War alongside actress Jane Fonda. However, he endorsed both Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012 and President Trump in 2016. He spoke at an inauguration rally for Trump in January 2017. \u201cWe love having you here, especially since it happens to be somebody that I really like,\u201d said Trump. Trump then presented a medal to Sharon Rockefeller. Sharon\u00a0Percy Rockefeller was the wife of former West Virginia Sen.\u00a0Jay Rockefeller, but her philanthropic work and public advocacy are what earned her the medal. As first lady of West Virginia, Rockefeller worked on behalf of the state\u2019s schoolchildren, among other causes. Rockefeller promoted the Public Broadcasting Service\u00a0and served as the CEO and president of WETA, D.C.\u2019s flagship public television and radio stations. She chairs the Board of Trustees for the National Gallery of Art. She also serves on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, Sibley Memorial Hospital and the Rockefeller Foundation. Next, Trump presented a medal to author Patterson, whom he called a personal friend and \u201cone of the most prolific and talented fiction authors of all time.\u201d Patterson has written 277 books and sold over 400 million copies. \u201cYou\u2019ve sold a lot more books than me. More than anyone except maybe one --\u00a0the Bible has you by a little bit,\u201d said Trump. PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESENTS MEDAL OF HONOR TO GREEN BERET FOR 2008 AFGHANISTAN HEROICS Among Patterson\u2019s works are \u201cRed Alert,\u201d \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d \u201cThe President is Missing\u201d which he co-wrote with former President Bill Clinton, and \u201cFilthy Rich,\u201d a story of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, published in 2016, years before the shocking 2019 revelations that led to his arrest and subsequent apparent suicide. Of Patterson\u2019s works, 218 titles have earned a spot on The New York Times bestseller list, and 95 have ranked No. 1. Trump then turned to Allison Krauss. Krauss is an American bluegrass-country singer. She\u2019s won 27 Grammy awards and 42 nominations, earning more Grammy awards than any other woman. She\u2019s known for hits such as \u201cEvery Time You Say Goodbye,\u201d \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You,\u201d \u201cWhiskey Lullaby\u201d and \"When You Say Nothing at All.\u201d TRUMP PRESENTS MEDAL OF HONOR TO FORMER ARMY STAFF SERGEANT WHO RESCUED ENTIRE SQUAD IN IRAQ The president then honored Patrick O\u2019Connell as \u201cone of the greatest chefs of our time.\u201d O\u2019Connell opened The Inn at Little Washington, which Trump said he and the first lady planned to visit. Also honored was the Claremont Institute for informing Americans how America\u2019s founding principles \u201cmade this nation the greatest of anywhere on earth.\u201d He then honored Teresa Lozano Long for her support of the arts. Together with her husband, Long has donated over $130 million to universities and institutions in Texas.

      "content": " In back-to-back speeches from the Senate floor, a pair of Republican senators on Wednesday broke rank and said they\u2019d oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education secretary. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski are the first Republicans to come out against one of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. \u201cI was trying to get to yes, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Murkowski said. Collins called DeVos \u201ca product of her experience.\u201d \u201cShe appears to view education through the lens of her experience promoting alternatives to public school education in Detroit and other cities,\u201d Collins said. Despite the Republican pushback, White House press secretary Sean Spicer expressed confidence - \u201c100 percent\u201d - that DeVos\u00a0 would be confirmed and added she was \u201cunbelievably qualified\u201d for the post. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office told Fox News that they aren\u2019t worried about her confirmation. If all of the other GOP senators support DeVos- as expected - and all Democrats oppose the nomination, DeVos would end up with a 50-50 vote in the Senate. If that happens, it would be up to Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie. DeVos, a billionaire charter school advocate, has emerged as a polarizing figure. The wealthy Republican donor has been denounced by Democrats \u2013 and now two Republicans - who have slammed her credentials. DeVos has never worked in the public school system nor has she sent her children to public school. Controversy surrounding DeVos increased Monday after she was accused of lifting several sentences or phrases from sources \u2013 including one from a top Obama administration civil rights official - without attribution in her written responses to questions from lawmakers on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. On Tuesday, the Senate committee voted along party lines to send her confirmation to the full Senate for final approval. A full Senate vote could come early next week.",

      "content": "Betsy DeVos cleared a major hurdle in the Senate Friday in her bid to become the next Education secretary \u2013 but likely will need Vice President Pence\u2019s help getting over the finish line next week. The billionaire Republican donor and school choice activist has emerged as one of President Trump\u2019s most controversial Cabinet nominees, with two Republican senators having announced they will join Democrats in opposition on the final vote. Both those senators \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 went along with advancing her nomination early Friday morning by voting to end debate. The 52-48 vote was along party lines. But multiple Senate sources tell Fox News they expect the final confirmation vote, coming as early as Monday, to split 50-50 \u2013 with Collins, Murkowski and all 48 Democratic senators voting against DeVos. This would put the pressure on Pence to cast a historic tie-breaking vote. DeVos supporters indeed are expecting Pence to do so, giving the nominee the necessary 51 votes to win confirmation. If he does, it would mark the first time in history a vice president has voted to break a tie to confirm a Cabinet officer. The procedural gymnastics come as the Trump Cabinet confirmation process gets increasingly tied up in a complex partisan battle, related not only to the nominees themselves but some of Trump\u2019s more controversial executive actions and simmering resentment over the way Republicans treated nominees under the Obama administration. DeVos, though, has come under fierce criticism from labor unions, who accuse her of seeking to dismantle public education, given her history promoting charter schools. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York calls her \"one of the worst nominees.\" \"Ms. Devos does not deserve to be secretary of education,\" he said. At Tuesday\u2019s Senate education committee meeting on the nomination, Republican Chairman Lamar Alexander chided his Democratic colleagues. \u201cI believe their concerns are misplaced,\u201d he said, arguing DeVos\u2019 stance on the role of the federal government in local school systems aligns with what an overwhelming majority of senators voted for in replacing the controversial No Child Left Behind law in 2015.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos watched a transgender girl eat apple sauce and draw and listened to another student's emotional story of feeling marginalized at school, as activists pressed DeVos to make good on her promise to protect all students. Parents and activists who met with DeVos on Wednesday said they thought she was moved by their stories, but they still left with little hope that she would be a strong advocate for transgender children. The meeting at the Education Department came two weeks after the Trump administration rescinded Obama-era guidance that instructed schools to let students use bathrooms in line with their stated gender identity, not their assigned gender at birth. The decision was strongly condemned by civil rights groups, who said that it would harm already highly vulnerable students, but it was applauded by conservatives, who said the guidelines violated the safety and privacy of all other students. Attending the meeting were Ellie Ford, a 5-year-old transgender girl, and high school student Grace Dolan-Sandrino, who told DeVos the middle school she attended did not let her use the girls' bathroom \u2014 as the Obama guidance was not in place then. SUPREME COURT RETURNS CASE ON TRANSGENDER BATHROOM ACCESS TO LOWER COURT DeVos would not commit to any specific actions to help protect students like Grace and Ellie, the parents said. One parent at the meeting said she had lost a transgender child to suicide. Grace's mother, Karen Dolan, said of the education secretary: \"She sat there and listened to our stories through our tears and at times she seemed to appear visibly moved, but she didn't react.\" DeVos agreed that there were \"thousands and thousands\" of transgender students across the country and that children are born that way, according to Dolan, who lives in Washington's Maryland suburbs. \"There is one thing between increasing your understanding and having your heart moved for an hour and then out of her position of power either acting to protect transgender and gender nonconforming children or acting in a way that will make their lives worse,\" Dolan added. \"I haven't seen any concrete action that would give me any reason to be hopeful.\" Grace, 16, who now goes to an inclusive high school where she can use the girls' bathroom, said that she told DeVos that her decision to scrap the guidance was \"an extremely cruel thing to do.\" She said that being in an unwelcoming environment dramatically increases a transgender child's chances of developing depression or committing suicide. \"It is not fair for them to grow up with their human rights being denied,\" Grace said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"This is beyond bathrooms; this is about our right as transgender people, as humans to exist, to simply exist.\" Vanessa Ford, Ellie's mother and a resident of the District of Columbia, said that the Education Department already has an existing document, published on its website, that outlines best practices that some schools have used with regard to transgender students. She urged DeVos to promote the document publicly and urge schools to use it. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that she was grateful to DeVos for devoting two hours of her time to the meeting. \"I think decision makers should meet the people they are deciding about.\" At the same time Keisling said rescinding the bathroom guidance was \"extremely harmful\" and urged DeVos to take steps to undo the harm and increase protections for transgender children. DeVos said she was glad to meet with transgender families and hopes to continue the dialogue. \"Every school and every school leader has a moral responsibility to protect all students and ensure every child is respected and can learn in an accepting environment,\" DeVos said in a statement. \"I remain committed to advocating for and fighting on behalf of all students.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Just in time for Thanksgiving, President-elect Donald Trump continued stocking his cabinet on Wednesday, naming two new nominees as his one-time rival Dr. Ben Carson said he is still \"thinking about\" options to serve in the new administration. In an exclusive interview on \"The Kelly File,\" Carson, who is rumored to head the department of Housing and Urban Development, said \"the offer was on the table,\" but that news should come out \"in the next few days.\" \"There are a lot of things that were put on the table, and I am thinking about them,\" Carson said, referring to if he plans to serve in a role in or outside the government. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump announced the choices of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. All three cabinet positions require Senate confirmation before they become official. The retired pediatric neurosurgeon, who had previously been rumored to be a contender for a job heading Veteran\u2019s Affairs, Education or Health and Human Services, could appear at first glance as an odd choice for HUD. However, Carson wrote and spoke about the department and issues affected by its actions numerous times during his time as a primary candidate, and he also addressed some of what may soon face him in a Wednesday Facebook post that hinted at a HUD job offer from Trump. \u201cAfter serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\u201d Carson wrote. \u201cWe have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid. An announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.\u201d On Tuesday, Carson told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d that the HUD position was \"one of the offers [from Trump] that is on the table.\" \"Our inner cities are in terrible shape,\" Carson said. \"And they definitely need some real attention. There have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine.\" Minutes after Carson left a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower Tuesday, the billionaire mogul tweeted: \u201cI am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I\u2019ve gotten to know him well\u2014he\u2019s a greatly talented person who loves people!\u201d Carson ran against Trump during the Republican primary battle. But after he dropped out of the White House race in March, the subdued doctor quickly endorsed the boisterous businessman and became one of Trump\u2019s most visible surrogates. The path to a secretary nomination was far different for Haley, who often critiqued Trump during the campaign, though she eventually \u2013 and somewhat begrudgingly \u2013 said she would vote for him for president. \"This is no longer a choice for me on personalities because I\u2019m not a fan of either one,\" Haley said in October. \"What it is about is policy.\" Born in South Carolina and of Indian descent, Haley is the third Asian-American to serve as U.S. governor. She drew praise for her handling of the aftermath of a racially-charged mass shooting at a black Charleston church and also presided over the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state house grounds. Haley was beginning to earn buzz as a possible vice presidential pick in January when she delivered the Republican response to President Obama's final State of the Union address. Parts of her speech, however, were viewed as a rebuke not only of Obama, but also of Trump. But her past criticism \u2013 and support of Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz \u2013 were apparently set to the side during a Thursday meeting with Trump. A Trump spokesperson said Wednesday that Trump and Haley had \"natural chemistry\" and her selection as UN ambassador was an easy choice. DeVos, from Michigan, is a longtime advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. She currently leads the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, and sits on the board of the Jeb Bush-led Foundation for Excellence in Education. Bush, another fierce critic of Trump prior to the election, praised the decision to choose DeVos. \u201cThe status quo in education is not acceptable,\" DeVos said in a Wednesday statement. The DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, especially as donors to GOP candidates and the Republican Party. DeVos' husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former president of the company. The couple gave $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington in 2010, at the time the largest private donation in the center's history. Hours before the DeVos pick was announced, conservative policy leader Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, called her \"an establishment, pro-Common Core secretary of education.\" Asked about DeVos' support for the Common Core standards, Trump spokesman Jason Miller noted that \"the president-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core.\" \"Anybody joining the administration is signing on to the president-elect's platform and vision for moving America forward,\" Miller said.",

      "content": " Liberal groups are calling on senators who got contributions from President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump's education secretary pick to recuse themselves from voting on her confirmation \u2013 drawing accusations of hypocrisy from Republicans who note Democrats never recused themselves in similar situations. In a letter\u00a0to 21 Republican senators, to whom nominee Betsy DeVos has given almost $1 million in campaign donations, Generation Progress and other left-wing groups called for them to recuse themselves \u201cor risk imperiling the legitimacy of DeVos\u2019 confirmation.\u201d DeVos, a strong advocate for school choice, has her Senate confirmation hearing scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cIn addition to these individual campaign contributions, DeVos and her family contributed $2.25 million during the fall campaign to the Senate Leadership Fund, and have also given $900,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That comes out to a $4 million bid to influence you,\u201d the letter says. Generation Progress is an arm of the Center for American Progress. But Republicans are pushing back, arguing that previous Obama Cabinet picks had donated to Democratic politicians and causes, and Democrats cast confirmation votes anyway. Penny Pritzker, Obama\u2019s now-Commerce secretary, was a bundler for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election bid, collecting more than $1 million in campaign donations. The Wall Street Journal reported she also raised more than $250,000 for him in 2008, when she served as finance chair of his campaign. Pritzker had also donated roughly $20,000 to at least 20 of the 51 Democrats who voted on her confirmation on June 25, 2013. In 2009, she also made a $28,340 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, according to\u00a0Open Secrets. Sally Jewell, Obama\u2019s now-Interior secretary, had also donated to a number of Democratic senators who voted on her 2013 confirmation, including $4,250 to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \u2013 who introduced her nomination. Republicans denounced what they saw as a \u201cshameless\u201d double-standard. \"The hypocrisy of Democrats and their liberal allies is truly shameless. Where was their outrage when Democrats voted for Obama cabinet nominees who donated to his and their campaigns?\" Raj Shah, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, told FoxNews.com. While the amounts donated by Pritzker and Jewell don\u2019t hit the same numbers as DeVos\u2019 donations, her supporters describe the situations as similar. \u201cIf you accept the faulty premise that political contributions create a conflict of interest, then any amount is problematic,\u201d Ed Patru, spokesman for Friends of Betsy DeVos, told\u00a0The Washington Post. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a single Democrat, citing conflicts of interest, recusing themselves from a vote on billionaires like Penny Pritzker.\u201d",

      "author": "Kaitlyn Schallhorn",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos unveiled the long-awaited overhaul to the guidance for how schools handle complaints of sexual misconduct, adding more protections for those who have been accused of assault and harassment. The proposed Title IX changes would limit the definition of sexual harassment and allow for the cross-examination of the accused by the accuser\u2019s defense team. The proposal also seeks to \u201cclarify that in responding to any claim of sex discrimination under Title IX, recipients are not required to deprive an individual of rights that would be otherwise guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution; prohibit the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) from requiring a recipient to pay money damages as a remedy for a violation of any Title IX regulation; and eliminate the requirement that religious institutions submit a written statement to qualify for the Title IX religious exemption.\" While conservatives have heralded the changes, victims\u2019 rights advocacy groups have slammed the proposed regulations. \u201cDeVos is making plain with these unlawful rules that she is turning her back on survivors. The results of this rule are clear: Fewer will report their assaults and harassment. Schools will be more dangerous. And, more survivors will be denied their legal right to equal access to education after experiencing sexual violence,\u201d Jess Davidson, the interim director of End Rape on Campus, said in a statement. The Democratic National Committee accused the Trump administration of delivering \u201cone devastating blow after another to women and victims of sexual misconduct.\u201d But DeVos, one of the more controversial figures in President Trump\u2019s Cabinet, said her focus is \u201con ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment.\u201d \u201cEvery survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas.\u201d Last year, DeVos rescinded a set of 2011 rules created during the Obama administration that guided schools on how to handle complaints. Advocates for accused students said those regulations tipped the scales in favor of accusers, and some college leaders complained the rules were too complex and could be overly burdensome. The Title IX law, enacted in 1972, forbids discrimination based on sex in education. It was once seen as a measure to ensure equity in college sports, but President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights issued several letters in 2011 directing college administrations on how to tackle the nation\u2019s ongoing campus rape epidemic \u2013 and prove on paper they were doing so \u2013 or risk losing federal funding. Since then, many colleges saw an uptick in lawsuits alleging mishandling of assault complaints. According to RAINN, the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization, 11.2 percent of college students experience rape or sexual assault. Read on for a look at what could change with DeVos\u2019 new plan. The proposed changes narrow the definition of what exactly constitutes sexual harassment. DEVOS TO ROLL BACK OBAMA-ERA TITLE IX REGULATIONS DEEMED UNFAIR TO THE 'ACCUSED' Under the new regulations, it would be defined as: \u201cunwelcome sexual conduct; or unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d For sexual assault cases in higher education, the accuser has the right to cross-examine the accused and witnesses through an \u201cadvisor\u201d or attorney during a live hearing, according to the proposal. During the cross-examination, questions about either party\u2019s sexual history cannot be asked, in line with rape shield protections which guards victims against \u201cinvasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and stereotyping,\u201d according to the proposal. Either party may also request to be separated, placed different rooms, with a video feed for the live hearing. DEVOS CONSIDERING ALLOWING STATES TO USE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BUY GUNS: REPORT \u201cThe proposed regulations thereby provide the benefits of cross-examination while avoiding any unnecessary trauma that could arise from personal confrontation between the complainant and the respondent,\u201d the proposal states. For elementary and secondary schools, cross-examination is allowed but not required due to the young ages of those involved. The plan would only hold schools responsible for investigating complaints if the incident occurred on campus or another area overseen by the school and only if they are reported to certain campus officials with the authority to take action. However, it does allow for schools to offer support services or intervene with a student conduct proceeding if a reported incident happened outside of that scope. The Education Department would also adopt the policy that a school \u201cacts with deliberate indifference only when it responds to sexual harassment in a manner that is \u2018clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\u2019\u201d The proposal requires schools to provide free \u201csupportive measures\u201d to the accused or accuser \u2013 even if a formal complaint hasn\u2019t been filed. These services, which are meant to be confidential, include counseling, changes to class or work schedules, extensions on deadlines, campus escort services, changes to housing, leave of absence or increased security. US COLLEGES REFUSE TO EASE SEX ASSAULT RULES DESPITE SLEW OF LAWSUITS FILED BY ACCUSED A school will be \u201cgiven a safe harbor from finding of deliberate indifference\u201d by the Education Department if it offers one of those services to someone after a formal complaint, the proposal said. The proposal would ensure schools establish a \u201cpresumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process.\u201d Under the Obama administration's guidance, schools were told to use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, meaning an allegation \u201cis more likely than not\u201d true. Under the proposal, schools would adopt a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard, meaning the claim is highly probable. Fox News' Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Teachers unions, advocacy groups and others are jamming Senate phone lines, funding TV ads and rallying on the ground to stop Betsy DeVos from becoming President Trump\u2019s secretary of Education. But their efforts, at least for now, appear to be coming up one vote short. With her final Senate confirmation vote set for Tuesday at noon, the chamber still seems locked in a 50-50 split on the nomination. If that happens, Vice President Pence is expected to cast a historic, tie-breaking vote to confirm her. This scenario has DeVos' critics going into overdrive in a bid to peel off one more Republican to vote nay. \u201cWe are trying to do everything we can to persuade just one more Republican to join us,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Monday. \u201cDouble down on your advocacy. \u2026 She\u2019s spent her career trying to destroy public schools.\u201d The Democrats' appeals come after GOP Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, announced their opposition last week to DeVos, the school choice advocate and wealthy Michigan political donor. Presuming all 48 Democratic senators oppose DeVos, this brings the tally to 50-50. Several of the major groups rallying against DeVos, including the American Federation of Teachers union, declined on Monday to name which of the remaining Republican senators they are targeting. Senate Democrats acknowledged the challenge ahead, as they took the floor Monday planning an all-night session of speeches railing against her nomination. While teachers unions and others say DeVos\u2019 support for voucher programs and other school-choice efforts will hurt public education, backers say her plans will provide more opportunities to families and an alternative to public schools, which in some parts of the country are showing little progress improving student proficiency in core subjects. Pence, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" predicted victory for their nominee. \"We are very confident that Betsy DeVos is going to be the secretary of Education,\" he said. \"It would be my high honor to cast the deciding tie-breaking vote on the floor of the Senate.\" Among the names mentioned early as potential targets to flip were GOP Sens. Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania; Deb Fischer, Nebraska; and Rand Paul, Kentucky. All of them, however, have publicly backed DeVos. \u201cIf you are a Republican senator who is going to vote against DeVos, you would have needed to make that clear well in advance,\u201d David Payne, a Republican strategist and partner at Vox Global, said Monday. \u201cNo way would somebody do that on the Senate floor. That would be a massive embarrassment. Not going to happen.\u201d Among the other major groups trying to fight the nomination are End Citizens United and Every Voice, whose strategy is largely focused on trying to get senators who have received DeVos campaign donations to recuse themselves from voting. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cast a wide net with our work to pressure senators with donations from the DeVos family \u2026 to avoid any conflicts of interest,\u201d Laura Friedenbach told Fox News on Monday. To be sure, members of Congress have reported a high volume of calls since Trump, a Republican, was elected in November. \u201cWe are seeing a heavier-than-normal amount of constituent calls,\u201d Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark told Fox News on Monday. However, Clark, like other Capitol Hill aides, have made clear that the calls are for a variety of constituent concerns, including the future of ObamaCare and Cabinet nominations beyond DeVos, and that many are from out-of-state voters. Clark also said \u201can extremely high volume\u201d of calls have come from out of state. Friedenbach also made clear that Every Voice\u2019s efforts to expose money in politics and the critique of DeVos will continue even if she becomes Education secretary. \u201cThe after-effects of the widespread public backlash to her nomination will linger,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are tired of a government that works best for the wealthiest among us. \u2026 Rewarding a big donor with a Cabinet position will only add fuel to the fire.\u201d American Federation of Teachers President\u00a0Randi Weingarten said Monday: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a massive wave of opposition to Betsy DeVos. ... We\u2019ve never seen someone tapped for this job who is so ill informed \u2026 and who would give such preferential treatment to for-profit schools, vouchers and other strategies that actively drain funding from public schools.\u201d",

Vice President Mike Pence is expected to cast the deciding vote in his role as president of the Senate. But critics like Lawson\u00a0have gone into overdrive in a bid to convince just one more senator to oppose the school choice advocate.

Schumer\u2019s warning paled in comparison to some of the vitriol aimed at DeVos from the media. \u201cBetsy DeVos is the worst person to be around schoolbooks since Lee Harvey Oswald,\u201d Bill Maher snarked on his \u201cReal Time\u201d show. The New Republic urged readers not to \u201cnormalize Betsy Devos. Her views are simply much too dangerous.\u201d Actor-vist Mark Ruffalo appealed to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Twitter to be the third Republican \u201cno\u201d vote needed to defeat DeVos. \u201cCome on Marco, know where you stand and actually STAND there! You got kids. They have friends. You know better,\u201d he wrote. The United Federation of Teachers called DeVos a \u201cdanger to special education,\u201d while disabilities writer Elizabeth Picciuto wrote a piece for The Daily Beast saying she has \u201ca special-needs son and Betsy DeVos scares me to death.\u201d Comedian John Fugelsang compared DeVos\u2019 nomination to the Syrian refugee crisis. \u201cRefugees vetted 2 yrs before allowed to reunite w/families. Betsy Devos vetted 5 mins per Senator before allowed to run America\u2019s schools,\u201d Fugelsang wrote on Twitter. \u201cWestworld\u201d and James Bond actor Jeffrey Wright has frequently blasted DeVos, including one tweet that implied Chief of Staff Reince Priebus only cared about the money DeVos has contributed to Republican political candidates. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, suggested her confirmation could threaten the \u201cexistence of public education.\u201d On Tuesday morning, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway voiced confidence in DeVos' confirmation and defended her views on public school alternatives. \"[Democrats are] trying to humiliate and embarrass some of these nominees,\" Conway told Fox News, saying DeVos is committed to education. DeVos herself has not engaged the online critics. Her most recent tweet came on Jan. 31: \u201cIf confirmed, I look forward to fighting for quality education for all students.\u201d",

      "content": "School choice advocate Betsy DeVos was narrowly confirmed Tuesday as the next education secretary despite deep opposition from teachers unions and other groups, after Vice President Pence intervened to cast a historic tie-breaking vote. Pence\u2019s vote marked the first time in American history a vice president has broken a tie on a Cabinet nominee\u2019s Senate confirmation \u2013 and the first tie-breaking vote by a VP since 2008. Pence was compelled to cast the vote after two Republican senators \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 joined all 48 Senate Democrats in opposing DeVos. \u201cThe Senate being equally divided, the vice president votes in the affirmative and the nomination is confirmed,\u201d Pence said, stepping into his role as president of the Senate in a brief appearance on Capitol Hill. With his support, DeVos was confirmed on a 51-50 vote. Devos was sworn in later by Pence in a ceremony at the vice president's ceremonial office, which he called \"the easiest vote I ever cast.\" The confirmation of the wealthy GOP donor will mark a sharp change in philosophy at the helm of federal education policy, given DeVos\u2019 history boosting alternatives to public education. \u201cShe\u2019s led the most effective school reform movement of the last 30 years,\u201d Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said moments earlier on the floor, shoring up DeVos' Republican support. Democrats mounted an all-night speaking marathon railing against her nomination in the run-up to the vote, questioning her experience and ties to charter schools though their opposition combined with lobbying efforts by teachers unions were not enough to block her. \"Mrs. DeVos demonstrated a complete lack of experience in, knowledge of and support for public education. She was unable to address basic issues that any New Hampshire school board member could discuss fluently,\" said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., whose son has cerebral palsy but studied in public schools under a federal law that guarantees access for disabled students. Several Democrats questioned DeVos' commitment to and understanding of that law. But Republicans accused Democrats of slow-walking DeVos and other qualified nominees to placate liberal base voters who still haven't come to terms with President Trump's election. \"[Democrats are] trying to humiliate and embarrass some of these nominees,\" White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News earlier Tuesday, saying DeVos is committed to education. \"It seems this gridlock and opposition has far less to do with the nominees actually before us than the man who nominated them,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"Enough is enough.\" In addition to DeVos, Republicans hope to confirm a series of other controversial nominees this week. They successfully broke a Democratic filibuster Tuesday afternoon on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general.\u00a0The 52-47 vote sets up the Alabama Republican for likely confirmation Wednesday evening. The Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee also endorsed physician David Shulkin to be veterans affairs secretary, sending his nomination to the full Senate. Also awaiting floor votes are GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia for health secretary and financier Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary. In each case Democrats intend to use the maximum time allowed under the Senate's arcane rules to debate the nominations, which may result in a late-night votes this week and delay Mnuchin's approval until Saturday. Republicans complain that previous presidents have been able to put their Cabinets in place more quickly. Democrats say it's Trump's fault because many of his nominees have complicated financial arrangements and ethical entanglements they claim they have not had enough time to dissect.

      "content": "Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos voiced strong support for public school alternatives at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, telling senators that \"parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning fits the needs of every child.\" DeVos told the Senate Health, Education and Pensions Committe that she would be \"a strong advocate for great public schools\" if confirmed, but added that \"if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child ... we should support a parent's right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.\" DeVos, 59, also said she will seek to address rising higher education costs and massive student debt, but also advance trade and vocational schools as well as community colleges because \"craftsmanship is not a fallback \u2014 but a noble pursuit.\" President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of DeVos to lead the Department of Education was harshly criticized by teacher's unions, who have claimed that DeVos wants to undermine the public education system, which provides instruction to more than 90 percent of the country's students. In his opening statement, committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., himself a former secretary of education, said DeVos is \"on our children's side.\" \"I believe she is in the mainstream of public opinion, and her critics are not,\" said Alexander. That praise was echoed by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who introduced DeVos to the committee by calling her \"a champion of education, and specifically a champion of education for poor kids.\" Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman also appeared before his onetime colleagues to introduce DeVos. \"We just can't accept the status quo in education anymore,\" Lieberman said. \"We need a change agent and an education reformer to be education secretary ... and that is exactly the kind of education secretary I believe Betsy DeVos can and will be.\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee's ranking member, expressed concern that lawmakers had not received an ethics review for the nominee. \"I am extremely disappointed that we are moving forward with this hearing without receiving the proper paperwork from the Office of Goverment Ethics,\" Murray said. Murray also told DeVos that federal policy should be focused on strengthening public schools, \"and certainly not toward diverting taxpayer dollars to fund vouchers that don't work for unaccountable private schools.\" She asked DeVos point-blank to pledge that she would not seek to privatize public schools or take money away from them. DeVos, whose husband is the heir to the Amway marketing fortune, has for decades used the family\u2019s influence and wealth in her home state of Michigan to advocate for charter schools and promote conservative religious values. Critics of DeVos have expressed concerns about her financial contributions and possible conflicts of interest. The nominee attempted to assuage those concerns during the question-and answer period, pledging that she \"will not be conflicted. Period.\" DeVos also said that she will take a government salary of $1 if confirmed. Asked outright by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., if she got the job because of her family's political contributions, DeVos said: \"As a matter of fact I do think that there would be that possibility. I have worked very hard on behalf of parents and children for the last almost 30 years.\" On tuition-free public colleges and universities, DeVos said: \"I think we also have to consider the fact that there is nothing in life that is truly free. Somebody is going to pay for it.\" She skirted Sanders' question on whether she would support making child care free or much more affordable for low-income families as is the case in many countries around the world, saying only that she feels strongly about \"parents having an opportunities for child care for their children.\" \"But it's not a question of opportunity,\" Sanders fired back, raising his voice. \"It's a question of being able to afford it!\" As the hearing dragged on into its fourth hour, Democratic senators made repeated requests with Chairman Alexander to allow them to pose another round of questions to DeVos, but he refused, citing procedures at previous hearings. DeVos is expected to get enough votes in the committee and before the full Senate to be confirmed, considering she needs only a simple majority, with Republicans having 52 senators and Democrats having 48. In a letter addressed to the committee, 38 prominent education groups and teachers' organizations expressed concern that DeVos' track record bodes ill for public education. \"Over the course of her career as a major campaign contributor, soft-money donor and lobbyist, DeVos has used her considerable wealth to influence legislation and the outcomes of elections to advance policies that have undermined public education and proved harmful to many of our most vulnerable students,\" the letter said. LGBT groups also have protested Trump's choice of DeVos, saying she has funded conservative religious groups that promote what they consider to be traditional family values, including one organization that supports conversion therapy -- counseling of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation. DeVos repeatedly disavowed any support for conversion therapy Tuesday, saying in her opening statement that \"every child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination.\" Under questioning from Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., DeVos said that \"I have never believed in\" conversion therapy and \"I believe in the innate value of every single human being.\" \u00a0Alexander later read into the record a letter of support from the Log Cabin Republicans, a Republican organization pushing for LGBT rights. DeVos supporters, meanwhile, applauded her nomination. Eva Moskowitz, CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, said that American public education \"is in deep crisis,\" with 35 countries outranking American schools in math and 20 in reading. \"I believe Betsy DeVos has the talent, commitment and leadership capacity to revitalize our public schools and deliver the promise of opportunity that excellent education provides, and I support her nomination as U.S. secretary of education,\" Moskowitz said in a statement. DeVos has also garnered strong backing from two dozen state governors, as well as another former education secretary, William Bennett. It\u2019s time we take a major turn in American education,\u201d Bennett told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHappening Now\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cBetsy DeVos represents a change. She is experienced in the field with children from all over the country. \u2026 She understands what the problems with education are.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is set to give a major speech Thursday on Obama-era directives on campus rape in the wake of a damning report spotlighting a lack of due process rights for accused students across university campuses. DeVos is expected to make an announcement regarding Title IX, the 1972 campus gender equality law, at George Mason University in Virginia, BuzzFeed News reported. Insiders have described the event as \u201ccentered around equal opportunity and equal protection of all.\u201d Education experts have long expected DeVos to make a move on Title IX and the Education Department 2011 directive named \u201cA Dear Colleague Letter\u201d that set the procedures for colleges that receive a sexual assault report. The procedures include setting how long campus sexual investigations should take, what standards of evidence should be used, and prohibiting colleges from just sending a case to police, BuzzFeed News notes. Some have criticized the directive and standards used in the prosecution of sexual assault on campus, claiming the accused students often do not receive significant protections and due process rights \u2013 turning university investigations into so-called \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d DeVos has often been attacked for expressing interest in changing Title IX. During her confirmation hearing, she came under fire for having donated to a group that has been critical of how Title IX is enforced on campus, Politico reported. More recently, feminist groups criticized her for meeting with so-called men\u2019s rights activists who opposed campus policies, the New York Times reported. The possible major changes to Title IX would follow a damning report by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) that found most American universities deny due process rights to the accused. According to a first-of-its-kind report titled \u201cSpotlight on Due Process 2017\u201d \u2013 which looked at 53 top American universities \u2013 almost 74 percent of schools did not presume a student to be innocent until proven guilty in non-academic cases. At the same time, 85 percent of top schools in the country received the lowest grades for due process protections and 79 percent of surveyed institutions received a D or F rating for protecting the rights of a student accused of sexual misconduct. Less than half of surveyed universities, meanwhile, \u201crequire that fact-finders \u2014 the institution\u2019s version of judge and/or jury \u2014 be impartial\u201d, the report said. A number of Ivy League universities, for example, do not guarantee the presumption of innocence during sexual misconduct trials and rarely give the accused access to evidence or conducts a cross-examination. No universities have scored the top A score.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday called for replacing the Obama administration's rules for investigating allegations of sexual violence on campuses across the country with a more \u201cworkable, effective and fair system.\u201d During a speech at George Mason University, DeVos announced plans to review and overhaul the way colleges and universities handle investigations. \u201cHere is what I\u2019ve learned: the truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students,\u201d DeVos said. She added, \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. That\u2019s why we must do better, because the current approach isn\u2019t working.\u201d DeVos said the department will seek public comment and university expertise to develop rules to replace the current policy. \u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise, and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective, and fair system,\u201d DeVos said. The Title IX law, enacted in 1972, forbids discrimination based on sex in education. It was once seen as a measure to ensure equity in college sports, but in recent years has become associated with efforts to address sexual assault and harassment at college campuses. The Obama administration reshaped how colleges handle complaints of sexual assault, setting new rules and starting hundreds of investigations into colleges accused of straying from them. Central to the debate is a 2011 department memo that laid out rules colleges must follow when responding to complaints of sexual assault from their students. The memo requires colleges to investigate complaints even if there's a separate criminal inquiry. It also established what has become a polarizing standard of evidence used to judge cases. Unlike in criminal courts, where guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, colleges judge students based on whether it's \"more likely than not\" they committed the offense. Colleges that are found to have violated Title IX rules can lose federal funding entirely, although the department has never imposed that penalty. Some advocacy groups say the Obama-era policies are flawed but worth saving. They argue the policies have protected many students and forced colleges to confront problems that were long kept quiet. On Thursday, about two dozen protesters gathered outside the auditorium where DeVos delivered her speech. DEVOS PLANS TITLE IX CHANGES IN WAKE OF REPORT ON CAMPUS DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS The protesters included women who said they were assaulted on campus and victims' advocates. \"Donald Trump supports Betsy DeVos supports perpetrators,\" read the sign of one protester. But opponents say the rules have swung the pendulum too far and pressure colleges to take hasty and heavy action against students accused of misconduct. \u201cEvery survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously,\u201d DeVos said Thursday. \u201cEvery student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. These are non-negotiable principles.\u201d She added: \u201cDue process either protects everyone, or it protects no one. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the \u2018victim\u2019 only creates more victims.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "The Senate was in session all night Monday into Tuesday morning as members debated the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be education secretary ahead of her likely confirmation at noon. DeVos is poised to be confirmed for education secretary by the narrowest possible margin as Vice President Mike Pence is expected to break a potential deadlocked vote. DeVos, a wealthy GOP donor, has devoted herself to boosting alternatives to public education and sparked concerns among educators that she won\u2019t be a strong champion for public schools. Two GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have announced plans to oppose DeVos in a Senate split 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats. That will leave her with a tie vote if all other Republicans support her and all Democrats oppose her as expected, and will require Pence to put her over the top. A vice president breaking a tie on a Cabinet nomination would be a first in the history of the Senate, according to the Senate historian's office. The chamber went to brief, intermittent quorum calls as senator after senator completed his or her remarks and yielded the floor to a colleague. And a lone Republican senator, South Carolina's Time Scott, went to the floor to speak, as well, arguing that lawmakers' focus should be not on DeVos, but on ways to improve the education system. Emotions ran high ahead of the vote as constituents jammed senators' phone lines with calls and protesters gathered outside the Capitol, including one person in a grizzly bear costume to ridicule DeVos' comment during her confirmation hearing that some schools might want guns to protect against grizzlies. \u201cMrs. DeVos demonstrated a complete lack of experience in, knowledge of and support for public education. She was unable to address basic issues that any New Hampshire school board member could discuss fluently,\" said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., whose son has cerebral palsy but studied in public schools under a federal law that guarantees access for disabled students.

Yet there is little suspense about the final outcome on any of the nominees because Democrats themselves changed Senate rules when they were in the majority several years ago so that Cabinet nominees can now be approved with a simple majority, not the 60 votes previously required.

Protesters shouted \u201cshame, shame\u201d at the secretary as she was led back into her vehicle. One holding a Black Lives Matter sign then stood in front of the van, but was scolded by fellow protesters to \u201clet her leave,\u201d and he stepped aside.

No school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation's school children.\" THE WEEK IN PICTURES The disruption is the latest in a series of protests against Trump administration officials and policies. DeVos\u2019 nomination was fiercely opposed by teachers unions and Democratic lawmakers in large part over her long support for charter schools and other public school alternatives. Two Republicans joined Democrats to oppose her in the Senate earlier this week, but Vice President Pence broke the 50-50 tie to ensure her confirmation. According to Fox5DC, the \u201cvigil\u201d in front of the D.C. school on Friday was not labeled a protest, but designed to urge DeVos to \u201csupport and fund our public schools.\u201d Most of the few-dozen \u201cvigil\u201d participants were retired teachers and parents, but several Black Lives Matter demonstrators also attended and were more aggressive toward DeVos. Jefferson Academy is a Title I school, meaning a majority of its students come from lower-income homes. The school's principal, Natalie Gordon, previously headed two D.C. charter schools before she was asked to take over at Jefferson Academy, which was struggling with low test scores.\u00a0City officials say the school has made a dramatic turnaround over the last few years. Friday's protest comes after Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, reportedly confronted protesters at a town hall in his home state of Utah on Thursday.

DeVos told the Senate Health, Education and Pensions Committee in January that she would be \"a strong advocate for great public schools,\u201d but added that \"if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child ... we should support a parent's right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.\" Trump's nomination of DeVos to lead the Department of Education was harshly criticized by the teachers\u2019 unions, who have claimed that DeVos wants to undermine the public education system, which provides instruction to more than 90 percent of the country's students.

Bertram, the author of \u201cOne Nation Under Taught: Solving America\u2019s Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Crisis, wrote that DeVos\u2019 most important task will be to cast a vision for what education can be for our next generation to meet the demands of a global economy. Politico reported that DeVos did not go into detail about what steps the Trump administration will take to implement its school-choice goals. She said states that opt out would be making a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and will be \u201churting the children and families who can least afford it.\u201d",

      "content": "U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is being guarded by the agents from the U.S. Marshals Service after a bruising nomination process, Politico reported. Drew J. Wade, a spokesman for the service, told the magazine that he is not aware of these agents guarding an education secretary in the past. The education secretary is traditionally guarded by a small security unit from the education department, the report said. The report said that few other details are available about the security arrangement. Despite her win, DeVos emerged bruised from her highly divisive nomination fight. Opposed by half the Senate, she faced criticism, even ridicule for lack of experience. At one point, she said some schools should have guns because of the threat of grizzly bears. And there has been scathing opposition from teachers unions and civil rights activists over her support of charter schools and her conservative religious ideology. President Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, \"Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!\" Pence tweeted later in the day that supporting DeVos was \"a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education.\" In a separate development, DeVos announced Friday that a government website devoted to students with disabilities, which had been down for more than a week, has been restored and will be updated with input from interested parties. She also accused the previous administration of neglecting the website. The American Federation of Teachers disputed that contention. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "content": "Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday over her decision to suspend rules that were meant to protect students from abuse by for-profit colleges. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says DeVos violated rule-making laws when she announced a June 14 decision to delay so-called borrower defense to repayment rules, which were finalized under President Barack Obama and scheduled to take effect July 1. In her announcement saying the rules would be delayed and rewritten, DeVos said they created \"a muddled process that's unfair to students and schools.\" Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill called the lawsuit by attorneys generals \"ideologically driven\" and said the now-delayed rules suffered from \"substantive and procedural flaws\" that need to be addressed. \"That is why the Secretary decided it was time to take a step back and hit pause on these regulations ... to make sure these rules achieve their purpose: helping harmed students,\" Hill said in a statement. The rules would have forbidden schools from forcing students to sign agreements that waive their right to sue. Defrauded students would have faced a quicker path to get their loans erased, and schools, not taxpayers, could have been held responsible for the costs. A final version of the rules was announced last fall after nearly two years of negotiations. The Obama administration started pursuing new rules after the Corinthian Colleges chain shut down in 2015 amid allegations of misconduct, leading to a flood of applications from students seeking to get their loans forgiven. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is leading the lawsuit against DeVos, said the regulation was a \"common-sense measure\" meant to protect students. \"Since Day One of the Trump administration, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and the administration have sided with for-profit schools over students,\" Healey told reporters. \"For me and my colleagues, it's simple: When students and families are cheated out of an education and taxpayers foot the bill, everybody loses.\" The lawsuit says DeVos and the Education Department failed to take legally required steps to delay already established rules. It says they failed to open the decision to public comment and failed to provide an adequate legal justification for delaying the rules, among other faults. In June, the Education Department said it was delaying the rule because a federal court was weighing a lawsuit brought by a California trade group made up mostly of for-profit colleges seeking to block the rules. The department cited a law allowing such a delay for litigation if it's found \"that justice so requires.\" The attorneys general said that justification is \"a mere pretext\" for repealing and replacing the regulation. The other states that joined the lawsuit are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Last week, a group of 47 Democrats in Congress, along with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a letter to DeVos opposing the delay, saying the department had never used litigation as a reason to delay rules. A separate lawsuit against the Education Department was filed Thursday on behalf of two former students of a Boston-area for-profit college. The suit says the students were counting on protections in the new rules to sue the New England Institute of Art, which they say deceived them and left them with few job prospects and heavy debt. The school's parent company did not immediately comment. \"Secretary Betsy DeVos has effectively revoked students' rights under the rule while giving a pass to predatory schools that wield influence with this administration,\" said Julie Murray, an attorney for Public Citizen, a liberal think tank in Washington that's representing the students. The lawsuits set up a legal battle that has been brewing outside the courts for months. Advocacy groups and some congressional Democrats have been gearing up for a fight to preserve Obama-era rules that were intended to hold for-profit colleges accountable, while the Trump administration has sought to roll back regulations it sees as burdensome. Last Friday, DeVos said she was also suspending the new \"gainful-employment\" rule, another hallmark of the Obama administration that was set to take effect in July. The regulation would have cut off federal funding to career programs that consistently left students with more debt than they could afford. Data released by the Obama administration in January found that more than 800 programs across the country were failing to meet the rule's standards.",

      "content": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday rescinded Obama-era guidelines for investigating allegations of sexual assault on campus, replacing them with guidelines she said would help schools \u201ctreat all students fairly.\u201d DeVos, who has been highly critical of the Obama administration\u2019s approach, had announced earlier this month she planned to replace the policy she describes as unfair. \"This interim guidance will help schools as they work to combat sexual misconduct and will treat all students fairly,\" DeVos said in a statement Friday. \"Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on. There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.\" The temporary guidance will be in place while the Education Department gathers comments and comes up with new rules. The Obama administration had reshaped how colleges handle complaints of sexual assault, setting new rules and starting hundreds of investigations into colleges accused of straying from them. Central to the debate is a 2011 department memo that laid out rules colleges must follow when responding to complaints of sexual assault from their students. The memo requires colleges to investigate complaints even if there's a separate criminal inquiry. It also established what has become a polarizing standard of evidence used to judge cases. Critics have, among other complaints, claimed the system denies due process to the accused. Unlike in criminal courts, where guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, colleges judge students based on whether it's \"more likely than not\" they committed the offense. Colleges that are found to have violated Title IX rules can lose federal funding entirely, although the department has never imposed that penalty. The department is now withdrawing that 2011 letter, with DeVos saying in a statement \u201cthe era of rule by letter is over.\u201d In a fact sheet, the department said schools must address sexual misconduct that is \u201csevere, persistent or pervasive,\u201d while conducting fair and impartial investigations in a \u201ctimely manner.\u201d The department said such investigations must be led by an individual free of conflicts of interest. The department maintained the changes do not limit the rights of anyone to file such a Title IX complaint. Some advocacy groups say the Obama-era policies are flawed but worth saving. They argue the policies have protected many students and forced colleges to confront problems that were long kept quiet. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " President Trump won't be the only high-profile\u00a0target on House Democrats' investigative agenda when the new Congress is seated in January, with top officials in his Cabinet also expected to face a torrent of scrutiny. Trump's Cabinet has seen\u00a0several shakeups\u00a0this year -- including the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt\u00a0and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But several controversial figures remain. And Cabinet officials generally are easier for Congress to investigate than senior White House officials and the president, who can assert executive privilege to presumptively shield both\u00a0his communications and deliberative processes from review. House Democrats have signaled a particular interest in probing Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos,\u00a0Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Housing and Urban Development head Ben Carson. Other possible officials to go under the microscope include Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0Kirstjen Nielsen, though Trump reportedly has indicated she may leave the administration, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. DeVos, who has reportedly received round-the-clock protection from the U.S. Marshals after being accosted last year, was once called the \u201cmost hated Cabinet secretary\" by \"60 Minutes\"\u00a0host\u00a0Lesley Stahl. A wealthy Republican donor with limited education experience, DeVos\u00a0was confirmed by a 51-50 vote in the Senate -- a result ensured only by Vice President Pence's tiebreaking vote, which marked the first time in history a vice president had to vote to confirm a Cabinet official. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who is slated to chair an appropriations subcommittee that handles education funding, has criticized Devos on everything from her handling of student loan debt\u00a0to her department's guidance\u00a0on campus sexual assault policy. She\u00a0has vowed to\u00a0\u201chold Secretary DeVos accountable for her agency\u2019s failure to uphold federal protections for our students.\u201d STOSSEL: WHAT THE HATERS DON'T GET ABOUT BETSY DEVOS Chief among Democrats' objections are DeVos' efforts to enact regulatory\u00a0rollbacks favorable to major providers of student loans, including\u00a0Navient and FedLoan Servicing, that DeVos has said are aimed at reducing confusion and inefficiencies\u00a0in the student loan process. Democrats have also opposed\u00a0DeVos' narrowing of the definition of fraud in the student loan context, which conservatives have argued was an important step in reducing potentially frivolous litigation that would ultimately result in\u00a0big-digit judgments that come out of taxpayers' pockets. Rep. Mark Takano, who is slated to chair the Veterans' Affairs Committee, told Politico that he wants \"to examine the extent to which her rollbacks of regulations negatively impact veterans,\" who enroll at for-profit colleges at high rates. And Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who is expected to chair the House Financial Services committee, has accused DeVos of waging a \u201cfull-on attack on civil rights protections for students\u2014particularly students of color, students with disabilities, transgender students, and survivors of sexual assault.\u201d At a contentious hearing with DeVos in March,\u00a0DeLauro charged that \"despite your statements all morning about supporting states\u2019 rights, what your office has done, you\u2019ve issued a declaration to pre-empt state regulations on companies that collect student loans.\" In February, DeVos issued a notice effectively saying states have no legal authority to regulate such lenders, who are facing several lawsuits from state attorneys general\u00a0and investigations by various agencies. More recently, DeVos has moved to block efforts by states and federal regulators to obtain information about student loans, citing federal privacy laws. Legal challenges concerning that effort are ongoing, with one judge ruling that the Education Department couldn't assert those privacy protections to hide from discovery requests. Democrats have also raised concerns about DeVos' new proposed guidance for how campuses should handle sexual assault claims, which Republicans have long claimed are unfair to students accused of misconduct. \"Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\" DeVos said in a statement announcing the proposal, which would provide the accused the right to question his or her accuser. The two could communicate through an intermediary and would not need to be in the same room. But DeLauro, again, was unconvinced: \u201cIn the ongoing battle to eradicate sexual assault from college campuses, Secretary Betsy DeVos is on the side of those accused rather than the victims,\" she said in a statement earlier this month. Zinke, a former Montana congressman and U.S. Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Bosnia,\u00a0has come under criticism for his alleged misconduct as interior secretary, centering on a\u00a0real estate deal in his home state involving a foundation he created and the chairman of the energy giant Halliburton that does business with Interior. Multiple media reports have indicated the Interior Department's watchdog, Inspector General Mary Kendall,\u00a0has referred that probe to the Justice Department for possible criminal charges. Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who is expected to lead the\u00a0House Oversight Government Operations Subcommittee, told Politico that \"Zinke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior we\u2019ve had in living memory.\" \"[There\u2019s] rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office,\" Connolly added. The 57-year-old Zinke also raised ethical concerns when he blocked two Connecticut tribes from opening a casino and redrew boundaries to shrink a Utah national monument. Kendall's team\u00a0cleared Zinke in a separate probe into his air travel, faulted him\u00a0for violating department regulations when he allowed his wife to ride in government vehicles, and said there were insufficient records to determine whether Zinke's staff re-assignments broke policy. Zinke has also been inundated\u00a0with criticism even for his legally above-board policy decisions and statements.\u00a0As head of the Interior, Zinke has reduced the boundaries protecting some national monuments to open more land to drilling and mining operations, angering some in his home state of Montana.\u00a0Last week, he blamed \"radical environmentalists\u201d for the deadly California wildfires that have left dozens dead, saying they'd rather \u201cburn down the entire forest than cut a single tree.\u201d Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the probable incoming chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said it \"can't be dismissed as merely a coincidence\" that Zinke reportedly sought to replace Kendall\u00a0with a political appointee shortly after the DOJ referral. Grijalva made clear on Friday he's going after Zinke in a USA Today op-ed calling for his resignation, prompting a fiery response from the secretary. But it remains a possibility\u00a0that Zinke, like former EPA head Pruitt, might step aside rather than face Democrat-led investigations. Citing several sources familiar with his discussions, Politico reported earlier this month that Zinke plans to resign before the end of the year. \"It's laughably false and belongs in The Onion,\" the Interior's press office wrote on Twitter concerning the report. President Trump indicated to reporters at a post-Election Day White House press conference\u00a0on Nov. 7 that Zinke's fate was in doubt. ZINKE BLAMES 'RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS' FOR CALIFORNIA FIRES \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that, and I do want to study whatever is being said,\u201d Trump said. \"I think he\u2019s doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that, and we\u2019ll probably have an idea on that in about a week.\u201d But two days later, Trump told reporters he had no immediate plans to fire Zinke. \"No, I\u2019m going to look into any complaints,\u201d he said. At a roundtable discussion in Biloxi, Miss., on Monday evening, Trump said he's still thinking of potentially changing some Cabinet positions, but added that he'd be very happy if he left his Cabinet as it is now. For his part, Zinke wrote on Twitter after Election Day that he was \"looking forward\" to working with new members of Congress in January. Carson, a former neurosurgeon who challenged Trump for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination,\u00a0is most dogged by ethical complaints concerning his allegedly excessive spending at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Earlier this year,\u00a0HUD announced it would cancel an order for a $31,561 dining set purchased for a costly makeover of Carson's office after a complaint by Helen Foster, HUD\u2019s former chief administrative officer. Foster said she faced retaliation for objection to the cost of the set, saying that $5,000 was the statutory max.\u00a0The New York Times first reported on the decision, made in late 2017 -- shortly after the White House moved to cut various HUD programs for low-income individuals. A HUD spokesperson told The Times that Carson\u00a0\u201cdidn\u2019t know the table had been purchased\" -- a claim that Democrats are sure to probe in January. House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., already demanded that HUD turn over all documents related to the purchase earlier this year, but a Democrat-led probe would likely be more expansive and could include subpoenas for additional information and testimony by more officials at HUD. In something of an investigative crossover twist, an email sent by Carson on Oct. 12 apparently described the plan to replace\u00a0Kendall after she referred her investigation of Zinke to the DOJ. BEN CARSON HITS BACK AT 'HYSTERICAL' CRITICS, SAYS RENT REFORM HELPS THE POOR In his email, Carson wrote that assistant secretary for administration Suzanne Israel Tufts was leaving to replace Kendall as the Interior Department's watchdog -- an assertion the White House quickly called \"false.\" House Democrats have promised to determine how exactly Carson got the idea that Kendall would depart. Carson has taken criticism for arguing for advocating rent reforms that he says will help boost people out of poverty.\u00a0 Saying \u201d$50 a month is not a lot of skin the game,\" Carson has moved to boost the minimum rent contribution from poor people receiving government housing benefits from $50 to $150. He has also sought to have residents pay a larger percentage of their income towards rent, and move income verification checks from once a year to once every three years -- a change he says will encourage people to work more. \u201cThe real meat of the rent reform is things like making the assessment of income every three years instead of one year so that people aren\u2019t discouraged from taking a raise,\u201d Carson said this summer. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t discouraged from bringing another income earner in or getting married, things like that. Those are the things that have kept people chronically in poverty.\u201d But backlash has been severe, with\u00a0Democrats countering\u00a0that more work requirements and higher rent costs would drive more people into homelessness. Nielsen has been front-and-center in recent days, after members of the leading migrant caravan from Central America attempted to storm the port of entry at San Ysidro, Calif., on Sunday. During the episode, U.S. Border Patrol authorities used tear gas to disperse the migrants, including several who threw what appeared to be rocks across the border. At a rally late Monday in Mississippi, Trump seemingly sounded a note of confidence in Nielsen's work overseeing border security efforts, which resulted in dozens of arrests. No members of the caravan made it into the U.S. without being apprehended, according to U.S. officials. \"Are we doing OK on the border, folks?\" Trump said to cheers of \"Build that wall.\" WATCH: HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS RUSH BORDER AT SAN YSIDRO \"We're not going to have it -- you've got to come into our country legally,\" the president added. \"We have a lot of [the wall] built, and it's going up. And the rest of it -- it's pretty nasty looking wire, isn't it? We're doing well.\" In between his two Mississippi\u00a0rallies, Trump attended a roundtable with law enforcement leaders on his bipartisan criminal justice reform effort. There, he charged that\u00a0some migrants -- whom\u00a0he identified as \"grabbers\"\u00a0-- were essentially using children as human shields at the border. After the president instituted a zero-tolerance policy that all illegal immigrants should be referred for criminal prosecution, administration officials argued that the Flores consent decree legally prevented them from keeping adults and children in custody together for more than two weeks.\u00a0That decree, made amid litigation during former President Bill Clinton's administration,\u00a0ostensibly limits the amount of time that federal authorities can detain illegal immigrant minors who are caught along with their parents. But amid fierce criticism against both the White House and Nielsen, Trump signed an executive order this summer barring family separations at the border, although it remains subject to legal challenges. Democrats have called for investigations into the family\u00a0separations, as well as for Nielsen's resignation amid a report by the\u00a0DHS Office of Inspector General finding various possible deficiencies in the agency's handling of the matter. If Nielsen remains \"Donald Trump\u2019s puppet, continues to flout the law, lie to Congress and ignore the plight of these children in the face of these findings, then she is truly unfit to lead the Department,\"\u00a0Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in October. Thompson is set to chair the\u00a0House Homeland Security committee. In a statement late Monday, Nielsen\u00a0backed up Trump's comments\u00a0about migrants, just as DHS earlier supported Trump's remarks that the caravan contained hundreds of criminals. But in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" earlier this month, Trump said he wanted to see more from Nielsen. \"Well, I like her a lot.\u00a0I respect her a lot,\" Trump said, referring to Nielsen.\u00a0\"She\u2019s very smart.\u00a0I want her to get much tougher and we\u2019ll see what happens there.\u00a0But I want to be extremely tough. ...\u00a0\u00a0I like her very much, I respect her very much, I\u2019d like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period.\" He added there's a \"chance\" that Nielsen, who\u00a0was accosted in a restaurant this summer by far-left progressive activists,\u00a0will continue in her role. House Democrats have signaled their intent to scrutinize Ross' finances, as well as his responses to federally required disclosure forms and his possible ties to Chinese and Russian interests. In a letter this summer, several leading Democrats, including likely incoming Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., requested that a government watchdog look into Ross' decision to short Navigator Holdings in October 2017,\u00a0 just days after he became aware that The New York Times planned to publish a report on his investments with the company. On Nov. 5, 2017, The Times published a story titled, \"Commerce Secretary\u2019s Offshore Ties to Putin \u2018Cronies,'\" which linked Navigator Holdings to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a Russian oligarch. \u201cSecretary Ross\u2019 holdings in Navigator, his sale of those holdings, and his lack of transparency with regard to those holdings, are especially troubling given that he is responsible for promoting the interests of U.S. companies and for implementing sanctions against Russia,\u201d the Democrats wrote. They also questioned whether Ross had properly divested himself of his interest in companies co-owned by the Chinese government and other companies that he can influence -- as he said he would during his confirmation hearings --\u00a0or whether he had simply distributed his holdings among his family members. Separately, Democrats have sought to question Ross on the Trump administration's decision\u00a0to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, though the Supreme Court has blocked those efforts in connection with several lawsuits. Ross had claimed in March, when the decision to add the citizenship question was announced, that he considered adding it after a request to do so last December from the Justice Department. However, in October, Justice Department lawyers filed a new document in which Ross said he now remembered speaking with former senior White House adviser Steve Bannon in spring 2017 about adding the question. That apparent inconsistency could provide fuel for Democrats' efforts to highlight the citizenship issue more broadly. Democrats claim a citizenship question would scare illegal immigrants and lead many to avoid participating in the census. Because the number of congressional seats awarded to each district in the House of Representatives is currently determined by population totals provided by census results -- citizens and noncitizens -- Democrats fear the Trump administration's change will dramatically cut into their representation in Congress. But late Monday, Bloomberg, citing three people familiar with Trump's thinking, reported that despite these potential headaches and widespread speculation, the president has no plans to replace either Ross or\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. If accurate, the news would mark something of a bailout for Ross, who himself\u00a0helped Trump avoid a personal bankruptcy in\u00a0Atlantic City, N.J., in the 1990s.\u00a0It was evident even decades later that the president hasn't forgotten Ross' investing prowess. \"This guy knows how to make money, folks,\" Trump said at a rally in 2016 after picking Ross for the top Commerce job. \"I put on a killer.\" Fox News' Samuel Chamberlain, Dom Callicchio, Bret Baier and Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.",

      "content": " A petition calling for NBA superstar LeBron James to replace Betsy DeVos as secretary of education has attracted thousands of signatures. As of early Friday, more than 23,000 people had signed the\u00a0Care2 petition, asking President Trump to replace DeVos with the Los Angeles Lakers star. The three-time NBA champion recently opened his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. \u201cI am very excited by the overwhelmingly positive reception of the petition, but am also unsurprised,\u201d Rebecca Gerber, who started the petition, told USA Today. \u201cIts success is undoubtedly due, in part, to the effect of LeBron James as a singular role model in our culture, and his ability to not only be a superstar athlete, but a superstar activist that so many men, women and children admire.\u201d Gerber said she hopes the petition can \u201csend a message\u201d and claimed that people were frustrated with Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cpetty, racist attacks against James and other black athletes.\u201d DeVos is one of the most criticized members of the Trump administration. She assumed office as secretary of education in February 2017. Last month, vandals untied a $40 million yacht owned by DeVos' family, setting it adrift at a boat club in Huron, Ohio, resulting in thousands of dollars in damage. Unfortunately for Gerber, James signed a four-year contract with the Lakers over the summer. He also has a busy year in Hollywood coming up as he is set to be producing several TV series and \u201cSpace Jam 2.\u201d",

BETSY DEVOS TO VISIT STRUGGLING SOUTH CAROLINA SCHOOLS DeVos drew attention to the $13.2 billion in federal grants awarded to states for special education. The secretary faced a storm of criticism after she was grilled by the House Appropriations subcommittee over proposed budget cuts that would eliminate nearly $18 million in federal funding for the athletic competition for disabled youth and adults while calling for a\u00a0$60 million increase in charter school funding. She said she has \u201cpersonally supported\u201d the Special Olympics, but added that it could be supported through philanthropy as well. The Special Olympics received $17.6 million from the Education Department this year, according to records. In her statement, she said the organization raises more than $100 million annually and that \u201cThere are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don't get a dime of federal grant money.\u201d \u201cBut given our current budget realities, the federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, U.S. Sen.

Our Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program.\" Just last week, Blunt attended the 2019\u00a0Special Olympics World Summer Games, held in Abu Dhabi, Roll Call reported. DeVos is expected to present her budget to Blunt's panel Thursday. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Benjamin Brown",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is reportedly considering allowing states to use federal funds to buy firearms for educators. The New York Times, citing multiple people with knowledge of the plan, reported Wednesday evening that the department is focusing on a federal education law that does not explicitly prohibit the purchase of firearms through federal funds called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants. It would be up to DeVos to approve of any such measure, The Times reported. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News. A spokeswoman for the education department told the paper that the agency is \u201cconstantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,\u201d but did not specifically address whether the department is considering granting states the option to use federal funds for weapons purchases. \u201cThe secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was injured during a 2011 shooting at a meet-and-greet event in Tuscon, Az. \u2013 said arming teachers puts \u201cchildren in even more danger.\u201d \u201cArming teachers is not a solution. It recklessly puts American children in even more danger,\u201d Giffords tweeted late Wednesday evening. \u201cWe can forge a better path. It\u2019s time for Americans to find the courage to fight for our own safety.\u201d Stricter gun control laws have been at the forefront of hotly debated topics in Washington since a gunman opened fire at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members. President Trump in February expressed his support for arming \u201cgun adept teachers with military or special training experience,\u201d as a way to prevent another \u201csavage sicko\u201d from causing mass causalities. He also advocated for gun control measures, such as raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21.

      "content": "President-elect Donald Trump selected a charter school advocate and GOP donor from Michigan on Wednesday to be education secretary. Betsy DeVos becomes the second woman chosen to fill a spot in Trump's Cabinet. Earlier Wednesday, Trump named South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations earlier in the day. Both Cabinet-level positions require Senate confirmation. While some initially cheered Haley's selection, despite her limited experience on the international stage, the\u00a0DeVos\u00a0choice faced criticism even before it was formally announced Wednesday. Conservatives warned that\u00a0DeVos, a longtime Republican donor, previously supported the Common Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign. Trump, who was at his Palm Beach estate Wednesday for the Thanksgiving holiday, called\u00a0DeVos\u00a0\"a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\" DeVos, from Michigan, is a longtime advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. She currently leads the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, and sits on the board of the Jeb Bush-led Foundation for Excellence in Education. \"Under her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\" Trump said. DeVos\u00a0said in her own statement, \"The status quo in education is not acceptable.\" The\u00a0DeVos\u00a0family has been active in Republican politics for decades, especially as donors to GOP candidates and the Republican Party.\u00a0DeVos' husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former president of the company. The couple gave $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington in 2010, at the time the largest private donation in the center's history. Hours before the\u00a0DeVos\u00a0pick was announced, conservative policy leader Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, called her \"an establishment, pro-Common Core secretary of education.\" \"This would not qualify as 'draining the swamp,'\" Cannon said, referencing Trump's campaign trail slogan. \"And it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point.\" In a statement to Fox News, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said DeVos \"has no meaningful experience in the classroom or in our schools.\" \u201cThe president-elect, in his selection of Betsy DeVos, has chosen the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education,\" Weingarten said. \u201cIn nominating DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America.\" Former presidential contender and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called DeVos \"an outstanding pick\" for the position. \u201cShe has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children\u2019s success,\" he said in a statement. When asked about\u00a0DeVos' support for the Common Core standards, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said \"the president-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core.\" \"Anybody joining the administration is signing on to the president-elect's platform and vision for moving America forward,\" Miller said. There was less immediate opposition to Haley's selection. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, is the only minority member chosen by Trump so far. Retired neurosurgeon and Trump loyalist, Ben Carson, an African-American, has been offered the job of secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the deliberations publicly. Carson has not yet accepted the offer, but he tweeted on Wednesday that \"an announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.\" Trump said that Haley, his UN choice, \"has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country.\" \"She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals,\" he said in a statement. \"She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham praised his home-state governor as a good choice and said in a statement that he looks forward to working with her on \"overdue reforms of the United Nations.\" Graham is chairman of the Senate's Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, which is responsible for funding the UN and all American foreign assistance. Haley said she accepted the assignment partly out of \"a sense of duty.\" \"When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,\" she said in a statement. Not all presidents have treated the ambassadorship to the U.N. as a Cabinet-level position, and Republicans have tended not to grant that status. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump is \"spending significant time\" weighing his choice for secretary of state. Among those he has interviewed is 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who repeatedly denounced Trump during the 2016 campaign. After secretary of state, the UN ambassador is the highest-profile diplomatic position, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the international stage. As part of the Cabinet, Haley would have more opportunity to shape U.S. policies, rather than simply defend the administration's positions. Yet it could be an awkward role at times. Trump campaigned on the theme of \"America first\" and said he is skeptical about \"international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\" Trump has also described the United Nations as weak and incompetent. Haley would be the third consecutive female U.S. ambassador to the UN, after Susan Rice and Samantha Power, the current ambassador. Bad blood between Trump and Haley was evident through much of the campaign. \"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" Trump wrote on Twitter in March. Haley denounced several of Trump's campaign comments and urged voters to \"reject the siren call of the angriest voices.\" DeVos, too, was slow to warm to Trump. She told The Associated Press in July, \"A lot of the things he has said are very off-putting and concerning.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Harvard University students staged a protest as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered a speech Thursday on school choice. Some held up fists. One held up a sign reading in red ink: \u2018White supremacist.\u201d Others called for protections for victims of campus sexual assault. DeVos last week revoked Obama administration guidance that instructed colleges on how to investigate sexual assault cases on college campuses. DeVos said policy was skewed against those accused of assault and had \u201cweaponized\u201d the Education Department to \u201cwork against schools and against students.\u201d DeVos did not stop her speech to address the protesters but later took some questions from the audience. The Associated Press reported the protest was mostly silent, though some students snapped their fingers or cheered in support of some questions. HHS SECRETARY TOM PRICE RESIGNS OVER PRIVATE PLANE TRIPS Asked about protections for transgender students, DeVos said she is committed to making sure all students are safe. Earlier this year, she rescinded guidance that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms that matched their gender identity. \"With respect to any student that feels unsafe or discriminated against in their school, that is the last thing we want and the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education continues to hear and work with the schools that have any of those issues to deal with,\" DeVos said. \"And we are committed to doing that on behalf of the students.\" DeVos said she wanted new rules on campus sexual assault to be fair to both the victims and the accused. She was asked by a student how much her net worth was expected to increase due to school choice. Devos responded: \"I have written lots of checks to support giving parents and kids options to choose a school of their choice. The balance on my income has gone very much the other way and will continue to do so.\" School choice referred to efforts that give students options other than their local public schools, such as charter or private schools. Charter schools were funded by public money but usually operated by entities that were independent of school districts. DeVos was a supporter of school choice efforts in Michigan before becoming President Trump\u2019s education chief. Before she spoke, she announced $253 million in grants to expand charter schools across the country. The awards went to nine states, two state agencies and over 20 nonprofit charter management organizations. The grants were awarded as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act. TILLERSON IN CHINA TO TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA, TRADE Tony DelaRosa, 27, a student at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, held a sign reading \"Our Students Are Not 4 Sale.\" \"We need public schools not to lose our funding and be given to charter schools,\" DelaRosa told the AP. \"Administering more charters anywhere, it's going to take funding from somewhere.\" Samantha White, a 19-year-old neurobiology major, said she came to the speech to ask DeVos why she rescinded the guidance on campus sexual assault. \"I am very upset and angry about it,\" White said. \"Sexual assault is such a huge problem on college campus already and if you are rolling this back, it makes survivors of sexual assault more vulnerable and it's more difficult for them to seek justice when there aren't these regulations.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Her visit inside the school was closed to the press, but afterward, she spoke to the media at a Parkland hotel. \u201cIt was a very, as I said, sobering and inspiring moment and visit,\u201d DeVos said.\u00a0\u201cI come committed on behalf of this administration to continuing to work to find solutions so that no student and no parent ever has to go through what this community has had to endure.\u201d She said she heard a variety of things from the students with whom she spoke with. \u201cSome of them are doing quite well, but they all acknowledge that it\u2019s a day-to-day situation,\u201d she said. \u201cFor students who were actually in the building involved, it\u2019s very tough.\u201d School safety\u2014and what to do about it\u2014has dominated the political landscape since former student Nikolas Cruz allegedly took an Uber to the school, unpacked his AR-15 assault rifle with multiple magazines and unloaded 150 rounds inside the classrooms and hallways.\u00a0Fourteen students died, along with one teacher, the athletic director and a coach.\u00a0Sixteen others were shot and wounded. In Tallahassee, the state capital, the Senate passed its Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act afterhours Monday night.\u00a0It calls for raising the age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21, mandates a three-day waiting period for all gun purchases, boosts funding for mental health care and aims to post armed officers at ever school. One controversial proposal, to arm teachers with guns in the classrooms if their school districts approve, was removed by the Senators. The proposal was opposed by Gov. Rick Scott. The bill is now in the Florida House and a House vote on the massive, $400 million package could come Wednesday. Broward county prosecutors are presenting evidence in front of a secret, grand jury this week.\u00a0A formal indictment with 17 counts of first-degree murder is expected.

      "content": " A $40 million yacht owned by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' family was untied from its dock this weekend, causing thousands of dollars in damage, police said. The 163-foot Seaquest yacht had been moored at the Huron Boat Basin when the captain alerted authorities early Sunday morning it had been untied and set adrift,\u00a0according to a police report provided to Fox News. According to the Toledo Blade, which first reported\u00a0on the incident, the yacht had \"several large scratches and scrapes\" from hitting a dock\u00a0\u2013 resulting in what the captain estimated to be between $5,000 to $10,000 in damage. The investigation is ongoing, Huron Police Chief Bob Lippert told Fox News on Thursday morning. DeVos was in Ohio earlier this month to tour a career center and a correctional treatment program. One of the more controversial figures in the Trump administration, she assumed office as secretary of the Education Department in February 2017. PROTESTERS BLOCK DEVOS FROM ENTERING DC SCHOOL She\u2019s a proponent of school choice and charter schools \u2013 which has resulted in large protests when she addresses college students. Her decision to rescind an Obama-era guidance instructing how college campuses investigate allegations of campus sexual assault was also met with indignation. DeVos and her husband are known for their philanthropic work \u2013 especially when it comes to education \u2013 in their home state of Michigan. SEN. MARK WARNER\u2019S OFFICE VANDALIZED; SUSPECT ARRESTED A spokeswoman previously announced that DeVos plans to donate her nearly $200,000 salary to charities that focus on special needs and education. She also travels on her own private plane, but foots the bill, The Associated Press reported. The Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family.\u00a0According to MarineTraffic.com, the yacht was back in Harbor Springs, Michigan, Thursday morning. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " The Department of Education said it will cancel $150 million of student loan debt, impacting about 15,000 people whose schools closed. The Obama-era borrower defense relief program \u2013 which essentially ground to a halt under Education Secretary Betsy Devos \u2013 provided a path for people to seek forgiveness for federal student loans if a shuttered school violated specific laws or misled students. DeVos was highly critical of the program, reportedly calling it a \u201cfree money\u201d giveaway, and sought to change and delay the program. However, she was sued, and a federal judge ruled in September the program needed to \u201cgo into effect.\u201d Those eligible for loan forgiveness must have been enrolled at the school when it closed and not enrolled at another Title-IV school within three years of the previous school\u2019s closing, according to the Education Department. PLUS loans \u2013 which parents took out on behalf of children \u2013 could also be eligible for discharge. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT UNVEILS NEW TITLE IX GUIDANCE FOR CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT: HERE\u2019S WHAT WILL CHANGE So far, about 15,000 people have been flagged by the Education Department as eligible. About $80 million of the $150 million debt is attributed to the now-defunct Corinthian schools. Borrowers will begin to be notified of student loan discharges by email on Friday, the department said. BETSY DEVOS CONSIDERING ALLOWING STATES TO USE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BUY GUNS: REPORT \u201cThis is a good first step, but it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Education Committee. She called on DeVos to \u201cabandon her attempts to rewrite the borrower defense rule to let for-profit colleges off the hook and instead fully implement the current rule and provide relief to more than 100,000 borrowers who were cheated out of their education and savings.\u201d Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Education Committee chair, previously argued the \u201cObama administration went too far in rewriting this provision by setting overly broad and vague standards and as a result, put taxpayers on the hook for too many loans.\u201d",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos did not make \"active or extensive\" use of her personal email accounts to conduct official business, according to an internal watchdog inquiry long pushed by House Democrats that concluded with a whimper on Monday. Congressional Democrats for months have aggressively pursued a variety of probes into DeVos, who has frustrated liberal lawmakers by embracing deregulation and methodically dismantling the Obama administration's education platform. But this particular review largely came up empty, with the Education Department's\u00a0Office of Inspector General\u00a0saying it searched the department's email system and found only a \"limited\" number of messages to or from DeVos' personal accounts. In total, the watchdog said there were \"fewer than 100\" emails linked to four personal accounts. Most of the emails were from the first six months of 2017, soon after DeVos took office, and most were from a single person, the inquiry found. DEVOS BLASTS 'SHAMEFUL' MEDIA COVERAGE OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS PROPOSED\u00a0CUTS The person, who was not identified in the report, was writing to recommend candidates for agency jobs. Other emails were from people who congratulated DeVos on her confirmation or offered other job advice. The secretary's office told investigators it was taking \"additional steps to identify and preserve\" emails in her personal accounts. A department spokeswoman declined to comment. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DEVOS TAKES EXCEPTION WITH JOE BIDEN FOR SAYING WE NEED TO END TRUMP-DEVOS EDUCATION AGENDA Under department rules, employees are forbidden from using personal emails for government business except in rare circumstances when their work accounts are unavailable. In those cases, employees are required to forward the messages to their work accounts within 20 days. But in DeVos' case, the report said, that never happened. \"We did not identify any instances where the secretary forwarded emails from her personal accounts to her department email accounts,\" the report said. It added that \"the secretary's emails related to government business were not always being properly preserved.\" The inspector general's office urged the department to improve its training on the issue. It said there was no other evidence of irregularities around the use of personal emails. During his 2016 campaign, President\u00a0Trump repeatedly attacked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over findings that she used a private email server for work while she was secretary of state. At rallies, Trump often called for her prosecution and led supporters in chants of \"lock her up!\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DeVos, unlike Clinton's subordinates, did not delete tens of thousands of emails that were subpoeaned by Congress, nor did DeVos maintain private email servers hosted in her homes. Additionally, none of the emails sent by DeVos involved classified information, while several emails that found their way onto Clinton's personal email server contained classified materials -- including messages that were marked classified at the time they were sent. The Education Department review was requested in October 2017 by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. However, the inspector general's office said it was unable to begin work until \"well into 2018\" because of staffing challenges. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco. She also fined the Education Department $100,000. Kim previously ordered DeVos to stop collecting federal loans from former Corinthian Colleges students who applied for loan forgiveness after the chain shut down in 2015 amid allegations of fraud. The Obama administration sought to make it easier for defrauded students to get loans forgiven, but the Trump administration has worked to tighten the rules. The Education Department acknowledged in September that it continued to collect loans from more than 3,000 former Corinthian students, prompting Kim's response.

The move comes after the Education Department continued to garnish wages and seize tax returns of nearly 1,800 borrowers who were granted loan forgiveness by the courts under the borrower defense to repayment program, after Corinthian -- embroiled in scandal and bankruptcy\u00a0--\u00a0was forced to close in 2015, the court said. The initiative sought to provide loan relief to students who were misled by the school, but DeVos,\u00a0a Trump appointee, tried to limit the scope of the program even after a judge's ruling in 2018. \u201cGiven that there are over 16,000 borrowers who have suffered damages from [the] defendants\u2019 violation of the preliminary injunction, and given that there may be some administrative expenses to remedy the harm, the court finds the amount reasonable,\u201d Sallie Kim, a federal magistrate judge in California, wrote in a court order.

Instead, the judge said DeVos implemented a new methodology that calculated a borrower's eligibility for partial loan forgiveness based on their average earnings. The judge also said that the Education Department \"mistakenly notified at least 3,000 Corinthian borrowers that their loans are entering repayment, rather than stopped collection or forbearance status.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Kim threatened to \"impose additional sanctions, including the appointment of a Special Master to ensure compliance with the preliminary injunction\u201d if DeVos and the\u00a0Education Department\u00a0 \u201cfail to comply\u201d with the order.",
