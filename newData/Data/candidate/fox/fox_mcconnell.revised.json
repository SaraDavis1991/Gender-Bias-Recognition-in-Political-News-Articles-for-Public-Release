      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0met with 9/11 first responders on Tuesday after comedian and advocate Jon Stewart accused McConnell of having used\u00a0the victim's compensation fund as a \"political football.\" \"McConnell made a commitment he's going to help get a piece of legislation that's going to pass the House in July for a vote in August in the\u00a0Senate. We wanted it as soon as possible, and to get the Senate Majority Leader's commitment means a lot,\"\u00a0John Feal, a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site and a longtime activist, said Tuesday after the\u00a0meeting with McConnell at the Capitol. 9/11 VICTIMS FUND BILL PASSES HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, A DAY AFTER JON STEWART'S FIERY TESTIMONY \"They work for us. The chairs that they put their a--es in, the pens that they use, the pads that they write on, we pay for that sh--,\" Feal added. \"That\u2019s us. They work for us. Mitch McConnell works for us. He works for all of you guys. Today Mitch McConnell promised to work for us. I\u2019m going to take him for his word.\" McConnell has been criticized by advocates of the legislation to extend the $7.4 billion fund, which will run out of money in December 2020, claiming his inaction in the past has stalled the progress of legislation to replenish\u00a0the fund.\u00a0The Justice Department said in February the victims' compensation\u00a0fund is being depleted and benefit payments are being cut by up to 70 percent, a source of deep frustration for advocates who want to see victims and\u00a0families afforded financial security to cope with lingering diseases from the attacks. Joined by other first responders from the NYPD, Feal expressed that he is \"a ball of emotions,\" particularly in light of the impending death of his friend and colleague,\u00a0retired NYPD Detective Luis Alvarez who gave his final interview to Fox News' Shepard Smith on Thursday as he suffers from liver failure after his battle with cancer, a result of his service after the September 11th attacks. \"We're going to leave here and Luis Alvarez is going to die,\" Feal said, choking up with emotion.\u00a0\"In that meeting, we gave McConnell Alvarez's badge. We wanted the Senate Majority Leader to be reminded of people like Alvarez. He's got his badge now. If he strays from his commitment, then we'll go back into attack mode but for now, we'll put down our swords, pick up our rakes, we'll farm and be with our friends who are sick and dying.\" The\u00a0House Judiciary Committee\u00a0passed a reauthorization bill for the\u00a09/11 Victims\u2019 Compensation Fund\u00a0on Wednesday, where it will now move to the full House and is expected to pass with bipartisan support. Advocates have rallied to keep the bill alive until 2090, the expected lifespan of first responders who developed illnesses from inhaling toxic fumes during recovery efforts and while clearing rubble at the World Trade Center,\u00a0the Pentagon\u00a0and Shanksville, Pa. following the terrorist attacks in 2001. More than 2,000 firefighters, police officers, federal agents and other first responders\u00a0have died from 9/11-related diseases and that\u00a0number is expected to climb over time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's World Trade Center Health Program. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Critics have opposed making the bill open-ended, while advocates have cited\u00a0the terminal illnesses that many first responders continue to face.\u00a0More than 40,000 people have applied to the fund and over\u00a0$5 billion in benefits have been awarded out of the $7.4 billion fund\u00a0with about 21,000 claims still pending.",

      "content": " Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao tried to intercede between protesters and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as they continually asked McConnell why he was \"separating families,\" at an event in Washington, D.C. on Monday. The couple was departing an event held at Georgetown University, The Hill reported, when the individuals approached the building. Video of the moment was tweeted\u00a0Tuesday by Hillary Clinton adviser Adam Parkhomenko, and seemed to originate from Twitter\u00a0user Roberto,\u00a0who identified himself as being amongst the group. \u201cWhy don't you leave my husband alone?\u201d Chao said. Chao was later heard saying \u201cHe is not,\u201d seemingly in response to the repeated questions about \u201cseparating families.\u201d 17 STATES FILE LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES OVER FAMILY SEPARATIONS Before she was ultimately escorted back to her waiting vehicle, another protester asked the cabinet official how she and her husband could sleep at night. McConnell\u2019s office did not comment to Fox News. The encounter comes amid a controversial \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy that\u2019s led to migrant children getting split up from their parents after coming across the U.S. border. Following backlash, President Trump last week signed an executive order allowing children to remain with their families. Along with the video, Roberto tweeted \u201cWe confronted @SenateMajLdr and @SecElaineChao with @ProPublica audio of children separated from their families at the border while leaving a @Georgetown event. We must #AbolishICE & #AbolishCBP! #FreedomforImmigrants.\u201d Describing himself as \u201ca rising senior\u201d at the university, he explained that he learned about the officials\u2019 visit to campus from a friend after returning from his \u201cinternship at United We Dream.\u201d LAWYER VISITING \u2018DEVASTATED\u2019 PARENTS SEPARATED FROM KIDS SAYS MOST DON\u2019T KNOW WHERE THEIR CHILD IS \u201cMy parents are Mexican immigrants, and I was infuriated that a man who blocked the Dream Act and a Trump cabinet official were invited to my campus,\u201d Roberto tweeted. \u201cAs a result, my friends quickly mobilized and went to the event that was held inside Copley Formal.\u201d He referenced the exchange between Chao and the protesters, adding, \u201cMy question is why they won\u2019t leave our families, friends and communities alone? As my friend said, \u2018how do you sleep at night?\u2019 #FreedomForImmigrants.\u201d \u201cAnd to be honest, I cannot fathom how these movers of racism, discrimination and hate sleep at night,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cCabinet officials like Elaine Chao might not like to hear it but she and her husband bear responsibility and we won\u2019t stop telling that truth everywhere they go. #AbolishICE.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Charles Creitz, Chad Pergram, John Roberts and Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " In\u00a0unusually forceful, angry, and personal\u00a0terms,\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday countered what he called\u00a0\"baseless smears\" from left-wing media and vowed not to be \"intimidated,\" in the wake of a Washington Post op-ed that declared McConnell a \"Russian asset.\" That op-ed was written by\u00a0columnist Dana Milbank, whom McConnell bluntly suggested was one of several\u00a0\"hyperventilating hacks\" who conveniently had ignored former President Obama's \"feckless\" Russia policies. Milbank had argued that McConnell's opposition to several election-security bills proposed by Democrats effectively made him an unwitting Russian agent, and other pundits quickly echoed Milbank's argument.\u00a0On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday, host Joe Scarborough repeatedly called McConnell \"Moscow Mitch,\" saying he was \"aiding and abetting\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts\u00a0to \"subvert\" American elections -- and even alleging a Russia-linked investment in Kentucky could be\u00a0playing a part. \"I don't normally take the time to respond to critics in the media when they have no clue what they're talking about,\" McConnell said. \"But, this modern-day McCarthyism is toxic, and damaging, because of the way it warps our entire public discourse. \"Facts matter,\" McConnell said sternly. \"Details matter. History matters, and if our nation is losing our ability to debate public policy without screaming about treason, that really matters. In the middle of the 20th century, the original McCarthyism\u00a0hurt America's strength and diminished our standing in the Cold War by dividing us against ourselves.\" MSNBC PANIC: ANALYST SAYS THIS COULD BE THE LAST FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY In response,\u00a0Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor at The Washington Post, told Fox News: \u201cDana Milbank\u2019s column was a legitimate exercise in commentary, making the argument that Sen. McConnell\u2019s blocking of elections-security legislation will harm the United States and work to Russia\u2019s advantage. Of course it\u2019s equally legitimate for Mr. McConnell to express a contrary view, but the Milbank argument has nothing to do with McCarthyism.\u201d McConnell, however, said the \"outrage-industrial complex\" had ignored his legitimate and principled objections to Democrats' proposed election-security bills. For example, McConnell\u00a0noted that the New York Times editorial board this weekend wrote that he \"has long opposed federal involvement in election management\" and as far back as 2002,\u00a0\"repeatedly\u00a0spoke out against a one-size-fits-all approach\u00a0in favor of leaving election matters up to the states.\" One of the Democrats' proposals would have federally mandated the use of paper ballots as well as voting machines that do not directly connect to the Internet,\u00a0and included funding for the federal Election Assistance Commission. The bill passed\u00a0the House 225-184, with only one Republican vote, and McConnell then killed Democrats' bid\u00a0to pass it in the Senate via unanimous consent. On Monday, McConnell chastised Democrats for the \"partisan\" maneuver, saying they knew the bill never had a chance of passing by unanimous consent, which can be blocked\u00a0by a single senator. Republicans have also said Democrats are playing politics by\u00a0seeking election-security funding that has already been allocated for that purpose. Last year, Republicans allocated $380 million to the states for election security in a funding bill, although the move\u00a0attracted little attention. States still have available grant money to spend from that allocation. First Amendment concerns have also been raised about another bill proposed by Democrats, which would require campaigns to disclose all contacts with foreign individuals\u00a0to the FBI. That, too, would be an unprecedented federal overreach into state-level elections, McConnell said. SCARBOROUGH CALLS MCCONNELL 'MOSCOW MITCH,' ESCALATING TREASON ACCUSATIONS Still, he made clear he didn't think Democrats actually cared about his reasoning. \"This modern-day McCarthyism was pushed by big-time outlets,\" McConnell said. \"The smear that I am 'a Russian asset'\u00a0ran in the opinion pages of the Washington Post. The accusation that I am 'un-American'\u00a0was broadcast on MSNBC.\u00a0This is the state of left-wing politics in 2019.\" He added: \"These people have worn out the volume knobs so badly that they have nothing left but the most unhinged smears,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"Welcome to modern-day McCarthyism. McCarthy-like tactics out in the open for everyone to see.\" Speaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated he was perplexed by Republicans' opposition to the bills. \"I still don't have a really good idea why Leader\u00a0McConnell won't do something on election security,\" Schumer said. He added that it would be a \"mistake to elevate\" a \"partisan warrior\" to be the director of national intelligence (DNI), in a jab at Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe, whom Trump named to replace outgoing DNI Dan Coats. Schumer said if administration officials give the president information he doesn\u2019t want to hear, \"you\u2019re either fired, or you\u2019re frozen out and you quit.\" But, McConnell, who\u00a0entered the Senate in 1985, said he has distinguished himself as staunchly loyal to the United States and deeply skeptical of the Soviet Union and, later, Russia. \"I'm proud of my record, I'm proud that it's right there in black and white, and liars cannot gaslight it away,\"\u00a0 McConnell said. TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER' The majority leader noted that in the 1980s he stood with then-President Ronald Reagan on missile defense and his Soviet policy. He also said he was \"honored\" to \"watch Communism crumble,\" before later \"sounding the alarm\" when then-President Bill Clinton was \"too soft on Russia.\" \"I used hearings to grill Democratic officials who were soft on President [Boris] Yeltsin and optimistic about President-elect Putin,\" McConnell said, noting that many Democrats were less skeptical about Putin. \"And, of course, I helped lead the charge against the Obama administration's completely feckless Russia policies. President Obama mocked his 2012 opponent for taking Russia too seriously. His administration sought a naive reset with the Kremlin and for eight years I helped lead the charge against that weakness. \"In 2010, I stood with [Arizona GOP Sens.] John McCain and John Kyl to oppose the new START treaty, a watered-down placeholder for the sort of tough stance we knew was necessary,\" McConnell\u00a0added, after mentioning Putin's aggression in Crimea under Obama. \"As Vladimir Putin was building up his nuclear arsenal, we even had to push President Obama to commit to deploying capable missile defenses to Europe.\" TRUMP AIDE TO HEAD TO GREECE TO RETRIEVE MYSTERIOUS $10G PAYMENT HE SAYS WAS FROM FBI OR CIA \"In 2012, I firmly supported sweeping legislation to authorize heavy sanctions following the killing of Sergei\u00a0Magnitsky in a Russian prison. The Obama administration flinched and tried to tiptoe\u00a0around our legislation to avoid messing up their charm offensive, but we backed them into a corner and the president signed the bill into law.\" McConnell concluded: \"Let me make this crystal clear for the hyperventilating hacks who haven\u2019t actually followed this issue. Every single member of the Senate agrees that Russia meddling was real and is real. We all agree that the federal government, state government and the private sector all have obligations to take this threat seriously and bolster our defenses.\u00a0Claims to the contrary--\u00a0that anybody here denies what Russians did on President Obama\u2019s watch -- are just lies, not partisan distortion, not clever spin, just total fabrications.\" Last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee released\u00a0the first volume\u00a0of its long-awaited report into Russian election interference efforts, providing new details on how\u00a0Russian government hackers \"directed extensive activity against U.S. election infrastructure\" -- and potentially identified vulnerabilities that they can exploit in upcoming elections. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, the committee said a major purpose of Russia's involvement may have been to cause hysteria and affect America's confidence in democracy. In fact, the panel said, Russia may have wanted their activities to be discovered. \"While the Committee does not know with confidence what Moscow's intentions were, Russia may have been probing vulnerabilities in voting systems to exploit later,\" the report stated. \"Alternatively, Moscow may have sought to undermine confidence in the 2016 U.S. elections simply through the discovery of their activity.\" Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.",

McConnell responded to the clip by\u00a0stressing\u00a0that the Senate has \"never failed\" to address the issue, adding \"I'm not sure why he's all bent out of shape.\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0of encouraging threats against the senator\u00a0and \"trying to dox some underage kids\" after she blasted a group of McConnell-supporting boys\u00a0who took a controversial photo with a cardboard\u00a0cutout of her during a recent Kentucky political event. \"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and liberal Twitter personalities are trying to dox some underage kids for taking a photo with a cutout at the Fancy Farm political picnic and are cheering on thousands of accounts calling for Senator McConnell to 'break his neck,\u2019\" Team Mitch, the Kentucky Republican's campaign account, tweeted on Tuesday. AOC SLAMS MCCONNELL AFTER PHOTO OF YOUNG MEN IN 'TEAM MITCH' T-SHIRTS 'GROPING' CUTOUT SURFACES Doxxing is a term used to describe the practice of revealing personal information, like addresses or phone numbers, about a private individual online. McConnell's campaign did not elaborate when Fox News requested details about the allegation against Ocasio-Cortez. In a tweet Monday, Ocasio-Cortez did not explicitly call for harassment or threats but\u00a0she prompted a wave of negative reactions to the boys when she suggested\u00a0that\u00a0their gestures -- \"groping\" and \"choking\"\u00a0the cut-out, as she alleged --\u00a0represented the\u00a0\"culture\" of McConnell's campaign. \"Hey\u00a0@senatemajldr - these young men look like they work for you,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted at McConnell on Monday.\u00a0\"Just wanted to clarify: are you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\" The photo was reportedly posted on Facebook alongside the caption \"break me off a piece of that.\" After Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, McConnell's campaign responded by distancing\u00a0itself from the photo, clarifying that the boys weren't employees of the campaign. \u201cTeam Mitch in no way condones any aggressive, suggestive, or demeaning act toward life-sized cardboard cutouts of any gender,\u201d campaign spokesman Kevin Golden said, according to the New York Post. OCASIO-CORTEZ DEMANDS MCCONNELL STOP 'GIVING BOGUS EXCUSES' AND PASS GUN BACKGROUND CHECK BILL Golden added: \u201cThese young men are not campaign staff, they\u2019re high schoolers and it\u2019s incredible that the national media has sought to once again paint a target on their backs rather than report real, and significant news in our country.\" McConnell's campaign appeared to downplay the photo by comparing it to one that a former aide to President Obama\u00a0took after his election in 2008. The photo, posted at the end of 2008, showed Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau appearing to grope a cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton, then Obama's choice for secretary of state. \"Team Mitch in no way condones any aggressive, suggestive, or demeaning act toward life-sized cardboard cut outs of any gender in a manner similar to what we saw from President Obama\u2019s speechwriting staff several years ago,\u201d Golden told The Washington Post. Also Tuesday, McConnell's campaign appeared to tie Ocasio-Cortez's tweet to another incident in which supporters of McConnell's opponent, Amy McGrath, allegedly \"stormed\" McConnell's home in Louisville. \"Last night, an angry left-wing mob of Amy McGrath supporters stormed Senator McConnell\u2019s Louisville home screaming obscenities and hoping someone would \u2018just stab the motherf---r in the heart,'\" the campaign tweeted. McConnell's campaign also said they have been in touch with law enforcement in response to recent threats made against the senator. The campaign accused\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0and other liberals on Twitter\u00a0of \u201ccheering on\u201d these threats. \u201cThese threats go far beyond a political cartoon or a broken shoulder,\u201d McConnell\u2019s campaign said, referencing the Kentucky senator\u2019s recent injury, \u201cthey are serious calls to physical violence and we\u2019ve alerted law enforcement.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee on Thursday said it won't spend money on Twitter until the situation is \"adequately addressed.\" A top official with the Republican National Committee also said the RNC and the Trump campaign would not spend money with Twitter \"until they address this disgusting bias.\" Meanwhile, the White House for weeks has been\u00a0hinting\u00a0at possible action in relation to how social media outlets treat conservatives.\u00a0A White House official told Fox News\u00a0the administration is \"exploring all policy solutions.\"\u00a0The administration has circulated drafts of a possible executive order from Trump, following a summit last month where he met with conservative social media influencers, according to Politico. TWITTER LOCKS OUT MCCONNELL'S CAMPAIGN FOR POSTING VIDEO OF CALLS FOR VIOLENCE AT HIS HOME \u201cIf the internet is going to be presented as this egalitarian platform and most of Twitter is liberal cesspools of venom, then at least the president wants some fairness in the system,\u201d a White House official told the outlet. It is unclear what the order will entail or how it would aim to curb social media bias but it reportedly deals with other issues as well. The latest example of conservative outrage at social media: Twitter froze the\u00a0McConnell campaign\u2019s \"Team Mitch\" account this week after the campaign\u00a0posted videos of protesters outside McConnell\u2019s home, which included violent threats against the Kentucky senator. The episode prompted the McConnell campaign to\u00a0slam Twitter for political bias, saying the social media platform had effectively blamed the victim.

In addition to a potential executive order, the White House is planning a summit with technology companies on Friday aimed at combatting extremism online. This comes after President Trump discussed the dangers on the internet during an address following last weekend\u2019s shootings in El Paso and Dayton.

According to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, support for the policy has dropped as concerns arise that it could lead to higher taxes and longer waits for health care.

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, known for years by the hardboiled moniker\u00a0\"Cocaine Mitch,\" told community leaders in his hometown Kentucky on Monday that he wants a new nickname to reflect what he plans to do to a slew of far-left progressive policy proposals: \"grim reaper.\" McConnell has long framed the upcoming 2020 elections as a referendum on what he has called the \"full socialism on display\" from prominent Democrat Party members, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential contenders Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten\u00a0Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris. On Monday, the longtime incumbent was positioning the Senate as a bulwark to defend capitalism, even in the event President Trump doesn't win re-election in 2020. \"You pass the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, you have fundamentally changed this country, fundamentally changed it into an unproductive place with significant unemployment and huge problems,\" McConnell\u00a0told supporters in\u00a0Owensboro, Kentucky.\u00a0\"I don't want you to think this is just a couple of nutcases running around on the fringe. This is pervasive policy view on the other side.\" NYC MAYOR SAYS GREEN NEW DEAL WILL GET RID OF PESKY GLASS SKYSCRAPERS McConnell added, according to multiple reports: \"If I'm still the majority leader of the Senate after next year, none of those things are going to pass the Senate. They won't even be voted on. So think of me as the grim reaper. None of that stuff is going to pass. None of it.\" McConnell brought Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal resolution to a vote in the Senate in March, and it did not secure a single affirmative vote from Democrats, who charged that the the move was a stunt. McConnell later admitted in an interview with Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" that the vote was indeed \"for show.\" But it would be a grave mistake, McConnell warned Monday, to underestimate the threat posted by the \"pervasive\" rise of socialism. \"We are having a legitimate debate about the virtues of socialism, and I don't want you to think it's just a 28-year-old congresswoman from New York,\" McConnell said. \"This is much broader than that. I've got five colleagues in the Senate, five colleagues running for president, who have signed on to the Green New Deal and Medicare For All.\" McConnell has also cautioned that Amy Klobuchar, a relative moderate 2020 Democratic contender who has called for a public option instead of universal Medicare, would similarly\u00a0destroy the private insurance industry and cause major problems for the health care system. McConnell, who first became a senator in 1985,\u00a0is up for reelection in 2020, and he formally launched his campaign last week by emphasizing his work on tax cuts and federal judicial confirmations.

Earlier this year, Matt Jones, a Kentucky sports radio personality who has weighed a bid against McConnell, told reporters that he wanted to see a new face in office. \u201cSomebody in Kentucky has got to step up and do this,\" Jones said. \"And it will be a huge challenge, this guy is almost impossible to beat, but it\u2019s possible.\" Last month, a campaign to enlist former figher pilot Amy McGrath to run against McConnell began fundraising. \u201cThere is incredible grassroots energy for Amy McGrath to run against Mitch McConnell,\u201d\u00a0Ryan Aquilina, who runs the Ditch Mitch project, said at the time. \u201cWe had one of our best days ever in terms of fundraising, and that proves in no uncertain terms just how much appetite there is for Amy to run and to defeat Mitch McConnell.\"",

      "content": " Senate Republican leaders on Monday unloaded on Democrats over their revived efforts to push college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accusing them of engaging in \u201cnot normal political behavior.\u201d McConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor Monday afternoon to decry what he described as a familiar \u201cpattern\u201d involving Kavanaugh allegations: \u201cShoot first, correct the facts later.\u201d He accused Democrats of \u201crushing to exploit\u201d the new accusations and \u201chysterically\u201d demanding his impeachment, but maintained that a majority of senators were\u00a0right to confirm him last year. He also accused Democrats of deploying the \u201cpolitics of personal destruction\u201d in their handling of both sets of allegations. 2020 DEMOCRATS IGNORE KAVANAUGH STORY CORRECTION AFTER DEMANDING IMPEACHMENT \u201cIt\u2019s just as transparent and self-serving today,\u201d McConnell said. In his blistering floor speech, he went on to rebuke several Senate Democrats for a recent brief that urged the Supreme Court to \u201cheal itself\u201d or face restructuring \u2013 which was widely seen as a threat of court-packing.\n\n\n\u201cThis is not normal political behavior,\u201d McConnell said. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Judiciary Committee chairman who mounted one of the most passionate defenses of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, called the attacks \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d \u201cMy heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again,\u201d he tweeted. Many of the Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020 over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing The New York Times' reporting of a disputed allegation of sexual misconduct. But\u00a0Graham insisted that wouldn't happen. \u201cAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations,\u201d Graham tweeted. Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who led the Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh hearings, said his office never \"received an allegation against Kavanaugh like the one referenced in the report over the weekend.\" \"We now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted only in unnamed sources, with no direct knowledge of the event, and that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t even remember,\" Grassley said. \"Since when did that become something 'fit to print'\u00a0by the supposed American paper of record?\" By late Sunday, the paper had revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question. President Trump repeatedly ripped the paper on Monday. \"The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys,\" he tweeted Monday afternoon, reacting to quotes from Fox News' Greg Gutfeld. \"The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn\u2019t even remember the event.\" As for Democrats, California Sen. Kamala Harris,\u00a0who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh \u201cmust be impeached,\u201d\u00a0did not back down in a new tweet Monday, writing:\u00a0\u201cThe reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity \u2014 there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.\u201d The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro tweeted in response: \u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote: \u201cLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d NYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT While 2020 Democrats did not back down from their impeachment calls, despite the Times revision, top Democrats in Congress appeared less eager. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.,\u00a0seemed to brush off his party's calls to launch impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh,\u00a0saying on a radio show Monday: \u201cWe have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters: \u201cI am saying nothing on Kavanaugh right now.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Judson Berger, Chad Pergram and\u00a0Gregory Re contributed to this report.",

Video obtained by TMZ shows at least one diner berating McConnell on issues such as Social Security at a restaurant in Louisville.\u00a0The video starts with him yelling at McConnell and arguing with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- to whom McConnell is married. The outlet reported that four men first confronted McConnell. \u201cOh yeh, why don\u2019t you get out of here? Why don\u2019t you leave our entire country,\u201d the protester tells the couple. As Chao argues with the protester, McConnell appears unperturbed\u00a0and sips on a drink. But other diners begin yelling at the protester, telling him to \u201cleave him alone\u201d and making shoo-ing gestures. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come for Social Security,\u201d he told the other diners, before appearing to be approached by staff. CRUZ CONFRONTED BY 2 PROTESTERS OVER HIS VOTE TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH: REPORT According to TMZ, the woman who recorded the incident said the protester slammed his fists on McConnell\u2019s table and threw food out of the restaurant after accusing McConnell of killing people with his views. McConnell reportedly later thanked some of the supporters and shook their hands. \"The Leader and Sec. Chao enjoyed their meal in Louisville last night and they appreciate those who spoke up against incivility,\" McConnell spokesman David Popp said in a statement.\u00a0\"They hope other patrons weren't too inconvenienced by left-wing tantrums. As the Leader often says, the Senate will not be intimidated by the antics of far-left protestors.\" The incident marks the latest hounding of a Republican or Trump administration official from a restaurant. Last month Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was forced out of a restaurant by protesters angry at his support of the confirmation of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. McConnell and Chao were confronted by protesters earlier in the year as they left an event at Georgetown University. Chao stood up to the protesters and told them to \u201cleave my husband alone.\u201d MCCONNELL SAYS PROTESTERS WHO CONFRONTED HIM 'WAITED' UNTIL WIFE ELAINE CHAO WAS GONE In July, McConnell was confronted by more protesters as he left a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky. Protesters reportedly yelled \u201cabolish ICE\u201d and \u201cno justice, no peace.\u201d \u201cI see what they did here. They waited until Elaine wasn\u2019t around,\u201d McConnell subsequently tweeted. Fox News\u2019 Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.",

In the CNN interview, the Democratic candidate was asked to explain her statement that,\u00a0\u201cThe only feeling I can describe that\u2019s any close to it was the feeling I had after 9/11.\u201d TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES McGrath told host Jake Tapper that she was\u00a0comparing how she \u201ctook stock\u201d of the state of the country after the 2016 election with how she reacted to the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cYou know many of us were spurred into action by what happened\u00a0in 2016, the labeling of each other as they\u2019re all communists, or they\u2019re all this, or they\u2019re all that, and the fake news.\u00a0The divisiveness of our country was something I had never seen before,\u201d McGrath said. Looking back, McGrath admitted she \u201ccan see why, you know, folks might be upset about that.\u201d But then just as the interview was wrapping up, McGrath awkwardly signed off by telling Tapper, \u201cGreat to have you\u201d -- a line typically used by news anchors, not their guests.

In the brief video, McConnell accuses House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being \u201cin the clutches of a left-wing mob\u201d pushing her toward\u00a0impeaching the president, while promising to stand in her way. NANCY PELOSI LEADS CHARGE ON IMPEACHMENT \u201cAll of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as Majority Leader,\u201d he declares. He closes by saying, \u201cBut I need your help,\u201d as he requests\u00a0campaign donations. Marine veterans Amy McGrath and Mike Broihier are among the Democrats currently vying for the chance to face McConnell in 2020. While the primary is far from settled, McConnell\u2019s ad indicates that in the current fight over impeachment,\u00a0he intends to protect Trump from Democrats\u2019 efforts to remove him, even before articles of impeachment have been drafted. McConnell's support was not necessarily in question, but a few GOP senators in recent days have spoken out against the president, over his now-public request for Ukraine to \"look into\" Democratic presidential primary candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in the country. The criticism escalated after Trump made a similar request, during a session with reporters, to\u00a0China. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Trump displayed \"appalling\" behavior by asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for Trump to ask China to investigate the Bidens. Should the House vote to impeach Trump, the matter would go to trial before the Senate \u2014\u00a0where Republicans could easily brush back the impeachment effort if they largely hold together. In a CNBC interview last week, McConnell acknowledged that he \u201cwould have no choice but to take it up\u201d if the House approves impeachment articles. But he added the caveat, \u201cHow long you\u2019re on it is a whole different matter.\u201d The odds of McConnell being put in that position seemingly increased over the weekend, as a senior\u00a0member of the House Democratic Caucus told Fox News they believe there are enough Democrats currently supporting impeachment to get the required House majority to pass articles of impeachment. The senior member based this belief on the 227 Democrats in the House who have expressed support for\u00a0an impeachment inquiry. Democrats investigating Trump had earlier\u00a0been focusing their efforts on suspicion that he obstructed justice by trying to impede the investigation of Russian election interference. Pelosi had been holding off impeachment efforts for months \u2014\u00a0but was eventually swayed after a whistleblower complaint accused Trump of pressuring\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over a potential Biden probe. On Sunday, attorneys for the whistleblower confirmed they also are representing\u00a0a second whistleblower with information backing up the initial complaint. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has denied wrongdoing, while turning up criticism of the Bidens. \"The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,\" he tweeted over the weekend.

Nike pulled the Air Max 1 USA shoe, which included a Revolutionary-era U.S. flag with 13 white stars in a circle on the heel. Kaepernick reached out to Nike after learning they planned to release the sneaker to explain that the flag recalls an era when black people were enslaved and that it has been appropriated by white nationalist groups, a person familiar with the conversation told The Associated Press. Nike decided to recall the shoe after it had been already sent to retailers to go on sale this week for the July Fourth holiday, according to the Wall Street Journal. COLIN KAEPERNICK MAY NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHO BETSY ROSS IS, DR. ALVEDA KING SAYS The decision caused an instant backlash among conservatives who accused Nike of denigrating U.S. history. \"If we\u2019re in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans, I think we've got a problem,\" McConnell said on Tuesday, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. \"I hope Nike either releases these shoes or some other shoe maker picks up the flag, puts it on a pair of shoes and starts selling it.

Although some extremist groups appear to have appropriated the flag, it is not widely viewed as a symbol of hate, and is used in museums that focus on 18th century U.S. history. The Anti-Defamation League does not include it in its database of hate symbols. Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow for the ADL's Center on Extremism, said extremist groups have occasionally used it, but the flag is most commonly used by people for patriotic purposes. \"We view it as essentially an innocuous historical flag,\" Pitcavage said. \"It's not a thing in the white supremacist movement.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nike said in statement that \"it pulled the shoe based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday.\" The company pushed back against criticism that the decision was being \"anti-American.\" \"Nike is a company proud of its American heritage and our continuing engagement supporting thousands of American athletes including the U.S. Olympic team and U.S. Soccer teams,\" Nike said.

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take up articles of impeachment against President Trump should the House of Representatives approve them following their formal impeachment inquiry. In an interview with CNBC, McConnell, R-Ky., was asked whether he would bring articles of impeachment for a vote should they reach the Senate. IMPEACHMENT PROBE RAPIDLY WIDENS AS DEMS FIRE OFF SUBPOENAS, SET TESTIMONY \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long you\u2019re on it is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on [the] Senate rule on impeachment.\u201d The comments affirm that McConnell, even as he blasts Democratic tactics from the floor, would not let impeachment articles languish. Depending on how the House proceeds,\u00a0this raises the possibility of a Senate trial just as the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses are set to begin in early 2020 -- though Trump still enjoys broad support among Senate Republicans and would have to suffer enormous party defections to actually be ousted from office. Earlier this year, McConnell gave a similar assessment to NPR, saying that if impeachment \u201cwere to happen, the Senate has no choice. If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes to trial.\u201d But last week, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formal impeachment inquiry in the House, McConnell said he was \u201cnot going to address all of these\u2026hypotheticals.\u201d \u201cI think all of that is premature,\u201d he said. THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: HOW DOES REMOVING A PRESIDENT WORK? McConnell has now cleared the air on the heels of Pelosi's launch of an impeachment inquiry. The timetable for House action remains unclear, though Democrat-led committees are moving quickly to investigate allegations, first raised in a whistleblower complaint, that Trump improperly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. A transcript of that call shows Trump sought an investigation, but he denies wrongdoing and denies tying the request to U.S. aid. House Democrats, including Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., have\u00a0vowed to work expeditiously on the inquiry, with some reports indicating that Democrats could even be prepared to introduce formal articles of impeachment against Trump later this fall. Should the House introduce articles of impeachment, all that is needed to impeach Trump is a simple majority vote by those lawmakers present and voting. But at that point, removal from the Oval Office is hardly a certainty. The Senate, as McConnell indicated, would have to hold a \"trial.\" During such a\u00a0trial, House lawmakers serve as so-called \u201cmanagers,\u201d who basically fill the role that prosecutors would in a criminal trial and present evidence against the president. The president would be represented by his own counsel. The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial and the Senate acts as the jury \u2013 listening to the arguments from both sides before deliberating and voting on whether to remove the president from office. But it takes a two-thirds vote\u00a0to convict a president and remove him from office. While some Senate Republicans have voiced concerns about Trump's actions, impeachment does not at this stage appear to have enough support in the Senate to threaten Trump in the long run. Most GOP senators have stopped short of condemning the president for his controversial phone call, while others have outright defended him. \u201cThis seems to me like a political setup,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s all hearsay. You can\u2019t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistleblower didn\u2019t hear the phone call.\u201d The whistleblower acknowledged that the complaint was based on second-hand information.

      "content": " Eleven\u00a0years, five months and 10 days into his tenure as Senate Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell has now had the party\u2019s top spot longer than anyone. \u201cHe understands the Senate better than anybody else here,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Tuesday. Up until today, Former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was the longest serving Senate Republican leader. Former Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., had the job for five years, and believes it comes with challenges others in Washington never face. \u201cI think it\u2019s the toughest leadership job, political job, in this city,\u201d Lott said in an interview. \u201cWhen the president makes a decision the government moves, in the House when the Speaker makes a decision the rules committee takes care of it, in the Senate\u2026you lead and govern by the strength of your personality and respect for the rules.\u201d Lott believes McConnell\u2019s longevity sprouted from a style that stands out from previous party leaders. \u201cHe plays his cards very close to his chest, he is an interminable listener,\u201d Lott said. \u201cHe may not say much but he\u2019ll just sit there and listen and listen and listen.\u201d McConnell\u2019s majorities have successfully passed tax reform, but failed to achieve another top legislative goal: full repeal of Obamacare.\u00a0 And in 2010, he took heat for outlining a different priority. \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d McConnell told the National Journal. Obama was re-elected, but stymied by McConnell six years later when the outgoing president nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, and the GOP-lead Senate refused to consider it on the floor until after the 2016 election. \u201cWe think the most important principle in the middle of this presidential election, which is raging, is that the American people need to weigh and decide who is going to make this decision \u2013 not this lame duck president on the way out the door, but the next president next year,\u201d McConnell said in 2016. At the time, the Obama administration complained McConnell was breaking longstanding Senate tradition. \u201cWe\u2019re setting an incredibly dangerous precedent in the institution that I love,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said. But waiting worked in McConnell\u2019s favor, as Garland\u2019s nomination expired and the Senate later confirmed President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Tensions with Democrats seem to have cooled after the long-running high court conflict, and some are even offering kind words about McConnell\u2019s milestone. \u201cHe\u2019s reasonably able to control his people,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said. \u201cThat in and of itself is something to be credited with.\u201d But sometimes Republicans break ranks, like Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who once called McConnell out about the Export-Import Bank, from the floor of the Senate. \u201cI cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie,\u201d Cruz said in 2015. Then, there are the GOP candidates who try to capitalize on anti-McConnell sentiment in their home states. \u201cOne of my goals as U.S. senator will be to ditch \u2018Cocaine Mitch,\u201d Don Blankenship, third-place finisher in West Virginia\u2019s recent Republican Senate primary, said in a campaign advertisement. Ultimately in D.C., there\u2019s not much of an appetite to remove the Republican leader. \u201cHe\u2019s been right so many times,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said. \u201cIt builds confidence among his colleagues.\u201d",

In his\u00a0statement, Jones called the complaint \"absolute nonsense\" and disappointing from \"someone as powerful as McConnell.\" MCCONNELL: IF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WERE HELD TODAY, 'IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A REMOVAL' \"One would think that a man who has at his disposal all the media outlets in America, an unending supply of corporate donations and all the platforms a person could ever need would not be frightened of a sports radio show in Kentucky,\" Jones wrote. \"I have said repeatedly in public and in filings with the FEC that I am not yet a candidate and I haven't used the show to raise money or talk about my exploratory Committee in any way,\" he added. \"Nevertheless, Senator McConnell has complained that having me on air is unfair and the man who speaks about the importance of free speech and the exchange of ideas has decided to cut off mine.\" Jones has formed an exploratory committee to run as a Democrat against McConnell, WLKY-TV reported.\u00a0\u00a0Another Democrat, Amy McGrath, has already filed to run. McConnell's office did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment Thursday. Jones said over Twitter he does not blame iHeart Radio for being taken off the air. He said he hopes to work with the company and KSR in the future should he decide not to run.

Thanks to Senator McConnell that time will apparently start now.\" On Thursday, #FreeMattJones was trending on Twitter after news of the complaint got out. Several users accused McConnell and the GOP of suppressing free speech and hypocrisy.",

Days after the social media platform froze the \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d account over a video it posted of leftwing threats against the Republican Senate leader, the situation appeared to be resolved Friday as the campaign celebrated having Twitter access again.

McConnell appeared confident given the knowledge he has that if the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach Trump, the president will not be found guilty in his trial before the Senate. \u201cI will say I\u2019m pretty sure how it\u2019s likely to end,\u201d McConnell told reporters in Washington. \u201cIf it were today, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question it would not lead to a removal.\u201d NEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED It takes two-thirds of the Senate to convict a president and remove him from office. That means at least 20 Republicans would have to vote to convict Trump if he is impeached by the Democrat-controlled House. McConnell also questioned whether the six Democratic senators currently running for president in 2020 would want to take time off from campaigning\u00a0to attend what could be a lengthy trial in the Senate. \u201cThe question is how long the Senate wants to take,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long do the presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate instead of Iowa and New Hampshire?\u201d McConnell added: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to ascertain how long this takes. I\u2019d be surprised if it didn\u2019t end the way the two previous ones did, with the president not being removed from office,\u201d Neither of the last two presidents to face impeachment \u2013 Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2013 were removed from office. Nixon\u00a0resigned from office before he could face impeachment, while Clinton was impeached by the House but was acquitted by the Senate.

The two diplomats were part of a pivotal May meeting with Trump at the White House that raised red flags. They also engaged in a text message chain about the administration's actions toward Ukraine.

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he\u2019s canceled most of the chamber's traditional August recess, citing Democrats' \"obstruction\" and the need to pass spending bills. In a brief written statement, he said: \u201cSenators should expect to remain in session in August to pass legislation, including appropriations bills, and to make additional progress on the president\u2019s nominees.\u201d McConnell's announcement had been expected, as he's faced pressure for weeks from fellow Republicans to keep members in session over the hot summer stretch. Their appeal focused on the need to wrap up spending bills and confirm President Trump\u2019s nominees to various positions. McConnell cited exactly that in his statement Tuesday. \"Due to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president\u2019s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year, the August recess has been canceled,\" McConnell said. But the decision also keeps lawmakers in Washington during a critical period in the runup to November's midterm elections -- a controversial move. On one hand, the recess cancellation allows senators of both parties to show they're working hard. But Democrats may suggest there\u2019s an ulterior motive -- as it keeps several endangered members of their party off the campaign trail. Republicans hold a narrow, 51-49 seat edge in the Senate. In a strange electoral alignment, however, the overwhelming majority of seats up for election this year are held by Democrats -- many in states President Trump won. Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. and others are considered vulnerable this election cycle, and could suffer from time off the campaign trail. At the same time, Congress is facing very real deadlines. Congress and the president must come to terms with the next round of spending before Sept. 30. Democrats and Republicans are working feverishly behind the scenes to reach an accord before then. But another factor could scramble the appropriations process. Republicans recently cobbled together a \u201crescissions\u201d bill, which cancels spending Congress already allocated. The administration recently sent an updated version of that plan to Capitol Hill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has warned that the rescissions effort \u201cis going to make it harder to get the appropriations process moving forward in a bipartisan way.\u201d Schumer said Tuesday, though, that Democrats welcome the additional time to work on urgent matters in Washington \u2013 and called on Trump to stay in D.C. along with Congress. Not all is lost for senators, aides and other Capitol denizens hoping to relax. McConnell's office said senators will likely be on a break for the first full week of August before returning for the rest of the month.

In a tweet Tuesday, Trump compared the House impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine to \"a lynching,\" essentially likening the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. The president added: \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching.\" His words have brought bipartisan condemnation. McConnell, speaking to reporters, said \"that was an unfortunate choice of words.\" McConnell added: \"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching.\" But, some Republicans pointed to video showing prominent Democrats, including Reps. Gregory Meeks and Danny Davis,\u00a0calling Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings a de facto \"lynching\" in 1998. GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest also pointed to an October 2008 comment from now-Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, that was published in an Associated Press article. The quote from Nadler read: \"I am the president\u2019s defender in the sense that I haven\u2019t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense. \u2026 I wish we could get this over with quickly. \u2026 In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob.\" This time around, however, Democrats have sounded a sterner tone. \"That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\" said South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. \"That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\" Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., who is also black, called on Trump to delete his tweet. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet,\" Rush wrote. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., tweeted to Trump: \"No sir! No, @realDonaldTrump: this is NOT a lynching, and shame on you for invoking such a horrific act that was used as a weapon to terrorize and murder African Americans.\" The New York Times, in a tweet, condemned Trump for \"using a term that invokes the decades-long racist history of white mob murders of black people to describe a legal process laid out in the Constitution.\" Meanwhile, Republican legislators largely tried to put the focus on what they said was the unfair way in which Democrats are conducting the inquiry. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump's description was \"pretty well accurate.\" He called the impeachment effort a \"sham\" and a \"joke\" because the president does not know the identity of his accuser, and the process is playing out in private. \"This is a lynching in every sense,\" said Graham, who is close to Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate's only black Republican, agreed with Trump's sentiment but not his word choice. \"There's no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing (to) a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process,\" Scott said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's reluctance to hold a vote on a popular criminal justice bill has angered top Republican senators and created an unusual rift with a longtime GOP ally, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. And on Friday, it also brought on a tweet from President Donald Trump. \"Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform,\" Trump tweeted. \"It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!\" Minutes later Grassley tweeted that he and the president had spoken about \"the growing support\" for the legislation. \"Pres Trump told me he wants it done THIS CONGRESS,\" Grassley tweeted. Grassley has spent years working to build a coalition around the bill and is pushing for a year-end vote. Grassley says more than two-thirds of the Senate supports it. But McConnell is refusing to bring the legislation forward in a standoff that's dividing the Republican majority and putting President Donald Trump on the spot. \"We've done what needs to be done,\" Grassley said about the overwhelming support for the bill. \"So what's holding it up?\" For the 85-year-old chairman of the Judiciary Committee, this is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate. Grassley was expecting some deference from McConnell after delivering on Trump's judicial nominees \u2014 including two now on the Supreme Court. Despite Trump's support for the measure, McConnell says it's divisive. His reluctance to take up Grassley's priority shows the limits of the Senate's old-fashioned customs in an era of heightened partisan politics. \"What's so irritating about this is, first of all, he and I have been hand-in-glove working to get the judiciary vacancies filled,\" Grassley told Iowa reporters. \"I think I ought to have some consideration for delivering on tough Supreme Court nominees, and a lot of tough circuit court nominees and maybe even once in a while you get a tough district court nominee,\" Grassley went on. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., intervened Friday, talking directly to Trump about attaching the criminal justice legislation to the must-pass year-end spending bill, which is already tangled in a separate fight over funds for the border wall with Mexico. \"Just talked with President,\" Graham tweeted. \"He strongly believes criminal justice reform bill must pass now. He also indicated he supports putting criminal justice reform bill on year-end spending bill which must include MORE wall funding.\" Trump has called senators about the bill and spoke briefly about it Friday at an event on safe neighborhoods in Kansas City. The bill is a project of Trump's son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, and would be the biggest sentencing overhaul in decades. It would reduce mandatory prison terms for certain drug crimes and give judges in some cases more discretion on punishments. It would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It also includes provisions to encourage education and workforce training in prisons. Roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation. While Kushner has been meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Trump is also hearing from allies who are against the legislation. Chief among them is Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is warning senators that Republicans will be blamed if criminals are released and commit new crimes. \"Only thing worse than early release from prison of thousands of serious, violent, & repeat felons is to do that in a spending bill with no debate or amendments, forcing senators to either shut down government or let felons out of prison,\" Cotton tweeted Friday. The spending bill will need approval by Dec. 21 to avoid a funding lapse days before Christmas. Cotton and others, including Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, No. 2 Senate Republican, insist there is not as much support for the bill as Grassley claims. Cotton says senators may tell the chairman they're in favor of it when actually they're not. The bill has support from several conservative and liberal advocacy groups, uniting such disparate partners as the influential Koch network and the American Civil Liberty Union, but it splits law enforcement groups. It is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police but opposed by the National Sheriff's Association. Amid this divide, McConnell has been choosing caution, saying there's just not enough time to push the bill forward in the remaining days of the Congress. \"The question is, can you shoe-horn something that's extremely controversial into the remaining time?\" he said Monday in an interview at a Wall Street Journal forum. Criminal justice reform has traditionally been a Democratic priority, as Republicans prefer a more tough-on-crime approach. And McConnell acknowledges it's \"extremely divisive\" among Senate Republicans. Leaders tend to protect senators from taking tough votes that could have political blowback. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Thursday that bill backers are making a last-push to attach it to the spending measure and picking up new supporters. But he acknowledged the package's chances are slipping with each passing day. \"We're still lobbying Sen. McConnell \u2014 he has all the power to allow it or not allow it,\" said Paul. McConnell and Grassley have worked side by side for decades. When then-President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in early 2016, Grassley stood by McConnell's decision to keep the seat open during the election year for the new president to decide. He's ushered in 84 Trump judicial nominees, including a record number of circuit court judges. But their split over criminal justice reform is testing not just their partnership but also the longstanding norms of the Senate. \"What's holding it up is our leader, the majority leader,\" Grassley said. \"There's no reason it shouldn't come up.\"",

McConnell, as I said to you last week, describes himself as the Grim Reaper,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u201cThe Senate is the graveyard where bills that pass in the Congress, that have bipartisan support in the country, go to die.\u201d \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d was a moderately successful heavy metal band from three decades ago. Their album covers depicted a cloaked visage of Death mounted on a horse. Death clutched a bloody scythe in his hand, two illuminated eyes shining from beneath a cloak. For the record (or, cassette tape, as it were), Grim Reaper put out three albums in the 1980s: \u201cSee You in Hell\u201d in 1983. \u201cFear No Evil\u201d in 1985 and \u201cRock You to Hell.\u201d VH1 ranked the title track \u201cSee You In Hell\u201d as the 38th worst metal song of all-time. McConnell generated his own Grim Reaper moniker. In an interview on Fox News, the Kentucky Republican declared he was \u201cthe Grim Reaper when it comes to the Green New Deal.\u201d McConnell has long embraced gallows equivalencies with his post as Senate Majority Leader. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like being the groundskeeper in a cemetery,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cEverybody\u2019s under you. But nobody\u2019s listening.\u201d This is a far cry from how former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., used to describe the role. Lott characterized the job as \u201cherding cats.\u201d At least that had a warm and fuzzy connotation. Of course, McConnell has some choices, too. It\u2019s unclear if he prefers the Grim Reaper sobriquet or \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201d Former Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Don Blankenship christened McConnell with the \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d handle after 90 pounds of coke were found aboard a shipping vessel owned by his wife\u2019s family. McConnell likes the byname. You can purchase a \u201cCocaine Mitch\u201d t-shirt from McConnell\u2019s website for $35. The shirts are emblazoned with the words \u201cCartel Member.\u201d There are questions as to whether it\u2019s appropriate for McConnell to brazenly adopt \u201cCocaine Mitch,\u201d considering the nation\u2019s drug problem. That\u2019s to say nothing of the issues involving drug smuggling at the border. So Democrats will hammer McConnell over his nickname(s) in an effort to craft a narrative about the Senate. The Senate has mostly focused this year on confirming nominees. Senators have voted on just a few bills all year long. At a press conference, Chris Murphy gave Senate Republicans an earful the other day. He blasted them about health care and other pieces of legislation. \u201cMost days, Senate Republicans are pretending that they aren't actually members of Congress. They pretend as if Donald Trump is Kryptonite, having robbed their powers to legislate,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThey can legislate. They can pass legislation. They could use their voices.\u201d Democrats are flummoxed about the problem. \u201cWhat's the antidote to Kryptonite?\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Murphy. Someone in the crowd hollered \u201cthe sun!\u201d Schumer ran with it. \u201cWe are the sun antidote to Kryptonite!\u201d thundered the New York Democrat. Well, not exactly. In the DC Comics canon, Superman is blessed with an array of powers. Herculean strength. X-ray vision. Heat vision. Freezing cold breath (really?). Speed. The ability of fly. You know the mantra. \u201cFaster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!\u201d Superman came to Earth from the planet Krypton, which exploded. But just before Krypton\u2019s demise, Superman\u2019s parents sent their son (then, Kal-El) to Earth in a space-basinet. Superman derives his powers from the sun in this universe. Kryptonite, pieces of the doomed planet Krypton, are lethal to Superman here. Superman\u2019s only protected from Kryptonite if it\u2019s encased in lead. The Man of Steel\u2019s arch villains - ranging from Lex Luthor to Brainiac to General Zod \u2013 have all tried to debilitate Superman with Kryptonite at one point or another. But back at the press conference, Schumer wondered if there was another way to neutralize Kryptonite. \u201cI thought it was saying that guy's name backwards. Mr. Mxyzptlk. But that's something else. Remember him?\u201d said Schumer. Schumer\u2019s referring to the impish villain who periodically surfaces from the Fifth Dimension. Mr. Mxyzptlk torments Superman and the rest of Metropolis in bizarre ways. You pronounce his surname \u201cmix-yezz-PITT-uh-lik.\u201d But to remand Mr. Mxyzptlk to the Fifth Dimension for 90 days, you must con him to utter the last name backwards. That\u2019s pronounced \u201ckell-tipp-ZIXX-um.\u201d And you thought immigration policy was hard? Perhaps nicknames are de rigueur in politics these days. After all, President Trump has deployed Crooked Hillary, Lyin\u2019 Ted, Little Marco, Alfred E. Newman, Jeff Flakey, Pocahontas, Mr. Magoo, Low-IQ Maxine Waters, Mr. Kurd, Tim Apple, Horseface to describe various political figures and adversaries. One can bet the president will christen a few new nicknames more before the 2020 campaign is complete. But the Democrats motive to take on McConnell here is clear. Democrats now control the House. Pelosi thinks Democrats have already retained control of the House heading into 2020. Republicans hold the Senate with 53 GOPers compared to 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats. Democrats believe they have a shot at defeating Sens. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., David Perdue, R-Ga., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, next year. That said, Democrats also have to defend Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Tina Smith, D-Minn. For years, Republicans toxified Pelosi during her first tour as speaker. The gambit worked. Pelosi\u2019s approval ratings plummeted and GOPers made Pelosi the central figure in their 2010 campaign to retake the House. Democrats think the nicknames about McConnell could double as Kryptonite and undermine vulnerable Senate Republicans. It\u2019s unclear if the maneuver will work. But Republicans lack a lead box in which to hide the Kryptonite. And Republicans wish they could just say Mr. Mxyzptlk\u2019s name backwards to dispatch Democratic attacks to the Fifth Dimension.",

So think of me as the Grim Reaper,\" McConnell had said. Pelosi commented: \"Leader McConnell seems to take great pride in calling himself the \u2018Grim Reaper,\u2019 it\u2019s part of his political campaign.\" McConnell told Ingraham he does not plan to approve any items that would move the country in a left-wing direction. \"This is full-bore socialism on the march in the House.

      "content": " Bestselling author Ta-Nehisi Coates singled out Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in\u00a0testimony to Congress Wednesday that took issue with McConnell's\u00a0stance on reparations for slavery. \"Yesterday when I asked about\u00a0reparations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0offered a familiar reply:\u00a0America should not be held\u00a0liable for something that\u00a0happened 150 years ago since\u00a0none of us currently alive are\u00a0responsible,\" Coates said. Coates cited pensions for family members of Civil War veterans as a precedent for reparations and said America must function as a collective entity, even when citing\u00a0the distant past.

But well into this century, the United\u00a0States was still paying out pensions to the heirs of Civil War soldiers,\" Coates\u00a0said.\u00a0\"We honor treaties that date back some 200\u00a0years despite no one being alive\u00a0who signed those treaties.\u00a0Many of us would love to be\u00a0taxed for the things we are\u00a0solely and individually\u00a0responsible for.\u00a0But we are American citizens and\u00a0thus bound to a collective\u00a0enterprise that extends beyond\u00a0our individual and personal\u00a0reach.\" Coates also claimed slavery is what made America an economic giant on the world stage, and accused McConnell of shirking his duties as a government leader. \"When [slavery]\u00a0ended this country could\u00a0have extended its hollow\u00a0principles -- life, liberty and\u00a0the pursuit of happiness to all, regardless of color.\u00a0But America had other principles\u00a0in mind.\u00a0And so for a century after the Civil War, black people were\u00a0subjected to a relentless campaign\u00a0of terror,\" he said.\u00a0\"A campaign that extended well\u00a0into the lifetime of Majority Leader McConnell.\" \"It is\u00a0tempting to divorce this\u00a0modern campaign of terror, of\u00a0plunder -- from enslavement. But the logic of enslavement, of\u00a0white supremacy, respects no such\u00a0borders. And the guard of bondage\u00a0was lustful and begat many\u00a0heirs,\" said Coates, who noted that McConnell was born during\u00a0the Jim Crow era and should be more understanding and empathetic to the plight of African-Americans. BETO O\u2019ROURKE SAYS WHITE AMERICANS DON\u2019T KNOW THE FULL STORY OF SLAVERY, CONTINUES TO SUPPORT REPARATIONS \"[McConnell] was alive to witness cleptocracy in his native\u00a0Alabama and a regime premised on electoral theft.\u00a0Majority Leader McConnell cited\u00a0civil rights legislation\u00a0yesterday, as well he should -- because he was alive to witness\u00a0the harassment, jailing, and\u00a0betrayal of those responsible\u00a0for that legislation by a government sworn to protect\u00a0them,\" Coates said. \"He was alive for the redlining\u00a0of Chicago and the looting of\u00a0black homeowners of some $4\u00a0billion.\u00a0Victims of their plunder\u00a0are\u00a0very much alive today.\u00a0I am sure they'd love a word\u00a0with the majority leader.\u00a0What they know, what this\u00a0committee must know, is that\u00a0while emancipation dead-bolted\u00a0the door against the bandits of\u00a0America, Jim Crow wedged the\u00a0windows wide-open.\" Coates closed by saying Americans should be tied to the entirety of their history and remain at the mercy of the past.

Amy McGrath, a Democrat who lost a close House race in 2018, sees McConnell\u2019s close ties to President Trump as a possible weakness for the incumbent GOP leader and Kentucky senator. MCCONNELL THROWS SHADE AT NIKE WITH 'BETSY ROSS' FLAG TWEET \"Everything that\u2019s wrong with Washington had to start somewhere\u2014it started with him,\" McGrath said in a Tuesday morning tweet. McConnell has been in office since 1985. History is not on McGrath\u2019s side, as Kentucky has not elected a Democratic senator since 1992. Trump\u2019s popularity in the state may also be a hurdle, as McConnell successfully helped the president achieve a number of goals, including the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Despite this, McGrath remains undaunted. \u201cI've been always somebody who stepped up to the plate when asked, when I felt like my country needed me, and this is one of those times,\" she said in an interview with The Associated Press. McGrath\u00a0believes that people in her state voted for Trump due to promises to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and lower prices of prescription drugs; promises she does not believe the president has fulfilled. \u201cThose things haven\u2019t happened because of guys like Senator McConnell,\u201d she said. Trump is expected to back McConnell, as he did for Rep. Andy Barr, the lawmaker who defeated McGrath last year by just three percentage points. MCCONNELL VOWS TO BE 'GRIM REAPER' OF SOCIALIST DEM PROPOSALS On Tuesday morning, McConnell\u2019s campaign responded to McGrath\u2019s announcement with a tweet that included a video montage of her supporting liberal positions on issues including universal health care, abortion, and illegal immigration, as well as a clip of her comparing her reaction to Trump\u2019s election to how she felt on 9/11. The tweet included a brief message: \u201cWelcome to the race, Amy.\u201d McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden also responded to McGrath's announcement by calling her \"an extreme liberal who is far out of touch with Kentuckians.\" In a statement, he said, \"Comparing President Trump\u2019s election to 9/11, endorsing a government takeover of healthcare, and calling the wall \u201cstupid\u201d is a heckuva platform that we will be delighted to discuss over the next sixteen months The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

MITCH MCCONNELL CAMPAIGN CRITICIZED FOR PHOTOS OF TOMBSTONES WITH DEM NAMES \u201cHey @senatemajldr \u2013 these young men look like they work for you,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cJust wanted to clarify: are you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll,\u201d she asked, \u201cor is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d The photograph was first surfaced by a Twitter user named @emrazz and the initial caption read, \u201cBreak me off a piece of that.\u201d The freshman congresswoman has pressured McConnell for declining to bring a Senate vote on a gun control bill in the wake of shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. MCCONNELL WILLING TO CONSIDER \u2018BIPARTISAN\u2019 GUN VIOLENCE SOLUTIONS, OPPOSES 'INFRINGING' ON RIGHTS \u201cThe House passed HR8, a Bipartisan Background Checks Act, *5 months ago* and the Senate has yet to vote on it,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt was one of our 1st major priorities after ending the gov shutdown. You\u2019ve been sitting on it since February giving bogus excuses. Care to explain the people why?\u201d Her call to bring the vote also was in response to McConnell\u2019s tweet offering condolences to the families. \u201cThe entire nation is horrified by today\u2019s senseless violence,\u201d tweeted the top Senate Republican. \u201cElaine\u2019s and my prayers go out to the victims of this terrible violence, their families and friends, and the brave first responders who charged into harm\u2019s way.\u201d Other prominent Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also reportedly called for the bill passed by House Democrats to be brought to a vote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McConnell said Monday that he\u2019s willing to consider \u201cbipartisan\u201d solutions in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, but made clear his opposition to gun control policies that infringe \u201con Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d \u201cToday, the president called on Congress to work in a bipartisan, bicameral way to address the recent mass murders which have shaken our nation,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cSenate Republicans are prepared to do our part.\u201d",

      "author": "Chad Pergram",
      "content": " I learned a long time ago to pay close attention to the precise verbiage of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell usually says what he means. It\u2019s others who divine meaning and interpretation onto the language of the Kentucky Republican. But, without fail, McConnell says exactly what he means. Consider what McConnell said during a recent\u00a0appearance on WHAS Radio in Louisville about guns. REP. PRESSLEY CALLS MCCONNELL 'THE COMMON ENEMY' AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS \u201cWe\u2019re going to begin these discussions over the August break and when we get back \u00a0[Sept. 9], hopefully, we\u2019ll be in a position to agree on things on a bipartisan basis and go forward and make law.\u201d So, let\u2019s parse what McConnell didn't\u00a0say. The majority leader didn\u2019t say the Senate would have a formal \u201cdebate\u201d on the Senate floor about firearms, as at least a couple of news outlets reported. McConnell didn\u2019t say the Senate would even consider a bill. \u201cI want to make a law,\u201d McConnell said. Such a proposition would entail the Senate debating actual legislation. But McConnell didn\u2019t commit to that. The majority leader was vague about what bill or bills could be candidates to become\u00a0law. He also indicated prospective legislation would have to score 60 yeas to overcome not one but two rounds of filibusters. And\u00a0\u00a0McConnell\u00a0gave himself a potential\u00a0exit ramp from the whole enterprise. \u201cIt has to pass the House,\u201d McConnell told WHAS, adding it \u201chas to be signed by President Trump.\u201d There's no special code in McConnell's\u00a0locution. Any bill requires passage by the House and Senate, plus\u00a0the signature of the president, to become law. But, McConnell is simultaneously, and overtly suggesting, something else. There may be no way the House, Senate, and president can come together on anything. It\u2019s hard enough to get all three on the same page with garden-variety legislation. TWITTER UNLOCKS MCCONNELL'S CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT AFTER GOP FURY So, you understand the difficulty of the task in the twilight of this month's\u00a0shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Policymakers never have been able to come together and make federal law on firearms after any other mass shooting. So why, oh why, would the aftermath of El Paso and Dayton be any different? That\u2019s not to say that McConnell isn\u2019t open to trying to tackle a bill. McConnell told WHAS that \u201cwhat\u2019s happened after every one of these shootings is there\u2019s been a temptation to just engage in political discourse rather than passing something.\u201d Some analysts may view such a remark as a fig leaf for McConnell to avoid actually doing something on guns. Possibly. But\u00a0McConnell certainly can then accuse people of trying to politicize the shootings if lawmakers stumble. Things which pass the House don\u2019t always fare well in the Senate. One could easily imagine a scenario in which the Senate is stymied at advancing anything due to the 60-vote requirement to overcome filibusters. In fact, as McConnell\u00a0pointed out, the Senate likely would have to marshal 60 yeas not once but twice on gun-related legislation. This is why it\u2019s not a stretch to see no Senate action at all when lawmakers return in September \u2013 or a scenario similar to the one which played out in the spring of 2013. HARMEET DHILLON: MCCONNELL CAMPAIGN TWITTER BAN IS LATEST SHOT IN BEG TECH'S WAR ON CONSERVATIVES The Senate didn\u2019t get around to addressing firearms after the December\u00a02012 attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., until April\u00a02013, and when the Senate did vote, senators cast their ballots with the understanding that nothing would pass. In 2013, McConnell forged an agreement with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to take a series of gun-related votes. It was a devil\u2019s bargain. The Reid-McConnell pact required not a simple majority to adopt any amendments related to guns \u2013 but 60 votes. There was a conservative amendment, drafted by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,\u00a0and then-Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. That proposal scored 52 \"yea\" votes, but that\u2019s a far cry from 60. Reid obviously didn\u2019t want the Senate to pass the conservative plan \u2013 especially in a Senate controlled by the Democrats. President Obama (remember, this was 2013), certainly wouldn\u2019t sign such a plan. But, Reid knew that bill could score a simple majority and it did. So, by requiring 60 \"yea\" votes, Reid made sure the Senate euthanized the GOP plan. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., developed a bipartisan compromise on background checks. The Senate had sufficient votes to adopt the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Still, many Republican senators opposed that proposal. McConnell may have been the minority leader at the time, but he certainly wasn\u2019t going to allow Manchin-Toomey to pass. That\u2019s why Reid and McConnell forged their devil\u2019s bargain. Both sides played defense. Various gun proposals could record 51 \"yea\" votes in the Senate, but none could secure 60 yeas to overcome a filibuster. So, Reid and McConnell decided to set up a vote sequence to kill all proposals. That would entail subjecting each amendment to a 60-vote requirement for adoption. SENATE DEMS DELIVER STUNNING WARNING TO SUPREME COURT: 'HEAL' OR FACE RESTRUCTURING Among the amendments which withered on the 60-vote vine: a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,\u00a0to resuscitate the assault-weapons ban which expired in 2004. Naturally, defenders of the Second Amendment abhorred that proposal. Feinstein\u2019s amendment failed 60-40 \u2013 not even coming close to 51 \"yea\" votes. So, the sides pre-baked the gun vote series in such a way that it was a fait accompli the Senate wouldn\u2019t approve anything on firearms. Some of the ideas scored more than a majority in the Senate, but the 60-vote threshold doomed all plans to failure. There\u2019s a reason why Reid - as he wrote this week in The New York Times - has wanted to eliminate the filibuster. Such a maneuver would discard the ever-present requirement of coughing up 60 votes to halt filibusters. And, in the present gun debate, McConnell and many others know it\u2019s a challenge to vault the 60-vote hurdle. It may be impossible for the Senate to pass something on guns, let alone finesse legislation into law. One never knows if lawmakers could come up with something which commands 60 votes in the Senate and is also endorsed by the House and President Trump. There\u2019s a chance McConnell may not like such legislation. But, if McConnell sticks to the parameters he laid out, he might not have much of a reason to explain why he won\u2019t allow a measure to advance through the Senate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Still,\u00a0we\u2019re a long way from that scenario. So, for now, senators will have \u201cdiscussions,\u201d as McConnell suggested, and unless there\u2019s a major breakthrough, discussions could be the only postscript to the massacres in El Paso and Dayton.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0shared opposing\u00a0views Wednesday regarding Twitter's recent call to ban all political advertisements while gearing up for the 2020 presidential election. Clinton praised the Twitter move and urged Facebook to follow suit, saying such moves would\u00a0prevent a repeat of the spread of false information that occurred during the last presidential election. TWITTER TO BAN POLITICAL ADS WORLDWIDE, CEO JACK DORSEY ANNOUNCES \"Twitter made the right decision to say, 'Look, we don\u2019t want to get into the judging game,'\u201d Clinton said at The New York Times DealBook Conference in New York City. \u201cI think that should be the decision that Facebook makes as well.\u201d But McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor in Washington, slammed the new Twitter policy as an effort to undermine the First Amendment right to free\u00a0speech. McConnell said a ban on paid candidate and issue ads would only hurt \u201cfledgling speakers who are not already famous.\u201d Clinton also encouraged Facebook to ban political ads given its track record during the 2016 presidential election, when Russian operatives\u00a0spread misinformation on American politics prior to the vote. \u201cWe know unfortunately that Facebook has a history of allowing all kinds of disinformation on its platform,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, they were taking ads from a number of sources and later revealing that actually ads paid for in rubles were part of what they were putting out.\u201d Clinton also rejected arguments that by allowing paid political ads, Facebook was protecting free speech. She instead accused the platform of prioritizing its revenue stream instead of fulfilling its duty to American people to stop the spread of misinformation given that \u201cmore than 50 percent of people in this country use Facebook as their only source of news.\u201d \u201cIf you were to say to your expert engineers, out algorithms really favor the explosive, the inflammatory, the blatantly false and we love to hook people into them and they seek more of it and then they get absolutely barraged by all of this information, we need to tweak the algorithms,\u201d she said. She also admitted that the Democratic Party partially to blame given decades-long ties to Silicon Valley. On Wednesday, McConnell said Twitter\u2019s new policy on paid political advertising \u201cwould just amplify the already privileged speakers who already possess multimillion-dollar platforms. It would just help clear the field for those elites by denying the same tools to fledgling speakers who are not already famous.\u201d It does \u201cnot bolster our democracy. It would degrade democracy. It would amplify the advantage of media companies, celebrities and certain other established elites while denying an important tool to the Americans who disagree with them,\u201d he continued, according to The Hill. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \"Twitter's leadership has tried to produce a rationale for banishing paid political speech, but the argument boils down to the same misunderstanding that has been used to undermine free speech for decades,\u201d McConnell continued. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last week that the platform will stop all political advertising \u2014 including candidate ads and issue ads \u2014 globally starting next month.",

Kentucky is one of only three states\u00a0electing a governor this year.\u00a0Polls indicate a tight contest between Republican incumbent Matt\u00a0Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear: the latest Mason Dixon\u00a0Poll in Kentucky shows\u00a0Bevin and Beshear tied at 46 percent. Some Democrats, though, are looking ahead to the state's Senate race in 2020 -- where they dream of ousting the longtime Kentucky senator and Republican Senate leader --\u00a0despite his history of beating back Democratic challengers. TRUMP IS NOT ON THE BALLOT, BUT HE'S FRONT-AND-CENTER IN THIS MONTH\u2019S KEY GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS A tight race to Democratic voters like Susan Jarl translates into a competitive race against\u00a0McConnell, who, like President Trump, will be on the ballot next year. \u201cWe have to first get past this step in the state because it\u2019s so important what happens at the state and local level,\" Jarl told Fox News. \"Then come back and get Mitch McConnell and Trump out next year. It would be a miracle and such a blessing.\u201d A spokesman for McConnell did not immediately return a request for comment. McConnell is the longest-serving Republican Senate leader in history and has been reelected six times.\u00a0A well-funded challenge by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes garnered national attention in 2014, but McConnell handily defeated her by 15 points that year. McConnell\u2019s history, however, hasn\u2019t stopped Democratic opponents from emerging, including\u00a0retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath.\u00a0She\u00a0raised $10 million in just 24 hours of announcing she would run against the Senate majority leader. But politics professor\u00a0Dewey Clayton\u00a0at the University of Louisville said that it\u2019s ambitious for Democrats to equate Kentucky\u2019s close gubernatorial race to the Senate race in 2020.

His campaign manager Kevin Golden, however, told\u00a0Roll Call:\u00a0\u201cLeader McConnell and our campaign have been focused on making sure that Governor Bevin, [state attorney general nominee] Daniel Cameron and the rest of the Republican ticket are successful on election night.\u201d It's clear McConnell is preparing for a fight: so far he has about $9 million cash on hand for his re-election bid in 2020.",
