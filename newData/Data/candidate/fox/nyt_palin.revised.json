      "content": "The news that Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, was hired to speak at the annual convention of the  Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America has drawn reactions ranging from puzzlement to consternation. Some have asked why the wholesalers would select Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, for the convention April 6-8 in Las Vegas. While her husband, Todd Palin, may have an affection for Alaskan Amber \u2014 like many Iron Dog snowmobile competitors \u2014 she has no known affiliation with or, for that matter, interest in wine, beer, spirits or any other alcoholic beverage. Others, like the blogger Tom Wark, who in his day job representing the Specialty Wine Retailers Association  staunchly opposes the wholesalers\u2019 effort to maintain the three-tier system,    have heaped scorn on the association of Ms. Palin with the wholesalers. How is it, Mr. Wark asks, that someone like Ms. Palin, who is purportedly devoted to the free-enterprise system, with as few government constraints as possible, would hook up with the wholesalers\u2019 association, which demands that the state and federal governments continue to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages. Why would Ms. Palin, who railed against lobbyists in the 2008 campaign, be accepting a fee for speaking to a well-heeled special interest group? Ah, but whoever said politics was clear-cut and rational? In announcing the selection of Ms. Palin, Craig Wolf, the president and chief executive of the wholesalers association, offering this reasoning: Governor Palin is a great supporter of America\u2019s free enterprise system and understands that industries like the beverage alcohol industry play a key role in driving our national economy,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud and honored to welcome her as a speaker. We expect she will share with the convention attendees her analysis of the current political environment and her vision for America\u2019s future. In sharing her vision, Ms. Palin, in all probability, will shed little light on issues directly concerning the business of the wholesalers. The selection of Ms. Palin has earned the wholesalers far more attention than they might have received by hiring the usual sorts of wine and spirits speakers. But in the end it may not be the sort of attention that the wholesalers really want.",

      "content": "Is Sarah Palin pulling a Donald Trump on the political universe? The announcement by the former governor of Alaska on Thursday that she will begin a slick, campaign-style bus tour this weekend immediately set off a frenzy of media and political speculation about her intentions for the 2012 presidential race. Her small band of advisers was flooded with hundreds of phone calls and e-mails the moment the story broke. Helicopters hovered over the new home that she and her family have bought in Arizona, hoping for a glimpse. And in Iowa and New Hampshire, her potential candidacy diverted attention, at least for the moment, from her rivals. The political flurry foreshadowed the kind of adrenaline shot to the heart that Ms. Palin\u2019s candidacy could be for a Republican presidential campaign that had recently looked like it was coalescing around a pretty traditional set of contenders. Traditional she is not. But like Mr. Trump, whose flirtation with a presidential run may or may not have been a stunt to ramp up ratings for his show on NBC, Ms. Palin is a celebrity and an entertainer whose motivations for keeping political speculation alive remain unclear to everyone but herself (and, maybe, her husband, Todd.) \u201cTogether let\u2019s prepare ourselves for the days ahead by reminding ourselves who we are and what Americans stand for,\u201d she announced on her Web site. The days ahead? Was she hinting at a campaign that is coming? Or perhaps setting the stage for a new reality show on The Learning Channel \u2014 \u201cSarah Palin and her family on the road across America?\u201d Or maybe it is designed to be a reminder to her Fox News employers of the crowds that she still commands. In one sense, Ms. Palin\u2019s flirtation with the idea of a presidential campaign has not been unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s. Like the real estate mogul, Ms. Palin has used confrontation with President Obama as a way to seize the media spotlight. And as Mr. Trump did, the former Alaska governor dangles the promise of a celebrity-infused campaign that would be a kind of political reality show of its own. (Remember, it was just days after her introduction to the nation in 2008 that the campaign manager for Senator John McCain of Arizona was surrounded by a crush of reporters at the Republican convention amid rumors that her daughter was pregnant.) But Mr. Trump\u2019s was a brief dalliance with presidential politics that almost appeared to have been done on a whim. Ms. Palin, by contrast, has been moving slowly and methodically for several years. Aides have said for months that she wanted to be in a position to run for president if that\u2019s what she decided to do. Ms. Palin and her aides revealed few clues on Thursday, which leaves a lot of people in Washington and around the country guessing. Who is waiting nervously for Ms. Palin to reveal her plan? Here\u2019s a partial list: The Media: A presidential candidacy by Ms. Palin holds the promise of a larger-than-life character who is a huge draw for readers and viewers. And as she proved when she released her \u201cblood libel\u201d video in the days after the Arizona shooting, Ms. Palin has a way of picking confrontations that make for great stories. But Ms. Palin has also shown little willingness to accommodate the press in ways that are critical during long presidential campaigns. That makes the prospect of covering Ms. Palin a daunting \u2014 and probably expensive \u2014 one for the media. The White House: David Plouffe, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top political aides, once pined for Ms. Palin to run but said \u201csomething tells me we won\u2019t get that lucky.\u201d On Thursday, a Democratic operative who was asked whether he was compiling opposition research on Palin answered: \u201cHave you heard of Google?\u201d For the president\u2019s advisers, a candidacy by Ms. Palin is likely to end in one of two results: Either with her winning the Republican nomination by appealing to the party\u2019s conservative, religious wing. Or with a different nominee who has been pulled to the right by Ms. Palin\u2019s presence. Either way, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers believe he would benefit politically. New Hampshire and Iowa: The two states that begin the presidential nominating process are eager to know whether Ms. Palin will be part of the process. For Iowa, especially, her presence could mean a bigger crush of media and a more intense battle for the conservative vote there as Ms. Palin seeks to prove her popularity among that constituency. Michele Bachmann: The Republican congresswoman from Minnesota said Thursday evening that her decision about whether to run for the presidency is not based on whether Ms. Palin runs. \u201cOur decision is unique and we are independent of what any other candidate decides,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any two candidates are interchangeable.\u201d But in truth, Ms. Bachmann and Ms. Palin are clearly trying to appeal to similar crowds: the Tea Party activists and the conservative Republicans who have helped both women raise millions of dollars. If Ms. Palin runs, winning becomes much more difficult for Ms. Bachmann. Other Republican Rivals: Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, might benefit from Ms. Palin\u2019s candidacy because she would make it more difficult for the lesser-known candidates to get air time and challenge Mr. Romney. That\u2019s the challenge for Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, who is banking on a surprise victory in Iowa to turn him into the alternative to Mr. Romney. If Ms. Palin runs, winning Iowa is tougher for Mr. Pawlenty. Fox News: Roger Ailes and other Fox News executives are probably agnostic on whether Ms. Palin should run. If she does, they will lose (at least temporarily) a woman who is regularly a big draw on their network. On the other hand, a candidacy by Ms. Palin would almost certainly add interest to the campaign, which in turn would drive higher ratings for Fox\u2019s coverage of the campaign.",

      "content": "Sarah Palin is rarely shy about expressing her preferences in many matters, but she was more diplomat than politician in an appearance Monday night on the ABC reality competition \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d taking care not to put her thumb on the scales even though her daughter Bristol is a contestant on the show this season. In an interview with the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d co-host Tom Bergeron, Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska and Republican nominee for vice president, was introduced as a \u201cguest ballroom commentator.\u201d Asked by Mr. Bergeron for her opinion of the show overall, Ms. Palin did not immediately seize the opportunity to promote Bristol\u2019s candidacy. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Ms. Palin replied. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting. And it\u2019s great to see all this courage and joy and exuberance by every dancer. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d Ms. Palin was also careful not to offend any of the show\u2019s professional judges, who last week gave Bristol a combined score of 18 out of 30 possible points, and this week gave her 22. \u201cOh, the judges are awesome,\u201d Ms. Palin said of the panel. \u201cO.K., now, it\u2019s like before a hockey game \u2013 you\u2019re not going to chew out the refs before your team is up to, um, you know, up on the ice. So they\u2019re great. You guys are doing great.\u201d Asked point-blank by Mr. Bergeron to name her favorite dancer, Ms. Palin gave the expected answer, eventually. \u201cOh my goodness, they\u2019re all amazing,\u201d Ms. Palin replied. \u201cThey really are. This is great. Bristol\u2019s not up yet. Bristol the pistol, yeah, that\u2019s who we\u2019re rooting for.\u201d Some booing from the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d studio audience could be heard on television before Ms. Palin\u2019s appearance, but the show\u2019s emcees carefully tiptoed around it. At the end of her interview with the contestant Jennifer Grey, the co-host Brooke Burke said, \u201cThere\u2019s booing in the ballroom, we don\u2019t know why.\u201d",

The announcement comes two weeks after she dropped the puck in Philadelphia for the Flyers\u2019 home opener, an appearance that generated a firestorm of controversy. Whether the Blues expect America\u2019s most famous hockey mom to be booed as heartily at the Scottrade Center as she was in Philly is an open question, but a search on Thursday afternoon showed no mention of Palin on the Blues\u2019 Web site. No mention either at the McCain-Palin 2008 Web site. However, as Helene Elliott of the Los Angeles Times notes, Blues chairman Dave Checketts donated money to the McCain campaign in May. Palin\u2019s last ceremonial face-off engagement resulted from an invitation from Flyers owner Ed Snider, himself a prominent contributor to Republican campaigns.",

      "content": "The argument over whether Sarah Palin was misinformed about the historical facts of Paul Revere\u2019s ride has moved to where bar bets go to be settled: Wikipedia. Since Ms. Palin described the ride last week while she was visiting Boston,  Wikipedia\u2019s Paul Revere article page has been the site of a mini \u201cedit war.\u201d And the page has gone from a little-visited one \u2014 2,000 or so page views a day \u2014  to a more heavily trafficked one, with54,000 on Saturday when Ms. Palin\u2019s comments were gaining the most news attention. Over the course of the weekend, people added sentences to the Revere article that repeated Ms. Palin\u2019s claims. It can be hard to discern motives for changes on Wikipedia, and in some cases people appeared to be attributing the claims to Ms. Palin in order to mock her. One editor, Tomwsulcer, added the following sentence:\u00a0 \u201cAccounts differ regarding the method of alerting the colonists; the generally accepted position is that the warnings were verbal in nature, although one disputed account suggested that Revere rang bells during his ride.\u201d When the discussion board for the Revere article was ringing with complaints that this was a lie, Tomwsulcer replied that it should be included as a theory because a prominent American politician, that is, Sarah Palin, had said it. \u201cIf you follow Wikipedia\u2019s rules,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe must maintain a neutral position, representing the mainstream position as well as disputed versions.\u201d He lost the argument, but others have been searching history books to find evidence to support Ms. Palin\u2019s claims. One editor added the fact that the colonists on the eve of revolution were themselves British. That argument was included at the end of a passage stating that \u201cRevere did not shout the phrase later attributed to him (\u2018The British are coming!\u2019), largely because the mission depended on secrecy and the countryside was filled with British army patrols.\u201d By that logic, Revere did, as Ms. Palin put it,\u00a0 \u201cwarn the British\u201d \u2014\u00a0 namely, the rebel colonists who were still technically British subjects. But the battles continue, and recent changes to the Revere article have used more facts to undercut the additions that seem to support Ms. Palin. For example, on Monday, one editor added, \u201cEverything Revere told his British captors had a single goal, to move the soldiers away from Lexington, where he had left Hancock and Adams.\u201d As a result, the Revere article has become much longer, and much better sourced -\u2013 a version of what Wikipedia users call the \u201cStreisand Effect,\u201d which is described as when  \u201can attempt to hide or remove a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely.\u201d Ms. Palin\u2019s supporters have made their mark on the Paul Revere article at Conservapedia, a right-leaning version of a Wikipedia-like encyclopedia. The piece has been edited to read as follows: \u201cHe is famous for riding from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts with William Dawes on the night of April 18, 1775 ringing bells to warn the British that colonists would exercise their natural rights to both bear arms and use them in an effort secede from the United Kingdom in response to Big Government bullying and interfering with Colony\u2019s Rights.\u201d",

      "content": "Here are two more data points from the weekend to back up my argument that the 2012 Republican nomination is not Sarah Palin\u2019s to lose. First, the Values Voter Summit straw poll, a decent gauge of sentiment among the kind of activists Palin would presumably need to rally, in which the former Alaska governor racked up just 7 percent of the vote, trailing Mike Pence (who gave a barn-burner of a speech), Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Second, a new 2012 poll from Public Policy Polling, showing Romney leading with 22 percent, followed by Huckabee at 21, Gingrich at 18, and Palin at 17 percent. And note this statistic: As is the case every month Sarah Palin is the most personally popular of  the Republicans, with 66 percent viewing her favorably.  She is followed by  Huckabee at 60 percent and Gingrich and Romney at 57 percent. The problem for  Palin is that a smaller percentage of the people who like her personally  support her for President than any of the other Republicans.  37 percent of  the voters who like Romney also say he\u2019s their choice for the 2012  nomination and the same is true for 32 percent who like Gingrich and Huckabee.   But just 24 percent who see Palin positively on a personal level translate  that to intent to vote for her. [emphasis mine \u2014 R.D.] About a month ago, I wrote a column arguing that the most interesting pre-primary contest in the G.O.P. was arguably the battle to see if somebody (a Mitch Daniels? a Jon Thune? a Haley Barbour? a Tim Pawlenty?) would manage to unseat Romney from his perch as the safe, competent-seeming, establishment-y candidate. In response, Commentary\u2019s Jennifer Rubin argued that I was missing the point, and that being perceived as having anything to do with the G.O.P. establishment would doubtless be the kiss of death of 2012. (\u201cThe party elders, for better or worse, are being ignored,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAsk [Marco] Rubio,  Rand Paul, Nikki\u00a0Haley, Sharon Angle, and the rest if endorsements by  the establishment and big-name donors are the key to victory.\u201d) This is true in a sense: Obviously nobody\u2019s going to run for president in \u201912 saying \u201cI am the voice of the Republican establishment!\u201d, and no candidate can hope to win the nomination if they\u2019re perceived as a Mike Castle or Lisa Murkowski-style figure. But right now, in autumn 2010, at what seems like a moment of maximal populist outrage and anti-establishment fervor, Sarah Palin can\u2019t crack 20 percent in primary polling, and Mitt Romney (for all his manifold weaknesses) still has the most plausible path to the nomination. Which suggests to me that concerns about stability, solidity and electability may play a bigger role in the 2012 Republican campaign than many observers seem to think.",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "The response to Sarah Palin\u2019s announcement last week that she would quit as governor of Alaska at the end of July quickly turned from shock to irritation, even among some conservative commentators. Among Republican party ranks, there\u2019s been division over whether she\u2019ll have a role leading the party once out of office. Governor Palin responded to critics and the Republican Party this week, telling Fox News that she\u2019s not going to \u201cget wrapped up into a strong political machine that hasn\u2019t been extremely successful in some ways.\u201d  And she told ABC, \u201cYou know, politically speaking, if I die, I die. So be it.\u201d We asked some Republican strategists and conservative thinkers, what is Governor Palin\u2019s political future?  Can she build up her position in the party while being on the outside?  Dan Schnur is the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. He was the communications director for John McCain\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign. Once the dust has settled and cable commentators have finally quieted themselves, it\u2019s not clear that Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s resignation will have much of an impact on her presidential aspirations one way or the other. Governor Palin\u2019s announcement served only to intensify feelings about her among both her friends and foes, reaffirming her status as the most polarizing American political figure since Hillary Clinton departed from the White House 10 years ago. The question for Ms. Palin, whether she is a governor or a talk show host or a commercial fisherman, is whether she can find a way to expand her base of support in what is likely to be a very crowded Republican primary field in 2012.  She\u2019s more likely to achieve that goal by campaigning around the country for G.O.P. candidates and strengthening her emotional bonds to conservative voters next year than by balancing Alaska\u2019s budget and fighting off ethics inquiries.  But if she does run, history is decidedly against her. Running mates of defeated presidential candidates invariably begin the next election cycle as front-runners because of the attention they received during the last campaign, but almost always forfeit that advantage as other challengers compete with them for money, volunteers and news coverage. None of the most recent unsuccessful vice presidential nominees \u2014 John Edwards, Joe Lieberman, Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle \u2014 ever came even remotely close to winning the presidency. In the modern primary era, the only two losing vice presidential candidates to even achieve their party\u2019s nomination were Walter Mondale and Bob Dole, both of whom were offered up as sacrificial lambs to popular incumbents running for reelection. Read more\u2026 This is not to say that Governor Palin cannot be elected president, but rather that her history and her notoriety get her no more than a seat at the primary table. Given the challenges she would face on the campaign trail, the question for her to consider is whether she can most effectively influence the political debate as a candidate or as an outsider. Neither Al Gore nor Newt Gingrich will ever be president, nor will Arianna Huffington or Rush Limbaugh. But all of them had a much greater impact on the 2008 election dialogue than any politician not named Obama, Clinton, or McCain.  So it\u2019s entirely possible that Palin could best serve the causes that matter most to her by choosing to pursue a place in the punditocracy rather than the presidency. Vin Weber, managing partner of Clark & Weinstock, a political consulting firm, was a member of Congress from 1981 to 1993. He was policy chairman for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008. In the next four years Sarah Palin will make a lot of money, advocate eloquently for conservative causes and, ultimately, not run for president. Governor Palin was thrust onto the national stage prematurely. Who\u2019s to say what her future would have been if she\u2019d gained a bit more experience before coming under the microscope of the national media? But we know a couple of things. First, she has a core of supporters that will never desert her but can never elect her. And, second, she\u2019s been branded in a way that makes her a figure of such divisiveness (unfairly, I might add) that she, being an astute and highly intelligent individual will not try to paddle upstream for as long as it would take to be the Republican nominee in \u201912. She deserves the improvement in her life that her resignation will guarantee. Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, has worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, where he served as deputy assistant to the president. Sarah Palin has star power, she\u2019s quite popular with a significant portion of the G.O.P., and she can raise lots of money. Few figures generate the excitement she does among core party supporters. So it would be foolish to write off her political future. On the other hand, she has done enormous damage to herself since her single shining moment: her acceptance speech at the Republican Convention in early September. In interviews she has come across as unable to offer up more than a sound bite argument on virtually any issue (with the exception of energy). She seems to have memorized answers rather than thought through issues. She doesn\u2019t seem able to articulate a core philosophy. And her announcement that she would not complete her term as governor was rambling and at times incoherent. She strikes me as terribly out of sync with the needs of this moment. The G.O.P. is at low ebb; rebuilding its reputation depends on emerging public figures who are conservative and principled, who radiate intellectual depth and calmness of purpose, who come across as irenic rather than agitated, competent and reliable rather than erratic and uneven. Sarah Palin may prove to be more impressive than many of us believe she is. And she has every right to make her case and test herself against others. But even those of us who were disposed to like her cannot deny that her public appearances have generally ranged from mediocre to awful. She\u2019s had more than a handful of chances to show her stuff; what we\u2019ve seen has not been reassuring, and at times alarming. If Sarah Palin becomes the face and future of the G.O.P., it would take a huge step toward securing its position as a minority party for many years to come. Linda Chavez, a former Reagan administration official, is a syndicated columnist and conservative commentator. Sarah Palin\u2019s abrupt and largely unexplained resignation as Alaska governor will make it very difficult for her to seek future public office.  There is no question that she \u2014 and, more important, her family \u2014 was treated unfairly by the national media.  But barring a looming medical or family crisis, which she did not cite, it is inexcusable for an elected official to walk away from his or her post because the going got rough.   There is precedent for quitting one elected position in order to seek another, higher office; but given Ms. Palin\u2019s short time in the governorship, her move hardly inspires confidence in her long-term commitment. Nonetheless, Governor Palin could remain a powerful player in G.O.P. circles. She touched a chord among Christian conservatives, the pro-life movement and rank-and-file Republicans during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, drawing unprecedented crowds of enthusiastic admirers who identified with her values and style. She could become an important voice for these voters by forming her own organization or taking the helm of an existing group. Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, exerted tremendous influence on the G.O.P. during the \u201890s without holding office. But Mr. Reed\u2019s example is a cautionary tale as well.  He failed miserably when he sought the Georgia lieutenant governorship in 2006, primarily because of his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was convicted of public corruption and fraud the same year. Ms. Palin has two paths. She can cash in on her celebrity by giving speeches, writing a book and perhaps getting her own radio or TV show.  Or she can decide she wants to be a serious policy advocate on issues important to her and her base.  If she chooses the latter, she\u2019ll have to do more than rely on her personal biography and learn the issues. David Winston, director of planning for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, is a strategic adviser to the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Sarah Palin\u2019s announcement last week that she would not run for reelection as Alaska\u2019s governor was not necessarily a surprise; her resignation in the middle of the term was. Voters understand that running for president, if that is her intention, is a full-time occupation. But resigning mid-term is a dicey move.  After all, the next presidential election is four years away, leaving at the end of her term would have given her plenty of prep time. She explained her reasons \u2014 the frivolous ethics charges, the toll on her family and Alaska and her belief that as the Democrats\u2019 and media\u2019s target of choice, she could do more to further her issues agenda out of office than in.  Unfortunately, she lacked clarity in outlining her specific goals and plans, and this allowed pundits and politicos to spend the weekend speculating, sometimes wildly, as to her \u201creal\u201d reasons for resigning. To much of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin is an engaging and interesting personality.  But in the hardball world of presidential politics, that is not enough, particularly given her weakness among independent voters.  Opponents have attacked her knowledge of national issues, and her exit news conference reinforced some of those criticisms \u2014 and may have raised questions even with some of her supporters. Her task now is to establish her own credibility on a range of voter issues.  Her expertise on the crucial issue of energy gives her a good opportunity to join the current political debate.  Had she focused on her energy bona fides during last year\u2019s presidential election, she might have had a better shot at quieting critics. Governor Palin\u2019s decision to resign her office is a major political gamble but ultimately, her political success will depend on her ideas and policies.  Maggie Gallagher is a syndicated columnist and president of the National Organization for Marriage. Will Sarah Palin survive, thrive, and possibly conquer? I hope so. I am not a Palin supporter. Really, even the bare idea of thinking about who I will support in the 2012 election is enough to induce a total brain freeze. But certainly you can count me in the anti-anti-Sarah Palin camp. The hatred generated against Sarah Palin was and is extraordinary. Why do so many culturally powerful people feel so free to hate Sarah Palin even as they express only tolerant and affectionate amusement at the bumbling Joe Biden? You might as well ask: why was a tidal wave of hatred directed at Miss California Carrie Prejean for saying something that President Obama also says? These two incidents are not, in my opinion, unrelated phenomenon. They are connected by the logic of symbols. Sarah Palin was a new and refreshing face. She is beautiful. She had astronomic approval ratings from Alaska voters and bucked the old boy network. She stood for integrity, youth, vigor and beauty and political courage. She reconciled family and work. She was, taken in herself and apart from the question of whether or not anyone wants to make her president, an interesting and inspiring figure.  And she was Republican. Not only Republican, she was conservative. Not only conservative but socially conservative, a new political face for evangelical Christians. Read more\u2026 Sarah Palin may not have chosen to be a symbol, but she became one. And you don\u2019t undercut symbols by rebutting them \u2014 you dirty and ridicule them. You ruin them. Could Sarah Palin have responded better? Yes, of course. She is too visibly rattled by the viciousness of the attacks against her. If Palin is going to surmount these attacks she needs to take a page from Ronald Reagan, who rose above even more relentless attempts to define him as stupid. It was an astonishing gift our Teflon president had. I do not know if Sarah Palin has that gift. But she has the gift of an extremely committed base of supporters who understand something real and important: that the hatred now being directed at her is really deflected hatred of all those Americans who have failed to get with the progressive moral program in which equality demands that a union of two men be viewed as a marriage and unborn human beings be stripped of all legal protection. Sarah Palin is a symbol, whether she likes it or not, for both sides in this ongoing culture war. For that reason, I hope she does not stoop but conquers.",

Andrew Kaczynski of BuzzFeed has pulled together quotes from elected officials with no interest in trying to add Mr. Obama to that exclusive club composed of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton (Richard Nixon was not actually impeached). What\u2019s notable is that their lack of interest is entirely practical\u2014i.e. they won\u2019t say the president doesn\u2019t deserve impeachment, only that it\u2019s not going to happen. Here\u2019s Mrs. Palin\u2019s former running mate, Senator John McCain: \u201cThere are not the votes here in the United States Senate to impeach the president of the United States and I think that we should focus our attention on winning elections. We win this election and we regain control of the United States Senate we can be far more effective than an effort to impeach the president, which has no chance of succeeding.\u201d\n\n\n\nRepresentative Blake Farenthold of Texas: \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize that the impeachment process starts in the House, when it passes articles of impeachment. Then there is a trial in the Senate and he won\u2019t be removed from office unless he is convicted in the Senate. The Senate won\u2019t even take up commonsense job bills. The chances they would actually impeach the president I think are between slim to none.\u201d And the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who\u2019s suing the president, just said \u201cI disagree\u201d when reporters asked him about Mrs. Palin\u2019s op-ed.",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 Walter Mondale has only one official title these days: Honorary Norwegian counsel-general here in his home town, a post that he owes to his heritage. But as a former senator, former vice president, and, of course, the first presidential candidate to select a woman as his running mate, Mr. Mondale was brimming over on Wednesday morning with a few thoughts about Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, who is scheduled to accept her nomination as vice president this evening. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a presidential candidate does that remotely compares in importance to picking the vice president,\u2019\u2019 the 80-year old Mr. Mondale told a visitor to his law office high above the Mississippi River here. \u201cAnd you have to be ready to answer a few questions about whoever you pick.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\n        With a twinkle in his eye, the old Democratic pol added, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear McCain answer these.\u2019\u2019 The first, he said, is: \u201cIs she ready for the presidency? And how does she strengthen the President? Because you know, there are some tricks to this job.\u2019\u2019 Whether Republicans or Democrats win in November, he said \u201cthere will be messes on the Hill. And that\u2019s what I did a lot of as vice president,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI spent a lot of time cleaning up messes on the Hill.\u2019\u2019 The second is to act as an early-warning radar for brewing problems \u2013 which means having deep connections in the government, with people honest enough to say things they might not say to the president. Ms. Palin, he said, \u201cseems like a lovely person\u2019\u2019 but is so detached from Washington that she is unlikely to serve in that role. The third, he said, is to \u201cextend the president\u2019s power abroad.\u2019\u2019 When he was vice president to Jimmy Carter, he noted, he spent a lot of time in the Middle East, and dealing with the Chinese. (Under President Clinton, he came back to government to serve as ambassador to Japan, and he played a significant behind-the-scenes role managing the first nuclear crisis with North Korea, in 1994.) Dick Cheney, he said, \u201ctook the vice presidency off the rails.\u2019\u2019 But, he added, at least he is in Georgia today, bearing a billion dollars in aid for Georgia in the wake of the Russian invasion last week. He suggested that Ms. Palin might not be quite ready for that role, even if, as an Alaskan, she is accustomed to living on the borders of Russia. Then there\u2019s the unglamorous part of the job, he said. \u201cRemember, the vice president is the only other officer of the government without a bureaucratic constituency. You have to be able to hear out all sides, and know how what you\u2019re hearing is being affected\u2019\u2019 as members of the cabinet maneuver for more budget, or more authority. Ever since the announcement of Ms. Palin\u2019s selection on Friday, there have been endless comparisons to Geraldine Ferraro, the congresswoman that Mr. Mondale chose as his running mate 24 years ago \u2013 only to discover that there were a few questions that should have been asked earlier, mostly about her husband\u2019s willingness to let the world see his financial dealings. Mr. Mondale  argued that his staff had vetted Ms. Ferraro \u201cfor probably three weeks\u2019\u2019 before he announced her selection. \u201cShe was a known quantity,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cShe had been a leader in the House. I had known her for a long time.\u2019\u2019 While Mr. McCain surrounded his choice in nearly obssessive secrecy, Mr. Mondale recalled that \u201cwe deliberately leaked almost every name we were considering.\u2019\u2019 The reason, he said, was to \u201cfind out ahead of time if there\u2019s anything we might want to know.\u2019\u2019 Still, Mr. Mondale was in for a surprise: Ms. Ferraro\u2019s  husband balked at releasing tax returns that would expose his financial dealings. That drama played out for weeks, he recalled, ending in a press conference \u201cwhere she answered questions until everyone was exhausted. But the damage was done.  \u201cWe lost momentum,\u2019\u2019 he said. He also lost the election.",

      "content": "Sarah Palin\u2019s family-reality-show-slash-travelogue, \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska,\u201d began on Sunday night before almost five million viewers on TLC. TLC said it was the biggest premiere in the channel\u2019s history. Some have called the series a campaign ad for Ms. Palin, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008 and a possible presidential candidate in 2012. Others have labeled it a get-rich-quick scheme, since she quit her job as governor of Alaska last year. Ms. Palin and Mark Burnett, the well-known reality TV producer, shopped what became \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska\u201d to the broadcast networks and to a bevy of cable channels and eventually signed a deal with TLC. TLC supported \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska\u201d with one of its biggest marketing campaigns in memory. One of the online advertisements made a cheeky reference to an \u201cSNL\u201d satire of Ms. Palin: it declared, \u201cI can see \u2018Sarah Palin\u2019s Alaska\u2019 from my living room.\u201d For her part, Ms. Palin granted few interviews about the series, preferring to let Mr. Burnett and TLC officials do most of the talking. According to Nielsen, TLC averaged 4.96 million viewers for the first episode. Among 25- to 54-year-olds, the program averaged 1.8 million viewers. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote in a review, \u201cMostly, the eight-part series lives up to its title \u2014 the camera follows the former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee as she fishes, hunts, dog-sleds and rock-climbs. It\u2019s a nature series for political voyeurs: viewers get to observe Ms. Palin observing nature.\u201d The schedule of TLC, which is owned by Discovery Communications, is stocked with reality shows about unusual families \u2014 big, small and famous. Its most famous couple, Jon and Kate Gosselin, split up last year amid a much-publicized spat. More recently the channel gained attention for a series about a Utah family that practices polygamy.",

      "content": "\u201cSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\u201d writers have devastatingly lampooned Mitt Romney as a corny, coreless candidate who evokes an \u201cEh, I guess\u201d response in voters. Now they\u2019re worried that we\u2019re heading, comedy-wise, toward an \u201cEh, I guess\u201d election. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as much fun as 2000 and 2008,\u201d Jim Downey, the show\u2019s inimitable satirist, told me. \u201cWhen you have an incumbent president, it\u2019s not wholly new. And because of the long Republican primary debate stretch, I\u2019m already tired of Romney. I wish there could be a crazy brokered convention with someone we\u2019ve never heard of to keep it fresh. But you don\u2019t get a gift like Sarah Palin very often, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d You\u2019re telling me. \u201cComedy writers are incredibly promiscuous, and we want as many targets as possible,\u201d agreed Seth Meyers, the clever \u201cS.N.L.\u201d head writer and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d anchor. \u201cWe really slowed down in the second four years of Bush.\u201d Stuck with a Tin Man-versus-Spock race, the writers perk up at the thought of Romney\u2019s picking the crackling Chris Christie as his running mate. But Mitt seems too programmed to risk his hard-won chance at the brass ring on a brassy partner who might overshadow him. Two of the most hallucinatory moments in \u201cS.N.L.\u201d history came in 2008, when Tina Fey\u2019s Sarah Palin and the real Palin sashayed past each other, and when John McCain roguishly appeared in a skit with Fey\u2019s Palin going rogue. \u201cSarah Palin was a once-in-a-lifetime situation,\u201d Meyers marveled. \u201cShe was incredibly magnetic and came with a built-in catchphrase.\u201d She, like Joe Biden, inspires what Meyers calls \u201cwet comedy\u201d (as opposed to dry), and they both have what Downey calls \u201chandles,\u201d quirks of speech and personality that both writers and performers can latch onto. Having played John Kerry in 2004, Meyers has experience puncturing a stiff, rich guy who has a hard time getting anyone to like him. \u201cThe fun thing with Mitt Romney is, here\u2019s a guy who has to look in the mirror every day and see that he looks exactly the way a president should look,\u201d Meyers said, and yet he can\u2019t catch fire. \u201cThere\u2019s a creepy youth minister kind of squareness to him, especially combined with that goofy eagerness to please,\u201d Downey said. \u201cPeople are perfectly willing to accept people different from them as long as they don\u2019t try to pretend otherwise.\u201d In a sketch last week written by Downey, Jason Sudeikis\u2019s Romney pandered three exits past shameless talking to different groups. He told the American Diabetes Association, \u201cNo one wants to get sick, you know, but frankly I\u2019ve always thought that if I had to develop a chronic disease, you know I hoped it would be adult onset diabetes, I mean what a fascinating illness.\u201d The five Romney sons have also taken a ribbing. The hilarious Bill Hader, playing an Anthony Perkins in \u201cPsycho\u201d version of the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith, interviewed the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d sons, noting: \u201cI like creepy things and I love these guys. ... Our thanks to Stephen King for creating those boys.\u201d Meyers says that \u201cthere\u2019s something funny about a candidate with all these fully grown adult sons. When it comes to an adorable competition, they certainly don\u2019t beat Sasha and Malia.\u201d Lorne Michaels, the show\u2019s executive producer, has offered a guest spot to Romney, who is considering it. \u201cHe was funny on Letterman, giving the Top Ten list,\u201d Downey said. \u201cS.N.L.\u201d has always struggled with its Obama impersonation because Obama is \u201csmooth without big handles,\u201d as Downey puts it. To the dismay of the president, Fred Armisen plays it more as pedantic white guy than cool black guy. In The Times, the writer Jason Zinoman complained: \u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating about these performances is the same thing that has left many in Mr. Obama\u2019s base disillusioned. Mr. Armisen seems sometimes to blend into the background.\u201d Meyers recalled that, after the Navy Seals raid that killed Osama last year, the show did a sketch with Obama \u201cgetting his mojo back.\u201d \u201cIt would be really fun to see that Obama again on the show, the confident Obama who comes out on the campaign trail,\u201d he said. When Rick Santorum dropped out, Meyers tweeted about the Santorum impersonator Andy Samberg: \u201cAbout to sit down Samberg and tell him he\u2019s not going to play the president. This part of the job is never easy.\u201d But with rumors buzzing that Samberg, plus Sudeikis, who plays Mitt Romney, and Kristen Wiig, who plays Ann Romney, are leaving the show, will different white-bread Romney mimics be required? \u201cI\u2019m sure they would stick around for the pre-election shows,\u201d Downey said. Maybe Stefon can moderate the debates. But meanwhile, Downey is leavening the prospect of an \u201ceh\u201d campaign by plotting to follow up his hilarious Keith Olbermann sketch (performed by the host Ben Affleck) with a send-up of Sean Hannity. \u201cI think I\u2019m right in saying,\u201d Downey observed, \u201cthat he\u2019s the dumbest person who\u2019s ever been paid to speak on television.\u201d",

      "content": "When I walked into the Strand Bookstore in Manhattan last week, I headed straight for the bright young thing who wore an \u201cAsk Me\u201d button, and asked her to point me to the section of the store where I might find Sarah Palin\u2019s memoir, \u201cGoing Rogue: An American Life.\u201d  She looked at me as if I had  requested a copy of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d signed in blood by the author, and directed me to the nearest Barnes and Noble, where, presumably, readers of dubious taste and sensibility could find what they wanted. A few days later, I attended a seminar on political and legal theory where a distinguished scholar observed that every group has its official list of angels and devils. As an example, he offered the fact (of which he was supremely confident) that few, if any, in the room were likely to be Sarah Palin fans. By that time I had begun reading Palin\u2019s book, and while I wouldn\u2019t count myself a fan in the sense of being a supporter, I found it compelling and very well done.\n\n\n\nMy assessment of the book has nothing to do with the accuracy of its accounts. Some news agencies have fact-checkers poring over every sentence, which would be to the point if  the book were a biography, a genre that  is judged by the degree to which the factual claims being made  can be verified down to the last assertion. \u201cGoing Rogue,\u201d however, is an autobiography, and  while autobiographers certainly insist that they are telling the truth, the truth the genre promises is the truth about themselves \u2014 the kind of persons they are \u2014 and even when they are being mendacious or self-serving (and I don\u2019t mean to imply that Palin is either), they are, necessarily, fleshing out that truth. As I remarked in a previous column, autobiographers cannot lie because anything they say will truthfully serve their project, which, again, is not to portray the facts, but to portray themselves. The questions to ask then are (1) Does Palin succeed in conveying to her readers the kind of person she is? and (2) Does she do it in a satisfying and artful way? In short, is the book a good autobiographical read? I would answer \u201cyes\u201d to both. First, the art. The book has an architectonic  structure  that is built around a single moment, the moment when Palin receives a call from John McCain inviting her to be the vice-presidential candidate of the Republican party. When we first hear about the call it is as much a surprise to us as it was (at least as reported) to her, because for six pages she has been recounting a wonderful family outing at the Alaska State Fair. When her phone rings, she hopes it might be a call from her son Track, a soldier soon to deploy to Iraq, but \u201cit was Senator John McCain asking if I wanted to help him change history.\u201d And that\u2019s the last we hear of it for 200 pages. In between we hear a lot about Wasilla, high school, basketball, college, marriage, children, Down syndrome, Alaska politics, the environment, a daughter\u2019s pregnancy.  The re-entry of John McCain into the narrative on page 208 introduces Palin\u2019s account of the presidential campaign and its aftermath, especially her decision to resign the governorship before the end of her term.  In the epilogue, another 200 pages on, the famous call  serves as a bookend: \u201cIt is one year ago this week that I got the call from John McCain.\u201d Paradoxically, the effect of the neatly spaced references to the call is to de-emphasize it as a dramatic moment. It is presented not as a climax, but as an interruption of matters more central to Palin\u2019s abiding concerns \u2014 her family, Alaska\u2019s prosperity, energy policy. (She loves to rehearse the kind of wonkish details we associate with Hillary Clinton, whom she admires.) Indeed, it is a feature of this narrative that events we might have expected to be foregrounded are elided or passed over. Palin introduced herself to the nation with a powerful, electrifying speech accepting McCain\u2019s invitation to join the ticket. It gets half a sentence (\u201cI gave my speech\u201d). Chapter Two ends with Palin, no longer a mayor, wondering what she is going to do next. Four paragraphs into Chapter Three we learn, almost parenthetically,  that she had decided to run for governor. (When and how did that happen?) The  only event that receives an extended discussion is her resignation. It is important to her because as an act it reflects on her integrity, and she has to be sure (as she eventually was) that she was doing it for the right reasons. Resigning was a moral act for which she was responsible. The vice-presidential candidacy just happened to her; her account of it reads like an extended \u201cwhat-I-did-on-my summer-and fall-vacation\u201d essay. For many politicians, family life is sandwiched in between long hours in public service. Palin wants us to know that for her it is the reverse. Political success is an accident  that says nothing about you. Success as a wife, mother and citizen says everything. Do I believe any of this? It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that she does, and that her readers feel they are hearing an authentic voice. I find the voice undeniably authentic (yes, I know the book was written \u201cwith the help\u201d of Lynn Vincent, but many books, including my most recent one, are put together by an editor).  It is the voice of small-town America, with its folk wisdom, regional pride, common sense, distrust of rhetoric (itself a rhetorical trope), love of country and instinctive (not doctrinal) piety. It says, here are some of the great things that have happened to me, but  they are not what makes my life great  and American. (\u201cAn American life is an extraordinary life.\u201d) It says, don\u2019t you agree with me that family, freedom and the beauties of nature are what sustain us? And it also says, vote for me next time. For it is the voice of a politician, of the little girl who thought she could fly, tried it, scraped her knees, dusted herself off and \u201ckept walking.\u201d In the end, perseverance, the ability to absorb defeat without falling into defeatism, is the key to Palin\u2019s character. It\u2019s what makes her run in both senses of the word and it is no accident that the physical act of running is throughout the book the metaphor for joy and real life. Her handlers in the McCain campaign wouldn\u2019t let her run (a mistake, I think, even at the level of photo-op), no doubt because they feared another opportunity to go \u201coff script,\u201d to \u201cgo rogue.\u201d But run she does (and falls, but so what?), and when it is all over and she has lost the vice presidency and resigned the governorship, she goes on a long run and rehearses in her mind the eventful year she has chronicled. And as she runs, she achieves equilibrium and hope: \u201cWe\u2019ve been through amazing days, and really, there wasn\u2019t one thing to complain about. I feel such freedom, such hope, such thankfulness for our country, a place where nothing is hopeless.\u201d The message is clear. America can\u2019t be stopped. I can\u2019t be stopped. I\u2019ve stumbled and fallen, but I always get up and run again.  Her political opponents, especially those who dismissed Ronald Reagan before he was elected, should take note. Wherever you are, you better watch out. Sarah Palin is coming to town.",

      "content": "For a comedy show, the minds behind \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sure care a lot about fairness. Speaking at an event sponsored by the Museum of the Moving Image on Monday, cast members Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler discussed Saturday\u2019s influential sketch featuring Ms. Poehler as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tina Fey as Sarah Palin. \u201cThe trick with all of these people is to try to come out as fair and evenhanded as possible,\u201d Mr. Meyers, who is also the head writer for \u201cSNL,\u201d said. Mr. Meyers said the inclusion of Ms. Poehler\u2019s Clinton character \u201cmade it safer to mention things about Sarah Palin without making it seem like an attack piece.\u201d Among the jokes: POEHLER AS CLINTON: \u201cAnything. I believe that diplomacy should be the cornerstone of any foreign policy.\u201d\n\nFEY AS PALIN: \u201cAnd I can see Russia from my house.\u201d\n\nPOEHLER AS CLINTON: \u201cI believe global warming is caused by man.\u201d\n\nFEY AS PALIN: \u201cAnd I believe it\u2019s just God hugging us closer.\u201d Saturday\u2019s \u201cSNL,\u201d featuring the Palin sketch as the cold open, was the highest-rated edition of the show since 2002. The Palin sketch has been viewed more than five million times online. The cast members said the sketch was one of the more fluid ones they had done, as changes were being made up until the final minutes before the show. \u201cThe Palin people were happy with it as well, which was the weird thing,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. Ms. Palin\u2019s staff said Sunday that the Republican vice presidential nominee watched the episode on her campaign plane. \u201cShe thought it was quite funny,\u201d a campaign adviser said in an email response to inquiries, \u201cespecially because the governor has dressed up as Tina Fey for Halloween.\u201d Ms. Poehler joked that there was \u201ca lot of sexual energy\u201d between the two characters. \u201cMy dream is you, Tina and a podium,\u201d Mr. Meyers responded. Ms. Fey, the star of the NBC sitcom \u201c30 Rock\u201d who bears a striking resemblance to Ms. Palin, agreed to return to \u201cSNL\u201d to play the character. \u201cThis was a situation where the audience just cast Tina Fey,\u201d Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of \u201cSNL,\u201d said at the panel discussion in Manhattan. \u201cThe audience sort of felt that\u2019s who they wanted to see,\u201d even though at least two current \u201cSNL\u201d cast members could have played Ms. Palin \u201cperfectly,\u201d he added. Mr. Michaels wondered aloud whether the Democratic primary would have turned out differently if Ms. Clinton had appeared on \u201cSNL\u201d earlier last season. In August 2007, Ms. Clinton\u2019s office called and said \u201cshe wanted to come on,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. The program planned to have her appear, but she backed out shortly thereafter. Barack Obama wound up appearing in November, two months ahead of the all-important Iowa caucus. Ms. Clinton did not appear until March. \u201cI don\u2019t know how things would have turned out if she had been on that first show, or if Obama had been on that first show,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cI think if she had been there, I think people would have gotten a glimpse into who she is.\u201d He noted that there was a sense at the time that she felt entitled to be the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cI think when politicians over-think things and become super-cautious and start eliminating things, I think they get further and further from who they are, and I think the audience senses it,\u201d Mr. Michaels added. The four panelists are clearly looking forward to the first presidential debate on Sept. 26. \u201cDebates are perfect for sketches because you\u2019re making fun of both sides,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. James Downey, the lead writer for the political sketches on \u201cSNL,\u201d noted that the debate will take place on a Friday night, leaving the writers only 24 hours to figure out how to opine on it. Mr. Downey said the writers will probably write some \u201cpre-fab\u201d jokes in advance of the actual debate. \u201cThen we\u2019ll just have a hellish night and hope for the best,\u201d he said.",

At the Republican National Convention, however, the party line is that the nomination is an excellent one. That was the position Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, took in an informal chat with reporters.  \u201cWe all know about Joe,\u201d said Senator Graham, defending the Republican ticket by speaking \u2014 as if regretfully \u2014 of how, well, there are no real surprises to be discovered about Senator Joe Biden, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Imagine, no surprises. The lack of surprise about a candidate was portrayed as near a character flaw in Senator Graham\u2019s spin mission today as he avidly defended Governor Palin, up to and including the latest surprise, her looming grand-motherhood, and whatever might come next. \u201cShe is more like the rest of us,\u201d said Senator Graham, invoking what is already a definitive convention mantra.  Delegates are finding increasing comfort in that observation, despite the fact that some of the news coming out about Governor Palin \u2014 such as her reported ties to a group that promotes Alaska\u2019s right to vote on seceding from the United States \u2014 sounds more fringe than mainstream. Even as McCain campaign lawyers were reported to be spending time in Alaska for some belated vetting, Senator Graham portrayed Governor Palin in interviews as Oval Office ready. Senator Graham saw no drawback in the governor\u2019s lack of foreign policy experience.  \u201cDomestically and internationally, she\u2019d be better for America than Senator Obama,\u201d he told the gathered reporters. Senator Graham insisted the governor was not a desperate last-minute choice to appease the GOP\u2019s restless base of social conservatives.  \u201cJohn has been talking about her for months,\u201d he said. What does the Senator think about the prospect of Governor Palin becoming President \u2014 a prime consideration for a V.P. pick? \u201cThe McCain team will be around her,\u201d Senator Graham said, exuding confidence. \u201cShe\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Senator Graham stuck to the McCain campaign\u2019s talking points about why the selection was political genius. \u201cJohn felt we are matching history with history,\u201d he said. \u201cMaverick picks maverick.\u201d He had no regrets about incomplete vetting, or about the string of revelations about Governor Palin that have emerged since Friday.  \u201cI think we played this very well,\u201d he said.",

Asked whether CNN felt a need to be edgier, since it\u2019s up against opinion on MSNBC and FOX, she said no. \u201cThey are both partisan and bringing their partisan views into what they do, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as opinion. For me, it\u2019s about accountability. I\u2019m approaching this as a journalist,\u201d she said, adding that she would take on Senator Barack Obama when she thinks he crosses the line. And yes, by the way, she does think that the McCain campaign is being sexist about Ms. Palin. \u201cThe McCain campaign says that if she were a man, the media would not be treating her this way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s fair of me to ask, if she were a man, would they be coddling her this way?\u201d Readers who posted comments on the CNN Web site had mixed reactions. \u201cIf it\u2019s provocative,\u201d Ms. Brown said, \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",

I\u2019ve been running now easy for 35 years.\u201d In a lengthy interview, Gov. Palin reveals she can run a sub-4 hour marathon, kept running during each of her pregnancies and got annoyed with the staff of Sen. John McCain for not giving her time in her schedule for regular runs. And she tells a great story about the bandage on her hand during her vice presidential debate with Joe Biden, when she went for a run on John McCain\u2019s ranch in Arizona a few days before: My favorite thing in the world is to run on hot, dusty roads. I don\u2019t get enough of that in Alaska, so I was in heaven. And there were plenty of hills, so I knew my thighs were going to just throb and my lungs were going to burn, and that\u2019s what I crave. I like running alone, and having the Secret Service with me added a little bit of pressure. I\u2019m thinking I gotta have good form and can\u2019t be hyperventilating and can\u2019t be showing too much pain, and that adds a little more pressure on you as you\u2019re trying to be out there enjoying your run. Then I fell coming down a hill and was so stinkin\u2019 embarrassed that a golf cart full of Secret Service guys had to pull up beside me. My hands just got torn up and I was dripping blood.

      "content": "A recent segment of \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska,\u201d her live-action show on TLC, was preceded by a warning that parts of it \u201cmay be disturbing to some viewers.\u201d Presumably this referred to scenes of Ms. Palin clubbing to death a huge halibut and then triumphantly holding up a still-beating halibut heart, images that probably did send chills down the spines of animal lovers and moderate Republicans. But no scene in the show is as disturbing as the way she uses it to enhance her political glow. The eight hours of \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska\u201d are a visually sumptuous \u2014 if occasionally bloody \u2014 marketing campaign for an ostensibly undeclared presidential candidate. They are yet another in a series of brilliant bypasses of conventional politics that may provide Ms. Palin with a legacy. Other candidates have found new ways to reach voters \u2014 Barack Obama\u2019s e-mail fund-raising in 2008 comes to mind \u2014 but having one\u2019s own hagiographic reality show is a chapter in an entirely new playbook. And Ms. Palin is astonishingly good at turning every halibut clubbing and caribou shooting into an advertisement for her own ruggedness or a political parable. The program is theoretically nonpolitical and its producers have a blog intended to siphon off heated arguments among viewers. But having converted her lifestyle and family into political accessories, Ms. Palin never resists temptation when it comes along and the cameras are rolling. Referring to the 14-foot wall that her husband built for protection from the journalist Joe McGinniss, who moved in next door, Ms. Palin says, \u201cThis is what we need to do to secure our nation\u2019s border.\u201d She says she loves that the liberals \u201cget all wee-wee\u2019d up\u201d that her baby shower was held in a shooting range. And she exults that her teenage daughter Willow is gutting salmon instead of texting or partying, perhaps suggesting that her parenting skills are what the nation needs, too. In the two years since her rocky vice presidential candidacy, Ms. Palin has become famously contemptuous of the \u201clamestream media,\u201d which she has often described as elite and conspiratorial (against her and America\u2019s exceptionalism). She would not be the first politician who has stumbled and then lashed at the press for its lack of balance. But the parallel structure Ms. Palin has created as an alternative to conventional scrutiny and campaigning has been remarkably effective. She is a regular on Fox News and its affiliated radio shows, and her book tour (no questions from reporters, please) has taken her largely to Republican-leaning primary states. As a recent article in The New York Times Magazine documented, she has no need for an actual press staff and believes it is sufficient to communicate largely through Twitter and Facebook. And as long as she remains more provocative than substantive, her strategy works. On Monday, at 3:17 p.m., she issued a Facebook broadside that blamed the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d for the latest round of WikiLeak revelations. Within three hours, it was \u201cliked\u201d by more than 4,000 followers and picked up by scores of major news organizations and blogs, though its suggestion that the administration might have been able to stop the leaks was partisan wishful thinking. \u201cShe tweets one thing, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a room full of people that want to know,\u201d Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, complained to The Times Magazine, referring to the White House press corps. But Mr. Gibbs and his successors will probably have to get used to it. Ms. Palin will not be the last potential candidate to aim her political fire from a camouflage blind, and then retreat to a careful seclusion where only easygoing questions can be asked. We now live in a world where a politician can be the executive producer of her own precampaign show. A world where a governor can quit her elected job and make far more money, and political headway, creating a television legend as America\u2019s most fearless outdoorswoman and most encouraging mother to her brood of hunters and fishers. A world where millions of supporters flock to this portrait of a way of life that is radically different from the way most Americans now live and get some extremist politics mixed in with the supposed nostalgia. To paraphrase TLC, voter discretion is now advised.",

      "content": "DENVER \u2014 Senator John McCain\u2019s surprise announcement that he had chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate this morning turbocharged blogs on the left and right, and slammed our inboxes with release after release from public officialdom. Conservatives, who had been a worrisome, unenthusiastic constituency for Mr. McCain, cited the governor\u2019s known positions on their issues \u2014 spending, energy/drilling, abortion and same-sex marriage to name a few \u2014 and gave preliminary nods of approval from some corners. (But not all.) At least for the day, the announcement has generated considerable excitement among Republicans, who had been on the low-end of the so-called enthusiasm gap in comparison to the Democratic ticket of Senator Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a television interview today, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, equated Ms. Palin\u2019s role as a \u201cchange agent\u201d on the Republican ticket to that of Mr. Obama on the opposite side, with Senators McCain and Biden representing longtime Washington insiders. Erick Erickson, editor of the mega-blog RedState, expressed equal parts shock and excitement about Mr. McCain\u2019s choice just after the news broke: \u201cHoly cow, this is a game changer if, in fact, John McCain has chosen her. Serious game changer. Wow.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so hot and sweaty, because we\u2019ve been jumping around and hugging,\u201d Lori Viars, a social conservative activist in Lebanon, Ohio, who had been a staunch Mike Huckabee supporter and had previously struggled to muster enthusiasm for Mr. McCain, told our colleague Michael Luo. \u201cIt is too good to be true,\u201d she added, after attending the announcement rally in Dayton. \u201cThis is better than we could have ever expected.\u201d Glenn Reynolds, a heavyweight of the right-leaning blogosphere who is better known as Instapundit, wrote: \u201cThe Insta-Wife is ecstatic, which may bode well for that demographic. I\u2019d like it if she had more executive experience, but to be fair, she\u2019s got more than anyone else on either ticket. Is she too liberal on gay rights? Not for me, but maybe for some people.\u201d Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator and former presidential candidate, however, captured a few of the themes coalescing today as the news began to settle in: \u201cShe\u2019s probably the most dynamic young conservative in the country,\u201d he said. (And F.Y.I., he also noted that Ms. Palin had held a fund-raiser for him in the 1990\u2019s.) But while Mr. Buchanan gushed on MSNBC this morning and this afternoon that \u201cthis girl\u201d or \u201cthis gal\u201d was \u201cbeloved by the base,\u201d he also called it \u201cthe biggest political gamble\u201d in recent history. As the day wore on, the questions and the commentary became more probing, with Republicans and Democrats alike trying to sort through the known and the unknown about the 44-year-old woman who just became governor two years ago. With the election only two months away, analysts and others began weighing the balance between what they sense is the freshness of Mr. McCain\u2019s choice (including the XX-factor) and the unsettling notion that there is little time for the public and the campaign to learn more about Ms. Palin. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and commentator, declared that the short fall season would make defining the governor a game of \u201cjump ball\u201d between the two parties. And at the National Review Online, several editors and commentators gave mixed to thumbs-down reviews to Mr. McCain\u2019s decision. For one, Ramesh Ponnuru cited Governor Palin\u2019s inexperience and prowess as a debater, especially against an opponent as formidable as Senator Biden. And he also touched on \u201ctokenism,\u201d writing: \u201cCan anyone say with a straight face that Palin would have gotten picked if she were a man?\u201d I am not even sure that the pick will have quite the galvanizing effect on conservatives that it seems to be having now as it sinks in. The concerns I\u2019ve mentioned here \u2014 about her readiness and her credentials \u2014 are the kind of thing that many conservative voters take seriously. Kathryn Jean Lopez, an editor at NRO, offered up an opinion from a  reader who seemed even less impressed: \u201cConsidering both McCain\u2019s advanced age and the state of the world today, it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president. I don\u2019t have any confidence in Palin\u2019s ability to deal effectively with Iran, Russia, China, etc.  I certainly will not cast a vote for Obama-Biden, but nor will I vote for McCain-Palin.\u201d (An earlier version of this post mistakenly attributed this quote to Ms. Lopez.) Other conservative writers who were expressing doubts about Mr. McCain\u2019s choice seemed a bit swayed after listening to Governor Palin\u2019s speech in Dayton today. Paul Merengoff of the Power Line blog first uttered disappointment that Senator McCain picked \u201csomeone as inexperienced and lacking in foreign policy and national security background as Sarah Palin.\u201d\n\nIn an update following her debut, he added: \u201cShe looks great on the stump and speaks very well. Her husband, it turns out, is a member of the Steelworkers Union, and looks like he was sent by central casting.\u201d In a diary over at RedState, Jeff Weimer highlighted the labor affiliation, not a usual one for Republicans. \u201cWill it get my lifelong Democrat parents (and Hillary fans) to vote GOP? I\u2019ll work on them. We\u2019re all Scoop Jackson Democrats (quite conservative), staying with the party because they are staunchly pro-union (Dad is retired railroad). Like it or not, McCain is, really, a Scoop Jackson Democrat, it\u2019s just the party left them behind when they went, well, left. I migrated to the GOP, they remain Dem out of loyalty, but reserve the right to vote for whomever they please. Will this tip the scales? Look at it this way \u2013 no other VP nominee would have me even entertain the idea.\u201d But as the vetting of Governor Palin\u2019s record begins within the public realm, special interest groups and organizations have begun raising issues that will likely be mined much more in the coming weeks. Among those subsets are the environment (she\u2019s opposed to listing the polar bear as an endangered species); energy (she\u2019s a big proponent of drilling); abortion and other similar touchstone issues for conservatives; and of course, the female factor. On government spending, groups like the Club for Growth praised her reputation for restraint in government spending. \u201cAt a time when many Republicans are still clinging to pork-barrel politics, Governor Palin has quickly become a leader on this issue,\u201d said Pat Toomey, its president. \u201cShe is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the Republican brand.\u201d Rob Bluey, of the conservative-libertarian Heritage Foundation also mentioned fiscal matters in an email to us today, as well as citing her perceived willingness to tackle government corruption. He said that she had become \u201ca hero of conservatives when she killed the Bridge to Nowhere. Her willingness to take on pork-barrel spending and government corruption sends a strong signal to Washington. Her extensive experience on energy issues and her pro-life record demonstrate a commitment to free-market values and conservative principles.\u201d Democrats and left-leaning bloggers are already scrubbing the Palin claims on the Bridge to Nowhere, a symbol of pork-barrel projects that Senator McCain always mentions. Over at The New Republic\u2019s The Plank blog, Bradford Plumer  begins a fact-check of this claim, first citing an answer she gave in an Anchorage Daily News article in October 2006 when Ms. Palin was running for the gubernatorial seat: 5. Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges? Yes. I would like to see Alaska\u2019s infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now\u2013while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist. So she was very much for the bridge and insisted that Alaska had to act quickly\u2014the party of Ted Stevens and Don Young might soon lose its majority, after all. By that point, though, the project was endangered for reasons that had nothing to do with Palin\u2014the \u201cBridge to Nowhere\u201d had become a national punchline, Congress had stripped away the offending earmark, moving the money back to the state\u2019s general fund, and future federal support seemed unlikely. True, after Palin was sworn into office that fall, her first state budget didn\u2019t allocate any money for the bridge. But when the Daily News asked on December 16, 2006, if she now opposed the project, Palin demurred and said she was simply trying to figure out where the bridge fit on the state\u2019s list of transportation priorities, given the lack of support from Congress. Finally, on September 19, 2007, she decided to redirect funds away from the project altogether with this sorry-sounding statement: \u201cKetchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398 million bridge is not the answer,\u201d said Governor Palin. \u201cDespite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329 million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it\u2019s clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island,\u201d Governor Palin added. \u201cMuch of the public\u2019s attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here. But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened.\u201d Energy and environment issues also moved front-and-center with Governor Palin\u2019s selection. While she boasted that she had confronted the \u201cBig Oil\u201d companies today over profits and revenues, the governor remains a cheerleader for offshore drilling in the Artic and elsewhere. (With gasoline prices straining household budgets, recent polls indicate that the majority of the American public supports drilling as well.) But just hours after the announcement today, the League of Conservation Voters, which favors Mr. Obama\u2019s positions, issued this statement by its president, Gene Karpinski, listing the group\u2019s opposition to her stances on several matters: \u201cUnfortunately, with her support for drilling in the Arctic Refuge and off our coasts, Governor Palin will simply continue the failed policies of the Bush-Cheney Administration and their Big Oil friends \u2013 policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil. Governor Palin characterizes McCain\u2019s flip-flop on drilling offshore as a positive step in his transformation from maverick to Big Oil\u2019s best friend.  She has implored McCain to change his position against drilling in the Arctic \u2013 something she will have plenty of opportunities to pursue as his running mate. In addition to supporting backward-looking energy policies, Governor Palin has also opposed a crucial clean water initiative, sued the federal government for listing polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and opposed other important wildlife protection measures. My colleague Katharine Q. Seelye wrote earlier today about the effect Ms. Palin may have on the women\u2019s vote and those disaffected supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. And releases have been pouring in all day. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a trailblazer herself as the first female head of the House of Representatives, questioned Mr. McCain\u2019s judgment and raised the abortion issue in the form of Roe vs. Wade and future appointments to the Supreme Court. \u201cWhy, when the country is fighting two wars, facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis, did Senator McCain make the choice that he did?,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi asked. \u201cWhy, with so many other qualified women and men in his party, did John McCain choose Sarah Palin?  Sarah Palin is not the right choice.\u201d Ms. Palin belongs to the anti-abortion organization \u201cFeminists for Life,\u201d which released confirmation today of her membership since 2006, but said that it was nonpartisan and did not endorse candidates. The governor was already set to be honored by the Republican Coalition for Life at the party\u2019s convention in St. Paul. The Times\u2019s Michael Luo notes that the group\u2019s Web site singled out the decision by Mrs. Palin and her husband, Todd, to go ahead and give birth to their now five-month old son, Trig, even though he was diagnosed in the womb with Down\u2019s syndrome. The site featured a statement from Ms. Palin, released after she gave birth: \u201cTrig is beautiful and already adored by us. We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives. We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\u201d In an interview with Mr. Luo, Richard Land, who leads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, pointed to Ms. Palin\u2019s son as something that could be a key signal to evangelicals and other social conservatives that she was one of them. \u201cIt shows that she not only talks pro-life, she is pro-life,\u201d he said. With Ms. Palin on the ticket, abortion indeed may once again predominate in the battle over women\u2019s votes even as the Democrats have expanded the language in the party platform to be more accepting of those opposed to abortion rights. Gender issues may be heightened, not lessened, with the inclusion of a woman on a presidential ticket. Mr. Merengoff, the conservative blogger at PowerLine, lamented today: \u201cSadly, but not surprisingly, identity politics has run amok in this country. In my view, Palin wouldn\u2019t have been seriously considered for vice president but for her gender. But at least she appears to be a very substantial person with real potential for high office.\u201d We\u2019re not sure what he means by \u201cat least.\u201d Michael Luo contributed to this post.",

      "content": "ST. PAUL Sarah Palin came out of hiding Wednesday night, and boy, she seemed ticked off. \u201cHere\u2019s a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I\u2019m not going to Washington to win their good opinion,\u201d said the moose-gutting, polar bear-trashing, aerobics-class-networking vice presidential nominee. This was shortly after two very prominent Republican commentators got caught trashing Palin\u2019s candidacy when they thought an MSNBC microphone had been turned off. There has been a lot of that going around this year, people. We can do better. In the years to come, let us teach our children that if you can\u2019t say anything nice about somebody, step away from the voice enhancement equipment. The speech was very well done. The Palin family  \u2014  who we\u2019re supposed to ignore, but they did sort of seem to be pretty much front and center  \u2014  were adorable. And she was way more effective than the keynote speaker, Rudy Giuliani, at the red-meat-tossing detail. If you\u2019re going to be really mean for an extended period of time, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t look as if you want to lunge for the throat of the cameramen. We had been waiting for a long time to hear from Palin, who went to the mattresses almost immediately after she was introduced to the nation by John McCain last week. What followed was a long line of unexpected revelations, from the fabled teenage pregnancy to my own personal favorite: the threat to fire the town librarian who refused to censor books. Last night, Palin blamed the confusion and complaints on the news media, which hates her because she is \u201cnot a member in good standing of the Washington elite.\u201d John McCain, the member of the Washington elite who picked her, was temporarily unavailable for comment. Palin\u2019s speech totally swallowed up all the attention in St. Paul, leaving nothing whatsoever for speakers like Mitt Romney, who celebrated the convention Reform Day by announcing: \u201cWe need change all right! Change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington.\u201d Tragically, nobody seemed interested enough to point out that this made no sense. It\u2019s a long way from the golden days when Mitt invented the \u201cWashington is Broken\u201d slogan, and people took the time to ask him exactly who he thought had done the breaking. It\u2019s been one big reunion in Minnesota for the old gang  \u2014  Rudy and Mitt and Fred and Mike. Together again, for the first time since those primary debates. Reliving the golden days in which they managed to convince Republican voters that no matter what John McCain\u2019s defects, he could not possibly be as bad a candidate as they were. Did you see Fred Thompson? We had forgotten the electricity that is Fred until his speech on Tuesday, when he railed at the Democrats for overplaying Americans\u2019 economic woes. (\u201cListening to them, you\u2019d think we were in the middle of the Great Depression.\u201d) It was that same instinctive connection to the common man that had caused him to refer to the problems of unemployed Detroit factory workers as something that \u201cyou always find in a vibrant, dynamic economy.\u201d Reform Day was, of course, tailor-made for Palin, who is all about reform. Particularly, reforming the Republican party. Normally, in a democracy, the way you reform a party is by tossing it out of power until it learns its lesson and gets its act together. But the McCain-Palin plan is to reform Republicanism by keeping Republicans in control of the White House and most of the powerful posts in the federal government. That\u2019ll show them. Also fiscal reform. How many times have you heard McCain promise to slash taxes and pay for it by eliminating unnecessary programs? And who better to help carry out that agenda than the governor of a state whose residents pay less taxes than anyplace else in the union due to their genius in making the federal government pay the tab for virtually everything? \u201cTaxpayers have an advocate in Sarah Palin!\u201d said Giuliani in his keynote speech. Rudy had been extremely busy all day. In a stroke of genius, someone picked him to run around to the TV shows before Palin\u2019s address to defend McCain for picking her after having met her only once. When he was mayor, Giuliani hired people who had been in his inner circle since about the third grade. And most of them were terrible! So you see, there are lots of ways to screw up a big hire besides not thinking about it until the last minute. For all her great skills at presentation, many people, including some Republicans who think the microphone is off, believe that Sarah Palin is a terrible choice for running mate. But you have to remember who the other options were.",

In less than two months, she could be elected vice president to serve under the oldest president, at 72, ever elected to a first term, and one with a history of recurring melanoma. Intense, independent scrutiny by The Times and the rest of the news media of Palin\u2019s background, character and record was inevitable and right. And, yes, it was inevitable, and right to a more limited degree, that her family would come under the spotlight, too. As Bill Keller, The Times\u2019s executive editor, said, \u201cSenator McCain presented Mrs. Palin\u2019s experience as a mother as one of her qualifications for the job.\u201d It was also predictable that party professionals would object vigorously to stories that might undermine the image they were trying to project of Palin as an accomplished governor successfully juggling her \u201chockey mom\u201d family duties while fighting corruption in Alaska. But the Times article that drew the strongest complaints from the McCain camp was the one that questioned not her record but his judgment. Published on Tuesday\u2019s front page, the morning after Palin announced her daughter\u2019s pregnancy, the article said that revelation and a series of lesser disclosures called into question how thoroughly McCain had examined Palin\u2019s background. The article, researched by five reporters and written by Elisabeth Bumiller, quoted anonymous sources as saying that McCain had been holding out hope of choosing Senator Joseph Lieberman instead, and that a campaign team assigned to vet Palin more thoroughly had not arrived in Alaska until the day McCain asked her to be his running mate. A number of Alaska political figures said on the record that they had not found anyone who had been asked anything  about Palin by the McCain campaign. The Times article seemed dramatically at odds with one in The Washington Post two days earlier. The Post article quoted McCain advisers as saying that Palin had been thoroughly vetted, including an F.B.I. background check, and that, \u201cFar from being a last-minute tactical move or second choice when better-known alternatives were eliminated, Palin was very much in McCain\u2019s thinking from the beginning of the selection process.\u201d So was The Times story wrong, as the McCain camp said? It did contain one error. It said that one potentially embarrassing revelation about Palin was her membership for two years in the Alaskan Independence Party, which favors a vote on whether the state should secede. The assertion was based on an announcement by the party\u2019s chairwoman, Lynette Clark, which The Times failed to tell readers. That was a mistake. \u201cWe should have attributed it,\u201d Bumiller said. The next day, Clark said she had been wrong. It turns out that Palin\u2019s husband, Todd, had belonged to the party for a time,  and she had addressed its annual convention. The Times corrected the error in two follow-up stories. But the main thrust of its reporting on the vetting process appears to be holding up. The Post said the next day that a lengthy in-person background interview of Palin by the head of McCain\u2019s vetting team did not happen until the day before she was chosen. It also acknowledged that it had been incorrect when it reported that the F.B.I. had checked out Palin. In her home state, the Anchorage Daily News reported that it had found only one person who was asked anything about the governor before McCain selected her. That was the attorney representing her in an investigation of whether she had abused her power in office. \u201cWe stand by our reporting,\u201d said Richard Stevenson, the editor in charge of Times election coverage. Many readers, like John Southerland of Ocala, Fla., compared The Times\u2019s handling of John Edwards\u2019s extramarital affair and Bristol Palin\u2019s pregnancy and accused the newspaper of a double standard. The newspaper did not seriously pursue the story about Edwards, a populist Democrat, for months, but it put three stories involving Bristol Palin on the first page of its Web site and two on the front page of the printed paper. I took The Times to task for not trying to report the Edwards story until he acknowledged his affair, but once Edwards came forward, The Times put it on the front page and continued digging.  In Palin\u2019s case, the first hint of the daughter\u2019s pregnancy was the family\u2019s announcement of it, and once that happened,  it was front-page news everywhere, including the conservative Washington Times. Palin was the anointed Republican vice presidential candidate, and her family was very much part of the biography she was presenting to voters. Two of the New York Times articles were not directly about Bristol Palin: they were about how well McCain researched his choice and about women\u2019s discussions on how Sarah Palin could balance the demands of the vice presidency with the demands of having a pregnant teenager, a baby with Down syndrome and two other children at home. By choosing a running mate unknown to most of the nation, and doing so just before the Republican National Convention, John McCain made it inevitable that there would be a frantic media vetting. It turns out that Palin was for the Bridge to Nowhere before she was against it, that she sent e-mail complaining about a lack of disciplinary action against a state trooper who was going through a messy custody battle with her sister, and that she never made a decision as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard, one of her qualifications cited by McCain. The drip-drip-drip of these stories seems like partisanship to Palin\u2019s partisans. But they fill out the picture of who she is,  and they represent a free press doing its job, investigating a candidate who might one day be the leader of the Free World.",

      "content": "I see that Nate Silver has brought his usual statistical acumen to bear on my suggestion, in this week\u2019s column on the media\u2019s dysfunctional relationship to Sarah Palin, that a \u201cmajority of Americans \u2026are neither Palinoiacs nor Palinistas.\u201d Not so fast, he writes, citing a recent Politico survey on American attitudes toward various public figures: The survey asked people not just what they thought about these  political figures, but also how strong their opinions were. In the case  of John McCain, for instance, 11 percent of respondents said they had a very favorable view of him, and 25 percent had a very unfavorable  view. What I\u2019m interested in is which politicians induced the most of  these \u2019strong\u2019 responses, whether or not they were favorable or  unfavorable. Three politicians led the pack: the previous two presidents, Barack  Obama and George W. Bush \u2014 and Sarah Palin. Mr. Obama was viewed very  positively by 22 percent of respondents but very negatively by 33  percent of them, for 55 percent total. Ms. Palin\u2019s total was 53 percent,  broken down as 14 percent positive and 39 percent negative. Mr. Bush\u2019s  was 52 percent (16 percent positive, and 36 percent negative). \u2026 And so, to Mr. Douthat\u2019s chicken-and-egg dilemma \u2014 which came first: Ms.  Palin or the media\u2019s sometimes obsessive coverage of her? \u2014 we might  want to add a third actor: the audience. This is a fair point, and something I should have acknowledged in the column. Blaming the media and Palin for their increasingly toxic symbiosis risks understating the role that the public plays in generating demand for obsessive Palin coverage. The press wouldn\u2019t go to well so often if people weren\u2019t eager to drink. But let\u2019s be clear on what\u2019s going on here. Silver writes that \u201can unusually large number of Americans \u2026 have a  strong view of Ms. Palin.\u201d Likewise, TPM\u2019s Josh Marshall, in a revealing post defending his Web site\u2019s heavy Palin coverage, writes that Palin \u201cslices right through the society and generates one  intense response from one side and a completely opposite but equally  intense response from the other.\u201d Both of these lines make it sound like Palin generates love and fear in roughly equal measure. But in the poll Silver cites, Palin\u2019s \u201cvery positive\u201d numbers, while high, are not staggeringly so: Using this (admittedly) crude metric, she inspires slightly less devotion than George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton, and slightly more than Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney. It\u2019s her negative numbers that are off the charts: No politician, from Bush to Barack Obama to Nancy Pelosi, is hated so intensely by so many Americans. And this is what\u2019s so problematic, to my mind, about much of the Palin coverage: The media often acts as though they\u2019re covering her because her conservative fan base is so large (hence the endless talk about her 2012 prospects), when they\u2019re really covering her because so many liberals are eager to hear about, read about and then freak about whatever that awful, terrifying woman is up to now. Here\u2019s an illustrative passage from Marshall\u2019s post: With Sarah Palin and pretty much everyone else, we\u2019re not trying to  pump her up or pull her down or really do anything else with her.   That\u2019s a second order kind of thinking I don\u2019t think is really ever  proper for us to get involved in.  (To give one funny and ironic example  I\u2019m pretty sure our Eric Kleefeld was the first person to pick  out Palin\u2019s use of the term \u201cdeath panels\u201d in a Facebook post back  in during the Summer of Hate and much of the subsequent furor ricocheted  off that original post.) The parenthetical, it seems to me, somewhat undercuts the first two lines. The fact that TPM was the first to seize on the \u201cdeath panels\u201d provocation is neither \u201cfunny\u201d nor \u201cironic.\u201d\u00a0 Instead, it\u2019s typical of the Palin-press symbiosis. If you were a casual consumer of political news in 2009, you would assume that Palin\u2019s famous \u201cdeath panels\u201d remark received outsize media attention only after it became a rallying cry for the right-wing masses. But in reality, it received outsized media attention in part because a liberal Web site seized on it and ran with it as an example of the scary awfulness of Sarah Palin. And that pattern keeps repeating itself. It\u2019s why there\u2019s more Palin coverage in publications like TPM, MSNBC and Vanity Fair (not to mention, of course, a certain Palin-obsessed Atlantic blogger) than in many conservative outlets: Not because they\u2019re the only places willing to tell the truth about her, but because they\u2019ve built an audience that believes the worst about her, and enjoys wallowing in the fear and loathing she inspires. To be clear: My point isn\u2019t that Palin isn\u2019t a significant political figure, or that she doesn\u2019t inspire ardent devotion from many conservative Americans, or that she doesn\u2019t deserve a significant level of press attention: She is, and does, and does. But the most egregious, obsessive and pointless Palin coverage (of the sort we saw in the wake of the Tucson shootings) has less to do with responding to the scope of her appeal, and more to do with pandering to the millions of Americans for whom she\u2019s become a hate figure, and who are always eager to be confirmed in that hatred.",

She returns briefly to Alaska, but then finds the job of running a state that lives off federal dollars and oil revenue too taxing and not nearly lucrative enough. She quits, writes a smash best seller, charges who knows what for public appearances, and keeps her celebrity going by pretending for a while to be thinking about running for president. I was highly critical of John McCain\u2019s choice of Ms. Palin in 2008, and found her \u201cI\u2019m an American, you\u2019re not\u201d tone grating and insulting. She represented an inchoate anger among voters that has been fostered by the Republican Party for decades as an electoral ploy\u2014as well as a willful ignorance about the world that is not my favorite American trait.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve got to say this about Sarah Palin: she hangs in there when it comes to being a celebrity. On Monday, she gave an interview to a reliable and unabashed admirer, Eric Bolling of Fox News, who said that everyone he knows wants her to run. He pointed out that it\u2019s \u201cnot too late.\u201d Ms. Palin did not exactly wave her hand and say, well, gee, if everyone insists on me running for the White House, I might just have to. But she did say, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not too late for folks to jump in.\u201d And then she came out with the perfect anti-Shermanesque statement:\u00a0\u201c And I don\u2019t know, you know, it\u2014who knows what will happen in the future?\u201d Ms. Palin had a lot of other things to say\u2014about people who don\u2019t believe in Jesus and how they\u2019re trying to ruin Christmas, about how incompetent she thinks President Obama is and, of course, since all Republican conservatives are required to say this, how great Ronald Reagan was. She was, as always, full of folksy aphorisms \u2013 \u201cgrace runs downhill to the humble;\u201d the need to make sure \u201cwe\u2019re sweeping our own porch.\u201d She also had this to say: \u201chere, in North Korea, babies are reliant on China.\u201d The interview left me curious as to what Ms. Palin means by \u201chere,\u201d and it made me realize I that miss her. She\u2019s far more entertaining than the current crop of Republicans, especially now that Herman Cain\u2019s out. I hope she jumps right into the race and runs downhill with a broom to clean up the awful mess those North Korean babies left on our porch.",
