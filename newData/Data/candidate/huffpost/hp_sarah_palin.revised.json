      "content": " The mantra of the mainstream media is \u201cSure Hillary and Obama ran nasty campaigns against each other but at the end of the day, they banded together to defeat McCain and Palin and the same result will happen this year.\u201d No it won\u2019t. In 2008 social media was just another outlet for news and opinions. People still turned to the networks, CNN, MSNBC and FOX as their primary source to form their views on the candidates. The news organizations did their best to be fair to both candidates. That civil atmosphere no longer exits and we have Citizen\u2019s United to thank for our current discourse and candidates. This year\u2019s campaign is being run on Facebook and other online outlets, which give a voice to the supporters and detractors of each candidate. The posts have become very personal which is just hardening the positions of each side. It\u2019s now it will be much harder for the eventual Democratic candidate to convince the other side for their votes. There is no way the Democratic Party is going to give Bernie Sanders the nomination, even if he wins the rest of the primaries and goes over the magic delegate number. The Democrats are just not a Progressive or left leaning party anymore. Take Al Franken for example. I like Franken. He speaks for me. However, a few days after Bernie won the Minnesota primary in a landslide, Senator Franken was interviewed on one of the cable networks. As a superdelegate he was asked whom he was going to support. He said Hillary. When asked why he wouldn\u2019t support Bernie, especially since his own state had just voted loud and clear they wanted Sanders, Franken froze. He smiled weakly, hemmed and hawed and didn\u2019t answer the question. He looked extremely uncomfortable and rightly so. In this era where every syllable a candidate utters is videoed and archived, that answer and his vote against his constituents\u2019 preferences will come back to haunt him in his next election, as it will for every superdelegate who votes against the wishes of their state\u2019s voters, thus making most of the Democrats vulnerable. They would rather lose with Hillary than win with Bernie. Hillary will not win. She basically has no positions except what the zeitgeist is trending for that day. Hillary supporters have no argument to support her based on issues and track record. The only real argument they have is the Supreme Court. So the DNC says that if you want a non-conservative court, you must vote for Hillary. That argument doesn\u2019t cut it. She is running as a Republican, values Jeb Bush\u2019s supporters and obviously believes that moderate Republicans will flock to her. Won\u2019t happen. Her only chance is the Bernie supporters that she and the democrats loathe. Her word that she will be \u2018progressive\u201d means nothing. However I was going to vote for her to stop Trump. That was before the Nevada caucus. It is now becoming clear that there was no violence, no chair throwing or any such behavior. Where are the video or cell phone pictures? Where are the eyewitnesses who can prove it happened? There are none. However mainstream media to this day is continuing to smear Sanders and all of his supporters with lies furthering the Clinton and Wasserman-Schultz narrative.  Why? Did it have to do with the fact that the Kentucky primary was days away and manufactured bad publicity would sway some voters into Hillary\u2019s camp? Unfortunately, I can\u2019t rule that out based on previous dirty tricks like paying trolls to fight Sanders supporters online.  I just don\u2019t believe anything she says and all republicans, almost all Sanders supporters and a lot of independent voters feel the same. Remember what Les Moonves, President of CBS told his shareholders. \u201cIt (Trump) may not be good for America but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d I\u2019m sure if we got CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker and MSNBC\u2019s Andrew Lack to be honest, they\u2019d echo the same sentiment. (That pesky Citizen United strikes again.) The media loves Trump and Hillary because they have deep pockets to give to the news outlets via commercials. A Trump-Hillary campaign will be a horrible, bloody dogfight, boosting the ratings for all the broadcasters who can charge a fortune for commercials. Think of Trump-Hillary as a six month long episode of \u201cSurvivor\u201c without the civility. There\u2019s only one problem with the media\u2019s narrative. Everyone is sick and tired of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Nobody except diehard supporters will be engaged in this campaign. And no candidate I can think of has ever won an election by urging voters to vote defensively against their opponent. That won\u2019t stop the mainstream media from going non-stop in their coverage of this calamity because there is too much money at stake for them. There is no way that Hillary is going to embrace the Bernie supporters, alienating the very people she desperately needs to win. So what to do? Compromise on both sides.  No more Hillary and no more Bernie. For the good of the country, the Democrats must nominate Joe Biden for President. He is the only person that can unite the Democrats, Independents, disgruntled Republicans and defeat Trump. Everybody likes Biden and nobody can argue with his qualifications. (Yes Biden also voted to go to war in Iraq but unlike Hillary he apologized for his vote early on in 2005.  Hillary waited until 2014 when she kicked off her current campaign.) With Joe Biden will get the Supreme Court back. Sure a few of the diehard Hillary and Bernie supporters will be angry and not vote, but their numbers will be miniscule compared to the Independents and Progressives that Biden will bring to the party the Democrats so desperately need for victory. The Republicans are starting to unite behind Trump. The same will not happen on the Democratic side no matter if the nominee is Hillary or Bernie.  It\u2019s become way too personal. If the Democrats decide to run Joe Biden, it will be like a breath of fresh air in a very toxic campaign. They\u2019ll have a united party, Trump will be defeated and the world and we will be a much better place. I\u2019m in with Biden.",

      "content": " We live in an age of denial perpetuated by a political culture of ignorance that willfully embraces anti-intellectualism.   There are consequences to this, including real and present threats to our national security. Happy \u201c400 Day\u201d The earth, and its human occupants, reached an important milestone last week.  Carbon dioxide levels for the first time in hominid history surpassed 400 parts per million (ppm) as measured at Cape Grim in Tasmania.  This southern hemisphere measurement is particularly interesting because unlike those made in the north, observations are not subject to large seasonal cycles, meaning we have reached this threshold everywhere in all seasons.  Yet this story has barely been mentioned, if at all, in the media.  That is like the captain of the Titanic neglecting to inform passengers that a large hole had developed in the ship\u2019s hull.  This is not a minor oversight. A Warmer World In 1800 prior to the industrial revolution carbon dioxide levels hovered around 280 ppm.  Since 1850 rising carbon emissions have pushed global temperatures higher by about 1.5 degrees Celsius.   Almost all models predict that the global climate will warm by at least 2 degrees once carbon dioxide levels reach 450 ppm.   A global scientific consensus among more than 2,000 of the world\u2019s preeminent climatologists from 154 countries brought together by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has this 2 degree rise as a critical threshold.  At this point we anticipate melting ice sheets, sea level rise, coastal erosion, shifts in food production and water availability, increase in the number and intensity of storms, more frequent and intense droughts and heat waves, more and more intense wildfires, expansion of tropical diseases into the north, and mass migrations unprecedented in human history. The Hypocrisy of Denial Donald Trump claims he \u201cis not a big believer in global warming\u201c because the warnings are \u201ca total hoax\u201d and \u201cbullshit\u201d based on \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d   Thus dismissing the knowledge, experience and data of those 2,000 scientists from 154 countries.  Yet this prominent denier has cited global warming and its impacts as the rationale for building a wall at his golf course in County Claire, Ireland.  His permit application notes that erosion due to rising seas and extreme weather are a consequence of climate change - the reality of which he refutes.   He cites as justification the very thing he dismisses as a hoax. Trump is not alone in denying reality or in the hypocrisy involved in that denial.  Every prominent leader of the GOP denies that climate change is real.  Hypocritically these pols say they cannot accept that climate change is real with the phrase \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist\u201c but claim they know enough science to reject the scientific consensus.  Oddly none say he is \u201cnot a doctor\u201d when it comes to the abortion debate.  The GOP remains the only major western political party in the world to deny the reality of climate change. Every winter some silly wag or political hack laughs off global warming because it snows, thereby conflating climate and weather.  With every snow storm newspaper editors across the country trot out the old and tired cartoon of the global warming group meeting canceled due to snow and ice.  This confusion between local and global events is a consequence of ignorance.  Arctic air will always be brutally cold even in the most extreme cases of global warming. Snow and ice will always be a winter reality. So stop already with the embarrassing nonsense that climate change can\u2019t be real because it is cold outside. Nobody ever said climate change meant the end of winter.  In fact most models predict some areas will experience an increase in intense snowfall during winter months followed by hotter and drier months in later seasons as the average global temperature rises. Who Do You Trust \u2014 the DOD or Donald Trump? The U.S. military is not waiting around for the deniers to get onboard.  The GOP ostensibly supports a strong military focused on protecting our national security; yet denies one of the biggest threats to that security as identified by the very armed forces the GOP claims to support.  The Military Advisory Board, not a hotbed of radical liberalism, enumerates the very real threats from global warming in their report, \u201cNational Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change.\u201d  Perhaps rather than listen to Sarah Palin, who calls climate change \u201cjunk science\u201c and the \u201cgreatest scam in history\u201d Trump and his fellow conservatives should read what the U.S. military has concluded: Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water.  These impacts are already occurring, and the scope, scale, and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase over time. But Donald Trump dismissed climate change as \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d The Department of Defense concludes that, Coordinated and well-executed actions to limit heat-trapping gases and increase resilience to help prevent and protect against the worst projected climate change impacts are required \u2014 now. But Donald Trump is not a \u201cbig believer\u201d in climate change. The military\u2019s National Security Strategy, made public in February 2015, states that: The U.S. Navy is particularly concerned about the national security threats of an ice-free Arctic, which is soon upon us.  The Department of Defense report to Congress on \u201cArctic Operations and the Northwest Passage\u201c concludes that the \u201cArctic is warming on average twice as fast as the rest of the planet\u201c and that increased human activity in the region could lead to \u201ccompetition for resources and boundary disputes that may result in conflict...\u201c  With rising temperatures, the Navy now says that the Arctic will \u201cgive the U.S. its first new ocean to police since the annexation of the Pacific Northwest in 1846.\u201d But Donald Trump claims global warming is \u201cbullshit.\u201d Who do you believe has a more accurate handle on reality, Donald Trump or the Department of Defense?  These reports and conclusions are not the rantings of left wing extremists but from the very people and institutions in which Republicans put so much faith.  If the GOP wishes to deny climate change they must deny any DOD funding requests for any effort to combat its consequences.   If not they are nothing but Trump asking for permission to build a wall against a threat he denies exists.  You cannot have it both ways even in this age of hyper-hypocrisy.  You can accept the conclusions of the world\u2019s climatologists and geologists and U.S. military, or you can choose to have Sarah Palin as your science guide, but you cannot do both. The Consequences of Ignorance Irrationality, scorn for the truth, contempt for science and the warm embrace of willful ignorance are all direct and disturbing contributors to climate change denial, the anti-evolution movement \u2014 and Donald Trump.  The rise of Donald Trump as a national candidate and the denial of global warming are inevitable consequences of a political culture that embraces anti-intellectualism as a virtue.  The Donald as a candidate could not exist without the suspension of reason.  Trump and a political culture hostile to science are symptoms of the same malady, a society sick with extremism borne from faith-based reasoning in a population incapable of making rational choices.  Faith in the absence of evidence, or continued faith when presented with conclusive contrary proof an idea has failed, is no basis for reasonable dialogue.   When beliefs are divorced from reality and objective truth anything goes; we lose the ability to have any meaningful discourse to solve our very real problems.  We get Donald Trump instead.  If we do not share a common version of reality we have no basis for any dialogue at all.  We see this inability to address issues rationally in the debate about sane gun control, LGBT rights, abortion, vaccinations, GMOs, environmental protection, education, energy policy and national security.  We see it in our struggle to promote public health because of partisan extremism and irrational opposition to Obamacare.  We see this right at home in our widening butts and waistlines because we believe utter nonsense about diet and nutrition.  We saw it when Sarah Palin erupted on the national scene as the nation\u2019s first candidate obviously and clearly unqualified for office and we see it in the candidacy of Trump today. Trump\u2019s campaign highlights like few others could that we are in a race for the bottom, in which the candidate who best embraces ignorance and hate wins. When beliefs are divorced from reality, a hallmark of the Trump\u2019s outrageous claims, nothing is off limits.  With no common understanding of even baseline truths, we get proposals of pure fantasy to build border walls, deport 11 million people, kill the families of terrorists, identify Muslims and track their movements, and exclude them from our lands.  We can close mosques.  All without consequence.  Reality and objective truths are no constraint. We have never before witnessed so clearly the clash of reason and faith, science and religion, truth and the big lie, demagoguery and sane debate.  Disdain for the scientific method is front and center in Republican philosophy.  With faith-based reasoning politicians are not constrained by the annoying shackles of reality like the IPCC consensus on climate change.   False statements about Planned Parenthood are taken at face value by party sympathizers even when easily shown to be false.  Irrational fears are stoked about transgender bathrooms.  With no grip on reality people believe that their guns are going to be taken away; that evolution is just a theory and therefore has no greater validity than creationism.  Fighting evolution has become an integral part of the GOP fabric, a modern day version of the Church\u2019s attacks on Galileo.  Never mind that we can demonstrate evolution in a Petri dish; it has been proven across multiple fields of science including genetics, biogeography and paleontology.  Even the Pope in 1996 grudgingly admitted that evolution is \u201cmore than just a theory.\u201d   But the GOP hangs tightly to the fifteenth century on the precarious tendrils of faith immune to reason and fact.  With no filter of rationality, Fox News becomes legitimate; and a clownish buffoon who denies global warming in the face of dire national security warnings from our own military can become a candidate for the presidency. Unlike the pabulum of most campaign slogans, our future truly is at stake here as we cross the threshold of 400 ppm.  That is real. For those Bernie Sanders supports who contemplate not voting for Hillary Clinton, hear this:  you will \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d - every day as the earths gets hotter and hotter.  And to everybody else with the insane thought of voting for Trump:  happy 400 day.",

So all and all, it\u2019s just a typical week for this controversial candidate.  However, Mr. Tramp has been getting some interesting support. After this week\u2019s incident at DePaul University where Black Lives Matter protesters crashed an event, Milo Yiannopoulos said Mr. Tramp\u2019s message is only getting stronger. Those who liked Tramp cheered loudly at the event, and those who hated him jeered. While the opinions are strong about the man, one thing is for certain, there is never a dull moment when covering his campaign.  This last rally was no different. As usual, Mr. Tramp went head to head with some Black Lives Matter protesters As one would predict, it was a showdown of epic proportion. So I took a minute to chat with him about this as well as some of the other, interesting endorsements he was receiving from the Republican party.

      "content": " The idea of a Donald Trump victory in November is almost too scary to contemplate. And the prospect of a Hillary Clinton Presidency is not exactly filling the populace with ecstasy either. How can we cope with this confrontation between two of the most unpopular candidates in history? The best antidote may be humor, preferably satire with enough bite to outDonald the Donald. And that\u2019s what we have in the new ebook novella by Richard Hine: Kim Kardashian Saves the World after President Trump Nearly Ends It (TLD Media, LLC). This could be the fastest, funniest 56 pages you\u2019ll ever zip through. Let me keep the plot summarizing to a minimum, since I don\u2019t want to spoil anyone\u2019s fun. Suffice it to say that as early as Chapter Two, Russia has accidentally hit Canada with a nuclear missile. How will President Donald Trump respond, surrounded by a brain trust consisting of Secretary of State Sarah Palin, Secretary of Defense Jesse Ventura and National Security Adviser Sean Hannity? Fortunately, in Hine\u2019s fertile brain, these forces of darkness are counterbalanced by the top-secret CELIA, which stands for the Celebrity Intelligence Agency. Headed by Jodie Foster, CELIA dispatches Kim Kardashian, with her sidekick Maria Sharapova, to Moscow, in hopes of brokering a peace deal too artful for either Trump or Vladimir Putin to refuse. Ridiculous? Maybe, but not so long ago the idea of Trump\u2019s getting the Republican nomination was off-the-charts ridiculous. Hine is just putting the most hopeful spin on this situation that he can imagine. And if you can stop laughing long enough, you\u2019ll find that Hine actually has something serious to say about the potential global peacemaking power of social media. https://www.amazon.com/Kardashian-Saves-World-President-Nearly-ebook/dp/B01GAHHPOK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1464825751&sr=1-1&keywords=Richard+Hine",

Clinton was declared by the Democratic party to become the first woman major party presidential nominee.

Geraldine Ferraro, in 1984, and Sarah Palin, in 2008, blazed the trail to the top of the ticket, as Veep nominees for the Democrats and Republicans, respectively.

      "content": " Former Republican vice presidential hopeful and reality TV show star Sarah Palin\u00a0often takes to her Facebook page to rant about President Barack Obama. On Friday, Palin posted her latest diatribe, asking a series of questions about what she calls Obama\u2019s \u201ctwisted anti-Second Amendment mission.\u201d Palin asked Obama to explain himself, while simultaneously noting it\u2019s \u201ca special kind of stupid to demand\u201d gun owners explain themselves. Luckily for Palin, Obama has addressed most of these questions, answering some in a recent town hall hosted by PBS\u2019 \u201cNewsHour,\u201d and others earlier this week after the mass shooting\u00a0at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 dead and 53 wounded. Below, questions Palin raised in her June 17 Facebook post followed by Obama\u2019s stance. Palin:\u00a0\u201cToday you\u2019re demanding an \u2018explanation\u2019 from law abiding gun owners, but not demanding the same from followers of Islam, the religion behind this terror?\u201d Obama never demanded\u00a0\u201can \u2018explanation\u2019 from law abiding gun owners\u201d for the Orlando shooting. After meeting with families of victims of the Orlando massacre, he said \u201cthose who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why that makes sense.\u201d Obama said the United States would \u201ccontinue to be relentless against terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda.\u201d He has refused to use the phrase \u201cradical Islam,\u201d\u00a0recently saying the GOP\u2019s fixation on the term is a \u201cpolitical distraction\u201d from their own inaction. As the New York Times points out, Islam \u201cis a 1,500-year-old religion whose 1.6 billion followers worldwide observe a spectrum of customs and traditions.\u201d It\u2019s an unjust generalization to say those 1.6 billion people were \u201cbehind this terror.\u201d Palin:\u00a0\u201cIf the demented Orlando terrorist doesn\u2019t represent all Islamic followers, then why do you insinuate he represents all gun owners?\u201d \u201cThere is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself, but the only way we\u2019re going to do that is if we don\u2019t have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the Second Amendment,\u201d\u00a0Obama emphasized at the \u201cNewsHour\u201d town hall. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how the issue too often gets framed.\u201d\n\nPalin: \u201cAnd why, after any shooting, do you always want to take away firearms from the innocent people who didn\u2019t do it?\u201d \u201cFirst of all, the notion that I or [presumptive Democratic presidential nominee] Hillary [Clinton] or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks\u2019 guns is just not true,\u201d Obama said at the \u201cNewsHour\u201d town hall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care how many times the NRA says it. I\u2019m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it\u2019s just not true.\u201d",

      "content": " Either Elizabeth Warren just made Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential choice a lot harder or a lot easier, depending on how you see her strategic decision-making process and how much chance you think a Clinton/Warren ticket has of becoming reality.  Warren appeared onstage with Clinton today and the Massachusetts senator wowed the Ohio crowd, proving without a shadow of a doubt she is unquestionably the best \u201cattack dog\u201d the Democrats have against Donald Trump.  But is this enough for Clinton to select Warren as running mate?  Or, perhaps is it too much?  In other words, is there a danger that Warren could actually upstage the presidential candidate?  And even if Hillary knows Warren is the best anti-Trump weapon around, will Clinton\u2019s choice ultimately hinge on this criterion or not? Vice-presidential picks are made for any number of reasons.  The selection can be made for geographical reasons (to help the candidate carry a battleground state, for instance), or even to balance one region of the country with another.  The choice can be made for demographic balance, such as the selection of Dan Quayle or Sarah Palin (Quayle was young, offsetting George H.W. Bush\u2019s age; Palin was female).  These are usually framed in terms of balancing the ticket \u2014 shoring up a candidate\u2019s weakness by offering a stabilizing factor as a running mate.  But sometimes these calculations are ignored and a more personal choice is made.  Bill Clinton picked Al Gore in 1992, which surprised many because it was a ticket of two Southerners.  Sometimes the decision just boils down to the personal preference of the candidate, no matter what the wonky vote-predictors tell them they should do. Elizabeth Warren would unbalance the ticket in two major ways, but she\u2019d provide an overwhelming amount of balance on a third, which might make up for it.  The selection of Warren would mean the first all-female ticket in American history from a major party.  This already worries many Democrats (even staunch Hillary supporters) who are skeptical that the electorate is ready to vote for two women to lead the country.  Warren doesn\u2019t add anything in the realm of geography, either, as both candidates would hail from the Northeast.  In fact, this is actually an argument against choosing Warren, because Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would get to select Warren\u2019s temporary replacement (before a special election was held).  If this tilts the balance of power in the Senate, even for the first few months of a Clinton presidency, it could hobble her ability to press her agenda at the very start of her term. But the upside would be an ideological one.  No other veep choice would enthuse supporters of Bernie Sanders more than Elizabeth Warren (other than Hillary picking Bernie himself, which is not very likely to happen).  Warren would be seen as a big check on Clinton\u2019s tendency towards going easy on Wall Street by millions of Bernie voters.  Even before Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy, if you\u2019ll remember, there was a massive \u201cdraft Warren\u201d effort to convince her to launch her own presidential bid.  These Warren supporters eventually drifted over into Bernie\u2019s camp (after the thousandth time Warren unequivocally said \u201cI\u2019m not running\u201d), so for many of them Warren was actually their first choice.  Seeing her on Clinton\u2019s ticket would be a big reason for excitement for many, to put it mildly. The big question that ran through my mind watching today\u2019s video footage, however, was whether this might be too much of a good thing for Hillary Clinton to accept.  Wildly cheering crowds for the vice-presidential candidate \u2014 which are nowhere near as enthusiastic for the top of the ticket \u2014 can be awkward.  John McCain learned this, after seeing Sarah Palin\u2019s adoring crowds.  If Hillary Clinton did choose Elizabeth Warren with the hope that Warren would provide some enthusiasm, then she\u2019d have to be prepared to assume the role of \u201cbeing presidential\u201d and by doing so let Warren be the main foil to Donald Trump (with as many crowd-pleasing attack lines as possible).  As long as Clinton accepts this from the start, it could work out fine.  But if there\u2019s any tinge of \u201cWarren\u2019s crowds are bigger than Clinton\u2019s\u201d (either from disgruntled campaign staff or from the candidate herself), this could lead to some resentment. The biggest question is whether Hillary Clinton trusts Elizabeth Warren and has the confidence that she could step into the presidency at any time.  That\u2019s always what the personal part of the selection process boils down to.  There have been whispers that Warren and Clinton don\u2019t exactly like each other all that much, but now there are counter-rumors that they have personally bonded over being grandmothers together (which sounds suspiciously like a focus-group-tested line, if I ever heard one).  Both Clintons have always valued loyalty very highly, and Warren famously was the last female senator to endorse Clinton (at the very end of the primaries, when it essentially made no difference). The Clinton camp has indicated it is heavily vetting only three candidates at this point (although they leaven this with caveats about looking at a \u201cmuch longer list\u201d).  Warren is one, and the other two are Tim Kaine and Juli\u00e1n Castro.  All agree that Castro, currently in President Obama\u2019s cabinet, is destined for political stardom in the Democratic Party sooner or later.  He would bring two demographic strengths to the ticket: he\u2019s young, and he\u2019s Latino.  He hails from Texas, which is probably not possible for Democrats to pick up (even this year), but he would definitely provide a healthy dose of balance to the ticket.  The first woman in the White House might have the first Latino vice president at her side \u2014 that\u2019d be doubling down on the historic nature of this campaign for Democrats. Then there\u2019s Tim Kaine, currently in the Senate but previously Virginia\u2019s governor and head of the Democratic National Committee.  He is (by his own admission this weekend) \u201cboring.\u201d  To say he\u2019d be the safe choice is an understatement.  He\u2019s white, male, a Southerner, and he could virtually guarantee that Virginia\u2019s 13 Electoral College votes wind up in the Democratic column.  The current governor of Virginia is not only a Democrat, but also a Clinton acolyte, so Kaine\u2019s Senate seat replacement wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  If Clinton chooses Kaine, it will be to \u201ctriangulate\u201d the general electorate, in the same way her husband used to so effectively do.  Kaine would be seen by moderates, independents, and even Republicans disgusted with Trump as a fairly soothing choice and definitely not some sort of radical candidate.  Clinton would be gambling that the Democratic base (including all the Bernie supporters and lots of Latinos) are already sufficiently behind her and need no further enticement to vote for her.  Kaine, it almost goes without saying, would never be in danger of upstaging Clinton in front of a crowd. These are the three choices the Clinton camp has said they\u2019re now intensely vetting.  One is a populist firebrand who already has millions of nationwide supporters who love her dearly (and fervently) \u2014 and who is already proving she\u2019s the best weapon the Democrats have against the Republican nominee.  One is a handsome young Latino who is quite likely to run for president himself at some point in the future, and who is also capable of inspiring crowds with his oratory.  Either of these choices would be historic in their own way.  Then there\u2019s a white male from the South who could carry his home state.  Kaine is the safest of safe choices, but when he introduces himself to a national politics-watching audience with the admission that he\u2019s \u201cboring,\u201d he\u2019s likely not going to be an inspiring choice or (for that matter) an effective attack dog against a loose-cannon candidate like Donald Trump. Of course, at this point, none of us knows who Clinton will pick (perhaps this is all a feint, and she\u2019ll select a dark horse that nobody\u2019s currently paying any attention to?), and nobody knows exactly what she\u2019ll be thinking when she does decide.  But the pros and cons of the selection calculus of the current shortlist are pretty easy for all to see.  Warren\u2019s audition today showed she is the most capable person to take the fight to Donald Trump.  Nobody else really even comes close.  If that\u2019s what Hillary is looking for, she really needs to look no further.  But Hillary Clinton may have different criteria when making her choice, and other factors may weigh more heavily when she does decide.

      "content": " It was not so much that he made America great again, but when Donald Trump was elected president on November 8, 2016 he transformed the United States in ways that few, including he, could have imagined.\n\n\tRight from the start establishment politicians and pundits just never understand Trump.  He was consistently derided as having no chance.  First it was that his repeated insults against John McCain, Megyn Kelly and women, immigrants, or Muslims that would doom him. But with each insult his fame only grew.  Then it was the claim that he could not win in Iowa but he did.  Or that his loss in Wisconsin would doom him.  Or that his tirades against the media, his name calling of Hillary Clinton, or even selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate would surely kill his campaign.  Back in June of 2016  as stories mounted about how little money he had raised, or that Clinton had double digit leads in some polls, he was still dismissed.  Nat Silver, the whiz kids of political money ball, said that Trump had barely a 20% chance of winning and who could doubt the person who had so brilliantly declared that Clinton was a cinch to win the Michigan primary .\n\n\tEven as late as the July Republican convention, despite the riots and arrests outside and one final push by party elites to use the rules to oust him, some thought that Trump would not get the nomination.  But he did.\n\n\tTrump\u2019s success was in exploiting fear, prejudice, and ignorance.  These are the core elements of what most advertising does-appeal out our vanity insecurities,  and fears.  Trump as the consummate  salesman understood that.  But he also exploited the failures of the Republican and Democratic parties which for the last generation or more has sold the public on free trade, globalization, and open borders, saying that it would benefit us all.  Somewhere along the way these promises did not add up and mainstream national journalists, living in New York City, socializing on the upper east side, and vacationing in the Hamptons, for some reason just did not realize that average people were not reaping the benefits of NAFTA and free trade.  Perhaps they were too busy attending or covering the six figure speeches Hillary Clinton was giving to Wall Street to notice that most people were making less money now while working harder than they did twenty years ago.  Yes as F Scott Fitzgerald once said, the rich are different-they do have more money-but with money comes attitude and Trump played on resentment toward them and the elitism that they, the media, and the Washington establishment all represented.\n\n\tTrump also understood they way that politics and entertainment had converged.  Politicians  no longer campaigned and the media no longer covered politics-both were marketed.  Trump understood the for-profit spectacle that politics had become and which the news industry wished to deny but depended on. He knew that CNN, MSNBC, and the rest could not resist a good headline and that if he dropped a comment-no matter how outrageous-the media would pick it up and it would fill the news cycle for an entire day.  Trump thus understood how getting headlines for him also meant the media  would get ratings.  They were trapped, and forced to market the presidential elections on Trump\u2019s terms.\n\n\tBut Trump also benefitted from running against for many a hugely unpopular and uninspiring candidate who was the face of the establishment and status quo in a year where   neither was a plus.  Clinton struggled to win the Democratic nomination against an aging self-described socialist who  never considered himself a Democrat until he decided to run for president.  Clinton should have easily defeated him, but her difficulties revealed how poor of a candidate she was.  She started a race with 70% approvals and a 50%+ lead over Sanders only to see it disappear.  Some of it yes was sexism.  No doubt there is about 30% of Americans who will never vote for a woman and thus Clinton faced problems from the start.  But she also had many other problems they were not the result of sexism but self-inflicted.\n\n\tAt the end of the day Clinton had no narrative for her campaign.  It was all about breaking the glass ceiling and being the first female president.  That did not cut it with young people, including women, who preferred someone who shared their politics and not simply their gender.  Additionally, whatever narrative Clinton had was one that was either too conservative for an emerging Millennial generation of voters, or one that harkened back to her husband.  In so many ways she was still running, as she did in 2008, for Bill\u2019s third term.  Yet times had changed and what was once thought of as good public policy in the 90s was no long seen the same in 2016.\n\n\tHillary-a once youthful Republican turned New Democrat turned sort of progressive during the 2016 primaries and then back to a centrist Democrat who tried to appeal to Republican voters-was perplexed why no one trusted her.  This perplexity was also shared by her core supporters-women over 40-who saw in every criticism of her sexism.  Yet what was also perplexing  in the campaign was why Democrats supported her, let alone women or even people of color.  Clinton  who supported the death penalty, fracking, TPP and globalization , and a militaristic foreign policy, (at least until the primaries), and in the past who supported welfare reform, her husband\u2019s crime bill, and oppose marriage equality until recently, hardly seemed like someone who Democrat or women should support.  Given her positions, it is wonder why she was a Democrat and why so many women who considered themselves progressives supported her beyond the fact that she was a woman. Clinton had a narrative problem along with an identity problem-voters did not trust her and did not like her for sexist and legitimate policy reasons.\n\n\tYet Clinton was supposed to win according to pundits and politicians.  But she did not.  She selected Tim Kaine from Virginia and played conventional politics in a year when the normal rules of politics changed.  Similar to Frank Skeffington in the Last Hurrah who never understood how the  New Deal had changed politics and therefore was clueless to how the old rules of campaigning had changed.  Clinton campaigned like it was 1992 again, just like she did in 2008.\n\n\tThe election came down to a core of swing states again, with Ohio and Florida again decisive.  The media and Clinton were distracted by Trump\u2019s huge negatives and by how well she was doing in the popular vote and fund raising comparatively.  She went toe-to-toe negative campaigning but in the end Trump was able to dig deeper, go nastier, and insult better than her. He knew fear, prejudice, and ignorance would make the difference.  Benghazi, her e-mails, and all the other rumors around her stuck along with the image of Crooked Hillary.    In the end, Clinton, like Gore in 2000, won the popular vote by racking up huge majorities in Democrat states, but she lost among swing voters in swing states, handing the Trump-Palin ticket  an Electoral College victory.\n\n\tTrump\u2019s January 20, inauguration and swearing in were a made for TV event.  The inauguration ball and swearing in was held at the Trump International Hotel at 1100 Pennsylvania Ave in Washington, newly remodeled and just down the street from the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania  Ave. The cost of doing both was billed to the taxpayers and Trump of course profited from it, serving also Trump champagne and steaks. At his swearing in he also announced that Air Force 1 would be sold to save tax payer money, replaced with a Trump charter jet that would be rented by the government from him.\n\n\tTrump\u2019s inaugural speech-or rant-was exactly what was expected from him.  He said that his first order of business would be to expel all Muslims from the US, along with deporting all immigrants from Mexico. He also renounced NAFTA and all the free trade agreements with China and issued a 40% tariff on their goods.    He issued orders suspending enforcement of Obamacare and declared all EPA orders null and void. Palin was put in charge of a special task force on energy and the environment, and he declared all federal lands open to mining and drilling for oil. Drill Baby  Drill was now the official policy of America.\n\n\tTrump thought he could simply push through want he wanted but with a Republican House and Senate that flipped to the Democrats, he found that they were less they willing to do his bidding.  He insulted in bipartisan fashion but it did little good.  As the economy began to tank Trump saw his approval rating slip more.  Legal challenges to his orders and actions mounted, coming from both Congress and citizens.  The cases began to choke the federal courts, necessitating Supreme Court review.  But since the death of Scalia the Court was operating one justice shy and it did not look as if Trump was going to be able to get through his judicial appointments.\n\n\tBut whatever one can say about Trump he finally achieved the impossible-he got the Democrats and Republicans to agree on one thing-his impeachment.  Fed up quickly with his presidency there was bipartisan agreement to impeach him.  By the time Trump was to be impeached Palin had already resigned.  Trump was without a vice-president and his impeachment was for self-dealing and disregarding the Constitution and the Supreme Court which had declared many of his act illegal.  This left Paul Ryan as the successor.  Except Trump refused to leave office, defying both the Congress and the Courts.\n\n\tBut Trump\u2019s troubles did not stop there.  Following up on comments he made during the campaign, he ordered th US out of NATO. He ordered troops out of Japan and South Korea, and he torn up the nuclear agreement with Iran.  Early on  much of the career diplomatic staff at the State Department had resigned, leaving the US with few trained officials.  Trump named almost all of his friends as ambassadors, but they shared a common Trump trait-no diplomatic tact.  Soon the US was rhetorically fighting with everyone-even Great Britain who elected their own Trump like figure after Brexit, and President Le Pen in France. Tensions escalated in the Middle East as reaction to the Muslim US ban kicked in and domestic and international terrorist attacks against the US mounted.  Tensions with Iran, China, and North Korea reached a fever pitch, and finally Trump began talking  about nuclear weapons to be used to resolve all these disputes.\n\n\tFinally the day came.   Trump ordered the military to act or face removal. With the Joint Chiefs of Staff worried about what Trump would do next, and seeing that Congress and the Courts were unable to restrain him, they did they only thing they thought patriotic to save the United States.",

      "content": "  Politicon took place June 25 and 26 at the Pasadena (Calif.) Convention Center. What is Politicon, you ask? Vanity Fair described it best as \u201ca Comic-Con style event for political aficionados,\u201d while the Huffington Post called it \u201cthe Coachella of politics.\u201d Like Comic-Con, the event had panels, vendors, artwork, cosplay, and plenty of passionate attendees. The panels covered a smorgasbord of topics, the crowd was lively, and the experience was ridiculously fun. A Politicon highlight was an exchange between Sarah Palin, James Carville, and a 10-year-old boy, which you can read about here. Beyond this, I offer eight reflections from the event: 1. Is Donald Trump a psychopath? Probably not, but he displays many narcissistic personality disorder traits according to a panel featuring speakers such as clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis and The Daily Show cocreator Lizz Winstead. Michaelis also explained the concept of authoritarianism as it applies to Trump supporters, stating that when a voting block feels threatened, voters look to a strong individual to lead them. Michaelis said Trump supporters generally have an authoritarian personality type, and it is the single biggest predictor of those who back Trump. The psychologist also discussed how those on the left politically tend to value traits such as empathy and equality, while those on the right value purity, loyalty and respect. 2. Comparing Trump to Jack Kerouac. In a panel titled \u201cArt of Campaign Strategy,\u201d Los Angeles Times correspondent Ron Brownstein humorously compared Barack Obama\u2019s deliberate, strategic communication style with Trump\u2019s wild, loose cannon Twitter posts, drawing references to Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Former Obama speechwriter Jon E. Favreau noted Hillary Clinton\u2019s organization success during this election cycle, a far cry from the problems she experienced in 2008. However, it is hard for her to have her vision covered with Trump dominating the news. \u201cWhen Donald Trump comes on the ratings spike,\u201d Fox News national security analyst K.T. McFarland added, before proceeding to make the analogy that Trump is connecting personally with citizens through Twitter the same way Franklin Delano Roosevelt did so successfully through radio and Ronald Reagan through television.  3. \u201cNo one disagrees; we\u2019re going to Mars.\u201d That is what former NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver said during a panel titled \u201cHow We\u2019ll Get to Mars.\u201d Bill Adkins, a space policy and politics consultant, discussed funding as a primary driver for Mars travel and Congress\u2019 crucial role. The one and only Bill Nye the Science Guy highlighted how the concept of space travel is bringing people together. For example, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Culberson (R-Tex.) disagree on virtually everything, yet they are allies in an effort to travel to Europa, an icy moon orbiting Jupiter thought to have a global ocean of water. Nye said that if there were evidence of life on Mars or Europa, it would change the world. He stressed that space exploration brings out the best in us because it is inherently optimistic, as humankind seeks to answer questions such as where did we come from, what is the origin of living things, and are we alone? 4. Barbara Boxer on gender equality in the Senate. Discussing her new book, The Art of Tough, outgoing U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) gave a retrospective of her long career as a public servant. Boxer said there is total equality in Senate, sharing that the seniority system has helped make it a strong workplace for women, something that is not true in many other fields. The senator also talked about rough campaigns she has battled, from her 1992 election to the Senate to Carly Fiorina\u2019s viciousness in 2010. She feels as if California\u2019s top-two primary system is ridiculous, opining that one either believes in parties or they do not.  5. Ann Coulter vs. Van Jones. This was the debate I looked forward to most and the two did not disappoint. Coulter stressed how both parties are serving the rich and ignoring the voters; how Brexit, which she believes is a response to immigration, will help Trump; and how Trump is the only candidate who will do anything about the drug war because he will build a wall. Jones referenced how 90-92% of African Americans have to vote Democratic for a Democrat to win, and a disciplined Republican candidate could take advantage of this, though Trump is not that candidate; cited Barack Obama\u2019s high deportation statistics; and shared how the Clinton Foundation has done incredible good in the world. 6. Glenn Beck believes \u201cthe sickness is not with guns; it\u2019s with our souls.\u201d The conservative pundit explained that Teddy Roosevelt wanted to build rifle ranges in schools, and the U.S. had far more guns per capita until the 1920s than it does today. He analogized that if his son had a strange fascination with fire, he would not sue the match company. Beck called NRA members some of the most responsible individuals who want the harshest sentences for gun violators. He added that every indication is that Trump is a progressive who is not married to the constitution, as his record shows the opposite of what he is saying today; and legislators should vote on Merrick Garland because he may be the best candidate the Senate has to choose from for a while. 7. The Republican Convention will highlight the party\u2019s lack of unity, while the Democratic Convention will be like a Super Bowl party. Paul Begala, James Carville, S.E. Cupp, Van Jones, Michael Murphy, and Larry Wilmore participated in a lively discussion titled \u201cDeconstructing \u201816.\u201d Cupp shared that Trump benefited from having so many competitors campaigning against him and it was foolish to have him sign the GOP loyalty pledge. Jones disagreed that the Democratic Convention would be a celebratory jamboree, as 45% of delegates support Bernie Sanders. He predicted some turmoil at the convention, but not as significant as the Republican convention. During Wilmore\u2019s \u201cKeep it 100\u201d segment, every panelist predicted a Hillary Clinton victory in November.  8. Political trading cards are cool. I have had an affinity for trading cards since I collected Upper Deck, Topps, Fleer, and Kayo cards as a kid. At the Democracy Village, the Decision 2016 Political Trading Cards were featured. An autographed Trump card recent sold for $660 on eBay and an autographed Hillary Clinton card $510. \u201cPoliticians now have passionate fans just like athletes do and with Trump in the race, politics has really become a spectator sport like never before so political trading cards seemed like a natural extension of my core business,\u201d said Brian Wallos, owner of the trading card company. \u201cPolitical junkies want quality collectibles and what\u2019s more American than politics and baseball cards? Decision 2016 Trading Cards capture the highlights, historic moments, and all the candidates and influencers in this presidential campaign. I\u2019m a political junkie myself so I\u2019ve had a blast.\u201d  The event had its gaps. Most noteworthy was its inability to capitalize on an opportunity to cover state and local politics. California has the sixth largest economy in the world, while Los Angeles County is home to the City of Bell scandal and dysfunction in the sheriff\u2019s department. Local government has the most direct impact on citizens\u2019 lives, thus organizers should have dedicated at least a small number of panels to such issues. What impressed me most about the panels I attended was the environment in which panelists could debate vigorously without the threat of being shouted over or prevented from speaking by disagreeing audience members. This is a far cry from some of the recent chaos that has ensued on U.S. college campuses. During the Coulter-Jones debate, Jones supporters outnumbered Coulter supporters significantly, yet the audience was civil, even when Coulter made her typical statements about immigrant and minority groups. Questions from audience members\u2014who represented all sides of politics\u2014during question-and-answer sessions were often thoughtful and well considered. Here is to many more years of Politicon.

      "content": " Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin once again took aim at Black Lives Matters protesters Sunday, calling them \u201cthugs\u201d and demanding the media \u201cquit claiming that these rioters are peaceful.\u201d In an interview on radio show \u201cBreitbart News Sunday,\u201d the former Alaska governor argued that the Black Lives Matter movement is in part responsible for the actions of a lone sniper\u00a0(who was not affiliated with the peaceful movement) who fatally shot\u00a0five police officers in Dallas last week. \u201cThey\u2019re not protesters,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are thugs. They\u2019re rioters. And yeah, I\u2019m calling out the media, saying quit claiming that these rioters are peaceful. They\u2019re stomping on our flag, figuratively and literally, shouting death to cops, celebrating violence.\u201d Her use of \u201cthug\u201d isn\u2019t without racial connotations. Many argue that it\u2019s merely the socially acceptable version of the N-word, and some members of the media have vowed not to use it. Palin also blamed the media for \u201cperpetuating a message that really evil people are thriving on right now as they try to intimidate and ...\u00a0warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another.\u201d The movement is \u201cthe antithesis of Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s message, it\u2019s the antithesis of our constitution, our bill of rights, our charters of liberty that say all men are created equal,\u201d she argued. Of course, she thinks it\u2019s all President Barack Obama\u2019s fault. \u201cIt is part of that fundamental transformation of America that Barack Obama had promised to do to America,\u201d she said. You can listen to the full radio interview here. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article quoted Sarah Palin as saying the media should \u201cquit claiming that these rioters are people.\u201d She said the media should\u00a0\u201cquit claiming that these rioters are peaceful.\u201d",

      "content": " In 2006 when Sarah Palin was elected governor of Alaska she was given a state email account. But rather than using it exclusively as she was instructed to do, Sarah created gov.sarah@yahoo.com, a private account that she directed members of her senior staff and her cabinet to use when they needed to email the governor. In 2008 Andree McLeod, a local community activist, discovered that the governor was using gov.sarah@yahoo.com to conduct state business. Representing Ms. McLeod, I sued Sarah to establish the legal principle that emails sent or received by a state official on the official\u2019s private email account and whose content involves state business are \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of that term in the Alaska Public Records Act. In 2012 the Alaska Supreme Court agreed with Andree McLeod and me that those emails are \u201cpublic records.\u201d By the time the Court did so Sarah was long gone, having resigned as governor three years earlier to make her fortune as a political commentator for Fox News and right-of-Republican Tea Party maven. But before the McLeod v. Palin lawsuit reached the Alaska Supreme Court, in 2009 when Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell succeeded Sarah, one of his first acts as governor was to prohibit state employees from using their private email accounts to conduct state business. At the time, I was quite pleased with how my lawsuit had worked out. But the ongoing dust-up over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private computer server to conduct State Department business has caused me to reconsider the underlying policy objective. Secretary Clinton\u2019s cover story is that she set up her private email communication system for reasons of personal convenience. But it is reasonable to assume that she actually set it up for the same reason Sarah created gov.sarah@yahoo.com, which was to keep her email communications private and, in Clinton\u2019s case, to prevent them from being available for public inspection pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Whatever her motivation, Secretary Clinton now says she should not have done what she did. But setting aside the issue of how she handled (or mishandled) classified information, is it really in the nation\u2019s interest to subject the email messages of federal employees, from the secretary of state on down, to public disclosure? I pose the question because email has become the Internet equivalent of the telephone call. Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson installed taping systems in the Oval Office that allowed them to record their telephone calls. But they had no legal obligation to do so. And no one - including Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform who is trying to use the manner Secretary Clinton handled classified material on her private computer server to damage her presidential campaign - has ever suggested that federal employees should be required to record their telephone calls. Because no one has, the 1.4 million civilian employees of the federal government routinely conduct government business on the telephone. And unless someone participating in a call decides to take notes, when the call is over there is no record of what was said. Why should email messages those same employees send and receive whose content involves that same government business be treated differently? Maybe there is a policy rationale for treating them differently. And maybe there is not. But the subject merits public discussion and debate. Transparency in government is an important societal value.    But the federal government could not operate if every federal employee knows that every word he or she utters on the telephone during the workday is subject to public disclosure. Nor could the rest of us live our lives that way. Where the line between the need for government transparency and the equally important need for government confidentiality should be drawn when a federal employee sends or receives an email message instead of making or receiving a telephone call is a matter about which reasonable people can have differing views. The mess Hillary has made of her attempt to draw that line on her own presents a fortuitous occasion for the members of the congressional committees that have oversight jurisdiction over the Freedom of Information Act to hold hearings to obtain testimony from witnesses who know way more about the subject than I do where, if anywhere, they think the line best should be drawn. And there would be no better expert witness to kick those hearings off than Alaska\u2019s most famous former governor.",

      "content": " Black lives matter. Saying it out loud is obvious. And important. Agreeing that Black lives matter does not make one anti-police\u200a \u2014 \u200ait simply acknowledges that we understand there is a white privilege in the United States that has existed since our foundation.\n\nHaving grown up in the U.S. but having lived in Europe for more than a decade gives me a unique perspective to know this problem is more pronounced in America and we have a responsibility to continue to chip away at the problem. As a white person, I cannot accept that the GOP candidate for office was the leading voice in the United States for the \u201cbirther movement,\u201d which questioned the citizenship of the president of the United States because his father was from Kenya. If you can\u2019t see that and see that we have a racist problem in America that this despicable man won his parties nomination then I think you can\u2019t objectively understand the problem. America in 2016 is no place for \u201cdog whistle\u201d politics and it\u2019s time that more people say out loud, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d to make sure that the terrible people trying to undermine the movement don\u2019t have air cover for continued vitriol, hatred and racism. It\u2019s important to stamp out the overt racism of Sarah Palin (who called Black Lives Matter a farce)...  It\u2019s important to stand up to Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (who called black protestors \n\n\u201chypocrites,\u201d or to take on the very ugly comments by former congressman and right-wing radio commentator Joe Walsh.  \u201cReal\u201d America? Doesn\u2019t he just make the point with one Tweet? Is \u201cReal\u201d America white? And Christian? And hetero? And Black Lives Matters supporters are Punks? \u201cWatch out Obama?\u201d \u200a\u2014 \u200athreatening the president of the United States? Inciting violence? And then CNN had the temerity to put this racist on the air. Since hatred always speaks louder than support \u200a\u2014 \u200arational people like you and me will be drowned out unless we speak up. Speaking up is important because even though we haven\u2019t walked in the footsteps of our black friends we can show empathy that we support their frustrations and very real struggles. How can we as a community not speak up? After Eric Garner? Trayvon Martin? Freddie Gray? Alton Sterling? Philandro Castile? Black lives matter. I find the movement to say #AllLivesMatter offensive. Of course all lives matter. It doesn\u2019t even need to be said. Black Lives Matter doesn\u2019t say ONLY Black Lives Matter. It doesn\u2019t exclude other people\u200a \u2014 \u200ait calls attention to the unique prejudices black people face in America. And saying \u201call lives matter\u201d is a direct attack to say that black people can\u2019t unify around their unique problems and grievances. We need to stop hiding behind the ruse that being pro #BlackLivesMatter means you are anti-police. You can stand with the police while demanding that they treat our African American citizens better. I see Black Lives Matter as an attempt at: Black unity, creating awareness of the problem and showing the country that there is a problem with how black people are still treated in America. If you take offense to a group trying to call attention to its plight then it\u2019s you who have a problem.\n\nNowhere is the point made more poignantly than the 47-second video below by Jane Elliot in which she poses the question to the (all white) audience \u2018how many people would be happy to be treated how black people are treated in society?\u2019 She asks those who agree to stand and of course nobody stands, to which she rightly says: That says very plainly, you know what\u2019s happening, you know you don\u2019t want it for you, I want to know why you\u2019re so willing to accept it or to allow it to happen for others. We need to stop hiding behind the ruse that being pro #BlackLivesMatter means you are anti-police. You can stand with the police while demanding that they treat our African American citizens better. You can stand with the police while wanting to be sure their leadership feel accountable for the actions of the rank-and-file. That bad behavior won\u2019t be tolerated and will be prosecuted. Of course Micah Johnson who shot many police officers this week in Dallas killing 5 officers is despicable. Of course his actions weaken the movement of pushing for police reform because it hardens those who already refuse to acknowledge change is needed. Of course it\u2019s unacceptable and terrible and there are police officers to be mourned. But a demented person who shoots policemen does not change the fact that we need accountability for our police system and our penal system and need to end the double standards in our society that disproportionally affect people of color. As President Obama cited from years of research at a speech last week:       Whatever the origins of these disparities, it is undeniable to say that we have a problem and one that we all own responsibility for both acknowledging and helping to fix. Like most of you, this week I watched and I read and I shared and I wept (as I watched the 15-year-old son of Alton Sterling crying for his dad) and I mourned and I boiled and I discussed.\n\nIt was a terrible week in America. The video below knocked me out and is so important for people to watch and understand. It\u2019s a StoryCorps video about a young black man, Alex Landau, with a white mom and who is stopped for making an illegal left turn and is beaten senselessly by three members of the Denver police without provocation. He has a gun pulled to his head and he hears, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t calm down we\u2019re going to have to shoot him.\u201d His passenger, who was white, had weed in his pocket and escaped any violence. When police officers feel it is ok to beat an unarmed person senselessly without fearing that their colleagues will turn them in, you know you have a systemic problem. If you watch this important video it should turn the stats listed above into an individual human narrative of daily injustice that many people of color face in this county. Talk to any black person in the U.S. and ask about their experiences with the police. I\u2019ve never met one who didn\u2019t at least have one story. It\u2019s not acceptable to live in a country where black families have to coach their children how to behave around the police for fear of being killed. Yes, we should all be respectful of police officers\u200a \u2014 \u200abut this situation clearly goes beyond that. As a coincidence, even before the recent shootings I had been thinking a lot about race relations in America this past week because I had been watching \u201cOJ Simpson: Made in America\u201d\u200a \u2014 \u200aa 5-part, 7.5-hour documentary about OJ. It is the story about OJ\u2019s life from childhood in the projects, through high school, his time at USC, his storied football career, his abandonment of the black community, the murder, the trial, his spiraling out of control and ultimately his arrest for armed robbery and sentencing to 33 years in jail. It is some of the most compelling television I have ever watched. It recounts much of my childhood in the U.S. and growing up an OJ fan but it also presciently captures race relations in America and some of the injustices endured over decades and longer. The documentary covers the LA police killing of Eulia Love who was arguing over her $22 gas bill and armed with a kitchen knife and the police officers weren\u2019t punished. They profile the Rodney King beating in which none of the police were initially found guilty. They cover Latasha Harlins, a teenage black woman who was shot in the back of the head and killed by a grocery clerk who received no jail time. They show LA police chief Daryl Gates defending a police chokehold and saying it only killed black people because they had different attributes than \u201cnormal\u201d people. The community started calling cop cars, \u201cBlack and Normals.\u201d When your police chief talks like this there is no denying you have a problem. There is no denying the history of racism in our country brought to the surface again both by the recent police killings and by the ugly, dog-whistle presidential campaign of Donald Trump. \u201cMexicans are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people\u201d or the overt racism of questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship or religion. It is undeniable to say that we have a problem and one that we all own responsibility for both acknowledging and helping to fix. Many white, heterosexual, high-income men struggle to speak up on social, racial or gender issues for fear of being targeted for insensitivity. I understand this because when I speak up I try to be careful not to represent that I understand the struggles of people of different color, gender or sexual orientation. I try to be sensitive about not making it my fight or looking for any special recognition for speaking up. But saying nothing about intolerance or racism is far worse than risking being misunderstood. I wrote on the topic of black mistreatment in America 18 months ago after Eric Garner was killed and the officers weren\u2019t charged. A (white) friend of mine emailed me that he was \u201cshaking his head when he saw the headline of my post\u201d that was titled, \u201cWhy I\u2019m Standing Today with My Black American Friends, Family & Colleagues.\u201d He then proceeded to tell me that after reading the post he actually felt relieved that I had covered the topic with humility, compassion and open-mindedness. But why would a friend of mine even second guess me for speaking up or second guess the title of my post? Why wouldn\u2019t we ALL speak up? When I hear my non-Jewish friends showing support and sympathy for anti-semitic attacks I feel heart-felt appreciation for somebody acknowledging that Jews are still marginalized in many places in the world \u2014 including America. When others speak up for me I feel supported. My father is from South America and I take great offense to Trump vilifying Latinos. I remember my father in tears at one Passover dinner talking about how Latino immigrants are treated in America. He wept for the journey of his friends from Central America coming to the U.S. illegally to escape the violent conditions in that region and saying how much easier he had it arriving legally in the late 1950s. I feel more supported when people say they won\u2019t support trump because they choose country over party. I feel more supported when people stand up to anti-semitism or anti-Latino rhetoric.\n\nSo let\u2019s not hide behind the fact that we know that of course all lives matter and that without brave policemen we would have no civil society. Of course these things are true and shouldn\u2019t have to be said. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that the black community has a right to demand equal treatment in America by our police, by our legal system and by our penal system. And they have a right to know that they are supported by white people. #BlackLivesMatter. *** I would also encourage anybody who wants a depiction of the issues facing the urban communities in America including: drugs, race, policing, the education system, longshoremen, politicians and the press \u2014 there is no greater show ever created in the U.S. than The Wire. It\u2019s simply a must watch for every American. This post originally appeared on Both Sides of the Table.",

      "content": " It is too amazing to be true.  Donald Trump charged Arthur Culvahouse, the same DC lawyer who vetted Sarah Palin, with vetting his VP choices. And Trump has ended up picking Sarah Palin, without the charisma. One source who used to work as a senior staff member in the House of Representatives told me, \u201cPence, smart?  I used to eat salads at the Rayburn cafeteria that had more brains than Mike Pence.\u201d That certainly fits Mike Pence. Mike Pence who, in 2001, still was seriously trying to claim that cigarette smoking wouldn\u2019t kill you, writing \u201cTime for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill. In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer.\u201d Mike Pence who, just last year, looked like a deer in headlights on television, when asked to explain a law he just signed.  He was completely unable to tell George Stephanopoulos if the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Reminder: a bill he just signed) would allow bakers and florists to refuse service to same-sex couples being married.  The performance was widely mocked, and thought to be the end of his Presidential ambitions. Mike Pence who, when asked if he believes in evolution, had to repeat the question, before giving a nonsensical response. Mike Pence who either didn\u2019t read, or didn\u2019t understand, that he signed a law that requires women to bury or cremate their periods, if they contain a fertilized egg, leading to the Periods for Pence movement. It isn\u2019t so much that Mike Pence is a lightweight in the brains department. It\u2019s that Mike Pence is a lightweight in the brains department, and also ridiculously incompetent. Remember that religious freedom bill that Pence signed, but couldn\u2019t explain?  Upon finding out that it wasn\u2019t at all popular, that everyone realized it could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians, and coming under pressure from a nationwide boycott of Indiana as a result, Pence was forced to sign an amendment protecting the LGBT community, thus taking out the reason religious groups wanted the original law in the first place. The result ended up being the whole ordeal was an epic waste of time, that needlessly had Hoosiers at each others\u2019 throats. Pence, in his infinite wisdom, decided that banning needle exchanges would curb drug use, despite evidence to the contrary.  What happened, because of inept Mike Pence?  Oh nothing, just an explosion of HIV in the state.  So much so that Pence was forced to sign needle exchanges back into law. Mike Pence also once decided to start spending resources to develop a state-controlled news service, which would feed the media with prewritten stories, and be the one to break \u201cnews\u201d (read: \u201cpropaganda\u201d) about his administration.  When confronted with the fact that it was, well, kind of Soviet, Pence decided to stop developing the news service. These are just some of the reasons that Mike Pence was very possibly on his way to being beaten for reelection as governor, by a state rep who hasn\u2019t been in politics for 14 years, before Donald Trump saved his hide. How bad is his reputation in the state?  Republicans want Pence out of Indiana.  Reported CNN, \u201c[Trump picking Pence] also makes for a good fit for Indiana Republicans, who are ready for Pence to go after a tumultuous first term in Indiana that has opened up a chance for Democrats to claim the governor\u2019s office.\u201d Oh, the title of that piece?  \u201cIndiana GOP to Trump: Take Mike Pence, Please!\u201d Like the former Congressional staffer above, the people of Indiana and Republicans found out, pretty darned quick, that Mike Pence is as inept and bumbling as he is lacking in intellect. This is Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential-level decision, and he didn\u2019t just whiff. He whiffed very, very badly. After November, when the post-mortems on the Trump loss are written, people will look back on Pence and think, \u201cWhat was Trump thinking?\u201d",

      "author": "Sam Stein",
      "content": " CLEVELAND \u2015 To say that the rollout of Sarah Palin as Sen. John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008 didn\u2019t go as planned would be putting it gently. In reality, it was a series of headaches and communications mishaps culminating in near calamity for the Republican Party. An unknown governor from Alaska, Palin was engulfed by a highly curious, slightly vulturous press corps. Stories popped up about her husband belonging to the Alaska Independence Party. It was revealed that she\u2019d been investigated for an alleged vendetta against the head of the state police. It was revealed that her daughter was unwed and pregnant. The McCain campaign struggled to explain how being the \u201ccommander of the National Guard\u201d of Alaska gave her foreign policy experience. Two prominent Republican consultants were caught on a live mic trashing her. NPR called it a \u201cFull-Fledged Feeding Frenzy.\u201d As the date of Palin\u2019s speech at the GOP convention neared, there was a sense that her vice presidential candidacy was imploding at the very moment it was supposed to launch. In the midst of this misfire, however, Democrats were nervous. Not just because they\u2019re preternaturally wired to be so. Officials fretted that the expectations for Palin had been set so painfully low that, were she simply to remain upright during her convention speech, she\u2019d win applause. The Obama campaign itself was more sanguine. But even they felt that Palin was being set up for a cushy reception, heavy on sympathy for the week of hell she\u2019d just endured. \u201cI think there was an assumption that with expectations where they were, she\u2019d be able to put together a good speech,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, an Obama campaign spokesman that year who had gone to the location of the GOP convention to do counter-programming. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any expectation she\u2019d be as good and as strong as she was.\u201d Not only did Palin manage to stand in place for those 45 minutes. As Vietor noted, she delivered an address far more memorable than the one McCain would give a night later. The rave reviews that Democrats anticipated began flowing in. Eight years later, a similar set of events appears to be unfolding in a similar setting. A difficult month of press coverage for Donald Trump, compounded by his distinctly off-the-cuff speaking style and a slightly off-key rollout for his vice presidential nominee, has fed expectations that the next few days in Cleveland could go poorly. And Democrats like Paul Begala, an adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s super PAC, are worrying once more that a Republican candidate is being graded \u201con a curve\u201d \u2015 that in Trump\u2019s case, the mere absence of a racially tinged line in his speech or the simple routine of getting through a convention evening without a mishap will be hailed as a sign of presidential timber. \u201cReading words off a screen qualifies you to pass third grade, not handle the nuclear codes,\u201d said Begala via email. \u201cDonald Trump has spent more time on camera before running for President than any politician except Ronald Reagan. He is a showman, and the convention is his show. Other settings challenge him more \u2015\u00a0think debates. But standing before an adoring crowd is not actually the hardest part of running for President.\u201d Mindful of that grading curve, Begala argued that the Republican nominee should emerge from Cleveland with a 5 percentage point lead in the polls \u2015 the same that McCain registered after his convention. \u201cMcCain went from 8 down to 5 up. And his convention was shortened by a day due to a storm. AND he carried the viciously unpopular Dubya on his back,\u201d Begala said. That may overstate the room that Trump has for a post-convention polling bounce (keep in mind that McCain\u2019s big night came after Obama\u2019s in 2008, as opposed to the party sequencing this year). But the notion that Trump will benefit from a low bar is one widely shared, and not just by Democrats. \u201cThe expectations are similarly low, but for different reasons,\u201d said one former McCain campaign aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cRight now people are worried about what Trump might say; but in 2008, people were worried about whether Palin could effectively say anything.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, an adviser to Palin during the rollout and through the convention, said she was still \u201ctoo close\u201d to the 2008 convention planning to be able to meta-analyze it. And perhaps she blacked out a few memories from her rocky tenure with the former Alaska governor. But Wallace also said she saw in Trump a \u201cpotential to vastly exceed expectations\u201d in Cleveland. \u201cHis poll numbers are surprisingly close to Secretary Clinton\u2019s after a very rocky 6-8 weeks,\u201d Wallace said, \u201cand if the convention comes together in a way that is entertaining and credible, he can emerge from his convention tied or ahead of [Clinton].\u201d Trump certainly brings attributes to the convention that Palin never enjoyed. While she had just a week in the national spotlight to prepare for her speech, he\u2019s been on the campaign trail for well over a year and in the public consciousness for decades longer. He\u2019s a seasoned showman, acutely aware of how television broadcasting works, while her most applicable experience was as a sportscaster for local Alaska television. For those reasons, expectations should be high for Trump, argued Craig Shirley, a longtime conservative communications specialist and a Ronald Reagan biographer. Shirley added another reason as well. \u201cHe is the nominee. Expectations are almost always high for a nominee to hit it out in their acceptance speech. Think about it. You have lots of time to prepare. You have a crack staff of speechwriters. You have 17,000 (mostly) supportive in the audience. Most everybody is rooting for you. \u201cWhether he unifies the party is another matter. There are conservatives and Reaganites who remain dubious about Trump, and [running mate Mike] Pence does not have a strong enough tractor beam to pull them in, especially considering his ongoing problems with conservatives over a number of issues,\u201d Shirley added. \u201cThe party may well leave Cleveland still divided.\u201d",

Sarah Palin\u2019s recent speech in Colorado, calling it \u201cjust spot on\u201d and \u201cvery, very good.\u201d Doty made the comments to KNUS 710-AM\u2019s Julie Hayden, who bumped into Doty at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver July 2. \u201cI thought Sarah Palin was right on, just spot on!\u201d Doty told Hayden when asked for her \u201cthoughts\u201d on the speeches. \u201cShe was very, very good - brought a clear message that people need to get on board.\u00a0 And I really enjoyed hearing [Donald] Trump.\u201d Given that she\u2019s a reporter for Fox 31 Denver, Hayden knows that people want more details about Doty\u2019s assessment of Palin. \u201cSpot on\u201d is exuberant and laudatory, but what really stood out for Doty, beyond the message to get on the Trump train? And what did Doty \u201creally\u201d enjoy about hearing Trump? Doty, who\u2019s an Arapahoe County Commissioner running against Democratic state Rep. Daniel Kagan to represent Colorado Senate District 26, didn\u2019t return a call to explain, so I\u2019m forced to speculate. Palin\u2019s speech amounted to a semi-understandable endorsement of Trump. So it\u2019s not surprising that Doty, who\u2019s said she\u2019ll back Trump, would like it. But Palin went beyond expressing support for Trump. She raved about him. She derisively referred to Republicans who oppose Trump, the #NeverTrump people, as RATs (Republicans Against Trump). If you look at the folks who vote in Doty\u2019s district, you have to think Doty needs to win over a lot of ticket-splitting RATs to defeat Kagan. Is Doty worried about offending these voters by, well, saying it\u2019s spot on for Palin to call them vermin? Then there was the part of Palin\u2019s speech when she said Trump \u201creally connects.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe found a messenger!\u201d said Palin. That\u2019s \u201cspot on\u201d only if you\u2019re not a woman, not a Hispanic, not African-American, or not just about everybody. I guess it\u2019s spot-on true, as Palin said, that Trump is a messenger for the Tea Party. Trump, Palin said, is the standard bearer for a \u201cgrassroots, populist movement that\u2019s fertilized by the still passionate Tea Party, in all its glorious independence.\u201d Does Doty think the Tea Party is spot-on in its \u201cglorious independence,\u201d as in shutting down the federal government, denying global warming, blocking bipartisan immigration reform, etc? I could go on, but I won\u2019t. And I haven\u2019t even touched on why Doty \u201creally enjoyed\u201d hearing Trump. Lots for Hayden dig into during her next interview with Doty.

      "content": " My wife, a schoolteacher, watched the DNC for hours today, tearing up as Hillary Clinton was nominated for president.  But my thirteen-year-old daughter didn\u2019t share the same emotion, wondering what the fuss was all about.  She\u2019s now used to hearing about the accomplishments of women.  And that\u2019s a good thing.  When I came home, I was surprised to see my wife home early, with the television on, watching the DNC roll call for states.  She had put aside her lesson plans for the fall for her English classes on Tom Sawyer, counting the votes like a CNN pundit.  \u201cDid they do this for Trump?\u201d she asked me.  \u201cI think they just ended it with Alabama,\u201d I replied. She saw the votes pour in for Bernie Sanders.  \u201cAre these the votes he got, or is he picking up votes?\u201d she asked.  She had seen all the support for Sanders and saw me watching Fox News Channel\u2019s coverage of the protests the previous day.  I assured her that Clinton had it in the bag.  \u201cBut it\u2019s a little too close for comfort for me.\u201d She\u2019s not a political science teacher, or even a major.  We do watch \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as well as Samantha Bee\u2019s show, but her world doesn\u2019t revolve around politics like mine does.  But then it hit me.  Like so many women her age that I know, they\u2019ve grown up in a world where teachers told her that a woman could be elected president, but political pundits pooh-poohed every candidate who seemed to come close while voters shied away from ending tradition, undercutting each one. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2008 got her excited, and she was sad to see the New York Senator just come up short.  Her disappointment didn\u2019t lead her to back McCain, just because he put Sarah Palin on ticket. I have noticed that she seemed more interested in the political campaign this year than any other year.  I just assumed it was the high stakes, the Trump candidacy, the close polls, but maybe it was about seeing a woman break through the glass ceiling.  She wasn\u2019t watching CNN\u2019s coverage for me.  It was for her, and her daughter.  Polls now show that a majority of Americans are comfortable with a female nominee for president, according to Ariel Edwards-Levy with Huffington Post. \u201cMy son and I are watching this,\u201d her sister messaged me on Facebook.  \u201cHe wants to see which state gives Hillary the winning vote.\u201d  She\u2019s a physics professor at another college, and just as eager as her sister to see Clinton win the nomination, watching it with her twelve-year-old son.  After all, she spends a lot of time helping women in STEM classes overcome gender bias, giving them the same opportunities as male students. My teenage daughter seemed to be the lone holdout.  It just didn\u2019t seem so important for her.  I\u2019ve heard that this is sometimes the case for younger Sanders supporters.  I admit being a little puzzled by her decision.  But it isn\u2019t that she doesn\u2019t like Clinton.  She\u2019s a rare voice of support for Hillary at her school, dominated by conservative kids. But all her young life, she\u2019s seen cases of women succeeding, in politics, sports, business, and everyday life.  It\u2019s not that Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination held no meaning for her.  It just didn\u2019t seem so unusual anymore.  When Clinton spoke of all the cracks in the glass ceiling, it wasn\u2019t just one woman who made them all.  It was millions of women across America who made them in their everyday lives. In a number of European countries, there are gender quotas for elections, where a certain number of female candidates have to be on the ballot for each party to qualify (and women still lack power in some countries that adopt quotas, like Poland and Spain).  America doesn\u2019t have that, despite calls for it.  I suppose that makes Clinton\u2019s accomplishment all the more impressive.  My daughter still doesn\u2019t understand that part, or know about what America was like before the 19th Amendment, but I hope one day she will. John A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga.  He can be reached at jtures@lagrange.edu.",

He conceded that his language sounded \u201cinflammatory\u201d to some, but said, \u201cI stand by that.\u201d I don\u2019t believe this requires further commentary.

If so, obviously that wouldn\u2019t have been done by the Russians or pro-Russian separatists quote unquote, that would have been done by the Kiev Zio-Nazi government. Which is what it is\u2014these Zionist Jewish oligarchs, billionaire criminal dons, are funding Nazi street thugs. These are the people who overthrew the legitimate democratically elected government of Ukraine and created a fascist junta, and they are the ones who would be the suspects, at least in my opinion\u2014somebody shooting at Putin\u2019s plane, and yet the media doesn\u2019t even raise that as a possibility.\u201d Baraka immediately engages with the idea and agrees. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s raised, it\u2019s raised as a conspiracy,\u201d Baraka responded. \u201cI think that this is a\u2014I was trying to find the citation, I remember reading, I can\u2019t remember who it was, someone wrote about three weeks ago that we should expect false flag, a major false flag operation in eastern Ukraine that\u2019s going to be blamed on the Russians. And that\u2019s exactly what has happened.\u201d Finally, given that the Stein-Baraka campaign is courting Bernie Sanders voters, it appears Mr. Baraka hasn\u2019t exactly felt the Bern: According to Baraka, the Sanders\u2019 campaign did not offer a genuine program for radical change (apparently, free education and free health care aren\u2019t radical enough) because it was tacitly committed to \u201cEurocentrism\u201d and \u201cnormalized white supremacy.\u201d \u201cAs much as the \u2018Sandernistas\u2019 attempt to disarticulate Sanders \u2018progressive\u2019 domestic policies from his documented support for empire,\u201d Baraka said, \u201cit should be obvious that his campaign is an ideological prop ... of the logic and interests of the capitalist-imperialist settler state.\u201d Jill Stein\u2019s extremism is bad enough. The idea of Ajamu Baraka being one heartbeat from the presidency makes me feel something like the way I did the day John McCain picked Sarah Palin. And that\u2019s saying something.",

      "content": " The bedrock of a Democracy is free speech and an open, independent, free press. The media\u2019s fundamental role in a free society is to (a) report, analyze and investigate the news in a timely, factual and objective manner; (b) hold government leaders accountable to its citizens; (c) educate and inform relating to key issues and news; and (d) connect citizens with each other. In doing so, it is supposed to have unfettered access to those people and situations on which it reports. But Donald Trump, his campaign officials and surrogates appear to have a different definition of the media\u2019s role not just in a Democracy like America, but within his very campaign. To Team Trump, the media is an extension of the campaign itself, much in the same way that publicists and surrogates function. To understand Trump\u2019s relationship with the media is to start with his basic disdain for journalists. He sees them as the enemy. He neither understands their role in American society or appreciates the critical fact that without them we\u2019d live in a fascist dictatorship (though the latter appears increasingly more attractive to him). With his incredibly thin-skin, Trump views challenges from the media as \u201cvicious\u201d criticism. An attack. A \u201cganging up\u201d on him for which he responds, as a self-described \u201ccounter-puncher,\u201d with often ruthless, incendiary return-fire, public insults and/or, as in the case of the Washington Post, a ban from campaign events and rallies. As a self-consumed, self-aggrandizing narcissist, Trump believes everyone else in the world exists to serve him. Even as he runs for president of the Unites States, Trump fails to understand and accept journalists\u2019 role, especially on the campaign trail. The press is viewed as an extension of his promotion, marketing and PR team. Rather than respect the media\u2019s watchdog role, Trump genuinely expects them to reinforce and help spread his message, and gets deeply shocked and offended when they don\u2019t. And when they don\u2019t they\u2019re mocked, ridiculed, called \u201cdisgusting\u201d and accused of \u201crigging\u201d the system. When Trump makes ignorant, inflammatory, sexist, racist and ill-advised comments, he gets mad at the press for covering it as news. And when his unconscionable behavior impacts his campaign \u2014 miring it in controversy and sagging polls, for example \u2014 he then blames the media for his misfortunes. He\u2019s living the old Tina Fey parody of Sarah Palin: \u201cI hope the lamestream media won\u2019t twist my words by repeatin\u2019 \u2018em verbatim!\u201d It\u2019s an incredibly dangerous state of being when a candidate for the highest office in the freest nation on the planet loathes and impedes its free press because of personal animus. This Constitutionally-bankrupt behavior on Trump\u2019s part should be an automatic disqualifier in the race. But bankruptcy seems to be a calling-card in this unprecedentedly bizarre election.",

(Here\u2019s a funny video to emphasize the point.)

So, does the inverted worldview on Doty\u2019s mailer have anything to do with her enthusiasm about Palin and Trump?

Daniel Kagan is key, along with an Arvada state senate contest, in the GOP\u2019s struggle to maintain their one-seat majority in the senate chamber and thereby block Colorado Democrats\u2019 hopes of controlling state government next year.

      "content": " After serving as Alaska\u2019s junior United States Senator for twenty-two years, in 2002 Frank Murkowski was elected governor of Alaska. As governor, Frank\u2019s first action was to dumbfound Alaskans by appointing his daughter Lisa to serve out his term in the Senate. In 1998 Lisa, a Republican because her parents were, had been elected to the Alaska House of Representatives from a neighborhood in Anchorage. During the two terms she served in the House her pro-choice views and willingness to work with Democrats to develop a fiscal plan for the state that included reinstating the income tax put her out of step with the Alaska Republican Party, whose members trend from center-right to flat-out-nuts. She was so out of step that in 2002 when she was elected to a third term, by only fifty-seven votes, she barely survived a challenge in the Republican primary election from an opponent who was supported by Alaska Right to Life. Based on the record she compiled during her tenure in the Alaska House of Representatives, what her father\u2019s brazen act of nepotism accomplished was to saddle the Alaska Republican Party with a United States Senator who the party\u2019s rank-and-file never would have selected had they been given a say in the matter. That fact became apparent in 2010 when Lisa stood for reelection and was beaten fair and square in the Republican primary election by a Fairbanks attorney named Joe Miller, a Tea Party ideologue and protege of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin who has no use for father and daughter Murkowski because she has never forgiven Frank for not appointing her to his Senate seat. Several days before the primary election during a joint appearance with Miller at the Kenai-Soldotna Chamber of Commerce Lisa promised publicly that if he won she would support Miller in the general election. But when Miller did win she broke her word. The reason she did was that the Alaska Democratic Party\u2019s nominee was Scott McAdams, the titular mayor of Sitka, a small town in southeast Alaska. McAdams had no statewide name recognition, no political gravitas, and no money, and he had run for the Senate only because the Alaska Democratic Party had held its state convention in Sitka and during the convention no one else could be persuaded to run because no one thought Lisa could be beat in the general election. When Lisa unexpectedly lost the Republican primary election the Alaska Democratic Party could have replaced McAdams with a real candidate around whom the anti-Miller vote in the general election could have been organized. When the Alaska Democratic Party inexplicably decided not to do so, that fortuity provided Lisa a window of opportunity to launch a write-in candidacy that the decision the United States Supreme Court had issued nine months earlier in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission made possible because it allowed business corporations that were owned by Alaska Natives who were terrified of Miller to finance the write-in campaign with contributions that totaled $1.7 million. Lisa won the three-way contest in the November 2010 general election by defeating Joe Miller and Scott McAdams by 2,092 and 32,886 votes, respectively. But she only won because 36,474 Democrats and center-left independent voters who had voted for Ethan Berkowitz, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, abandoned McAdams in order to write-in Lisa. Her history-making victory gave Lisa an opportunity to solidify the bipartisan coalition that had coalesced around her write-in candidacy by declaring that when the new Congress convened she would return to the Senate as an Independent who would represent the Alaskans of both political parties and of no political party who had reelected her. And being an Independent, she would not be a candidate in the 2016 Republican primary election. While she did not do that, during the lame duck session that was held after the 2010 general election Lisa experimented with independence by voting to repeal the military\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy, voting to ratify a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that conservative Republicans abhorred, and voting to end a Republican filibuster of the DREAM Act, whose enactment would have created a path toward permanent residence for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States when they were children. Politico was impressed enough with her performance to report: \u201cMurkowski\u2019s willingness to defy Republican top brass after a bitter fight to keep her seat may mark a pivotal point in her career as she emerges as a real maverick foil to Sarah Palin, the conservative idol who put Alaska politics on the national map. And while conservatives who helped oust Murkowski from the GOP ticket in Alaska may howl about her being a \u2018Republican in Name Only,\u2019 Murkowski could enjoy a powerful perch as a much-sought-after moderate in an almost evenly decided Senate.\u201d But after that encouraging start, Lisa soon settled back in as a dependable member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Republican caucus. For example, last February when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, without consulting the members of the caucus McConnell announced that the Judiciary Committee would not afford the individual the president nominated to succeed Scalia even the courtesy of a hearing. Lisa initially told the Alaska press that \u201cI do believe that the nominee should get a hearing.\u201d But apparently after having been talked to by McConnell, the next day she fell into line. When she did, she undoubtedly thought she could do so with impunity because, since she was generally popular, she did not need to curry favor with the Democrats and the center-left independent voters who six years earlier had saved her from Joe Miller, many of whom were outraged by McConnell\u2019s refusal to allow the Senate to consider the confirmation of Judge Merrick Garland who in March President Obama nominated to succeed Scalia. Initially, that is how the 2016 Senate election in Alaska appeared to be playing out. Because in a state as blood red as Alaska the Democratic Party is a damaged brand, Kay Brown, the executive director of the Alaska Democratic Party, was instrumental behind the scenes in persuading an Anchorage attorney, retired army colonel, and MacArthur genius award winner named Margaret Stock to run as an independent in the general election with the Alaska Democratic Party\u2019s unofficial wink-wink support. Then in August Lisa easily defeated three never-heard-of-them candidates to win the Republican nomination, and Ray \u201cDisco Ray\u201d Metcalfe, a local political gadfly, won the Democratic nomination. But that smooth-sailing for Lisa ended last Tuesday when Cean Stevens, the nominee of the Alaska Libertarian Party, unexpectedly ended her candidacy and the party\u2019s board of directors replaced Stevens with Joe Miller. As of this writing the smart money remains on Lisa. But as any boomer Mouseketeer can tell you, on the Mickey Mouse Club Wednesdays were Anything Can Happen Day. And with Donald Trump and Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson both on the Alaska election ballot, and with Joe Miller now in the race, anything now can happen in the Alaska Senate election. When Miller narrowly lost to Lisa in the 2010 general election he won more than 90,000 votes. If he can do the same in 2016 he can win. In the same vein, if Democrats and center-left independent voters who saved Lisa in 2010 decide that, once burned, they will not save her again, and, because no one takes Disco Ray seriously, they decide to support Margaret Stock while Joe Miller\u2019s presence on the ballot depresses Lisa\u2019s vote count, Stock has a chance to win that a week ago she didn\u2019t have. If Stock does win and then caucuses with the Democrats, depending on the outcome of the other Senate elections that presently are too close to call, control of the Senate may move to the Democrats. If it does, when he has time to think about it after he returns to the back bench, Mitch McConnell may regret that Lisa so quickly ended her experiment with representing the Alaskans who reelected her in 2010, rather than kowtowing to the Tea Party-tinged ideology of the Alaska Republican Party, a majority of whose hard core members, left to their druthers, have never wanted any part of her.",

No one wanted the Jews before or during the war, and certainly not after the war. They went to Israel after the war and experienced racism there because they were immigrants. It wasn\u2019t until they came to America that they were able to build a life and a family \u2014 and most importantly, a legacy. Trump, who once sympathized with refugees, now wants them all out. 2.\tI\u2019m a nasty woman because I believe in equal pay. I grew up in an America where I didn\u2019t have to sleep with anyone or curry sexual favors to become a leader in my field. While I have never felt any overt negative bias because of my gender, many women do \u2014 especially when we have research confirming the unequal paychecks of men and women. I am a brilliant brand builder. My breasts and vagina classify me as a woman, but that has little do with my brilliance as brand builder. My lady parts shall only concern the lucky man that I choose to share them with. To Trump, women are an accessory to power, not power themselves. 3.\tI\u2019m a nasty woman because I believe that women should have the last word on what they can and cannot do with their bodies. At age 23, I had the choice of having an abortion. I wasn\u2019t flippant about the choice. I was using birth control and condoms and still, I became pregnant. I did not want to marry this man. My dreams were yet to be accomplished. If had that baby, I would have lived a lifetime filled with resentment for this child and contributed to the misery in the world. Trump has said he will overturn Roe v. Wade. 4.\tI\u2019m a nasty woman because I believe in honoring thy neighbor is the only way.  I do not want to live in a world where people can lie in real time and get away with it. Where you can dehumanize people in public, on tape, and say it isn\u2019t so. I don\u2019t want a world everyone fibs, name-calls, and manipulates because it\u2019s now acceptable to listen to what was once dinner table talk of racists, bigots, and liars in public. Trump has mocked, dehumanized, threatened, defrauded those around him. It\u2019s no surprise he has not been championed by any of our heroes \u2014 unless of course Scott Baio or Sarah Palin are your heroes. 5.\tI\u2019m a nasty woman because I believe that your word is everything. We cannot live in a world where a language \u2014 the language of Shakespeare \u2014 means nothing and winning means everything.

      "content": " Eight years to the day (November 4, 2008), 92% White and 3% Black Iowans gave Kenyan-American Barack Hussein Obama 38% of the votes in the 2008 Iowa Caucus thereby sending the man derisively called the \u201cjunior senator from Illinois\u201c on his way to an extremely hard-fought and character-building victory over the New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary R. Clinton in the Democratic Party Primary. Barack Obama\u2018s victory over Hillary Clinton set the stage for what should have been an equally hard fight against the Republican Party nominee and decorated war hero John McCain. That never happened. Vividly illustrating the inability to \u201cwalk and chew gum at the same time\u201c, John McCain stumbled from selecting the hitherto unknown Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate to  \u201csuspending his campaign\u201c even as he declared that the then-free falling US economy was \u201cfundamentally sound\u201c. In one fell swoop, the \u201cmaverick\u201d captain of the \u201cStraight-talk Express\u201d became an answer to the trivial pursuit question: Which presidential candidate lost to America\u2019s first African American President? Then in his successful 2012 re-election bid, Obama\u2019s ground game and \u201cStraight outta Silicon Valley\u201c analytics ran roughshod over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. America is now poised to elect Barack Obama\u2019s successor and if there was one moment that captures the Obama Presidency, I would offer as Exhibit A, the video that compared President Obama\u2019s reaction to a pro-Trump protestor AND Donald Trump\u2019s characterization of the president\u2019s reaction to said protestor. To put it bluntly: Donald Trump\u2019s characterization of Barack Obama\u2019s reaction to the protestor was an outright lie. Even more disturbing is that a section of the American population believed/s Donald Trump\u2019s version of the events in Fayetteville, North Carolina despite the video evidence. The foregoing is the sad yet accurate metaphor of Obama\u2019s two-term presidency. From Mitch McConnell\u2019s promise to \u201cmake him a one-term president\u201c to Joe Wilson\u2019s \u201cYou Lie\u201c yell in front of a global audience not to mention the R-Rated invectives hurled at the First Family, Barack Obama\u2019s response has epitomized tolerance and control. From Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cotherization\u201c of America\u2019s first non-white male president to the GOP-controlled Congress\u2019s abrogation of the adage \u201cpolitics ends at the waterfront\u201c, very few can question Mr. Obama\u2019s near-preternatural reaction and response to his rivals\u2019 refusal to accept his (American) citizenry even as they sided with a foreign leader who had policy differences with Mr. Obama! It is this otherworldly grace and equipoise combined with an economy that\u2019s back from the brink of collapse and a country not fighting a war that has enabled Barack to finish his presidency riding a 50%+ job approval rating even as hyper-partisan still insist that his presidency has been a \u201cfailure\u201d. Full Disclosure: I AM partial to the man whose father Barack Obama Sr. hailed from my Luo tribe in Nyanza. I am a father to a 13-year old teenager who came of age knowing as his first president, someone who looks like him and is of the same (tribal) lineage. My son, like President Obama is of Kenyan Luo-American heritage (his mother is a bi-racial American). Nearly all his peers and their friends across the socio-political, racial and religious divide have nothing but immense admiration for a POTUS they alternately describe as \u201ccool\u201d, \u201ccoolest\u201d, \u201ctotally swagged out Dad\u201d and/or \u201ca good man\u201d; an ominous sign for the Republicans as the \u201cbrowning of America\u201c picks up pace and these tweens become voters. With my then-5year old son at my side, I cried when on November 4, 2008 at 8PM PST, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer called California for Barack Obama thus giving him an unassailable Electoral College total well beyond the requisite 270. I reassured him that those were tears of joy; at being able to share a moment not many thought was possible, with him and as hyperbolic as it may sound, I knew that America, indeed the world would never be the same in the wake of Obama\u2019s first victory. People have made compelling cases against some of President Obama policies, myself included. The fiasco in Libya and Syria come to mind. His hands-off approach to the continent especially during his first term in office is another. There is palpable (and valid) fear among those in the \u201cRust Bowl\u201d who believe they have been left behind by the changing global economy. Finally, racial tensions have heightened during the last 2-3 years of his second term AND by the rhetoric of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. To be clear, the in-coming American president will inherit the foregoing listing of unfinished Obama business; all valid conversations Americans will need to have going forward. However, the dichotomous views on President Obama\u2019s intentions and actions of the last eight years as \u2014 illustrated by the narrative that came out of Fayetteville \u2014 stifled any constructive discussions and decisions on (these) matters of national import. This acrimony and deliberate obstructionism has been the bane of the Obama Presidency. Despite the foregoing, President Obama has stayed above the fray. In the process, he has offered Americans a benchmark and contrast against which to measure and compare future candidates vying for the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful office\u201d \u2014 regardless of race, gender or religion. As counter-intuitive as it seems, when their mostly right wing detractors \u201cwent low\u201c, The Obamas \u2014 Barack, Michelle, Malia, Sasha and Michelle\u2019s Mom Ms. Marian Robinson \u2014 \u201cwent high\u201d. In so doing, America\u2019s first black First Family gave America AND the world a daily reminder of the very ideals and values most of these same detractors and critics only speechify about. So, Mr. President, for the ethos of integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance displayed in the pressure cooker that is the American Presidency, let me join David Brooks in declaring that I miss you - already. Let me also say \u201cThank You President Obama\u201d.",

      "content": " President-Elect Donald J. Trump announced his cabinet on Wednesday. Trump, who won the presidency by defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he wanted to have a cabinet of people who thought and acted like he did. Attorney General: Jeff Sessions\n\nTrump said that the U.S. senator from Alabama and he \u201chave a similar thought process.\u201d Before Sessions became a senator he was nominated to be a U.S. district court judge. The Senate rejected him because of a long and disturbing history of racism, including praising the Ku Klux Klan, calling a black U.S. attorney \u201cboy\u201d and the NAACP \u201cun-American.\u201d Secretary of State: Dennis Rodman \n\nTrump praised the cross-dressing former NBA player and celebrity apprentice for his trip to North Korea where he met with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-Un. Rodman called Kim \u201ca friend for life,\u201d adding, \u201cI was able to get a sense of his soul.\u201d Rodman added that Kim\u2019s soul looked a lot like Trump\u2019s. Secretary of Education: Bill Cosby, Ed.D. \n\nCosby, an award-winning comedian, actor, and author, has a doctorate in education. He will face trial next year for sexual assault. More than 50 women have accused him of sexual misconduct. Secretary of Energy: Sarah Palin\n\nPalin, former vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor, was one of the first national politicians to endorse Trump. Palin has said she wants to be energy secretary. She\u2019s uniquely qualified: The lights are on but nobody is home. Secretary of Treasury: Bernie Madoff\n\nThe jailed financier shares Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for trickle-up economics. This involves giving your money to the wealthy, who then keep it. Secretary of Interior: Martha Stewart \n\nFracking can contaminate ground water, release toxic pollutants into the air, and increase the chances for earthquakes. If Stewart, an interior decorator and a former Trump business associate, becomes interior secretary, she\u2019ll do nothing about the dangers of fracking but at least the noxious air will smell more like cinnamon. Secretary of Defense: Rudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani and Trump agree that America used to be a great country until it started electing black presidents and that war is the answer, regardless of the question. Like Giuliani, Trump went to great lengths to avoid serving in the Vietnam War and is contemptuous of anyone who serves in the military. Trump, for his part, believes that Arizona Sen. John McCain is a slacker for spending the war as a POW. Secretary of Labor: Scott Walker\n\nTrump contributed $10,000 in dark money to the re-election campaign of the Wisconsin governor, who compared fighting the terrorist organization ISIS to fighting unions in his state. AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka calls Walker a \u201cnational disgrace.\u201d Trump and Walker have a lot in common: They\u2019re both union-busting national disgraces. Secretary of Health and Human Services: Terry Marks \n\nWho would better represent Trump\u2019s ideas on women\u2019s issues than the CEO of the Hooters restaurant chain? Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: Donald Sterling \n\nThe billionaire slum lord and former NBA owner was banned from professional basketball after his racist statements were made public. Sterling has been sued multiple times for refusing to rent apartments to blacks. So has Trump. Secretary of Transportation: Chris Christie \n\nThe New Jersey governor, a close Trump advisor, has been implicated in the infamous \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal. Two of Christie\u2019s top aides are facing a jail sentence for closing the George Washington Bridge near Fort Lee, NJ, to punish the town\u2019s mayor for not supporting Christie\u2019s re-election bid. Secretary of Commerce: Rick Perry\n\nThe former Texas governor and GOP presidential candidate advocated doing away with the Commerce Department during his \u201cOops\u201d moment during the 2012 presidential run. Perry believes that if the department is abolished, he would have one less thing to remember. Secretary of Veterans Affairs: David Petraeus \n\nAfter leaving the U.S. Army, the retired four-star general became director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He resigned from the CIA after providing classified information to his mistress who was writing his biography. Trump is a supporter of Petraeus \u2014 and no veteran is better associated with affairs than Petraeus. Secretary of Homeland Security: Joe Arpaio\n\nTrump has praised the sheriff of Maricopa County Arizona, who will stop of nothing - not even the U.S. Constitution\u2014 to detain Mexicans, regardless of whether they are in the United States legally. Secretary of Agriculture: Ted Cruz \n\nThe Republican candidate for president and U.S. senator from Texas agrees with Trump that we must evict all illegal Mexicans from the United States. If this happens, it will cause an agricultural crisis. It is estimated that the eviction of 250,000 farm workers will eviscerate crop production, inflate food prices to unprecedented levels and cost the economy billions of dollars a year. A small price to pay to make America great again.",

      "content": " Like many of you, I have communicated with a number of friends abroad about the result of the U.S. election. Every one of them have been genuinely shocked, and, like many here in the U.S., simply cannot believe it. The potential ramifications - for America and the world \u2014 are only just beginning to set in. I recently exchanged views with a friend in New Zealand, whose response was so refreshingly (and brutally) honest and insightful that I wanted to share them. What follows are his thoughts, which I felt might resonate with others in the U.S. and around the world. Indeed, he seems much better informed about the state of affairs in America than many of my compatriots. \u201cIt has been a fascinating spectacle from outside of your country as well, but not in a good way. We reflect on what the election brought out in terms of our understanding of the nature of the American people. I can see why you refer to non-U.S. citizens as \u201caliens\u201d when we enter the U.S. because I can certainly not connect with a lot of the thinking of U.S. citizens either. Bible obsession, gun culture, celebrity culture, tribalism, the high regard for extrinsic trappings of wealth and success that forgives all moral failings and lack of humanity, the cynicism of the elite, the gullibility of the exploited. Alien thinking by my standard. Not everyone of course, but too many. I\u2019d hasten to add that the short sightedness and collective stupidity is not a unique feature of American politics or the American people. We suffer from it here as well, but of course our ability to amplify it across the globe are nowhere near as great. Your political system desperately needs an overhaul for the good of the planet, if not just for your domestic well- being. Term limits are a great idea but you also need a proportional system like we have here and in Germany to give voice to other opinions and reasoned debate. The winner take all approach is I\u2019m sure a contributor to the political race to the bottom. The fact that people who voted against the establishment also voted in the establishment in the Congress makes me just wonder whether there is any consistency in thinking or principle, or are we all just gibbering chimpanzees with the attention span of goldfish successfully manipulated by demagogues? Of course the world shouldn\u2019t have any say in your domestic politics, but we have a huge stake in U.S. leadership when it comes to multilateral issues, as you so rightly describe in one of your articles. We may sneer at the willful stupidity and ignorance portrayed by your political leaders, but I am most fearful of what a Trump presidency means for our global commitment to combat climate change. This existential issue goes beyond any short-term concerns around global security and the ability to deal with other despots in Moscow, Beijing, and Riyadh. We all lose for having a climate change denier in charge of the most influential country in the world. You\u2019d think that someone who has already had to build a seawall to protect his golf course in Ireland and is looking at having to do something similar for his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida might be better informed on the science. But then again, the instinct to plunder for short term gain is probably stronger - how else to explain the rise of Sarah Palin, Harold Hamm, Myron Ebell and other neanderthals touted for the new administration? New Zealand has always prided itself on its global citizenship and support for multilateral institutions, rather than blind support for traditional allies like the U.S. Hence our muted response to the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d and our engagement in your middle eastern adventures. Your secretary of state, John Kerry, is currently visiting New Zealand to help celebrate a joint NZ-US proposal for the protection of the world\u2019s oceans with the establishment of the world\u2019s largest marine protected area in the Ross Sea. Is this another \u201cbad deal\u201d that will be undermined by your president elect?\u201d Bravo. *Daniel Wagner is Managing Director of Risk Cooperative and co-author of the new book \u201cGlobal Risk Agility and Decision Making\u201d.",

Any crazy-ass thing, no matter how insane, no matter how fucked up, is possible. In America, you just need to imagine it, and it can happen. Take Rudy Giuliani, crazy person and failed presidential candidate - which cabinet position should we choose for him? You\u2019re thinking, well, he\u2019s a former prosecutor and at least nominally, if not temperamentally, suited to be Attorney General? No, let\u2019s make him Secretary of State. Our top diplomat. Because nothing says diplomatic like Rudy Giuliani. Crazy lunatic white supremacist raging anti-Semite Steve Bannon? We\u2019ll make him top Special Advisor to the President. What, you\u2019re saying, a person with such views would never make it through the confirmation process? Well fuck you, it\u2019s not a cabinet position, there is no fucking confirmation process. I was joking with Kate last night that any minute Trump would be nominating Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter to cabinet positions. Say, Palin for Secretary of Defense maybe. MC Justice helpfully suggested Coulter for Ministry of Information, which again, makes perfect sense. Like that\u2019s the craziest thing that could ever happen. And then, 10 minutes later, my friend Camille is like, \u201coh no, Palin\u2019s being mentioned for Secretary of the Interior.\u201d Like, they just announced it. For real. For fucking real. And I\u2019m like, what\u2019s next? Ben Carson - he\u2019s a doctor, let\u2019s make him Secretary of the Treasury. Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke - you\u2019re thinking it would be really evil to put him as head of the Civil Rights Division at Justice, but no, let\u2019s make him Surgeon General, because fuck you. That crazy sheriff from Milwaukee - head of NASA. Why the fuck not. I haven\u2019t looked at the news in the last two hours, so I\u2019m sure events have gotten ahead of me, and all these people have been nominated already, for realz. If that\u2019s true and you\u2019re thinking of helpfully correcting me, you\u2019re missing the fucking point. Because I already know that they just nominated Baron Trump to the Supreme Court. So fuck you. In conclusion, I feel blessed, truly blessed, to live in a country where anyone, no matter their race, creed or color, no matter their station in life, no matter their connection with \u201csanity\u201d or \u201creality\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d, can achieve greatness, riches, and power, if Donald Trump says so.

With Trump at the helm,\u00a0it seems safe to say that the worst person imaginable to handle the environment, economy, Homeland Security, etc. is each being floated to handle those jobs.

So let\u2019s try to laugh away our impending doom by playing America\u2019s new favorite game show ... NOT FLOATED. But it makes sense, right? I felt this was right around the corner but there\u2019s no way. In fact, Trump has said he\u00a0is not a fan of\u00a0Shkreli. FLOATED!\u00a0That\u2019s right, Linda McMahon,\u00a0the woman who the people of Connecticut rejected for senator twice and who helped build the WWE might be the person overseeing the growth of American business. You know WWE, right? The most profitable company in the United States? [Cough]\u00a0Apple [Cough]\u00a0Facebook. NOT FLOATED! But again, this feels like it makes sense. Regardless of position, White will probably be given some sort of government clearance. High clearance. Like \u201cBarron Trump level\u201d clearance. NOT FLOATED! That\u2019s insane, guys. Sarah Palin isn\u2019t being floated for Education. Sarah Palin is being floated for Secretary of the Interior! I\u2019ve started payments on a doomsday bunker! We\u2019re fine! NOT FLOATED! Sorry, I gotta throw a couple jokes in here so it\u2019s not a complete horror show. The Winklevoss boys wont be sharing a desk in D.C. And even if they did, Zuckerberg would just make a much better version of that department and get all the credit. FLOATED!\u00a0Buzz is gathering around Ivana for this position,\u00a0because being a model and socialite is enough to represent the United States of America in another country. I gotta get new headshots! FLOATED!\u00a0Apparently if you can handle Milwaukee, you can handle all 50 states. Clarke denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and said that anti-Trump protesters were \u201canarchists.\u201d Despite that, he\u2019s looking like a top contender to make the call on how the country\u2019s citizens are protected. This game is deeply, deeply disturbing fun, right? FLOATED!\u00a0One day your father is being linked to the JFK assassination\u00a0and the next, your name is being thrown around to be in a position to overturn Roe vs. Wade!

You won! \u201cPresident Trump!\u201d I have to admit, I (and about 325-million people in the United States alone) thought achieving this feat was about as possible as the New York Knicks putting together a championship season. But, good grief, you did it! You defied the odds. You rewrote the book. Threw caution to the wind and took a flying leap off a short pier with the \u201cultimate outsider.\u201d Now, just how long do you think it\u2019ll take before you realize you were conned beyond comprehension? Donald Trump played you for fools. Lied to you 24/7. Told you everything you wanted to hear, no matter how outrageous, offensive or untrue. Ironically, the \u2018reality\u2019 show star kept you orbiting in an alternate universe. With each new ignorant, sexist, racist comment we liberals thought, \u201cThat\u2019s it, it\u2019s over, he can\u2019t recover from this!\u201d We said that from the start of the campaign back in May 2015 with the \u2018Mexican rapists\u2019 rhetoric and kept saying it right through to the pussy-grabbing tape. But recover he did. Every...single...time. There was nothing Trump could do to turn you off. The man himself even said he could shoot someone in the middle of NYC\u2019s 5th Avenue and you\u2019d still support him. As crazy as it sounds, he was right. Surely you\u2019d have said \u201cThat baby deserved it!\u201c Or, \u201cThe nun was holding up traffic!\u201d You have contempt and disdain for the media. For fact-checkers. For any independent source of truth. You live in a bubble where \u2018honesty\u2019 is named Sean Hannity and Fox News. Where you trust everything Trump tells you about Trump, and believe that everyone else is just conspiring against him. You seem repulsed by disclosure, the rule of law, checks and balances and a free press. And you relish violating the Constitution in your misguided quest to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Your motto? \u201cIn Trump We Trust.\u201d You\u2019re ok with Trump not releasing his taxes, no matter that they may reveal dubious business dealings with hostile governments such as Russia, which could impact America\u2019s national security. Further, the tax returns could also demonstrate that Trump\u2019s not the \u2018successful businessman\u2019 he claims (wasn\u2019t that one of the main reasons you supported him?). Or they could prove that he\u2019s cash poor, which is why he put up so little of his own money for the campaign, despite his mega-promise of being \u201cself-funded\u201d and beholden to no one (er...wasn\u2019t that one of the main reasons you voted for him?). What if the tax returns prove that Trump\u2019s not as charitable as he claims? That he hasn\u2019t donated to veterans\u2019 charities, for example. And let\u2019s talk about vets for second. How on Earth did any one of you vote for him? You didn\u2019t blink when he dissed Sen. John McCain and POW\u2019s in saying \u201creal heroes\u201d don\u2019t get captured. Or how he stiffed you out of the $5-million he promised in that sham \u201cfundraiser?\u201d Or when he said he \u201cknew more than the generals\u201d about ISIS, or when he attacked these generals and the entire armed services by repeatedly stating that our military is a \u201cdisaster\u201d and has \u201cfailed.\u201d You didn\u2019t blink when, as a draft dodger, he equated the danger of sleeping around with it being his own \u201cpersonal Vietnam.\u201d Or when he shamelessly took the medal of a retired vet and incredulously said \u201cI always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.\u201d Or when he suggested to an audience of vets that they had PTSD because they weren\u2019t \u201cstrong.\u201d Nor did you care when he admitted to paying zero income taxes, which means he personally provided no financial support to the military. But worst of all, you encouraged him when he unconscionably attacked the Gold Star Khan family. You still voted for him. Make no mistake: you vets do an amazing, noble job of defending America, and for that we honor and respect you and owe you a colossal debt of gratitude. But it\u2019s another story when it comes to defending yourselves from a military-hostile scam-artist like Trump. And now in just one week of being President-elect, Trump appears firmly on his way to reneging on all the major promises he\u2019s made to you. You know, all those reasons why you supposedly voted for him. Let\u2019s revisit: -He won\u2019t build a wall -He won\u2019t deport 11-million+ undocumented immigrants -He won\u2019t ban Muslims or create a registry -He won\u2019t be killing the families of terrorists -He won\u2019t appoint a special prospector to investigate, indict and jail Hillary Clinton -He won\u2019t bring back your factory jobs -He won\u2019t cut your taxes -He won\u2019t raise your minimum wage -He won\u2019t repeal/replace Obamacare -He won\u2019t \u201cpunish\u201d women for getting abortions -He won\u2019t appoint socially conservative Supreme Court justices -He won\u2019t overturn Roe v Wade -He won\u2019t shut the EPA or IRS -He won\u2019t be repealing NAFTA -He won\u2019t impose 45% trade tariffs on China -He won\u2019t tear up the Iran nuclear deal -He won\u2019t move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem -He won\u2019t be withdrawing from NATO To be sure, none of the above will disappoint or anger Democrats. The real question is, how will you react when he fails to deliver on his promises? Remember, he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and...",

      "content": " This story was first published in 2012, and has been published every year since. For one day each year, the turkey gets its time to shine. While most of that shining is done quite literally, as the glazed centerpiece of Thanksgiving feasts around the nation, a few fortunate fowl are granted pardons and given a chance to live out their\u00a0not-so-long lives in greener pastures, awkwardly bobbing their heads, crying gobble-gobble and whatever else it is that turkeys do. Those symbolic pardons may make the turkey eaters among us feel somewhat better about stuffing our faces with coma-inducing amounts of gravy-smothered poultry, yet during one such event in 2008, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) managed to tear the mask (or head?) off the whole charade. We\u2019ll call it the greatest turkey-related disaster in the history of politics. Fresh off a defeat in the 2008 presidential election, Palin headed to a turkey farm in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, to pardon a local bird \u2015 a common practice among governors. Palin delivered her prepared remarks over frequent interruptions from clucking birds not as fortunate as the turkey getting the reprieve. She even touted herself as a \u201cfriend to all creatures great and small\u201d before posing for a photo op. What happened next was entirely unexpected. While many had recently learned that Palin could be unpredictable \u2015 even a maverick, perhaps \u2015 Americans couldn\u2019t have foreseen her conducting a lengthy on-camera interview while live birds were being fed into a machine of mass turkey murder mere feet behind her. Palin seemed to unwittingly nail her remarks, commenting on the need to find \u201clevity\u201d in her job as turkey after turkey was decapitated by the metal cone of death in the background. The man shoving the struggling birds into the device even looked up toward Palin and the camera as the governor presciently predicted that the spectacle would invite skepticism. (The goriest moments have been censored in the video above.) Although her office later denied that she\u2019d known what was playing out behind her, Palin was reportedly asked if she wanted that particular backdrop for her interview, to which she replied, \u201cNo worries.\u201d",

But pretty much all the names floating around for that post would make the oil and gas industry happy. (Gage Skidmore/Flickr) BY: SOO RIN KIM While names were announced for a slew of appointments to President-elect Donald Trump\u2018s administration last week, there are still some significant posts left \u2014 like running the Interior Department, which is in charge of wildlife and natural resources. Oil execs and other pro-development types seem to be the leading contenders here, meaning it\u2019s likely that the department will be taking a drastic shift away from its focus of the last few years on conservation and renewable energy. Robert E. Grady: The former George H.W. Bush speechwriter and policy advisor who ran the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s unit on natural resources, energy and science, Grady is best known in the environmental world for his key role in negotiating amendments to push through the Clean Air Act of 1990. Though the administration championed the law for reining in acid rain and toxic pollutants, environmental groups argued that some of the administration\u2019s provisions blunted its effect. Currently a partner at private equity fund Gryphon Investors, Grady has donated a relatively modest $218,667\u00a0to federal politicians, including $5,400 to Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.),\u00a0$1,500 each to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his leadership PAC and $1,000 to Trump this year. In 2012, he donated $7,500 to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and $35,000 his joint fundraising committee. Grady is also a longtime aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a former chairman of the New Jersey Investment Council, overseeing the $81 billion public pension fund. Grady\u2019s name has also surfaced to run the Energy Department or the Environmental Protection Agency. Forrest Lucas: The sponsor of a number of racing events who also won naming rights to the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 home stadium, the founder and president of Lucas Oil is\u00a0a familiar face in his home state Indiana. His appointment would be widely hailed by the oil and gas industry, which has battled conservationists in the Obama administration. Employees of Lucas Oil Products (including Lucas himself) have donated a total of $965,486 since 2002 to federal candidates and committees; this year\u2019s biggest beneficiary was GOP Indiana Rep. Marlin Stutzman,\u00a0who had an unfruitful senatorial campaign. The Indiana oilman has also taken on a big role protecting farmers, ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts from threats posed by \u201canimal rights groups\u201d and \u201canti-farming extremists,\u201d such as the Humane Society of the United States. His 501(c)(4) nonprofit group Protect the Harvest is a driving force of the anti-animal rights effort, spending nearly $1.9 million since 2010. The social welfare group has laid out $246,297 for federal political ads in the past two election cycles, including $53,500 supporting Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) this year. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, Missouri Pork PAC, Missouri Cattlemen Association and Missouri Pork Producers are among the top donors to the nonprofit, and Lucas himself has given it $298,000. Lucas and his wife Charlotte Lucas, who co-founded Lucas Oil, have donated a total of $752,272 over the years, including $197,054 this cycle. Trump\u2019s joint fundraising committee, Trump Victory Fund, got $25,000 of that. Two years ago, Lucas took out a full-page ad\u00a0in the Indianapolis Star\u00a0apologizing for a Facebook post by his wife that read, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t think that atheists (minority),\u00a0muslims\u00a0(minority)n or any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here.\u201d In the apology, Lucas said his wife\u2019s comments were \u201charsh and insensitive,\u201d although he said she did not intend to offend anyone. Harold G. Hamm: The Continental Resources chief executive who just became the 54th richest person in the world with personal net worth of $15.4 billion, Hamm was a key energy policy advisor to Romney four years ago and has played a similar role for Team Trump this year. He was the mastermind in shaping Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to revive the Keystone XL oil pipeline project with TransCanada \u2014 rejected by Obama last year \u2014 with the condition that North Dakota oil get a bigger share of space in the pipeline. Hamm\u2019s Continental Resources is a major player in the North Dakota oil scene. Also being considered for the Energy Department spot, the man Trump calls the \u201cking of energy,\u201d\u00a0holds the view that the U.S. has abundant oil\u00a0 \u201cabundance\u201d view on the oil reserve issue, and has criticized Obama\u2019s focus on domestic renewable energy as indirect support\u00a0for Islamic terrorism by making the United States rely on Middle Eastern oil. The fracking mogul\u00a0and his wife Sue Ann Hamm have donated nearly $1.9 million to federal candidates and committees over the years, including $5,000 to Romney\u2019s campaign and $985,000 to pro-Romney super PAC Restore our Future in 2012. This year, he donated $5,400 to Ryan, $2,600 to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and $1,000 to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), as well as $5,400 to Trump. Meanwhile, tensions have fired up in North Dakota as demonstrators clash with the police over the contested Dakota Access Pipeline, which is\u00a0expected to carry oil obtained from fracking by Hamm\u2019s Continental Resources. Trump himself was\u00a0deeply involved in the pipeline, having invested between $500,000 and $1 million in Energy Transfer Partners, the key player in the project, Trump\u2019s financial disclosure report\u00a0from May 2015 showed. And CEO Kelcy Warren has returned the favor by donating $3,000 to the Trump campaign this year and an additional $100,000 to his joint fundraising committee. Trump dropped most of his investment in the company this summer, leaving only $50,000. Sarah Palin:\u00a0The former Alaska governor might be a long shot for Interior, but the presence of her name on the list is attracting mega-attention nationwide. Putting aside all other controversies revolving around her, we can safely assume which direction the Interior Department would head under Palin: \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d (Wolves, among other animals, might not be thrilled with the appointment, either.) The energy and natural resources sector, led by the oil industry, was Palin\u2019s main financial\u00a0 supporter at the beginning of her state political career in 2002. In the 2006 gubernatorial election, though government employees and individuals from the finance sector topped her donors list, the energy and natural resources sector lead by commercial fishing and oil and gas industries played a key role in her victory. Palin pushed through oil and natural gas development plans during her time in office, including controversial drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; she also signed legislation to grant a pipeline contract to TransCanada. The construction project was cancelled in 2014 after research showed it was inefficient. After the unsuccessful presidential campaign with GOP candidate John McCain in 2008, Palin resigned from the office\u00a0and started SarahPAC. The political action committee has spent a total of $14.8 million over the last four election cycles. This year, the PAC spent about $2.1 million, just $72,500 of which went to federal candidates, including $5,000 to Trump. Nearly $900,000 was spent by the PAC on fundraising. Ray\u00a0Washburne:\u00a0CNBC reported last week that Washburne, a Dallas investor who is currently leading the Trump transition team on commerce, could be next in charge of the country\u2019s federal land and natural resources. Washburn was vice chairman of the 2016 Trump Victory Fund\u00a0and a former Republican National Committee chair. Individuals from\u00a0his company Charter Holdings,\u00a0involved in real estate, restaurants, private equity and energy investments, have donated a total of $517,000 to Republican candidates over last three election cycles. This includes Washburne\u2019s $2,700 to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and another $5,400 to Texas Rep. Pete Sessions this cycle. Overall, the Texas investor and his wife Heather Washburne contributed a total of $579,811 to\u00a0Republican candidates and the Republican party. Robert B. Gillam: The Alaska investor is the latest addition to the rumored interior secretary list according to\u00a0the\u00a0Alaska Dispatch Publishing. Having graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania with Trump in 1968, Gillam said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cI recognized that suddenly it was possible for me to serve in a role that has otherwise been one of career politicians.\u201d Unlike his rivals for the slot, Gillam\u2019s\u00a0federal political contributions over the years have been bipartisan.\u00a0The millionaire financier made his single biggest donation in 2010, when he donated $50,000 to Alaskans Standing Together, a super PAC that spent $1.8 million to secure Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski\u2018s seat in Alaska. He has given $28,250 to national Republican party committees\u00a0and $23,550\u00a0to GOP candidates \u2014 but has also donated $37,000 to the Democratic Party of Alaska and\u00a0$14,300 to Democratic candidates. During the 2016 cycle, he sent $5,000 to GOP Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan\u2018s leadership PAC, True North PAC. Backed by the air transport and railroads industries as well as the Koch brothers, Sullivan\u2019s PAC gave $105,000 to Republican candidates including Ayotte, Blunt and Murkowski.",

      "content": " Tea party standard-bearer Sarah Palin, under consideration to join Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, has just blasted the tax deal the president-elect negotiated with Carrier, condemning it as \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence helped arrange $7 million in Indiana tax breaks over 10 years for Carrier in exchange for the company\u2019s promise to keep about 800 of 1,400 jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico. In addition, Trump threatened to impose a stiff tariff on Carrier products if they sent all of the work across the border. \u201cRepublicans oppose this, remember?\u201d Palin wrote in an op-ed Friday on the Young Conservatives website. \u201cInstead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail. \u201cA business must have freedom to locate where it wishes,\u201d the piece continued. \u201cIn a free market, if a business makes a mistake (including a marketing mistake that perhaps Carrier executives made), threatening to move elsewhere claiming efficiency\u2019s sake, then the market\u2019s invisible hand punishes. Thankfully, that same hand rewards, based on good business decisions.\u201d She warned that \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d which company darlings receive \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d is a \u201challmark of corruption\u201d and \u201csocialism.\u201d A \u201c$20 trillion debt-ridden country can\u2019t afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we\u2019re doomed,\u201d she urged. Palin left wiggle room in the piece for Trump to redeem himself. \u201cGotta have faith that the Trump team knows all of this,\u201d she wrote hopefully, and promised to be the first to dismiss concerns if details of the deal prove her wrong once they\u2019re publicly released. In a bit of cognitive dissonance, Palin also said she was \u201cecstatic\u201d for Carrier workers. \u201cWhat a relief for hundreds of workers. Merry Christmas Indiana!\u201d she gushed. Palin is hardly the only \u201cfree market\u201d Republican disturbed by the deal. The Wall Street Journal issued its own op-ed Thursday called \u201cTrump\u2019s Carrier Shakedown\u201d noting that real job security depends on a company\u2019s strength in the marketplace. \u201cIf the extra costs of staying in Indianapolis erode that business, those workers will lose their jobs eventually in any case,\u201d the Journal warned, adding: \u201cWorkers don\u2019t prosper when politicians force companies to make noneconomic decisions.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has also attacked Trump\u2019s deal, saying it signals to corporations that they can get significant tax breaks as long as they threaten to export jobs. Despite the deal, Carrier is still shifting some production to Mexico, and at least 600 Carrier positions will be cut. Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, will also move ahead with closing a separate Indiana plant and laying off 700 workers. The union at the Carrier factory was cut out of negotiations to save their jobs, Chuck Jones, president of the local chapter of the United Steelworkers union that represents the plant, told The Huffington Post. There was no immediate reaction from Trump on the criticisms from Palin or the Journal. He has touted the deal and this week did a victory tour of the Indianapolis factory.",

      "content": " Now that Thanksgiving is over and the holidays are coming up and everyone\u2019s back to shopping and posting cute pictures of puppies and kittens on Facebook and stopped freaking the fuck out about the election, I thought I would share a story about our home improvement project. Kate and I have been rushing to take care of some projects before Trump ruins everything. Earlier this year, we got into the Made in Minnesota solar lottery, which provides tax credits for buying MN solar panels. When combined with the federal tax credit (which I assume Hair Furor will do away with), the system pays for itself after 7 years, then we\u2019re in the electricity generation business, selling the electricity we generate back to the grid tax-free. We have an old roof, so we decided to replace that as well. Last Saturday, the three-day ordeal of the roof replacement ended, and I realized that I\u2019ve learned a lot about construction. For instance, I hadn\u2019t known that: \u2022 Dropping scraped off shingles three stories onto the garden below is actually good for the plants (\u201cdon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll be fine\u201d); \u2022 Saying about a million times that you want the roof vent placed in the southeast corner to accommodate the solar panels is not the same as actually having the roof vent placed in the southeast corner to accommodate the solar panels; and \u2022 The sound of a roof being installed inches above your head while you sleep is roughly equivalent to the sound of a jackhammer installing a new surface on your brain. That said, with this new knowledge, I now realize that I have about as much relevant experience in construction as our president-elect has in government. I understand there\u2019s an opening for CEO of Trump Corporation, and I\u2019m thinking of applying. I\u2019d do the best job, believe me! One thing I will say is that with all the frustrations of the roofing project (and really, Kate handled most of it, so I don\u2019t have much to complain about), there\u2019s a sense you get when you hire someone to work on your house who knows what they\u2019re doing, a sense of trust in the underlying social compact: you hire them to do some work, they put together a good team to get it done, there will be some inevitable hiccups and frustrations and unpleasantness along the way, but ultimately, you end up with a nice new roof, so whatevs, right? Which brings me to my next subject: Trump - Hair Furor, our Mango Mussolini, the Screaming Cheeto, Orange Fuckhead of Hate, or whatever you prefer (these were the most respectful ways of referring to him I could think of). What has become clear to me is that the people being chosen for Trump\u2019s cabinet are not the ones you\u2019d hire to fix the plumbing; they\u2019re not the ones you would choose to renovate the kitchen, or put on a new roof, or even do a gut job. In fact, they\u2019re not builders at all. They\u2019re the wrecking crew. You don\u2019t pick white supremacist Steve Bannon as your chief strategist because you want to make government work. You don\u2019t pick Jeff Sessions - rejected for a judgeship for being too racist - because you want to enforce the law fairly. You don\u2019t pick Obamacare dismantler Tom Price to run HHS, or public education opponent Betsy Devos to run Education, or global warming hoaxist Scott Pruitt to run EPA, or surgeon \u201cI\u2019m not qualified to run a government agency\u201d Ben Carson to run HUD, because you want to make government better. You hire them to blow it the fuck up. And that\u2019s just the ones who are arguably sane. NSA Director nominee Michael Flynn accused Hillary Clinton of running a pedophile ring out of the back of a pizza parlor in DC (for real); Deputy NSA nominee K.T. McFarland claimed that Hillary Clinton sent helicopters to spy on her; Sarah Palin is under consideration for two positions - Secretary of Interior and Veterans\u2019 Affairs because - why the fuck not, I guess. And don\u2019t even get me started on the irony of potentially nominating David Petraeus - convicted and currently on probation for mishandling classified information - for Secretary of State, after basing an entire campaign around bashing the former Secretary of State for mishandling classified materials far less egregiously (which, as it turns out, wasn\u2019t even true (but then, it\u2019s a Trump world, so what is truth...)). It\u2019s worth noting, btw, that if confirmed, Petraeus would have to report regularly to his probation officer and would likely have travel restrictions, both of which, in any functional administration, might negatively impact the effectiveness of the Secretary of State. So there\u2019s that. But what about the ones that haven\u2019t been filled - Labor, Energy, Agriculture, Interior, etc.? Remember that many of these are departments that Republicans have been saying for years are unnecessary and should be eliminated. Running them with demonstrable incompetence and ensuring their demise would be a feature, not a bug. So for the next few months, while we still have a functioning government, it\u2019s worth taking some time to visualize what is likely to be the new reality. Pick your favorite government program and imagine what it will be like in two years. I\u2019ll start: Medicare, gone; Obamacare, gone; safe drinking water, access to family planning, clean air, the right to marry, safe food, gone gone gone gone gone. Food stamps gone. Job training gone. Public schools gone. Immigrants gone, refugees gone, Muslims gone (if they\u2019re even allowed in in the first place). This is not a worst-case scenario - it is the stated policy agenda of the incoming administration and Congress. This is what we\u2019re up against. So it\u2019s worth considering what comes next. When the demolition crew comes to knock down your house, how do you stop it? I\u2019ll tell you how you stop it - you stand in front of the fucking bulldozer. When the machine becomes so odious that you can no longer run it, how do you make it stop? By throwing yourself on the machine so it can\u2019t run at all. When the men come to take your family away, or your children away, or your friends away, how do you stop it - by standing in front of them, by sheltering them, by protecting them, by throwing your body in front of the machine to make it stop, if that\u2019s what it takes. It\u2019s an uphill battle, it won\u2019t be comfortable, it won\u2019t be easy, but it will be necessary. Visualize resistance.",

      "content": " Since it would appear that President-elect Donald Trump is not going to give up using his Twitter account \u2015 which is probably the one good thing the social media company\u2019s share value has going for it \u2015 it would seem that journalists have a new problem: figuring a way to keep Trump\u2019s insomniac utterances from making a complete hash of their work. That was never more apparent than it was on Tuesday, after Trump joined a pile-on that was already in progress, tweeting out (over the course of two missives): \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it / \u2026\u2026.may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\u201d The story here is that on Monday night, news broke that House Republicans were, as a part of the rules-voting with which every new Congress begins its life on this earth, eyeing significant changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics. As The Huffington Post\u2019s Matt Fuller reported, this included \u201cremoving the entity\u2019s independence, barring it from investigating anonymous complaints and even changing the group\u2019s name.\u201d It would also place the ethics office \u201cunder the \u2018oversight\u2019 of the lenient Ethics Committee,\u201d at which point it would be no longer allowed to \u201crelease information to the public\u201d or \u201cdirectly contact law enforcement without approval.\u201d This touched off a public hue and cry that manifested sufficient pressure to convince House Republicans to abandon this plan. Trump\u2019s Twitter account joined this outpouring of anger very late. But in the rush to cover what Trump\u2019s Twitter account did, some of the basic facts got badly jumbled, leading many news organizations \u2015 as The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent documents here \u2015 to credit Trump with providing the pressure. It was only in the aftermath that people started noticing that Trump didn\u2019t actually come out against the proposed changes. He was merely critical of the timing. (Perhaps because any focus on government ethics in general currently redounds to his detriment?) At any rate, reporters belatedly sought clarification (Trump spokesman Sean Spicer eventually confirmed that the issue was about timing), and the story of how Trump\u2019s mighty tweets caused a reversal of this plan had to be gently walked back. Basically, everyone missed a chance to write a story about how no one in the Trump transition team seems to know how Congress works. (Congress votes on its rules at the outset of its existence, so there isn\u2019t some better \u201ctiming\u201d to be had.) But it\u2019s going to be a long four years for everybody if the media doesn\u2019t figure out the proper way to handle the fact that the president of the United States responds to visual stimulus by impulsively firing off thought-bursts on Twitter. On this subject, Sargent has a lot to say, specifically about writing headlines, so that one doesn\u2019t leave the impression that Trump came out in support of things that he didn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve a more comprehensive solution: Reporters should not cover Trump\u2019s tweets as authentic events. Back when Washington Post reporter David Weigel was writing for the Washington Independent, he faced a similar conundrum with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who by the end of 2009 had taken to using Facebook as her communications medium of choice. As Weigel pointed out in a piece titled, \u201cWhy I Don\u2019t Write About Sarah Palin\u2019s Facebook Posts,\u201d it was a key ingredient in a rather shrewd media strategy: The problem is that Palin has put the political press in a submissive position, one in which the only information it prints about her comes from prepared statements or from Q&As with friendly interviewers. This isn\u2019t something most politicians get away with, or would be allowed to get away with. But Palin has leveraged her celebrity \u2014 her ability to get ratings, the ardor of her fans and the bitterness of her critics \u2014 to win a truly unique relationship with the press. She is allowed to shape the public debate without actually engaging in it. At the time, Palin was engaged in a public row with former Vice President Al Gore over climate change \u2015 and an asymmetric one at that. As Weigel noted: While Gore submitted to an interview, on camera, Palin lent her name to a Facebook post. I say \u201clent her name\u201d because there is really no way of telling if Palin wrote the post \u2014 that\u2019s probably the biggest problem with the way Palin is using the media here, and the reason I choose not to engage with this stuff. Now, it was probably much easier to ignore Palin\u2019s Facebook posts than it is to ignore Trump\u2019s tweets. Palin, obviously, was no longer a political officeholder at the time, whereas Trump is going to be the president. Still, Weigel\u2019s approach is instructive, because we don\u2019t actually know, at any given point, who the actual author of Trump\u2019s tweets are. From time to time, he dictates tweets to aides, who then polish them for consumption. At other times, his aides have revoked his Twitter privileges. Of course, at some point Trump will gain access to \u201c@POTUS,\u201d the legacy Twitter account established by the Obama administration. No matter how Trump uses it, It\u2019s going to become tempting to view tweets from that account as the real deal \u2015 the authentic voice of the White House. You might be inclined to accord that account full faith and credit. Don\u2019t do this! As I said back when the Obama White House first built this infernal contraption, it doesn\u2019t produce authentic events, either: Anyone who thinks that this new outlet is going to be a venue for the president\u2019s unvarnished, sincere opinion needs to get his head examined. And yes, that cute little exchange between Obama and former President Bill Clinton was absolutely a tidy bit of Oval Office kayfabe. Anything that gets posted to the @POTUS account will be vetted [by White House communications staff] within an inch of its life, and anything remotely interesting will be stripped out and watered down. We will really never know if a Trump tweet is stubbed into existence by his own hand, laundered for clarity by an assistant, penned by an aide while channeling his voice, or slow-cooked by the White House communications team. So, with that in mind, why would anyone treat anything on Trump\u2019s Twitter account without several thousand grains of salt? The proper thing to do, if for some reason a Trump tweet seems newsworthy, is to pick up the phone and get in touch with those who actually speak for his administration. Ask them if his outbursts are official White House policy. See if there\u2019s any added nuance, contradictions, walk-backs or work-arounds. Note these distinctions. Track down what the authentic event actually is. Then, tell your readers about it. A really good rule of thumb: Done the right way, any story that begins with Trump tweeting need never actually link back to the tweet itself, because you\u2019ll have reported everything out with official sources and can bring in an official statement. In the end, you\u2019ll produce something that is fair to everyone involved and you won\u2019t have to disentangle that hasty headline, constructed in the fog of social media. As an added bonus: You\u2019ll be sending a message to the incoming administration that you\u2019re not going to be its Twitter stenographer. Guys. It\u2019s Twitter. It\u2019s not really real. It\u2019s just a piece of social media ephemera. Part of reckoning with a future in which a president is going to impulsively tweet is understanding that you, as a reporter, were not in the room to confirm that event. Thus, you should treat Twitter as a matter that requires confirmation. This isn\u2019t rocket science. It\u2019s the job. It\u2019s the same job you perform running down a rumor, or following up on something a source \u2015 even a trusted source! \u2015 mentioned. The mere fact that it\u2019s published as a tweet doesn\u2019t change this. The fact that a president might tweet anything at all should raise suspicions, not settle them. So, to borrow a phrase from Leah Finnegan:\u00a0\u201cVerify, then trust.\u201d As often as is necessary. I can already anticipate a complaint. After all, we live in a world where tweets have become currency, and those little blue check marks are treated as a de facto vouch for any Twitter user\u2019s bona fides. If we were to take these rules for Trump, you might argue, and apply them consistently, we\u2019d be treating the tweets of any politician, celebrity or public figure as inauthentic. We\u2019d be treating the tweets of brands as inauthentic. We\u2019d be treating the tweets of journalists as inauthentic! The material value of a tweet \u2015 indeed the Twitter platform itself \u2015 would be so diminished that it would not have any real world value at all. Right! That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m suggesting. My word, you say that as if it were a bad thing. ~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits \u201cEat The Press\u201d for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast \u201cSo, That Happened.\u201d Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

      "content": " Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor,\u00a0has over 4.7 million \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook.\u00a0Almost 4.3 million people have opted to follow her updates, many of which are not true. Many of Palin\u2019s updates are personal in nature \u2015 like when she shares videos of\u00a0her son Trig\u00a0or blogs written by her daughter Bristol\u00a0\u2015 or feature inspirational stories. But Palin, a former contributor to Fox News,\u00a0also regularly has\u00a0misleading or fake\u00a0posts about news and politics on her Facebook page. On Wednesday, Palin\u2019s page featured a story from the conservative website Breitbart News that claimed President Barack Obama awarded himself a Distinguished Public Service medal from the Department of Defense. That is not true \u2015 Defense Secretary Ash Carter gave the medal to the president. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton\u00a0have previously received the medal, which is described as \u201cthe highest honorary award presented by the Secretary of Defense to non-career Federal employees, private citizens, and foreign nationals.\u201d Recipients of the medal are nominated by heads of the components of the Office of Secretary of Defense, along with secretaries of military departments. The defense secretary makes the final decision. Palin\u2019s page featured a story on Dec. 11 from the website Young Conservatives about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in Michigan. But the so-called voter fraud was actually a problem with decades-old voting machines that failed to properly operate on Election Day,\u00a0The Detroit News reported. Palin\u2019s page has twice linked to a Young Conservatives story with a headline claiming Obama \u201cimposed rules to take $3,000 from every U.S. citizen.\u201d\u00a0He did not. The story cites Conservative Tribune\u2019s report, which reads as follows: Even thought [sic] President Barack Obama only has less than two months left in office, he hasn\u2019t stopped his liberal agenda, and he hasn\u2019t learned that the American people are tired of regulations. American Action Forum reported that America has just passed an important milestone \u2014 the 10-year regulatory burden on Americans has now passed $1 trillion. New Environmental Protection Agency regulations on trucks were what finally pushed the regulation costs over $1 trillion. Put another way, each American now will have to fork over a one-time payment of $3,080 for these new regulations, or an annual cost of about $540. Palin\u2019s page also often features commentary on the media, including a post from Jan. 4 with a link to Young Conservatives\u2019 stories on the most \u201cunder-reported stories of 2016.\u201d That list includes stories of \u201cthe disappearing women,\u201d a phrase they use to refer to the women who accused President-elect Donald Trump of sexual misconduct and were silenced after he repeatedly denied their claims\u00a0and accused them of lying. Palin\u2019s page has addressed the problem of \u201cfake news\u201d multiple times, and questioned Fox News in a post last month. The description of Palin\u2019s Facebook page features information on her political action committee, Sarah PAC,\u00a0so it\u2019s likely someone from that group is actually posting stories to the page. Sarah PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

      "content": " Online trolls have attacked a Washington Post editor over a fake news story falsely stating that she had snapped a photo of Rex Tillerson\u2019s notes during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. The video went viral, with conservatives including former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin jumping on the bandwagon, which incorrectly identified the Post\u2019s homepage editor Doris Truong\u00a0as the supposed offender. Who is this woman and why is she secretly snapping photos of Rex Tillerson\u2019s notes? pic.twitter.com/u3WXM3XHCA But the former president of Asian American Journalists Association\u00a0said she wasn\u2019t even working that day and assumes someone mistook her for another Asian woman. \u201cThe woman at the hearing wasn\u2019t me. I wasn\u2019t there, and I don\u2019t know who she is,\u201d Truong wrote in The Washington Post Thursday. \u201cWhat we have in common is that we\u2019re both women, and we\u2019re both Asian.\u201d The uproar started with supporters of Tillerson,\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0pick to be secretary of state, expressing concern about a video purportedly showing a woman taking photos of papers on the table where Tillerson had been sitting on Wednesday. Bloggers and tweeters determined it was Truong, even though no one contacted her to confirm the allegations. She was hit with dozens of vicious messages overnight on her Twitter and YouTube accounts, as well as on Facebook, Instagram and even voicemail. Trolls called Truong \u201cpathetic\u201d and a \u201csneaky thief.\u201d Some accused her of spying for China, while others called for the Post to fire her. Palin retweeted the misinformation on Thursday evening: After the conservative website Gateway Pundit updated a post to state that the person in the video was not Truong, a few readers apologized to the journalist for their comments. \u201cNot all Trump supporters are mindless and the real truth does matter,\u201d one reader wrote. Truong said in her article that she was \u201cshocked by how quickly the narrative went from someone trying to identify a woman in a video to another person attaching a name to hordes seizing upon that information as the truth.\u201d The woman in the video had not been identified by Friday morning, and Truong isn\u2019t sure that she should be. \u201cWhy are people so quick to look for someone to condemn?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd during the confusion about the woman\u2019s identity, why is it presumed that she is a journalist? Or that taking pictures of notes in an open hearing is illegal?\u00a0Or, for that matter, that she was even taking pictures of Tillerson\u2019s notes?\u201d Truong wants people to take a little bit of care to confirm information. She also pleads that \u201cpeople will give the woman who was at the hearing a chance to explain her actions before questioning her motives.\u201d",

      "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/syndication-2017-the-rich_b_14136272",

      "author": "Marc Berman",
      "content": " Unlike the glut of original scripted programs in primetime - an estimated 500 titles, a new record, are expected in 2017 on the combination of broadcast, cable and the digital outlets - new shows vying for national clearances in syndication at the upcoming National Association of Television Program Executives conference (aka NATPE) are actually few and far between. This should be no surprise, of course. Given the durability of first-run strips like \u201cJudge Judy,\u201d \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d \u201cJeopardy,\u201d \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d not to mention the weekend options, there are just so many time periods to go around. But this does not mean there are no potential opportunities for the next generation of hits in syndication, particularly a concept with proven \u201clegs\u201d in an established category.\n\n\n\nMore Long-Term Successes in First-Run Syndication Than Any Other Platform Year after year, decade after decade, the \u201cpassword\u201d in syndication is...durable. Naturally, the goal for any pending entry is to capitalize on one of the proven genres \u2014 talk, game, court, magazine or reality - with the appropriate content. Done right, the payoff, both in first-run strips and first-run weeklies, can be the type of staying power you do not normally see in any other broadcasting sector. Unlike broadcast and cable, now also competing with the estimated 130 scripted series coming up on the digital streamers this year, stability by the numbers in syndication for the most part this season is an inherent selling point for any distributor in search of clearances. \u201cThe greatest advantage about the syndication landscape, perhaps, is the loyalty by the audience,\u201d said Bill Carroll, Senior Vice President - Director of Content Strategy at Katz Television Group. \u201cViewers are accustomed to certain types of shows, and once they make a commitment to it to shelf -life can be unlimited. This makes the ties to the non-linear world less severe.\u201d \u201cSyndication is often used to effectively subsidize an advertising buy,\u201d added Billie Gold, VP, Director Programming Research, Amplify (a division of Dentsu Aegis). \u201cThese offerings are familiar to the available audience, which is why they tend to last so long. And the distributors know exactly who to target, which is a real advantage for an advertiser looking to reach a specific demographic.  You don\u2019t always have this specific insight elsewhere.\u201d NATPE in 2017 Of course, the NATPE of today is no longer just an outlet for stations, and groups, to acquire syndicated programming. The focus has shifted in great part to new media and technology, both domestically and internationally. And the over-indulgence of yesteryear (how can we forget those mile-long booths and the grand parties?) has been replaced with a more cost-effective atmosphere. But station execs will certainly be on hand in search of new product. There is still no better arena to meet and greet, and conduct business where the right new show, in the appropriate genre, can capitalize on the potential long shelf-life. So, what new series are hoping to build some momentum at NATPE?\n\n\n\nVying for Clearances In the first-run strip department, we have \u201cPage Six TV,\u201d based on the iconic gossip-themed page in the New York Post, which will return to Fox Television Stations (among other potential clearances) following last summer\u2019s three week-test run. Orion Television will premiere \u201cCouples Court,\u201d a new syndicated, half-hour weekday strip  from David Armour, the creator and executive producer of Orion\u2019s \u201cLauren Lake\u2019s Paternity Court.\u201d  The series will feature legal experts and trial attorneys Dana and Keith Cutler as the first-ever married couple to preside over the television courtroom where couples in crisis come to share their stories of cheating. Proposed court strip \u201cPalin Rules,\u201d presided over by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, is also still in contention. A potential one-hour talker from Warner Bros. hosted by Drew Barrymore that began generating buzz last spring has now been put on hold until fall 2018. That is it at the moment. On the weekend front, the options include magic-themed \u201cDon\u2019t Blink\u201d from Associated Television International; Bellum trio \u201cGreat Escapes,\u201d \u201cMysteries of the Unexplained,\u201d and \u201cOriginals,\u201d which explores the remarkable origin of hundreds of the world\u2019s most influential creations; \u201cHollywood Uncut\u201d from Telco, which profiles talent from the land of Tinseltown; and \u201cSherriffs El Dorado County\u201d from production company Foothill 7 TV. \n\n\n\nA New but Proven Option Already in its 3rd successful season on Fox affiliate KTXL in Sacramento, \u201cSheriffs El Dorado County\u201d (aka \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d) taps into the public fascination with crime and punishment, albeit with a bit of a twist. \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d is filmed and edited in true cinema verite style, showing the entire call, up close and personal, through the eyes of the deputy, from intake to final determination. Foothill 7 TV has filmed over 100 of the sheriff office\u2019s deputies performing their duties in order to allow the region to observe transparently the job the El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s office performs daily as they cover their beats. From Lake Tahoe to the original Gold Rush goldfields to the Sacramento line, the audience gets to know each deputy and observe their performance under constantly changing conditions. Given the nightly news reports of various individuals and groups targeting police officers across the country, and the dangers and condemnation each deputy faces, \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d allows the viewer to make a determination, based on the facts and their  knowledge of the deputy being highlighted. \u201cPeople like to witness the process of justice being served, the rough and tumble, chasing down, the handcuffing and ultimate arrest,\u201d said Rob Russo, President of RNR Media Consulting. \u201cThese people like to see people who break the law get arrested and get their due. It is that simple. And this is a show, plain and simple, that will serve that growing interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Key Advantage Unlike other newbies that enter the marketplace from scratch, the inherent advantage of \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d is the documented success, both on Sacramento\u2019s KTXL; and its six-week test run (in March and April, 2016) on 10 additional stations. Now a mainstay on KTXL, \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d has been dominant, to-date, in three time periods: Saturday 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., and Sunday 6 p.m. It has built from its news lead-in. And it has enjoyed demographic success in multiple time periods (and against various off-network sitcoms and non-scripted series). In the 10-market test, \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d (despite facing March Madness on NCAA Basketball) exhibited gains throughout the six weeks. Growth in the metered market households, on average, was 21 percent, according to Nielsen. It also outperformed the April 2015 time period average, including a massive 279 increase in household rating on WTTO in Birmingham. And it delivered a competitive audience in every market, proving the value of the police-reality format. \u201cThis is a one camera shoot; there is no cutting back, which adds to the intensity of the show,\u201d noted Leigh White, Vice President and General Manager of KTXL.  \u201cSheriffs El Dorado has been a solid draw demographically across the board for us, capitalizing on the success all these years of \u201cCops.\u201d It truly is a great show to have on my station.\u201d As justice continues to be served, weekend syndication will have a new member in the category in 2017, \u201cSheriffs El Dorado County.\u201d And stations in the fall of 2018 will also have the option to run it as a strip. Move over, \u201cCops.\u201d \u201cSheriffs EDC\u201d is now on the job.",

      "author": "Paige Lavender",
      "content": " Former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has several websites that regularly feature misinformation labeled as news. Her website, www.sarahpalin.com, features a column called \u201cNews\u201d filled with largely aggregated stories written with a conservative slant. Those stories often feature misinformation and falsehoods \u2015 as was the case with a story published Thursday about President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump. Mary Kate Knorr, the story\u2019s author,\u00a0reported that retailer T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are \u201crumored to be next on the list of stores to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line,\u201d\u00a0despite later referencing another story featuring a spokeswoman for the stores saying otherwise. Both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls deny that they are removing Trump\u2019s clothing.\u00a0The stores sent a note to employees last week instructing them not to remove clothes from the sales floor, but to\u00a0take down featured displays\u00a0and remove signage related to Trump\u2019s line, according to The New York Times. The sarahpalin.com story also falsely indicated that Trump had received the \u201cnews\u201d about T.J. Maxx and Marshalls just 24 hours after Nordstrom had announced its decision to drop her clothing line. That is not the case. Nordstrom had announced\u00a0a full week\u00a0\u2015 not one day \u2015 earlier that it would no longer carry Trump\u2019s brand due poor sales. The company said it told her about the decision in January. The story, but not the headline, was later updated to reflect this. A second story\u00a0about Nordstrom also published on Palin\u2019s website Thursday claimed the store had dropped Trump\u2019s clothing line \u201cearlier today.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s wrong, too. The story, written by Andrew Mark Miller, went on to claim that the company had \u201ccaved to public pressure from the unhinged left and pulled Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion brand from shelves.\u201d \u201cNordstrom has every right to sell whatever they want but it\u2019s a shame that they couldn\u2019t put country before politics and leave the Trump children out of it,\u201d\u00a0it read. Though Nordstrom\u2019s announcement is at least a week old now, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that both stories were published after it was thrust back into the headlines on Wednesday, when President Donald Trump\u00a0said the store was treating his daughter \u201cunfairly.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u00a0called Nordstrom\u2019s decision \u201ca direct attack on [Donald Trump\u2019s] policies in her name.\u201d In response, the department store chain stood by its initial claims that it had decided to drop the line based on poor sales. \u201cOver the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn\u2019t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,\u201d Nordstorm said in a statement. There is a disclaimer on Palin\u2019s website that the articles \u201cDO NOT necessarily reflect the views held by Governor Palin,\u201d but articles from the site are often featured on her Facebook page, which has\u00a04.7 million \u201clikes.\u201d The description of Palin\u2019s Facebook page features information on her political action committee, Sarah PAC,\u00a0so it\u2019s likely someone from that group is posting stories to the page.

      "content": " After White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday refused to discount the possibility that President Donald Trump might name Sarah Palin as the next ambassador to Canada, Twitter exploded with negative comments north of the border. But first to complain were politicians. New Democrat Party member of Parliament Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation it would be difficult to take the former Alaska governor and onetime vice-presidential candidate seriously because she wouldn\u2019t know the truth \u201cif it jumped up and knocked her on the head.\u201d He also compared her to \u201canother Donald Trump.\u201d Another NDP member of Parliament, Charlie Angus, characterized such a choice as insulting, saying it shows \u201chow little\u201d\u00a0Trump and Steve Bannon \u201cthink of Canada.\u201d Then the rest of Canada piled on their Alaska neighbor. Speculation first arose last month after the resignation of ambassador Bruce Heyman, who was appointed by Barack Obama. It kicked up Wednesday when Spicer, pressed specifically on a Palin ambassador appointment at a White House news conference, did not count her out. \u201cWe have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure at some point we will have, soon.\u201d A headline in the Ottawa Citizen warned that Palin could \u201cbring her carnival show here.\u201d Twitter users\u2019 #SarahPalin\u00a0comments ranged from the hilarious to the horrified. Lots made fun of her notorious geographical mistakes (she boasted during the 2008 presidential campaign that you could \u201csee Russia\u201d from Alaska, as evidence of her global experience) and apparent general cluelessness about foreign affairs. Others were mostly stunned. One asked Trump instead to simply bomb the country, and signed the tweet: \u201cAll intelligent life in Canada.\u201d A number of Americans apologized for the potential nomination, with one saying a Palin appointment was \u201cno way to treat a friend.\u201d One reminded Palin to \u201cdrive on the other side of the road.\u201d #sarahpalin potential ambassador to Canada?! pic.twitter.com/PdZiqmsldK",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " An angry Sarah Palin tore into the new proposed Republican health care program as \u201csocialism\u201d on Saturday. In a strident interview with the conservative news outlet Breitbart, she also ripped the \u201cquasi-reformed\u201d proposal as a \u201cRINO plan\u201d \u2014 Republican in name only. She said she expects President Donald Trump to \u201cstep in and fix it.\u201d \u201cRemember this is government-controlled health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of government-run medicine,\u201d the former Alaska governor and one-time vice presidential candidate told Breitbart. \u201cEven in this new quasi-reformed proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That\u2019s the whole premise here.\u201d Palin\u2019s vociferous opposition underscores the problem Republicans face in getting their plan off the ground. Not only do they face millions of furious voters terrified of losing insurance under Obamacare, but they must also grapple with stiff opposition from those on the extreme right who see the program as granting too much insurance aid to struggling Americans. The proposed American Health Care Act would drop a requirement that all Americans have health insurance, just as all drivers are required to have car insurance. The GOP plan instead would allow insurance companies to tack on a 30 percent penalty for people who have opted out of health insurance once they decide to sign up at some point in the future. \u201cThis 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers. It makes you wonder who\u2019s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved,\u201d Palin said. She was apparently referring to insurance companies that would reap the rewards of the penalty while other companies in the private sector would not receive any kind of comparable benefits with the help of government regulation. \u201cIt would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do ...\u00a0let them wear their sponsors [the names of their contributors] plastered all over their three-piece suits ...\u00a0so we know what side they\u2019re on and who they\u2019re actually doing their bidding for,\u201d she added. Palin said she\u2019s not opposed to all aspects of the plan, and is counting on the president to fix its problems. She added: \u201cAs a businessman, he\u2019s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side.\u201d",

Warren used it several times while promoting her book, \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight,\u201d including in a tweet that featured an image taken with the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue on Wall Street: Breitbart News claimed Palin first used the term in 2011 and reported she wasn\u2019t happy about Warren\u2019s use of the phrase.

      "content": " Sarah Palin won\u2019t say whether she experienced or witnessed sexual harassment at Fox News, but she does have a message for the victims: If you don\u2019t speak out when it happens, don\u2019t complain about it later. During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead,\u201d Palin hinted that she wasn\u2019t happy during her time as a Fox News contributor but would not divulge details \u2015 even when asked about Fox News\u2019 corporate culture in the age of Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201cI think the key there is that I used to be with Fox. The corporate culture there obviously has to change,\u201d the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate said. \u201cWomen don\u2019t deserve, they shouldn\u2019t have to put up with any intimidating workspace.\u201d Then Palin turned her focus on the women who made accusations of sexual harassment, telling them that it\u2019s their responsibility to quit their jobs and change the workplace culture. \u201cIf a woman believes that she is being intimidating and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through,\u201d Palin told Tapper. \u201cAs a strong woman,\u201d she added, \u201cI say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change.\u201d Palin is right: More women should speak out against workplace harassment. But women don\u2019t stay silent about harassment because they\u2019re not strong women. As the past has shown,\u00a0reporting abuse isn\u2019t as easy as telling on your boss so that the problem will go away. Women don\u2019t report sexual harassment for a number of reasons, including shame, fear of retribution, fear of losing their source of income and fear of not being believed.\u00a0In fact, a 2015 survey found that 71 percent of women\u00a0ages 18 to 34 did not report workplace sexual harassment. And when they do report it, victims sometimes end up with more problems, as in the case of Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer who detailed the chaos surrounding her sexual harassment complaint to Uber\u2019s human resources department in a February blog post. Perhaps Palin should take some notes from professor Anita Hill, the pioneer in the fight against workplace harassment who famously testified against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991\u00a0to much scrutiny and insult. \u201cThe problem with sexual harassment isn\u2019t just because people behave badly,\u201d Hill said in a recent interview with USA Today. \u201cThe problem is our inability to develop productive responses to it, and that exists because of our culture that accepts it, because that culture then gets built into how we approach solutions to it.\u201d Hill added: \u201cIt gets built into the choices we make about who can be believed. And even when we find sexual harassment exists, the solutions are very often to move the women who have complained to other positions.\u201d",

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the writer of a June 14 editorial to testify at a hearing scheduled for Aug. 16. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is considering the Times\u2019 request to dismiss the lawsuit, The Associated Press reported. A Times spokesperson told HuffPost the paper \u201cwill be providing the testimony that the judge has ordered.\u201d Times editorials reflect the opinions of the publication\u2019s editorial page, and are typically attributed to the \u201cThe Editorial Board\u201d rather than carrying an individual writer\u2019s byline. The Times on Thursday acknowledged that Bennet, who oversees the section, authored the editorial in question. Palin, a former Alaska governor, Republican vice presidential nominee and Fox News personality, sued the Times in June after an editorial about the Virginia mass shooting that wounded Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) linked Palin to the 2011 attack that disabled then-Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D). The Times editorial asserted that before the Arizona shooting, Palin\u2019s \u201cpolitical action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\u201d The map actually showed electoral districts under cross hairs, not specific Democratic politicians. The Times corrected the editorial on June 15 and issued an apology on Twitter. Still, Palin filed a lawsuit later that month, claiming the Times published information it \u201cknew to be false.\u201d The Times promised to \u201cdefend against any claim vigorously.\u201d Palin\u2019s attorneys filed papers last month seeking the correspondence of more than 20 Times journalists.

      "author": "Michael Calderone",
      "content": " New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet testified Wednesday that he did not intend to draw a \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between a map distributed by Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee and the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.). Bennet said he was looking at the overall political climate and exploring the line between heated rhetoric and incitement\u00a0in a\u00a0June 14,\u00a02017, editorial\u00a0that referenced the Palin map. The editorial was written in response to the congressional baseball practice shooting that morning in which Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and others were wounded. The editor\u2019s testimony is part of a court hearing in Manhattan to determine if Palin\u2019s lawsuit against the Times raises \u201csufficient allegations of actual malice\u201d to proceed. In other words, can Palin even plausibly argue that the Times didn\u2019t just make mistakes, but acted with malice toward her or with reckless disregard for the truth? U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has said he intends to rule later this month on the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss the suit. The June 14 editorial quickly drew criticism and prompted two corrections. The editorial stated incorrectly, as the Times acknowledged, that \u201cthe link to political incitement was clear\u201d\u00a0in the Giffords case. In fact, there\u00a0is no evidence\u00a0that the shooter, Jared Loughner, was targeting Giffords because of the map \u2015 or that he had ever seen it. The editorial also wrongly asserted that the former congresswoman and 19 other Democrats were shown in the cross hairs on the Palin map.\u00a0The Times corrected the piece to note that the cross hairs appeared over electoral districts, not specific politicians. On the witness stand, Bennet recalled drawing some inspiration for the editorial from colleague Thomas Friedman\u2019s August 2016 column tying together then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s talk of a \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d solution to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The Friedman column is not mentioned in the June 14 editorial, titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics.\u201d Bennet said Wednesday that the article was intended to hit three main points: \u201cthe horror\u201d of the Scalise shooting, the paper\u2019s position on \u201csensible gun control\u201d and concerns about heated political rhetoric. Bennet, who returned to the Times last year as editorial page editor, said he asked Washington-based editorial writer Elizabeth Williamson, the original author of the piece, to revisit the paper\u2019s stances around the 2011 Giffords shooting. Williamson filed a draft to Bennet around 5 p.m. by his account, and he significantly rewrote it before publication. Bennet said he didn\u2019t discuss the edits with Williamson prior to publication because \u201cdeadlines were looming.\u201d Much of Wednesday\u2019s hearing centered on establishing what information Bennet had known while writing the editorial. Bennet said he had not read the 2011 editorials that a Times researcher sent to Williamson as she prepared the first draft of the piece or a 2011 ABC News article to which the online version of the Times editorial linked. Bennet also said he had not read a June 14 news article by Times reporter Alexander Burns that mentioned how \u201cno connection\u201d was ever established between the Palin map and the Giffords shooting. Bennet said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know one way or another\u201d at the time of publication whether there was an established link between the Palin map and the 2011 shooting. Palin attorney Ken Turkel also tried to establish whether Bennet had recalled specific coverage of the Giffords shooting when writing the June 14 editorial, presumably to determine whether the editor should have known any particular information to be false prior to publication. For instance, Turkel asked if Bennet recalled a 2011 dispute between commentator Andrew Sullivan \u2015 whose \u201cDaily Dish\u201d blog was then published by The Atlantic \u2015 and a Financial Times writer over linking Palin to the Giffords shooting. Bennet, who was The Atlantic\u2019s top editor at the time, said he didn\u2019t recall the matter when he was rewriting the Times editorial. He pointed out that Sullivan \u201chad editorial control of The Daily Dish\u201d and didn\u2019t need to report such matters to him. Turkel also asked Bennet if he\u2019d recalled, while reworking the editorial,\u00a0that Palin had endorsed the GOP challenger to his brother, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), in that year\u2019s election. \u201cIf I had known that, I didn\u2019t remember it,\u201d the editor said, while adding that he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Palin backed the Republican candidate. Judge Rakoff asked both sides to respond in writing to Wednesday\u2019s hearing and said it was still to be determined if Williamson, who was unavailable this week, would need to testify in the pretrial proceeding.",

      "content": "(Reuters) - A lawsuit against the New York Times by former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who claimed the newspaper had defamed her in an editorial linking her to a 2011 mass shooting, was dismissed by a federal judge on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said that while the June editorial may have contained errors, it was not plausible those errors were made maliciously, which a public figure like Palin must prove to win a defamation lawsuit. \u201cNegligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not,\u201d Rakoff wrote in his 26-page decision. Lawyers for Palin could not immediately be reached for comment. Palin, the former Alaska governor who was Republican presidential candidate John McCain\u2019s running mate in an unsuccessful 2008 campaign, sued the Times in June, seeking in excess of $75,000 in damages. The lawsuit concerned a June 14 editorial about a shooting at a Virginia baseball field that injured four people including U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican. The editorial sought to link that shooting to a trend of political violence, recalling a shooting in Arizona in 2011 by Jared Lee Loughner that targeted U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people. Before that shooting, the editorial said, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map that \u201cput Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.\u201d The newspaper subsequently issued a series of corrections, saying no link had been established between political rhetoric and Loughner\u2019s actions. It also corrected its description of the map, saying it depicted electoral districts, not Giffords and individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath crosshairs. James Bennet, the editor of the New York Times editorial board, testified at a hearing earlier this month he did not look at the map or extensively review the Times\u2019 coverage of the 2011 shooting while editing the article. However, Rakoff ruled on Tuesday, that was not enough to establish Bennet wrote the editorial knowing it was false, or with reckless disregard for its falsity, as Palin would have to prove. Holding public figures to that standard in defamation cases, the judge said, was necessary \u201cif political journalism is to achieve its constitutionally endorsed role of challenging the powerful.\u201d Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli",

While most of that shining is done quite literally, as the glazed centerpiece of Thanksgiving feasts around the nation, a few fortunate fowl are granted pardons and given a chance to live out their\u00a0not-so-long lives\u00a0in greener pastures, awkwardly bobbing their heads, crying gobble-gobble and whatever else it is that turkeys do. Those symbolic pardons may make the turkey eaters among us feel somewhat better about stuffing our faces with coma-inducing amounts of gravy-smothered poultry, yet during one such event in 2008, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) managed to tear the mask (or head?) off the whole charade. We\u2019ll call it the greatest turkey-related disaster in the history of politics. Fresh off a defeat in the 2008 presidential election, Palin\u00a0headed to a turkey farm\u00a0in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, to pardon a local bird \u2015 a common practice among governors. Palin delivered her prepared remarks over frequent interruptions from clucking birds not as fortunate as the turkey getting the reprieve. She even touted herself as a \u201cfriend to all creatures great and small\u201d before posing for a photo op. What\u00a0happened next\u00a0was entirely unexpected. While many had recently learned that Palin could be unpredictable \u2015 even a maverick, perhaps \u2015 Americans couldn\u2019t have foreseen her conducting a lengthy on-camera interview while live birds were being fed into a machine of mass turkey murder mere feet behind her. Palin seemed to unwittingly nail her remarks, commenting on the need to find \u201clevity\u201d in her job as turkey after turkey was decapitated by the metal cone of death in the background. The man shoving the struggling birds into the device even looked up toward Palin and the camera as the governor presciently predicted that the spectacle would invite skepticism. (The goriest moments have been censored in the video above.) Although her office later denied that she\u2019d known what was playing out behind her, Palin was reportedly asked if she wanted that particular backdrop for her interview, to which she replied, \u201cNo worries.\u201d",

      "content": " As California officially became a \u201csanctuary state\u201d at the start of the new year, fake signs with anti-immigrant messages appeared near the state\u2019s borders. \u201cOfficial sanctuary state. Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome!\u201d the signs read. \u201cDemocrats Need The Votes!\u201d The messages had been\u00a0papered over\u00a0existing signs, California Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Dinger told HuffPost on Wednesday. They referred to a new law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D)\u00a0in October and effective Jan. 1,\u00a0that\u00a0limits local law enforcement\u2019s cooperation\u00a0with federal immigration officials and prohibits police from generally inquiring into people\u2019s immigration status.\u00a0The California Values Act does not, however, bar police from working with immigration officials in the cases of people convicted of a wide range of felonies. The signs suggested that undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals. Conservative leaders, including President\u00a0Donald Trump, have repeatedly and\u00a0falsely\u00a0portrayed\u00a0immigrants as more likely to commit criminal acts. Trump and others have\u00a0pointed to MS-13\u00a0\u2015 a\u00a0gang started in Los Angeles\u00a0that spread to other U.S. cities and to Central America \u2015 as a reason for stronger immigration enforcement. Five of the prank signs were reported around the state, but Caltrans employees have found and taken down only two, spokesman Dinger said.\u00a0One on I-15 near the Nevada border was removed on Monday, and another on I-40 near the Arizona border came down Tuesday. Caltrans was not able to locate at least three other signs reported near the Oregon and Arizona borders. Caltrans did not know who was behind the signs, Dinger said, and would not be investigating the incident as it is not a law enforcement agency. Photos of the signs were circulated largely by conservative accounts on Twitter, with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeting about them and other apparent opponents of the sanctuary law appearing amused by the prank. California now a \u2018Sanctuary State\u2019 CLICK to see this hilarious sign somebody posted. #tcot #P2 #BuildTheWall #MAGA https://t.co/KoF7jA2XNA There are an estimated\u00a02.3 million undocumented immigrants in California.\u00a0Before the statewide law went into effect, several major cities there, including San Francisco, already had their own sanctuary policies. Critics of sanctuary laws, including\u00a0anti-immigration hard-liners like Trump, argue that limiting local law enforcement\u2019s cooperation with federal immigration officials makes cities more dangerous. Supporters say that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with local police.",

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " Sarah Palin never said \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d and George W. Bush didn\u2019t wave at Stevie Wonder. But political myths like these have ways of sticking in the public memory and distorting history. When it comes to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, rumors have circulated since the early months of the conflict that Washington\u2019s original name for the war was \u201cOperation Iraqi Liberation.\u201d\u00a0After the war\u2019s architects realized that name produced the embarrassing acronym \u201cOIL,\u201d they quickly changed the official title to \u201cOperation Iraqi Freedom.\u201d In reality, however, there is no public record of Operation Iraqi Liberation as the official U.S. label, and no evidence that it was ever seriously considered. So, how did this story start? The story of \u201cOperation Iraqi Liberation\u201d is mild enough to be believable. It also neatly fits two prominent antiwar narratives: that the invasion was primarily aimed at capturing Iraq\u2019s oil reserves, and that George W. Bush\u2019s administration was full of morons. Perhaps because it sounds plausible, the \u201cOIL\u201d story doesn\u2019t just live in YouTube conspiracy videos and on internet message boards.\u00a0It has appeared in articles\u00a0in major newspapers and books on the Iraq war, and over the years has popped up in letters to the editor columns.\u00a0But the story is always unsourced or attributed to anonymous military historians. It has a friend-of-a-friend-told-me quality any time it\u2019s mentioned. The anecdote appeared as early as August 2003, just months after the start of the conflict. An Aug. 13 Washington Post article\u00a0covering a series of U.S. military raids in Iraq called \u201cOperation Ivy Lightning\u201d notes that mission\u2019s regrettable \u201cOIL\u201d acronym, and mentions rumors that military officials earlier that year avoided naming the war Operation Iraqi Liberation. On the afternoon of March 24, just days after the U.S launched a barrage of missiles at Baghdad to kick off the war, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer held a briefing with the media. Fleischer gave\u00a0a report\u00a0on the president\u2019s day and his phone calls with foreign leaders. But a few sentences into his briefing, he stumbled on the name of the war, and said \u201cOperation Iraqi, uh, Liberation.\u201d Which brings us to Jay Leno. One day after Fleischer botched the war\u2019s name, Leno taped the 51st episode of his 11th season as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d the top-rated program on late-night television that year. His guests that night included Hillary Swank, Chris Rock and musician Sean Paul. Like every late-night host at the time, Leno\u2019s opening monologues were a deluge of Iraq war jokes. Many of these from the March 25 show involved cringeworthy puns \u2015\u00a0\u201cYou think right about now, Saddam Hussein is suffering from Iraq-tile dysfunction?\u201d \u2015 and topical references \u2015 \u201cNot only do we have the Iraqis on the run, but late today, two of the Dixie Chicks surrendered.\u201d Then there was this: \u201cIn more serious news, the war continues in Iraq. They\u2019re calling it \u2018Operation Iraqi Freedom.\u2019 They were going to call it \u2018Operation Iraqi Liberation,\u2019 then they realized, uh-oh, that spells \u2018OIL.\u2019\u201d Given the show\u2019s references to daily events in Iraq, it\u2019s likely Leno\u2019s writers were watching Fleischer\u2019s briefings, or at least seeing news reports about them. A Leno joke from April 3 even mentions Fleischer by name, according to a database of late-night jokes about the Iraq war compiled by Michel M. Haigh and Aaron Heresco for\u00a0a study\u00a0published in Mass Communication and Society Journal. The \u201cOIL\u201d joke was popular, or obvious enough that it was soon repeated outside of late-night television. When New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof\u00a0held a contest\u00a0in November 2003 to find a better name for Operation Iraqi Freedom, a number of the 4,000 entries he received included the suggestion of Operation Iraqi Liberation. A representative for Fleischer did not respond to multiple HuffPost requests for clarification on why the former press secretary might have used the name, which he repeated during\u00a0a briefing\u00a0on April 1, 2003. Jay Leno\u2019s publicist did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. It\u2019s impossible to definitively say if Leno and Fleischer are the source of the \u201cOIL\u201d story, but what is certain is that the war was never officially named Operation Iraqi Liberation.\u00a0There\u2019s also no apparent documentation that suggests \u201cOIL\u201d was ever a real contender in the naming process, if it was brought up at all. Naming a military operation is a convoluted process. United States Central Command officials propose possible titles, in accordance with restrictions laid out in the manual for the military\u2019s \u201cCode Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System.\u201d The Joint Chiefs of Staff then selects a name, which is sent to the secretary of defense for approval. The George W. Bush administration announced the Iraq war\u2019s official title, \u201cOperation Iraqi Freedom\u201d\u00a0on March 20, 2003, according to a Scripps Howard News Service\u00a0article\u00a0published the same day.\u00a0The operation had no individual title before that, but fell under the umbrella of the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan \u2015 \u201cOperation Enduring Freedom.\u201d The U.S. Army War College has no record of the name \u201cOperation Iraqi Liberation\u201d in any of its literature, including an upcoming U.S. Army Operation Iraqi Freedom study group history of the war, according to an official there. \u201cI would not be surprised if that Liberation name got thrown around when the operational name was being discussed in D.C., but I cannot find any reference it was ever seriously considered,\u201d\u00a0said Conrad Crane, chief of historical services for the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Joint Chiefs issued an even stronger denial. \u201cThere is no record on the Joint Staff of any other name used or considered for \u2018Operation Iraqi Freedom,\u2019\u201d said Richard R. Osial, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs. Several\u00a0other military historians and Iraq war experts contacted by HuffPost all either said they were unaware of the \u201cLiberation\u201d story, or had heard it but never saw any proof.",

      "subtitle": "Gina Haspel\u2019s dark past makes her a complicated figure for feminists to support.",
      "author": "Emily Peck",
      "content": " The world desperately needs more women leaders, but feminists don\u2019t have to love and champion each and every woman who lands in a position of power. This week, Pres. Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If the Senate confirms her, she will be the first woman to run the CIA in its 70-year history. A female groundbreaker is something to celebrate, right? But Haspel, a veteran CIA operative who\u2019s been with the agency for more than 30 years, comes with controversy. During the Bush years, after the attacks of Sept. 11, Haspel ran a \u201cblack site\u201d prison in Thailand that conducted so-called enhanced interrogation \u2015 \u00a0torture \u2015 that\u2019s since been exposed, called out and halted. There are also charges that she participated in covering up some of these activities. Many civil rights advocates have already decried her nomination. And because of the secretive nature of the CIA, the extent of her involvement remains murky. Pres. Trump made sure to brag that Haspel was the first woman chosen to lead the CIA, and some of his staff amplified the point. But considering Haspel\u2019s dark past, it\u2019s not at all clear that her elevation would be anything like a win for women. \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t about wildly agreeing with all women,\u201d Michelle Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of Exeter in England who studies gender and leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s about equality.\u201d Typically, the idea that women each be judged on their individual merits is an argument that conservative women make without much fuss. From the right, this view lines up with a belief in the ascendance of individuality. The argument was endlessly rehashed during the presidential election when women on both sides of the aisle proclaimed that they didn\u2019t have to support Hillary Clinton just because she was a woman. \u201cWomen are individuals and can think for themselves and ought to,\u201d said Mona Charen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great day when people react to a woman based on her individual qualities.\u201d The issue of whether or not to celebrate a pioneering woman regardless of her policies isn\u2019t complicated for Charen. A longtime conservative, who chose not to work for George H.W. Bush because he was too much of a \u201csquish,\u201d she doesn\u2019t necessarily think it matters that there are so few women leaders in politics or business. \u201cWomen should do what they want to do,\u201d said Charen, who has a book coming out this summer called Sex Matters:\u00a0How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love and Common Sense. \u201cIf they want to be leaders, they should be,\u201d she said. If not, that\u2019s OK, too. Charen, who made a name for herself recently by speaking her mind about Republican hypocrisy at a conservative gathering, noted that Haspel has a strong reputation for competence and is fairly widely respected. (A rarity considering the caliber of those in the Trump orbit these days.) Charen\u2019s been making the case for women to be judged individually throughout her career with little controversy. However, when progressives, who are typically more focused on women\u2019s rights, don\u2019t automatically celebrate every woman leader, there is more backlash. It really confuses some conservatives when progressive feminist women don\u2019t automatically support every big-name female leader. But that reveals a naked misunderstanding or indifference to women\u2019s rights \u2015 a presumption that all us girls need is to see a woman in power and the feminist project ends there. You need only look back to the uproar around Sarah Palin in 2008 to see the same issues crop up. Republicans tried to gin up enthusiasm for Palin, simply because she was a woman \u2015 a way to draw votes from frustrated women who had supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid for the Democratic nomination.\u00a0They didn\u2019t seem to realize that those women cared about actual policies and ideas, too. It\u2019s not enough that a candidate wear a skirt; she must also espouse policies and ideas that empower the people who wear skirts. Palin did not. \u201cThe McCain campaign is cynically trying to recreate the excitement that surrounded Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy,\u201d wrote Jessica Valenti in The Guardian at the time. \u201cBelieving that all women want is ... another woman.\u201d Kellyanne Conway was the first female presidential campaign manager to win an election. Fox News\u00a0a while back tried to argue that feminists should therefore love her. Feminists, under this rationale, are also supposed to applaud Sarah Huckabee Sanders for simply being a working mother with a high-profile role. But it\u2019s tough to get psyched about the women in Trump\u2019s orbit. They not only support and enable a man accused multiple times of sexual assault, but who is also openly hostile to policies and positions that would help women. There are a few wrinkles here that probably help add to the confusion on the right. First, in a collective sense we do want to simply see more women in power. Gender equality \u2015 generally \u2015 leads to more fair outcomes for women. Research has shown that the empowerment of more women can lead to more opportunities for women \u2015 new kinds of jobs, pathways to promotion, etc. More women leaders mean that more girls get female role models to look up to and emulate. You have to see it to be it, the argument goes. More women in power also can lead to a reduction in gender discrimination and an increase in pro-women policies, too. We saw this in the fight to keep Obamacare, a policy with huge benefits for women, in place last year \u2015 it was female Republican senators who kept health care alive. There\u2019s even some research that shows that more women in power leads to a reduction in sexual harassment. It is female senators \u2015 on both sides \u2015 who are pushing for paid leave laws right now. Second, feminists are typically inclined to call out sexism, no matter the target. That means they\u2019ve objected to the misogynistic portrayals of Conway, Sanders and Palin\u00a0\u2014 even while disagreeing with their policies and positions. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Haspel faces a sexist, gendered critique in the coming weeks. She\u2019s expected to face tough questioning over her role in the CIA torture program at her confirmation hearing, which is set for April. She\u2019s already been called \u201cthe queen of torture.\u201d Because there are so few women at the top of organizations, the ones who do ascend are judged not just on their merits \u2015 but through the lens of their gender. When a female leader fails, that\u2019s almost always a ding for all women, said Ryan, who is one of the researchers who coined the term \u201cGlass Cliff,\u201d after finding that women were more likely to be thrust into leadership positions at organizations that were already imperiled. It\u2019s possible Haspel\u2019s involvement in the CIA\u2019s program will be judged more harshly because women are often expected to somehow be more moral, empathetic and caring than men: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect women to be involved in torturing people,\u201d Ryan said.\u00a0Would a man be called out in the same way facing the same charges, she asked. (It recalls the way Lynndie England became the face of the horrifying story of torture in Iraq, even as there were so many others involved and making the decisions that enabled her.) Not everyone is that worried about sexism and Haspel. Now that she\u2019s shattered the glass ceiling, Haspel should be judged on her merits, said Juliette Kayyem, former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a lecturer at the Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThere\u2019s not a female approach to homeland security,\u201d said Kayyem, who worked under Janet Napolitano during the Obama administration. Interestingly, Kayyem also pointed out that it\u2019s actually been easier for women to reach the top in national security \u2015 Kirstjen M. Nielsen runs DHS currently \u2015 than break through at an operational level. Rank and file agents and officers are still more likely to be men at the CIA, Kayyem said: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to be in a room where senior leadership is more diverse than the agents and investigators.\u201d We can applaud Haspel for being the first,\u00a0Kayyem said. \u201cBut we need to know why we\u2019re applauding it. She is a woman who ought to now be judged as we would want a man to be judged.\u201d Or, in other words, she should be judged as we would want any human to be. That\u2019s equality.",

He said he \u201cdid not know Sacha Cohen or that a Showtime TV series was being planned to embarrass, humiliate, and mock not only Israel, but also religious conservatives such as Sarah Palin, Joe Walsh, and Dick Cheney.\u201d He then went after Cohen directly. \u201cI don\u2019t need Sacha Cohen to tell me who America is, but I can tell him that America is a proud Nation which sprang from humble beginnings and a strong belief in God, virtue, and morality,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAs an American, I would never hide my identity and deceive others only to mock and ridicule them as this Showtime Series is designed to do.\u201d Moore then suggested he might take legal action against Cohen and the Showtime network, while alluding to his other controversial lawsuits against women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. \u201cI am involved in several court cases presently to defend my honor and character against vicious false political attacks by liberals like Cohen.

The veteran journalist told\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter that he was \u201cinterviewed\u201d by a man in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank. Koppel\u2019s description of the individual sounds a lot like the person former Fox News pundit and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin described earlier this week. Both now suspect the man asking them questions was Baron Cohen, heavily disguised. But unlike Palin and former Alabama judge Roy Moore, Koppel seemed unfazed by the incident. \u201cEverybody loves seeing well-known people get duped,\u201d Koppel told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI relish it too, when it\u2019s done well.\u201d The journalist said he realized fairly quickly that \u201csomething was really wrong\u201d\u00a0when the man\u00a0\u201cinterviewing\u201d him questions kept asking about President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size, rather than the line of questions the journalist was told the conversation would tackle.\u00a0Koppel added that he did not sign a release form. Koppel told The Hollywood Reporter he agreed to the sit down after receiving an email from a producer claiming to work on a six-episode Showtime project that would feature \u201cdistinguished experts in science and public policy, highlighting the brightest and most reputable minds on today\u2019s most important topics.\u201d Baron Cohen\u2019s Showtime series \u201cWho Is America?\u201d has been getting a ton of attention this week as high-profile figures have come out admitting they were duped.

Moore, who threatened legal action against Showtime and Baron Cohen, also said he was prepared to defend America against the comedian. The admissions follow a teaser trailer Baron Cohen tweeted on Sunday that included a clip of former Vice President Dick Cheney signing \u201ca waterboard kit\u201d at the request of an off-camera interviewer, who is presumably the U.K. comedian disguised in character. \u201cWho Is America?\u201d will debut on Showtime on Sunday, July 15.",

On Monday, the company released\u00a0a statement defending the comedian\u00a0and star of its new comedy series \u201cWho Is America?\u201d after former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin claimed that Baron Cohen \u201cduped\u201d her into an interview by pretending to be a disabled war veteran named Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D. It\u2019s an accusation that Baron Cohen has publicly denied, albeit in character. Last week Ruddick\u2019s Twitter account said, \u201cI did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service \u2015 not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once \u2015 when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property.\u201d In its more sober response this week, Showtime said: There has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the Showtime comedy series Who Is America? Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. The premium cable network then pointed to Baron-Cohen-as-Ruddick\u2019s interview of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the first episode. Sanders asked Ruddick if he was disabled. \u201cHe stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy,\u201d Showtime wrote. The network said that in dealing with Palin, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a U.S. military veteran and never wore any military apparel of any kind \u201cduring the booking process or during the filming of her interview.\u201d Showtime also noted that Baron Cohen did not appear in a wheelchair. Last week the former Alaska governor published a scathing post on her website and her\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0describing her experience with Baron Cohen\u2019s \u201cevil, exploitive, sick \u2018humor.\u2019\u201d\u00a0She called on the former \u201cBorat\u201d star, Showtime and CBS (Showtime\u2019s parent company) to \u201cdonate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d Disgraced former Alabama senatorial candidate\u00a0Roy Moore also claimed last week that he was conned into an interview with Baron Cohen and accused the comedian of \u201ctrickery, deception and dishonesty.\u201d A\u00a0#BoycottShowtime campaign has been\u00a0launched on Twitter. This week, a billboard appeared across the street from CBS studios in Los Angeles, per the Hollywood Reporter. The billboard, which was reportedly created by a \u201cconservative street artist,\u201d reads: \u201cSacha Baron Cohen Walks Away With a Hit ... and a touch of stolen valor. Who Is America? Sat, 9pm. CBS.\u201d Not every public personality who was interviewed by Baron Cohen as Ruddick has lashed out after discovering that they were misled. Ted Koppel admitted to being fooled by Baron Cohen last week as well. The veteran journalist said he had a feeling that something was off when the man who was interviewing him \u2014 whom Koppel described as sitting in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank \u2014 kept asking him about the crowd size at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration rather than questions pertaining to the subject matter Koppel was told they\u2019d discuss.",

A day after TMZ\u00a0leaked the news that Bristol Palin would officially be joining the long-running MTV reality show \u201cTeen Mom OG,\u201d the 27-year-old mother of three confirmed the news on Instagram. In the post, Palin can be seen posing with her kids as a small film crew stands behind her. \u201cI am excited to join MTV\u2019s \u2018Teen Mom OG.\u2019 I look forward to sharing my experiences and hope that I can help others on their journey,\u201d she captioned the post. An MTV spokesperson also confirmed the news to HuffPost. Palin will be replacing former cast member Farrah Abraham, who left the show last season. Abraham claims the show let her go because she is an adult entertainer. She filed a lawsuit against the network\u2019s parent company, Viacom, accusing it of engaging in sex- and gender-based discrimination. Viacom responded by saying Abraham\u2019s \u201cclaims are without merit.\u201d Palin, the eldest daughter of former Alaska Gov.\u00a0Sarah Palin\u00a0(R), made headlines in 2008 when she got pregnant with her first child, Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston, at age 17. Sarah Palin announced her daughter\u2019s pregnancy during her 2008 vice presidential campaign with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Since then, the younger Palin has had two more children \u2014 daughters Sailor Grace, 2, and Atlee Bay, 1 \u2014 with Dakota Meyer, whom she married in 2016. In 2018, Meyer, 30, filed for divorce, citing \u201cdiscord or conflict of personalities.\u201d Yet Palin and Meyer\u00a0still post family photos of each other on social media. MTV did not confirm to HuffPost whether Sarah Palin will be a presence on the reality show. The series typically features cast members\u2019 families on camera, so it\u2019s possible the former vice presidential candidate will make an appearance. As for what audiences can expect during the next season of \u201cTeen Mom OG,\u201d a quick gander at\u00a0Bristol Palin\u2019s blog\u00a0shows that her interests include acts of kindness, gun ownership and anti-abortion policy.",

      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " It was one of Sen. John McCain\u2019s finest political moments. At a rally for his presidential bid late in 2008 campaign, an audience member backing the Arizona Republican tells him she doesn\u2019t trust his opponent, then-Sen. Barack Obama and insists that the Illinois Democrat is an Arab. McCain didn\u2019t let her finish. Instead, he shook his head, took the microphone away from her and did something that would have seemed unimaginable during the most recent presidential election: He politely defended his opponent. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign issue is all about,\u201d he said, prompting applause from some other audience members at the gathering in Minnesota. The short exchange was a shining moment for McCain that gained attention at the time.\u00a0Instead of indulging in his supporter\u2019s falsehood, he corrected her and showed grace toward his political foe. And it wasn\u2019t an isolated moment. At the same rally, the crowd earlier had booed McCain\u2019s response to another supporter who said that Obama \u201ccohorts with domestic terrorists\u201d\u00a0and that Americans would have to fear an Obama presidency. McCain said Obama was a \u201cdecent person\u201d and that there would be no reason to be scared if he won the White House. McCain displayed character and civility that day, as he showed similarly throughout much of his military and political career. Clips from that rally had periodically resurfaced even before his death, as he\u00a0publicly feuded with President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2015 who in his short political career has become known for mocking and insulting his opponents and encouraging his supporters to do the same. The moments were guaranteed to be shared again following his\u00a0death on Saturday. Still, context is needed about that rally and the vitriol toward Obama that surfaced at it. McCain\u2019s campaign and his controversial running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, had disparaged Obama over his acquaintanceship with William Ayers, a domestic terrorist during the Vietnam War era, and exaggerated the link between the two. A campaign ad\u00a0from a group opposing Obama also played up the link between him and Ayers, who was part of the radical, left-wing group Weather Underground responsible for a series of bombings that happened when Obama was a child. Palin\u2019s speeches also often inspired rage, with some in her audiences yelling \u201ckill him,\u201d \u201ctreason\u201d or \u201cterrorist\u201d at the mention of Obama. Some speakers at McCain-Palin events\u00a0used his middle name, \u201cHussein,\u201d in what was clearly intended as a way to question his patriotism \u2015 and which also fueled the birther conspiracy theory. Writing about the campaign atmosphere at the time, then-New York Times columnist Frank Rich noted that when McCain, during his appearances, \u201casks the crowd \u2018Who is the real Barack Obama?\u2019 it\u2019s no surprise that someone cries out \u2018Terrorist.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis sleight of hand at once synchronizes with the poisonous Obama-is-a-Muslim e-mail blasts and shifts the brand of terrorism from [Bill] Ayers\u2019s Vietnam-era variety to the radical Islamic threats of today,\u201d Rich wrote. And even as McCain\u2019s responses to the barbs directed at Obama during the Minnesota rally 10 years ago garner renewed praise, some noted that he could have made a broader point. When the woman refers to Obama as an Arab and McCain says, \u201cNo ... he\u2019s a decent family man, citizen,\u201d without mentioning that that Arabic-speaking people can also be decent citizens.  McCain\u2019s campaign later condemned the offensive comments made at the Minnesota event, calling them\u00a0\u201cinappropriate rhetoric.\u201d Eventually, in his memoir, McCain revealed that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of then-Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who labeled himself at that point an \u201cindependent Democrat.\u201d Despite their contentious 2008 campaign, McCain and Obama maintained a mutual respect for each other. While conceding to Obama on the night of the election, McCain stopped his supporters from booing his opponent\u00a0and said he admired how Obama \u201cinspired the hopes of so many millions of Americans.\u201d McCain has reportedly asked Obama to give a eulogy at his funeral. In a statement released after McCain\u2019s death, Obama\u2019s regard for the senator was clear. \u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cAt John\u2019s best, he showed us what that means.\u201d McCain, for his part, offered a typically candid assessment when asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in 2017 how he wanted to be remembered: \u201cHe served his country and not always right.

Several sources, including Carla Eudy, a fundraiser and McCain family friend who helped plan the services, told People magazine on Wednesday that an invitation had \u201cnot [been] extended\u201d to the former Alaska governor. NBC News\u2019 Kelly O\u2019Donnell also reported\u00a0the snub. A \u201cPalin family source\u201d told O\u2019Donnell that \u201cout of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point.\u201d \u201cThe Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear,\u201d the source added. It\u2019s not clear why Palin was not invited to the services. As People noted, McCain had, in a documentary and book released in May,\u00a0expressed regret for choosing Palin as his 2008 running mate instead of Joseph Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut. Reacting to the news, Palin told the UK\u2019s Daily Mail that it felt like a \u201cperpetual gut-punch\u201d whenever she heard of McCain\u2019s supposed second-thoughts. She said,\u00a0however, that she would not believe the comments unless she heard it firsthand from her former running mate. \u201cI attribute a lot of what we\u2019re hearing and reading regarding McCain\u2019s statements to his ghostwriter or ghostwriters,\u201d Palin said, adding:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know unless I heard it from Sen. McCain myself.\u201d After news broke of McCain\u2019s death on Saturday, Palin had nothing but praise for her late colleague: Several dignitaries, including the two men who bested McCain in his two bids for president, have been invited to attend the late senator\u2019s funeral and memorial services this week. Former President Barack Obama, who beat McCain and Palin in 2008, will be speaking at the late senator\u2019s funeral service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. George W. Bush, who won the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 after a heated primary race against McCain, has also been invited to give a eulogy. Palin, however, won\u2019t be the only conspicuous absence at McCain\u2019s funeral and memorial services. President Donald Trump has also not been invited to attend.",

In the latest case, he allegedly assaulted a female acquaintance in his home, according to law enforcement officials. Alaskan State Troopers took the 29-year-old Army veteran into custody around 10:30 p.m. on Friday while responding to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d report at his home in Wasilla. \u201cWhen the acquaintance attempted to call authorities, he prevented her by taking away her phone,\u201d according to an online dispatch report.\u00a0\u201cWhile being placed under arrest, Palin physically resisted troopers.\u201d Palin was subsequently charged with domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.

In court on Saturday, Track Palin pleaded \u201cnot guilty, for sure\u201d on all four charged, local NBC affiliate KTUU reported. Representatives for the Alaska State Troopers did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Palin is the oldest of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin\u2019s five children. In June, he pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal trespassing charges as part of a plea deal related to an alleged December 2017 assault of his father. A drunken Track had repeatedly hit Todd Palin in the head after breaking into his parents\u2019 home in Wasilla, according to charging documents obtained by The Los Angeles Times. At the time of his 2017 arrest, Track Palin had been on probation after reaching a plea agreement following a domestic violence arrest in January 2016 for allegedly assaulting and pointing a gun at his then-girlfriend, Jordan Loewe. Sarah Palin suggested after that first arrest that her son was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.",

Sarah Palin (R), who claimed the newspaper defamed her by linking her to a 2011 mass shooting. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that Palin\u2019s suit against the Times \u201cplausibly states a claim for defamation and may proceed to full discovery,\u201d according to NPR. The lawsuit stems from a 2017 Times editorial, titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d published in the aftermath of the shooting at a baseball field in Virginia that left House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) in critical condition. The piece looked at \u201chow vicious American politics has become\u201d and the role that weaponized rhetoric may play in mass shootings. The editorial initially linked activity by Palin\u2019s political action committee to a 2011 shooting in Arizona that killed six people and injured then-Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and a dozen others.\u00a0The PAC had previously distributed a map of some Democratic congressional districts \u2014 including Giffords\u2019 \u2014 with a crosshairs superimposed over it. A direct link between the map and the 2011 shooting was never established, and the Times later issued a correction and apologized on Twitter for the error. Palin\u2019s lawyers filed a complaint later that month, alleging that the initial editorial defamed her \u201cby publishing a statement it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event.\u201d U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed the suit in August 2017, saying the editorial may have contained errors but that it wasn\u2019t plausible those errors were made with malice. \u201cNegligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not,\u201d Rakoff wrote in his 26-page decision. Palin appealed the decision, leading to the court\u2019s ruling this week. The judges gave the suit a green light to move forward but noted that Palin\u2019s attorneys will need to prove with \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the Times editors \u201cacted with actual malice\u201d in order to win their case.",

      "content": " Former Alaska Gov.\u00a0Sarah Palin, whose husband,\u00a0Todd Palin, has reportedly filed for divorce, once joked about the prospect in an email exchange, calling it a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d The apparent quip came to light in February 2012 when a trove of 17,000 records was released by state officials in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Within the mountain of files was an email sent September 2007 during her governorship to aides Kris Perry and Frank Bailey\u00a0on which Todd Palin was copied. \u201cSo speaking of .... If we, er, when we get a divorce, does that quell \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 accusations about BP?\u201d she wrote, referring to her husband\u2019s work on the British oil company\u2019s North Pipeline. \u201cVERY funny,\u201d Bailey replied, indicating the remark was made in jest. The day after HuffPost reported on the email, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee\u2019s office said she was \u201cclearly speaking tongue-in-cheek.\u201d However, according to the Anchorage Daily News, Todd Palin filed for divorce on Friday, pointing to an \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife.\u201d The two have been married for 31 years. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mistakenly stated that Todd Palin was once Sarah Palin\u2019s aide. He was not.",
