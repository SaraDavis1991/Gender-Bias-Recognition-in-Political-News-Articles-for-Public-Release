Just hours before Kremlin hackers attempted to break into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump publicly\u00a0challenged Russia to find Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails, which he claimed could have contained classified information. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a press conference in July 2016, referring to emails deleted from the private account Clinton used when she was secretary of state. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d Trump\u2019s grades aren\u2019t classified. But it\u2019s apparently important to the president that they stay secret. His former personal attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress on Wednesday that the president once ordered him to contact all of Trump\u2019s former schools and threaten them with legal action if they released the information. If Trump\u2019s appeal to Russia shook loose the first trove of Democratic emails to Wikileaks, the same tactic might also work with the Kremlin for his grades, SAT scores \u2014 and maybe even his tax returns \u2014 Twitter users concluded. So they\u2019re giving it a try:",

      "content": " SELMA, Ala. \u2015 Less than three years after defeating Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0in the 2016 Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton reunited with the Vermont independent and leading Democrats to deliver a passionate call for protecting voting rights in the face of Republican attacks. Clinton was the honoree at the annual Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast, a major feature of the weekend-long \u201cBridge Crossing Jubilee\u201d commemorating the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march for voting rights across Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965. The original march, symbolically re-enacted every year, ultimately inspired the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, which ensured black voting rights in the South for the first time since Reconstruction. Speaking in the gymnasium of George Wallace Community College, Clinton delivered a stinging indictment of Republican efforts to restrict voting that target black voters, particularly in the South, and called for a new movement to safeguard the franchise. \u201cWe need, starting right now, here in Selma \u2014 once again \u2014 to redouble our efforts with a 21st-century civil rights movement devoted to claiming, enforcing and defending the right to vote \u2014 once and for all,\u201d Clinton said. Although Clinton has largely faded from public life since her 2016 election loss, she received a hero\u2019s welcome as she ascended the stage to accept the jubilee program\u2019s 2019 International Unity Award and induction into the Women\u2019s Hall of Fame. Hank Sanders and Faya Rose Tour\u00e9, a married couple of Alabama civil rights attorneys, presented Clinton with a drawing of her, former President Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Hank Sanders prompted massive applause from the audience when he declared that Clinton \u201cwas elected president of the United States, but it was stolen from her\u201d by the FBI when it announced a last-minute reopening of the investigation into her emails, and by the Russian government. For her part, Tour\u00e9 introduced Clinton simply as \u201cthe president.\u201d In her remarks, which elicited a standing ovation, Clinton recalled her work investigating segregated schools in Alabama during an early 1970s stint at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, before pivoting to the injustices of the present. The former secretary of state did not need to look far for evidence that voting rights are under attack. She and other speakers argued that abuse of voting rules in Georgia deprived Democrat Stacey Abrams of a win in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race in November. \u201cStacey Abrams should be governor, leading the state right now,\u201d Clinton declared, prompting applause from the predominantly black audience that had assembled to hear her speak. As Georgia secretary of state, Brian Kemp, Abrams\u2019 Republican opponent in the gubernatorial race, instituted a system that required an \u201cexact match\u201d between the name on voter registration forms and other government records. Mere days before the election, 53,000 voter registration applications remained on hold. Seventy percent of the stalled applications were for black voters, sparking widespread charges of racial discrimination. Clinton also referenced the case of alleged pro-GOP election fraud in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District. Amid overwhelming evidence that an operative working on behalf of Republican Mark Harris illegally collected absentee ballots, the state election board called for a new election in February. \u201cThe district is holding a special election, but it should never have happened in the first place,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd we have to do everything we can to stand up and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you find it interesting that all the politicians who have argued for years for strict voter ID rules and limits on early voting that disproportionately affect low-income voters and voters of color have been curiously quiet about this North Carolina case?\u201d she added. Under the guise of policing \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d many Republicans in the South have become increasingly brazen in their efforts to restrict voting since a 2013 Supreme Court decision striking down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states with histories of voting discrimination to obtain advance approval \u2015 known as \u201cpre-clearance\u201d \u2015 from the federal government for any changes to their voting rules. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that historically racist Southern states had outgrown the need for federal supervision. But reminders of the persistence of racism in American society are apparent in the primarily Republican efforts to suppress the franchise, and the legacy of more explicit discrimination looms large in the South. For example, George Wallace Community College, where the unity breakfast took place, is named for the very segregationist governor who ordered state troopers to stop the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d marchers with brutal force in 1965. Years later, Wallace apologized for his actions, and in subsequent stints as governor, advocated the expansion of the state community college system that bears his name. Even the Edmund Pettus Bridge carries the stench of Alabama\u2019s long history of institutional racism. Pettus was a decorated Confederate general during the Civil War, who became a leader of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan. Changes to Southern landmarks named for racist figures are likely not in the offing, but efforts to fix voting rights deficiencies are ramping up. In the wake of their takeover of the House of Representatives in November, Democrats plan to pass legislation reinstating the key provision of the Voting Rights Act. The bill, authored by Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) who represents Selma and spoke at Sunday\u2019s breakfast, would restore pre-clearance requirements using a new formula that Sewell expects to apply to 11 states at the outset. The bill is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate, but Democrats hope to force Republicans to go on record opposing the measure ahead of the 2020 presidential election. In addition to Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) spoke on Sunday. Sanders and Booker are running for president; Brown is deciding whether to run. Sanders left shortly after his speech; he has a campaign rally scheduled in Chicago in the evening.\u00a0Booker and Brown stayed, walking at the head of the march across the Pettus bridge in the afternoon. The trip carried special resonance for Sanders, who is making a highly visible effort to improve his performance with black voters. Across the South, including Alabama, Clinton trounced Sanders in 2016 thanks to the support of black Democrats, particularly those over the age of 30. Sanders used his speech to call for automatic voter registration \u2015 with a flash of his signature economic populism. \u201cThe people who own America \u2014 the people who put hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates who represent the wealthy and the powerful \u2014 they know about the power of the vote,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s our turn to demand that we end all voter suppression in this country,\u201d he continued to applause. \u201cWe not only end voter suppression, but we make it easier for people to vote, not harder.\u201d Several of the breakfast attendees who voted for Clinton in 2016 said that their decision had been rooted in an affinity for Clinton, rather than their dislike for Sanders. Nate Brown, 56, a basketball coach and the artist who sketched the drawing presented to Clinton, said he would vote for Clinton again if she ran. But this time around, he is seriously considering voting for Sanders. He cited Sanders\u2019 commitment to improving the health care system to bring it in line with other countries. \u201cHe just looks like the nutty professor, but he\u2019s a cool guy. He makes good sense too \u2014 good sense,\u201d Brown said. JoAnn Bland, 65, a \u201cfoot soldier\u201d \u2015 or veteran of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march \u2015 who leads guided tours of the region\u2019s civil rights history, was apparently unaware that Sanders had formally entered the race. Bland said that she \u201ckind of\u201d liked Booker, but that if Sanders runs, \u201che may be my choice.\u201d Bland, who is also a military veteran, is drawn to Sanders\u2019 support for tuition-free public college and other efforts aimed at expanding economic opportunity. \u201cI just need to know some other facts from him like, \u2018How are you going to do this?\u2019\u201d she said. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story contained a tweet that said Clinton didn\u2019t march. She joined the marchers later.",

Some lawmakers have already seen an early wave of support, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his campaign. Sanders had been Clinton\u2019s main primary opponent in 2016. Clinton has been advising several declared or potential candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and former Vice President Joe Biden, according to The New York Times. But many had warned that were she to launch her own attempt, Clinton would immediately be a divisive addition to the field after losing to Trump in 2016. Many party members hoped she\u2019d keep a low profile ahead of the midterm elections, citing her low approval rating. \u201cI\u2019ve told every one of them, don\u2019t take anything for granted, even though we have a long list of real problems and broken promises from this administration that need to be highlighted,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have to work really, really hard to make our case to the American people, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help the Democrats win back the White House.\u201c Clinton said Monday that she planned to remain engaged with politics throughout the next election, even if she\u2019s not a candidate herself. She also said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d to see several women launch bids for the White House after her own groundbreaking nomination. \u201cI want to be sure that people understand I\u2019m going to keep speaking out,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.

      "author": "Jennifer Bendery",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) announced Thursday that he\u2019s not running for president. Who knows why he decided to bow out. He might have been worried about his plainly obvious likability problem. Think about it.\u00a0When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, remember all the crap she took for her voice? It had that shrill tone. It was nagging. It was like her voice floated up into her cheek bones and through her nose, and was just very annoying. She was too loud. Or was she tender? Whatever. These were serious matters. Clinton also didn\u2019t smile enough. Obviously, if you want to be president, you have to modulate your voice and smile more. And P.S., you have to dress just right, too. Clinton has been criticized for dressing too unflatteringly, too polished and even\u00a0too gender-confused. If you can\u2019t wear the perfect outfit, you won\u2019t connect with the average voter. These are real challenges for 2020 presidential candidates like Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who are coming across as\u00a0too warm and connecting too much with voters, or too cold, aloof and unlikable\u00a0at this early stage. This brings us to Brown. Forget the fact that literally everyone likes him and that he just easily won his third Senate term in a state President Donald Trump won by 8 points. Have you heard the guy\u2019s voice? It\u2019s gravelly. It\u2019s garbled. His Senate floor speeches sound like someone just passed the mic to Oscar the Grouch. And then there\u2019s his fashion sense. Brown wears rumpled suits, sometimes with a tie and sometimes without. What is that communicating to the average voter? I\u2019m a working professional who deserves your respect, but then boom, no tie, I\u2019m a regular schmoe just like you? Notably, Brown didn\u2019t smile once during a Thursday rant on the Senate floor about Republicans confirming piles of Trump\u2019s young, right-wing, ideological judicial nominees. Lighten up man, these are just lifetime posts to federal courts! HuffPost asked Brown\u2019s colleagues if they privately worried he wasn\u2019t likable enough and would face scrutiny over his voice and appearance as a presidential candidate, just as Clinton did. Shockingly, they did not. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has a likability problem at all,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Asked if he should probably smile more, she walked away in a huff. \u201cOh, please.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said of course Brown is likable enough to be president \u2015 and then made fun of his clothes, a statement that could have done significant damage to Brown if he were running for president. \u201cI don\u2019t think Sherrod has ever even seen a copy of GQ, let alone subscribed to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI like Sherrod a lot,\u201d added Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \u201cThere are so many candidates that whatever their traits are that people are looking for, they\u2019ll have their choice.\u201d What about his disheveled clothes, though? \u201cHey, look at Bernie Sanders,\u201d Hirono said. His scratchy voice? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he can do about that,\u201d she said. Hmm. Surely Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016, would have these concerns about Brown\u2019s prospects. He suggested something profound: male presidential candidates don\u2019t face anywhere near the same level of scrutiny over their voices and clothes as female presidential candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s all a double standard,\u201d said Kaine. \u201cThe single most overriding memory for me from 2016 is the gross double standard applied to Clinton because she was a woman. Everything from the FBI\u2019s treatment of their two investigations [of Clinton and of Trump] to her insensitivity to her voice, her health, the way she dressed. It\u2019s no accident we\u2019ve never had a woman president.\u201d Asked if he thinks Brown smiles enough though, Kaine paused. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about that question.\u201d The more HuffPost raised concerns with senators about Brown\u2019s smiles and vocal fry, the more the men were confused by the question and the women were thrilled HuffPost was doing this obnoxious story about sexist treatment of female presidential contenders. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that from me,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) insisted, when it was suggested Brown\u2019s voice could be problematic. \u201cHave you heard my voice? And I\u2019ve been on the ballot 24 times in Vermont and I\u2019ve won 24 times.\u201d \u201cSee, it\u2019s kind of nice that you\u2019re asking me all these questions about guys for a change, you know?\u201d said Hirono. \u201cThat\u2019s a change.\u201d Harris, who is already buckling in for months of criticisms about having just the right voice, hair, clothes and level of warmth to be president, laughed at the idea of Brown being considered unlikable on any of those fronts. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you make a great point. An excellent point. Keep making it.\u201d For his part, Brown said nobody had ever asked him if he worried he had a likability problem. He started to question it himself. \u201cI always thought I was kinda a likable guy,\u201d he said softly, his voice feeling even a bit tender. You are, senator! Brown got the point of the question though. \u201cIt\u2019s clear women are judged differently,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the criticism of Hillary was unfair in that way because she was held to a different standard from male candidates, and I see that. And I see that issue rising from time to time, or maybe more than time to time, this year. That\u2019s all a concern to me.\u201d",

      "content": " Although the U.S. House voted unanimously Thursday for a resolution asking that\u00a0any final report in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation\u00a0be made public, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has another priority: Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. The House bill passed without a single no vote, but it is a nonbinding resolution to make the Mueller report public, according to the Daily Beast. When the House\u2019s resolution reached the Senate, Graham blocked it, saying that there first needs to be a special counsel appointed to investigate \u201cthe abuses, potentially, by the Department of Justice and the FBI regarding the Clinton email investigation.\u201d \u201cWas there two systems of justice in 2016? One for the Democratic candidate and one for the Republican candidate?\u201d\u00a0Graham asked on the Senate floor, according to Mediaite. He added, \u201cIf the shoe were on the other foot\u2026 all hell would pay.\u201d However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N,Y.) disagreed with Graham, saying that the demand \u201cappears to be a pretext for blocking this very simple, noncontroversial resolution.\u201d He added: \u201cI have absolutely no idea why a member of this body would object to this basic level of transparency, whatever their concern on other issues.\u201d Schumer said there was no good reason that the special counsel\u2019s report should not be made public. \u201cThe American people are overwhelmingly for the report being made public. They have a right to see it. No one should stand in the way of that,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor, according to The Hill. The demand is familiar ground for Graham, who told Fox News in December he wanted a special counsel to investigate \u201call things\u201d related to Clinton. Graham also told\u00a0Fox News\u00a0on Wednesday that he also wanted a special counsel to investigate \u201cpotential crimes\u201d by officials in the Justice Department and FBI.",

And the \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d host\u2019s segment got a surprise endorsement from Trump himself, who shared the clip without comment on Twitter. Carlson said: Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton and her surrogates in the media attacked Donald Trump for his role in pushing the birther story. They didn\u2019t just argue that it was dumb to think Barack Obama was born in Kenya, they said it hurt America. They said it delegitimized Obama as a leader by casting him as an illegitimate president. Those are fair points. If you can\u2019t prove something is true, you shouldn\u2019t claim that it is. If you don\u2019t like a president\u2019s policies, argue against them, offer a better alternative, don\u2019t claim that he isn\u2019t really the president, that doesn\u2019t help the country. Carlson\u2019s criticism came as he repeated his argument why he believed special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign collusion was a hoax. It\u2019s likely that argument, and not the birther criticism, that prompted Trump to post the video. Carlson \u2015\u00a0who this month has been embroiled in his own scandal following the resurfacing of audio in which he made sexist, racist, misogynistic and homophobic comments \u2015 accused Democrats of pushing \u201ctheir own, far more harmful, conspiracy, the theory of Russian collusion.\u201d It was \u201call invented by the Clinton campaign for short-term political gain,\u201d he added, calling the collusion claims made in the unverified dossier\u00a0by former British spy Christopher Steele\u00a0\u201cfake.\u201d Carlson has previously called the birther claim \u201ca dumb talking point.\u201d Check out the segment, as shared by Trump, here:",

Florida resident\u00a0Cesar Sayoc, 56, was arrested last October after authorities determined that he mailed explosive devices to former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, among other Democratic leaders. Sayoc is also accused of sending bombs to actor Robert De Niro and to CNN\u2019s New York office \u2014 which prompted an evacuation of the Time Warner building. None of the devices went off. Sayoc, who has been referred to as the MAGA bomber in tabloids, pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to 65 counts, including use of a weapon of mass destruction,\u00a0the New York Daily News reported. \u201cIn October 2018, I made devices that were designed to look like pipe bombs and sent them in the mail,\u201d Sayoc said in court. During his arrest, authorities took possession of his van, which was plastered with images of Trump and other images of Democrats with crosshairs on their heads. Debra Gureghian, Sayoc\u2019s former employer at New River Pizza in Florida, told HuffPost in October that the van let no light through the windows and was littered with fast food wrappers and severed doll heads. \u201cThere were unopened bottles of alcohol, open bottles of alcohol,\u201d she said. \u201cDolls with their heads cut off, Barbie and Ken. He had said he was doing it for his nieces and nephews or something, he was fixing them.\u201d Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a long criminal history. He pleaded guilty in 2013 to felony grand theft and was found guilty in 2015 for a retail theft charge. Most disturbing is that Sayoc wanted to \u201ceradicate the Jews\u201d and hoped to \u201cgo back to the Hitler days,\u201d Gureghian said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the white supremacists, the white foot soldiers that he wants to follow and lead,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted to be a leader.\u201d Sayoc faces life in prison.

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 The Justice Department\u2019s recent decision to provide Congress with a wide range of documents surrounding the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s\u00a0emails will increase pressure on DOJ to be fully transparent about Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation into President Donald Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr\u00a0is reviewing Mueller\u2019s confidential full report and is expected to inform Congress about its principal conclusions in the coming days. But Democrats and Republicans want Barr to release the full thing, and the House recently voted unanimously \u2015 420 to 0 \u2015 for the Justice Department to release Mueller\u2019s full report. Barr told Congress that concerns over Trump\u2019s privacy could limit the information he makes public. Given Barr\u2019s broad view of executive privilege, he\u2019s also likely to abide by any claims the White House makes that portions of the report should be withheld. But the Justice Department has recently provided Congress with extensive access to materials about the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Some of the materials \u2015 such as\u00a0text messages exchanged between two officials involved in the Clinton investigation as well as the Russia probe \u2015 have provided fodder for Republicans seeking to help Trump undermine the Mueller investigation. The Justice Department\u2019s recent unprecedented disclosures have included Clinton investigation 302s (records of FBI interviews) as well as Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders connected to the Russia investigation. Ron Weich, a former Justice Department congressional liaison who is now dean of the University of Baltimore\u2019s law school, said that he thinks the full report will ultimately end up in congressional hands. \u201cThere are plenty of precedents where the public interest outweighs the concerns,\u201d Weich told HuffPost. \u201cIn this case, the public interest is overwhelming.\u201d That will especially be true if Mueller\u2019s report suggests that Trump committed conduct that would have led to his indictment if not for the Justice Department\u2019s restrictions on charging a sitting president. \u201cIf it\u2019s that momentous \u2015 if it\u2019s \u2018we believe the president engaged in conduct that would have led to criminal charges were he not the president\u2019 \u2015 obviously that has to go to Congress,\u201d Weich said. \u201cThe only reason he can\u2019t be indicted is because the remedy is, in Congress, impeachment. That\u2019s the basis for the department policy that he can\u2019t be indicted, that\u2019s there\u2019s another remedy in the Constitution.\u201d Former Attorney General Eric Holder agrees. \u201cIf the Mueller Report contains evidence about impeachable conduct/offenses that, at a minimum, must be shared with Congress,\u201d he tweeted Friday. \u201cIt would be irresponsible for DOJ to hold on to this kind of information - for any reason. No privilege claim would be valid.\u201d Weich pointed to a few additional examples of cases in which DOJ provided material about cases that didn\u2019t result in an indictment: The Justice Department provided extensive information about the decision not to indict the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; the investigation into \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d by the CIA; and the investigation of former IRS official Lois Lerner. Beyond just seeing Mueller\u2019s final report, Democrats are eager to obtain the raw investigative material that the special counsel compiled. A statement from the chairs of six House committees \u2015 Judiciary, Oversight, Intelligence, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs \u2015 asked for Mueller to turn over everything he\u2019s got. \u201cConsistent with the Justice Department\u2019s past practice and to ensure Congress can discharge its constitutional responsibilities, we also expect the underlying evidence uncovered during the course of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation will be turned over to the relevant Committees of Congress upon request,\u201d the six officials said in a statement.",

As Washington eagerly awaits a public report from Attorney General William Barr on the \u201cprincipal conclusions\u201d of Mueller\u2019s findings on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Republicans were laying the groundwork to keep any of the investigative material turned up by the probe out of the hands of House Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Department of Justice\u2019s job to give\u201d Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and the House Judiciary Committee that he chairs \u201cwhat they want [to] go off on a purely partisan investigation that could lead towards impeachment,\u201d Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the committee\u2019s ranking GOP member,\u00a0said on Fox News on Sunday. \u201cI believe that we need to protect the innocent here, but to the extent that we cannot sacrifice national security interests and release as much information as possible, I certainly support that,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told CNN. \u201cTypically, prosecutors do not release information that would be harmful to the innocent,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we protect the innocent here.\u201d \u201cThe Mueller report... we can just burn it up. It is a partisan document,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News. Ken Starr, the independent counsel who dogged President Bill Clinton, wrote a piece in The Atlantic calling on Mueller to remain quiet and not produce a public report. Barr has told Congress that concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s right to privacy could limit what the Justice Department discloses about the Mueller investigation. In a letter, he pointed to department regulations that call for prosecutors \u201cto be sensitive to the privacy and reputational interests of uncharged third parties\u201d and \u201cnot to criticize individuals for conduct that does not warrant prosecution.\u201d A potential complication is a longstanding DOJ opinion that holds that federal prosecutors can\u2019t indict the president. If the Mueller report indicates that Trump would have been indicted but for being the president, legal experts say the department couldn\u2019t justify holding that information back. \u201cIf it\u2019s that momentous \u2015 if it\u2019s, \u2018We believe the president engaged in conduct that would have led to criminal charges were he not the president\u2019 \u2015 obviously that has to go to Congress,\u201d former DOJ congressional liaison Ron Weich told HuffPost. \u201cThe only reason he can\u2019t be indicted is because the remedy is, in Congress, impeachment.

Conway,\u00a0a senior counselor to Trump and his final campaign manager during the 2016 election against Clinton, made the suggestion on Fox News on Monday. It came one day after Attorney General William Barr announced that there\u2019s no evidence that Trump conspired with Russia to swing the election. \u201c\u2018Oh, why are you still talking about Hillary Clinton?\u2019 Because folks, you wouldn\u2019t let the 2016 election go,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThose who have called for a full and fair investigation \u2014 \u2018I must get the truth, we will not stop.

You\u2019ve not reflected or been reluctant to waste $25 to 30 million of taxpayer dollars.\u201d She went on to point out that no one in Trump\u2019s family has been charged in the wake of the investigation, adding that \u201cthere should be a reckoning because our democracy bears nothing less.\u201d Calls for such an investigation into Clinton are nothing new and Trump has continued to attack his former rival since taking office. In 2016, the FBI did investigate Clinton over her use of a private email server but the probe did not lead to criminal charges against her. House Republicans later asked for a second investigation into not only her but James Comey, the FBI\u2019s former director, and Loretta Lynch, who was attorney general under President Barack Obama.",

The attorney general also exonerated the president of attempting to obstruct justice in the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the election \u2014 a question Mueller declined to weigh in on. Democrats are calling on Barr to testify about how he reached his conclusion on the question of potential obstruction of justice by the president, and they have called for the public release of the full Mueller report. Graham agreed Monday on both points. But he\u2019s also likely to call up Department of Justice officials before his committee to probe other matters, such as the FBI\u2019s decision to surveil a Trump campaign member, Carter Page, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the bureau\u2019s reliance on the Steele dossier, an unverified intelligence document that contained a number of dubious claims about the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia. \u201cWhat makes no sense to me is that all the abuse by the Department of Justice and the FBI, the unprofessional conduct, the shady behavior \u2014 nobody seems to think that\u2019s much important,\u201d Graham said, alleging that a \u201cdouble standard\u201d existed to how federal investigators approached Clinton and Trump. Graham suggested he would also seek to re-examine the Clinton email probe, former FBI Director Jim Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s decision to recuse herself from the matter. \u201cWhy did Comey do what he did? Why did he take over the investigation in July, make a statement that [Clinton] did a lot of bad things but not quite a crime? That did affect this election,\u201d Graham added. Democrats, meanwhile, said they were a bit perplexed by the idea of a special counsel investigation into the Clinton email probe. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that. ... It\u2019s a bit of a cipher to me,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Monday. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said, \u201cSeriously?\u201d several times and doubled over in laughter when asked about Graham\u2019s comments. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is my job,\u201d Coons added. This story has been updated to include comments from Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Chris Coons.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats say they want \u201call of the underlying evidence\u201d in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation . But what is all of that evidence? Mueller\u2019s team issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants and interviewed more than 500 witnesses. That means the special counsel likely compiled thousands, if not millions, of documents and pieces of evidence. Material collected ranges from a $15,000 ostrich jacket worn by President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman to emails and encrypted text messages to hard drives and laptops. It could even include tax returns, if Mueller sought them. In one Mueller case, that of longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, the government said it had turned over 9 terabytes of discovery \u2014 an amount so large that Stone\u2019s lawyers said if it were on paper, it would pile as high as the Washington Monument, twice. If all of that was delivered to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee might need to invest in a larger office space. But lawmakers say what they really want is documentation of everything \u2014 and an idea of how that evidence guided Mueller\u2019s conclusions. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to see Paul Manafort\u2019s ostrich jacket, but we do need to know that it\u2019s there,\u201d says Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the Judiciary panel. The requests for underlying evidence are central to Democrats\u2019 demands for Mueller\u2019s full report. They say that they need all that information to make their own conclusions, and to ensure that Mueller\u2019s findings are not filtered by Attorney General William Barr , whom Trump picked for the job. While they may not need every personal item seized by Mueller \u2014 like Manafort\u2019s jacket, meant to show his lavish lifestyle, or the contents of Stone\u2019s hard drive \u2014 they do want as much information as possible that is relevant to his decisions. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of several committee chairmen asking for the full report and underlying evidence, says what he is principally interested in is documentation that supports the report. He says the committees will fight for grand jury material, including witness interviews, that is normally off limits but can be obtained in court. Schiff said he expects negotiations with the Justice Department over the scope and breadth of what is turned over to Congress. \u201cIt will be a product of negotiation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t accept is, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to give you anything.\u2019\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has also said Democrats will fight for grand jury material. He said he talked to Barr on Wednesday and Barr wouldn\u2019t commit to releasing it. \u201cA judge would have to release those and we would hope a judge would,\u201d Nadler said. As part of his investigation, Mueller charged 34 people, including Manafort, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and three Russian companies. Manafort was convicted in Washington and Virginia of crimes related to years of Ukrainian political consulting work, and Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. In total, five Trump aides pleaded guilty and a sixth, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering. In a four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s report released Sunday, Barr said the special counsel did not find that Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cconspired or coordinated\u201d with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. It also said that Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out \u201cevidence on both sides\u201d of the question. Democrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions. It\u2019s not clear what evidence the Justice Department might be prepared to release, but documents of enormous public interest would be summaries of FBI interviews with witnesses in the case. The FBI released similar records following the conclusion of an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, including a write-up of the interview agents did with Clinton herself. In Mueller\u2019s case, disclosure of witness interviews would almost certainly yield vivid, firsthand accounts from some of Trump\u2019s closest aides and advisers \u2014 among them former White House officials Hope Hicks and Don McGahn \u2014 of the many episodes Mueller and his team scrutinized for potential obstruction of justice. Those include the firing of James Comey as FBI director and the constant browbeating of Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general. There are whole other categories of information that less likely to be released. Those include grand jury testimony; negative information about people who were investigated but not charged; and details about ongoing investigations. Though grand jury testimony is historically not released, those records were made public after the Whitewater investigation into former President Bill Clinton and during an investigation into President Richard Nixon before he resigned. Schiff and other Democrats are leaning heavily on those precedents, along with the Justice Department\u2019s recent release of hundreds of thousands of documents last year relating to the Hillary Clinton investigation and also the origins of the Russia investigation, which was ongoing at the time. Republicans sought those documents when they were in the majority; Democrats say the department can\u2019t possibly deny them similar information now that they control the House. Republicans, meanwhile, have been deferential to Barr. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday urged caution so as not to \u201cthrow innocent people who\u2019ve not been charged under the bus.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. Barr appears to be moving forward on sending Congress an additional, redacted report. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday that Barr told him he was combing through Mueller\u2019s report and removing classified, grand jury and other information in hopes of releasing it in April. Democrats say that won\u2019t be enough. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy about it, to put it mildly,\u201d Nadler said after his own call with Barr. ___ Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.",

Nick Merrill, who serves as Clinton\u2019s spokesperson, expressed outrage Friday over a January Washington Post Magazine article in which Buttigieg, a fellow Democrat, argued that President Donald Trump rose to power \u201cbecause, in his twisted way, he pointed out the huge troubles in our economy and our democracy.\u201d Buttigieg then called out former candidate Clinton, adding that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.\u201d Merrill denounced the comments and praised Clinton\u2019s platforms, pointing out that \u201cTrump ran on pessimism, racism, false promises, & vitriol.\u201d \u201cInterpret that how you want, but there are 66,000,000 people who disagree,\u201d he said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d Buttigieg, who at 37 years old is the youngest candidate in the crowded field of Democrats alongside Rep.

During a Thursday speech in San Francisco, Buttigieg criticized Trump\u2019s slogan\u00a0\u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d describing it as a disingenuous tagline. \u201cIt means \u2018we\u2019re going to stop the changes so you don\u2019t have to change anything\u2019 and it\u2019s not honest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an honest politics that revolves around the word \u2018again.\u2019\u201d",

On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez took part in an MSNBC town hall discussion in which she advocated for the deal and even defended a Republican who was called a \u201cmoron\u201d by an audience member for not supporting it. \u201cHey, hey, hey, hey.

      "content": " Though more than two years have passed since the presidential election, former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0said he remains troubled by his potential role in the rise of\u00a0Donald Trump, questioning the impact of the bureau\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. In October 2016, just one month before Election Day, Comey reopened a probe into then-candidate Clinton\u2019s use of a private server to conduct government business when she was secretary of state, meaning she may have violated security regulations. The scandal tarnished her reputation and indelibly marked her campaign. Critics of the investigation argue it was a tipping point in the election, swinging it in Trump\u2019s favor. Asked by CNN\u2019s Christian Amanpour whether he\u2019s kept awake at night by that possibility, Comey replied, \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cI hope someday somebody proves that what we did was irrelevant,\u201d he said. The investigation was launched in July 2015 and appeared to end with Comey\u2019s announcement a year later that he recommended no criminal charges against Clinton, since no evidence was found to indicate her mishandling of classified information was intentional. However, the discovery of additional emails led to the probe\u2019s resumption. Two days before the election, Comey announced that the FBI stood by its previous conclusion that Clinton committed no criminal acts. \u201cI hope we had no impact ... but all it does is increase the pain,\u201d he told Amanpour. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how I think about the decision.\u201d \u201cMy view and the view of my team was we cannot conceal from the American people that the investigation we told them and fought to tell them is done, is done, is done, is not done, and the result could change. We just couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d According to research released in May 2017 by Gallup, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, the email controversy negatively branded the Clinton campaign, becoming a fixation among Americans for months. Last June, the Department of Justice inspector general revealed that Comey himself had used his personal email server for FBI business, eliciting a sarcastic response on Twitter from Clinton, who noted the apparent hypocrisy. \u201cBut my emails,\u201d she wrote, employing what has become a refrain for Democrats mocking Republicans who haven\u2019t yet dropped the matter.",

The presidential hopeful commented on her past remarks that Bill Clinton should have resigned from his presidency after it was publicly revealed in 1998 that he was having an affair with then-White House intern\u00a0Monica Lewinsky. Moderator Erin Burnett asked Gillibrand if her comments about Bill Clinton ever affected her relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who Gillibrand has openly supported for years. Gillibrand responded cooly, telling Burnett that Hillary Clinton can still be a role model even if her husband is not. \u201cFor me, Secretary Clinton is still a role model for all of us and my views on her husband is very different,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI\u2019ve said all I\u2019m gonna say about that.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton put that 65 million cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling. She\u2019s inspired the world by her bravery and courage to do what she thought was right \u2014 to run for president twice, to be a national leader her whole life. She\u2019s given her life to public service,\u201d Gillibrand said earlier. Gillibrand has been an outspoken advocate for women\u2019s rights and routinely fights for survivors of sexual assault. She sent shockwaves through the Democratic party when she said in November 2017 that it would have been the \u201cappropriate response\u201d for Bill Clinton to step down after his affair with Lewinsky, who was 22 to Bill Clinton\u2019s 49 at the time the relationship took place. Just a month later, Gillibrand made waves again when she was the first Democrat to publicly call for then-Sen. Al Franken\u00a0(D-Minn.) to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct. During another segment of Tuesday\u2019s town hall, Gillibrand fielded a question about how she plans to fight the stigma surrounding sexual harassment and assault on college campuses, in workplaces and other areas. \u201cI believe deeply that we have to end sexual violence in this country because fundamentally it goes to a very simple question: Do we value women? And unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of evidence that we don\u2019t,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take sexual assault seriously in college campuses, we don\u2019t take it seriously in the military, we don\u2019t even take it seriously in places like Congress,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo we have to address sexual harassment and sexual assault head on.\u201d",

British police arrested Assange\u00a0on Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where had spent the past seven years to avoid capture. Assange became exposed to arrest and U.S. extradition when his diplomatic immunity was terminated. Assange was initially arrested and found guilty on charges that he breached bail conditions related to a Swedish rape case in 2012 before being arrested on the conspiracy charge. In New York City, during the first night of a speaking tour with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, she made it clear that she felt the arrests were justified. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll wait and see what happens with the charges and how it proceeds, but he skipped bail in the U.K.,\u201d the former secretary of state added. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential campaign, WikiLeaks disseminated hacked materials from the Democratic National Committee that damaged the Clinton campaign. Assange\u2019s conspiracy charge is on the grounds that he and former military intelligence analyst\u00a0Chelsea Manning conspired to steal military secrets from the U.S. government. Assange\u2019s attorney,\u00a0Jennifer Robinson, reportedly said Thursday that the extradition could set a\u00a0\u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for journalists who publish \u201ctruthful information about the United States.\u201d \u201cJournalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges,\u201d said another one of Assange\u2019s lawyers,\u00a0Barry Pollack. Thursday evening, Clinton pushed firmly back against that narrative. \u201cIt is clear from the indictment that came out: It\u2019s not about punishing journalism, it\u2019s about assisting the hacking of the military computer to steal information from the United States government,\u201d Clinton said. At the end of her answer, Clinton added a quip, much to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a little ironic that he may be the only foreigner that this administration would welcome to the United States,\u201d she said. Assange could face up to five years in prison if found guilty.",

New Yorkers apparently had better ways to spend $99, the minimum day-of price of admission. Even the heckler\u2019s opening cry lacked the gusto of political yesteryear. Gone was the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chant that had become a rallying call of the Republican Party in 2016. In its place was something more befitting the moment. \u201cBill, this is boring!\u201d the heckler bellowed. Thursday night was supposed to be the easy one \u2015 \u201cWe\u2019re starting this tour with a home game,\u201d Bill Clinton joked at one point \u2015 and it may very well turn out to be. The night was light on relitigation of that disappointing election and heavy on stories from the olden days, like that time Barack Obama was surprised to learn that the secretary of state had kept Osama bin Laden\u2019s assassination a secret from her husband, the former president. There was little reckoning with the battered image of the Clintons that emerged after the 2016 election:\u00a0Hillary lost an election that many thought she should have won. And Bill went from a charismatic former president coveted for campaign appearances to an awkward example of how the Democratic Party mishandled sexual harassment allegations. But Thursday\u2019s audience ate up their act, as Hillary suggested Washington, D.C., was more like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d than \u201cVeep\u201d or \u201cThe West Wing\u201d (Bill playfully suggested \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d). They loved her quip about not making difficult presidential decisions on Twitter. Despite their attempts to avoid too much 2016 talk, the Clintons may be forever tied to those political caricatures of them created by right-wing media. Outside, a few stray Trump supporters still bothered to line the sidewalk to make their presence known. One held a Confederate flag. Another, William Garrison, 83, hadn\u2019t planned on protesting the Thursday night event. He\u2019d been on his way to purchase a bottle of wine when he noticed the hubbub, he said. \u201cThis is just a serendipity-type thing,\u201d he said as he held a towering Trump 2020 flag in his hands. \u201cI thought I would kind of join the party.\u201d When HuffPost asked why he would spend his night protesting two 70-somethings who no longer hold public office or even seek it, Garrison replied that he just hoped they\u2019d get their \u201ccomeuppance\u201d when the full Mueller report is released. Nearby, a group of Haitian protesters led a loud chant related to the Clintons\u2019 supposed mishandling of funds after a devastating 2010 earthquake left the country in shambles. \u201cWhere is the money?\u201d \u201cWhat money?\u201d \u201cHaiti\u2019s earthquake money!\u201d \u201cHow much money?\u201d \u201cSix billion dollars!\u201d One of them, Dahoud Andr\u00e9, 52, said the group had been protesting the Clintons since 2014. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the world to forget. The people who are coming here \u2015 we want them to know,\u201d he said. Raquele, a 20-year-old woman visiting the U.S. from Colombia who declined to give her last name, was taken aback by the \u201cconfrontational\u201d nature of the scene outside. She had received her ticket for free from someone who no longer wanted it and was slightly surprised that anyone would pay so much to watch two people talk, she said. The United States\u2019 political media infrastructure has changed dramatically since Bill Clinton was first elected governor of Arkansas in 1978, something Hillary Clinton noted on Thursday night. \u201cMake no mistake, there is a very big industry designed to feed false information to people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he ran for president, there was no Fox News.\u201d \u201cYou just diminished the significance of my victory,\u201d said Bill to cackles from the crowd. Just before the heckler spoke, the former president had been trying to explain the political shift to the right that has occurred in places like his hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas. \u201cThere are a lot of very smart, decent people out there who are a part of the Make America Great rallies,\u201d said Bill Clinton. \u201cPeople who feel that they\u2019re stuck in economic stagnation, social insignificance and political disempowerment.\u201d Later, he returned to that point. \u201cA lot of these people I talk to in Arkansas, they\u2019re not anti-gay rights. They\u2019re anti the fact that all the gay rights progress and all the sexual identity issues got 20 times more political coverage than the misery they were living through,\u201d he said. Bill Clinton had earlier clarified that he remains a steadfast supporter of women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. And later in the night, he also celebrated his wife\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together,\u201d which he said stood in stark contrast to the \u201cglobal Brexit phenomenon\u201d of \u201cethnic politics and anti-immigrant\u201d sentiment. But his subtle criticism of the Democrats\u2019 recent emphasis on identity politics \u2015 a swipe that others took at his wife\u2019s campaign in 2016 \u2015\u00a0also served as a gentle reminder that the Clintons themselves represent different eras in their party. Hillary Clinton, for her part, was asked why certain areas of the country have switched from Republican to Democratic, like the Chicago suburbs where she grew up. The economic reasons were complex and geographically specific. But the major point was not. \u201cThis is a debate we should be having in a civil, respectful way \u2015 and instead we have really drawn lines where people are on one side or the other and almost afraid to talk with or listen to somebody of a different political affiliation,\u201d she said. She returned to the issue of political civility throughout the night, referencing her work with Republicans after the Sept. 11 attacks, as well as her strategy as secretary of state for maintaining a healthy working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cYou have to keep working to try to find common ground that is good for you, both of your people and the future,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. Perhaps the crowd felt nostalgic for a bygone political era when bipartisanship was at least a superficial goal. But those who spoke to HuffPost were also well aware of the Clintons\u2019 diminished stature in the political world. Liz Bostian, 58, was a steadfast Hillary supporter in 2016, she said. But this time around, she isn\u2019t sure if the Clintons\u2019 endorsement would \u201churt or help\u201d a Democratic candidate. \u201cI kind of feel like I need them to go away for this cycle,\u201d she said. \u201cJust this one cycle.\u201d Sneha Goud, a 30-year-old writer in Brooklyn, said she loves the Clintons, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to hear them speak.\u201d But she also said she understands why the Democratic Party is distancing itself from them right now. \u201cThe climate is not good for them. I understand why they\u2019re not selling tickets,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if it would be good for the nominee for them to endorse anyone.\u201d \u201cI would listen to them,\u201d Goud added. \u201cBut I do not know if the general public would. And I do not want to harm the nominee.\u201d Daniel Marans contributed reporting.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump spent Thursday morning running through his greatest hits over Twitter: \u201cno collusion,\u201d \u201cno obstruction\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton is a criminal.\u201d As the American public was just about to get its first look at special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s full (albeit redacted) report on Russian interference in the 2016 election,\u00a0Trump launched into a Twitter campaign in an attempt to vindicate himself for the two years of investigation that cast a dark cloud over his presidency. While Attorney General William Barr wrapped up a press conference addressing Mueller\u2019s findings, Trump posted an image-only tweet showing himself, in a black overcoat, turning away into a plume of dusty smoke that strangely mirrored imagery used to promote \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d \u201cNO COLLUSION. NO OBSTRUCTION. FOR THE HATERS AND THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS \u2015 GAME OVER,\u201d the graphic read, in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2013styled font. Once again, the president of the United States had appeared to co-opt HBO\u2019s hit drama to market himself. Once again, the network is not terribly pleased. \u201cThough we can understand the enthusiasm for \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 now that the final season has arrived, we still prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes,\u201d HBO said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Oddly, the president has chosen to place himself in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d promos that appear to most closely resemble those featuring the Night King, the show\u2019s undead villain. Trump previously used the \u201cThrones\u201d\u2013style imagery back in November, when he announced he would reimpose sanctions on Iran. That image similarly used a cutout of Trump over billowing grey smoke but was adorned with the words, \u201cSANCTIONS ARE COMING.\u201d At the time, HBO responded pithily over Twitter, writing, \u201cHow do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?\u201d (There are several mythical languages in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d including Dothraki.) The sanctions image later appeared in a January Cabinet meeting, lying on a table in actual, printed form while no one talked about it. Shortly afterward, the president tweeted another image, twisting the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d House Stark mantra \u201cwinter is coming\u201d into a reference to his biggest campaign promise:\u00a0\u201cTHE WALL IS COMING.\u201d The Mueller report did not conclude that Trump or anyone in his campaign colluded with Russians during the 2016 presidential election or obstructed federal investigators\u2019 work, but it did describe in detail a long series troubling actions by the president and those around him. Nevertheless, Trump says he\u2019s been having \u201ca good day.\u201d",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " FBI agents received reports in 2017 that the leader of a right-wing militia that has been detaining immigrants in New Mexico\u00a0had said then that his group was \u201ctraining\u201d to kill former President Barack Obama, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros, according to an FBI affidavit. The affidavit was part of the criminal complaint against Larry Mitchell Hopkins, who was arrested Saturday on a federal complaint charging him with being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition.\u00a0Hopkins appeared Monday in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Hopkins, 69, is the \u201ccommander\u201d of the United Constitutional Patriots, whose armed members are seen in the group\u2019s videos posted recently on social media that show them rounding up and holding immigrants in New Mexico until border agents arrive. The FBI began investigating Hopkins after receiving reports in 2017 of \u201calleged militia extremist activity\u201d in northwestern New Mexico, according to the affidavit by FBI special agent David Gabriel. According to the affidavit, \u201cHopkins allegedly made the statement that the United Constitutional Patriots were training to assassinate\u00a0George Soros,\u00a0Hillary Clinton, and\u00a0Barack Obama because of these individuals\u2019 support of Antifa,\u201d a shortened name for left-wing anti-fascist activists. Soros is a philanthropist and Democratic donor who is a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. \u201cInformation also was conveyed that the group had its \u2018base\u2019 at Hopkins\u2019s residence, was supported by approximately 20 members, and was armed with AK-47 rifles and other firearms,\u201d Gabriel stated. Hopkins\u2019 lawyer, Kelly O\u2019Connell, told The New York Times that the reports of assassination plans were \u201cnot true.\u201d The affidavit stated that agents found 10 weapons in Hopkins\u2019 Los Flores, New Mexico, home during a search in November 2017 \u2014 including handguns and a 12-gauge shotgun \u2014 which he claimed belonged to his common-law wife. It wasn\u2019t clear why Hopkins\u2019 arrest occurred more than a year later. Federal authorities refused to explain why Hopkins is just now being charged. New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas called Hopkins a\u00a0dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families\u201d following his arrest Saturday. Balderas said the \u201crule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes.\u201d Hopkins was previously convicted of felony firearm possession and felony impersonating of a peace officer. He was arrested just days after the UCP posted a video showing members, some of them armed, apparently holding hundreds of immigrants, including children. After receiving an alarming letter about the group\u2019s actions from the American Civil Liberties Union, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham demanded the militia stand down, calling members\u2019 actions \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d UCP spokesman Jim Benvie told The New York Times last week that the militia\u2019s actions are legal and compared them to a \u201cverbal citizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d He also said in a video posted to Facebook that border patrol agents are \u201chappy\u201d for the militia\u2019s help. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that CBP \u201cdoes not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.\u201d It added that interference by civilians \u201ccould have public safety and legal consequences for all parties involved.\u201d Hopkins also goes by the name of the late singer Johnny Horton Jr. \u201cJohnny\u201d often runs the militia\u2019s radio program. In a segment last month, he appealed for more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to \u201ccapture\u201d immigrants. He pleaded for donations for the group. \u201cWe\u2019re down to nothing,\u201d he said. PayPal and GoFundMe have both blocked fundraising efforts by the group. Hopkins\u2019 next court appearance is scheduled for April 29 in Albuquerque.",

Warren laughed at the student\u2019s use of \u201cHillary\u2019d\u201d before referencing her 2012 senate race, which she won against incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown. The senator said she was encouraged by other Democrats to run against Brown, but most blatantly told her that she shouldn\u2019t expect to actually win. \u201cPeople said to me you\u2019re gonna lose because Massachusetts in 2011, according to conventional wisdom, was not ready to have a woman senator or governor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never had and people said it\u2019s just not gonna happen. Not at least for another generation.\u201d Warren said the comments only made her more intent on winning the Senate seat, but that didn\u2019t stop the sexist coverage of her campaign. \u201cI jumped in the race and, sure enough, the early coverage, it\u2019s about what I\u2019m wearing, it\u2019s about my hair, it\u2019s about my voice, it\u2019s about whether or not I smiled enough\u00a0\u2014 I didn\u2019t,\u201d she added, to laughter from the audience.

It should be something undertaken in a really serious ... way based on evidence,\u201d she continued. Though some Democrats, including 2020 presidential contenders Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), have made concrete statements in support of impeaching Trump, Pelosi has taken a more measured approach. In a letter to her colleagues Monday, Pelosi acknowledged efforts to seek impeachment against the president in light of the \u201chighly unethical and unscrupulous behavior\u201d conducted by Trump, as laid out in the Mueller report. \u201cAs you know, last Thursday\u2019s release of the redacted Mueller Report has caused a public outcry for truth and accountability,\u201d Pelosi said in her letter.\u00a0\u201cWhile our views range from proceeding to investigate the finding of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth.\u201d Clinton on Tuesday compared a potential Trump impeachment to the impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Many public hearings involving Nixon administration officials took place before the House initiated impeachment proceedings against him, she noted. As a staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee at the time, Clinton researched the historical grounds for impeachment and helped draft a memo on what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201cI have a kind of weird personal history about impeachment,\u201d Clinton said during the Time summit. \u201cIt took several years for the slow acquisition and the publication of information to show the level of corruption and obstruction that was existing in [the Nixon] White House. ... By the end of it, the evidence was overwhelming.\u201d Clinton said the Mueller report \u201ccould not be more explicit\u201d in laying out evidence that Trump obstructed justice, adding that \u201cany other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted\u201d if not for the Justice Department determination that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nonetheless, she said, Congress must investigate and examine the evidence \u201cas objectively as possible\u201d before deciding to move forward with impeachment. \u201cI think Nancy is right to be cautious about making sure whatever is done in this Congress is more in accord with the very careful approach of 1973 and \u201974,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the Nixon impeachment proceedings. \u201cYou don\u2019t put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table. ... Instead, you say, \u2018We are going to proceed with the seriousness this demands.\u2019\u201d",

The investigations that our committees will conduct will take us down a fact-finding path, and everyone should welcome that.\u201d The comments came after Pelosi sent a letter to fellow Democrats on Monday acknowledging many of her colleagues\u2019 efforts to seek Trump\u2019s impeachment in light of the president\u2019s \u201chighly unethical and unscrupulous behavior,\u201d which was detailed in a report on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. \u201cAs you know, last Thursday\u2019s release of the redacted Mueller Report has caused a public outcry for truth and accountability,\u201d the House speaker\u2019s letter stated. \u201cWhile our views range from proceedings to investigate the finding of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth.\u201d Earlier Tuesday at the Time 100 Summit, Hillary Clinton said in an interview that she agreed with Pelosi\u2019s remarks Monday. \u201cI think Nancy is right to be cautious about making sure whatever is done in this Congress is more in accord with the very careful approach of 1973 and \u201974,\u201d the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee said, referring to former President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment proceedings. \u201cYou don\u2019t put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table .\u2026 Instead, you say, \u2018We are going to proceed with the seriousness this demands.\u2019\u201d Pelosi and Clinton both spoke at the Tuesday event after Pelosi was named in Time magazine\u2019s annual list of the 100 most influential people last week. Trump also appears on the list. Some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have made direct statements calling to impeach Trump now, while other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have carefully said Trump should face impeachment proceedings. But Pelosi has remained measured in her stance on pursuing impeachment since before the Mueller report. Pelosi has called the potential impeachment proceedings \u201cdivisive.\u201d In March, the House speaker told The Washington Post that Trump is \u201cjust not worth\u201d the division that would result from his impeachment. In February 2017, Pelosi said the president\u2019s behavior is \u201cstrategically incoherent\u201d but \u201cnot grounds for impeachment.\u201d \u201cImpeachment is a step that you have to take bringing the American people with you,\u201d Pelosi said Tuesday. \u201cAgain, without prejudice, without passion, without partisanship, but with a presentation of facts.\u201d",

Appearing with former President Bill Clinton in the video, Hillary Clinton\u00a0read from the special counsel\u2019s redacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The video was shown Saturday night at a speaking event the Clintons held in Washington, D.C., where the couple talked about the future of politics. In his video, Klepper said he was inspired to contribute to crowdfunding campaigns after seeing an online fundraiser receive more than $2 million to rebuild several historically black churches in Louisiana that were destroyed this month by suspected arson. While scrolling through online fundraisers with the Clintons, Klepper came across a GoFundMe campaign that was raising money for Hillary Clinton to record an audiobook of the Mueller report, which was released this month and is hundreds of pages long. \u201cGosh, I would definitely contribute to that,\u201d Clinton said, adding that she would need \u201clots and lots of lozenges.\u201d The former secretary of state gave it some tries, reading the report\u2019s conclusion about whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election. Klepper told Clinton in the video to read the report \u201clike you mean it.\u201d \u201cSecretary Clinton, feel it. Feel it,\u201d Klepper coached. \u201cJust imagine, like you have a history with this.\u201d \u201cThe investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency, and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally,\u201d Clinton read out loud as stringed instruments played in the background. She continued, in her best Trump impression: \u201cThe president slumped back in his chair and said, \u2018Oh, my God, this is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m fucked.\u2019\u201d The last word was bleeped in the video. The Clintons also told Klepper in the video that Attorney General William Barr misrepresented the report in his four-page summary of it, and joked that they should create a Kickstarter campaign to send Barr \u201cback to law school for continuing legal education.\u201d At last week\u2019s Time 100 summit, Clinton said the Mueller report \u201ccould not be more explicit\u201d in laying out evidence that the president obstructed justice. She said that anyone who \u201cengaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted\u201d if not for the Justice Department\u2019s ruling that a sitting president cannot be indicted.",

      "content": " Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Republican lawmakers Wednesday for refusing to fully investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election because they know it aided them and helped to elect President Donald Trump. She told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow that if the shoe was on the other foot, however, those same lawmakers would no doubt react very differently. As an example, she offered a hypothetical. \u201cImagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show and that person said, \u2018Y\u2019know, the only other adversary of ours, who\u2019s anywhere near as good as the Russians, is China. So why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don\u2019t we ask China to back us?\u2019\u201d Then, she got even more specific, using Trump\u2019s own words from when he called on Russia to hack her, just paraphrased slightly. \u201cChina, if you\u2019re listening, why don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns?\u201d Clinton said in this hypothetical scenario. \u201cI\u2019m sure our media would richly reward you.\u201d During a 2016 news conference, Trump infamously said:\u00a0\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d Clinton said that, according to special counsel Robert Muller\u2019s report, such a call wouldn\u2019t be considered criminal conspiracy even if China hacked the IRS and delivered those returns to a WikiLeaks-like organization because it took place in the open.\u00a0That\u2019s what happened in 2016 when Russia hacked email accounts of people close to Clinton and delivered the messages to WikiLeaks after Trump openly called on them to hack his rival. \u201cJust saying that shows how absurd the situation we find ourselves in,\u201d Clinton said. She said that Republicans like to mention her whenever they want a distraction from real issues, such as Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump\u2019s obstruction. \u201cThat\u2019s the real story. That\u2019s what they don\u2019t want the American people thinking about,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo when in doubt, say something wild about me.\u201d Clinton also noted that Trump\u2019s obsession with her meant that she was \u201cliving rent-free\u201d inside the president\u2019s brain. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a very nice place to be, I can tell you that,\u201d she added.

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " In one of the most damning and memorable exchanges of William Barr\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked the attorney general whether President Donald Trump has suggested that he investigate anyone. Barr, fumbling over his words, claimed that he did not know. As it turns out, Trump has publicly called on the Department of Justice, since Barr took control, to open an investigation into his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and also a potential future opponent: former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump suggested to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity\u00a0last week that Barr should open an investigation into whether Clinton\u2019s campaign received help from the Ukrainian government during the 2016 election based on information allegedly gathered by the top Ukrainian prosecutor. The president\u2019s desired investigation could also ensnare Biden through the former vice president\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s business with a Ukrainian oligarch, according to The New York Times. Hunter Biden, a former U.S. lobbyist and international corporate consultant, was hired by Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, and placed on the company\u2019s board in 2014. The head of Burisma fled the country after President Viktor Yanukovich was deposed in the Maidan revolution later that year and the company\u2019s business practices came under investigation by prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. But Western European nations, transnational economic organizations and the United States sought Shokin\u2019s removal. They argued that Shokin was letting corruption slide in the new, post-Yanukovich Ukraine. Shokin did open some corruption investigations, but only into former Yanukovich-connected elites \u2015 including Burisma Holdings. As part of the West\u2019s campaign to remove Shokin, Vice President Biden visited Ukraine and said corruption was eating the country \u201clike a cancer.\u201d The International Monetary Fund threatened to cut off aid unless it took action on corruption. Ukraine\u2019s parliament voted Shokin out of office. And with it went the investigation into Burisma. The Bidens have claimed that they never discussed Hunter\u2019s work for Burisma and the effort to remove Shokin did not originate from the vice president, according to the report by The New York Times. But the new Ukrainian prosecutor general recently reopened the investigation into Burisma. And Trump\u2019s allies are seeking to publicize the issue and foment an investigation in the U.S. This effort is led by Rudy Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s lawyers. \u201cI would imagine [Barr] would want to see\u201d the results of the Ukrainian investigation, Trump told Hannity on April 26. I would certainly defer to the attorney general, and we\u2019ll see what he says about it,\u201d he added. Harris\u2019 question to Barr about whether the president \u201csuggested\u201d he open an investigation into anyone was clearly pegged to Trump\u2019s public pursuit of an investigation that would touch both Clinton and Biden. When Barr got stuck on the word \u201csuggest,\u201d he could have been trying to figure out how to describe the president\u2019s indirect suggestion transmitted through a television program. This is not the first time Trump has sought to abuse his power and get the Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents for his own political benefit. He previously asked ex-attorney general Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton and has publicly called for investigations of Democrats, including for treason. President Richard Nixon faced impeachment for ordering the IRS and the security state to target his political opponents.",

      "content": " \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Voters care more about electability than anything else.\u201d That statement sums up what appears to be the dominant feeling among Democratic primary voters this cycle. Except that quote, spoken by then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to Newsweek, is from 2004. Electability has been front and center since former Vice President Joe Biden officially entered the presidential race last week, pitching himself as the person best able to defeat President Donald Trump. He quickly jumped to a wide lead in polls of the Democratic race. But candidates should beware: History is littered with men (and a woman) who campaigned on electability and eventually lost out. And electability is a measurement that often seems to benefit male candidates. Few presidential nominating campaigns were as devoted to the electability premise as the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries. Those who had already cast ballots in Iowa and New Hampshire \u201ctold us that electability was a big issue, so we\u2019re going to take just a few moments at the beginning to talk about how the race has changed,\u201d NBC\u2019s Tom Brokaw said at the beginning of a debate ahead of the South Carolina primary. The race ultimately winnowed down to two candidates: \u201cMr. Electable\u201d (Sen. John Kerry of Massachusets) and \u201cMr. Likable\u201d (Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina), according to The New York Times. A decorated Vietnam War veteran and an experienced lawmaker with foreign policy expertise and a record of bipartisan work on veteran\u2019s issues with the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Kerry appeared to many frightened Democratic voters to be the perfect challenger for President George W. Bush in the post-9/11 period of belligerent nationalism. Mr. Electable won the primary \u2015 but lost the general election. Kerry\u2019s selection may have the most explicit moment in contemporary times where primary voters chose the \u201cmost electable\u201d candidate \u2015 over other considerations \u2015 who then went on to lose. But it wasn\u2019t the first or the last. Former Vice President Walter Mondale wrapped up major endorsements from Democratic Party interest groups early in the 1984 election cycle because they believed he could beat President Ronald Reagan. \u201c\u2019They believe that Mondale is electable,\u201d Donna Brazile, then an adviser to Rev. Jesse Jackson, said after the National Organization for Women endorsed Mondale in 1983. Mondale won Minnesota, his home state, and Washington, D.C., in the 1984 election \u2015 and lost everywhere else in the Reagan landslide. In the 2016 Democratic race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made electability the issue as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rose in the polls ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cWho\u2019s the one candidate who can stop\u201d the Republicans? one Clinton campaign ad asked. The answer: Clinton. In the general election, she won the popular vote, but, of course, lost the White House to Trump. The thing is, Kerry, Mondale and Clinton were electable. (Okay, maybe Mondale had no shot.) So were GOP presidential nominees Mitt Romney, Bob Dole and McCain, and Democratic nominees Michael Dukakis and Al Gore. Clinton and Gore even won the popular vote! But they still didn\u2019t become president. And their closest contenders in the primary contests all made electability arguments to promote their own candidacies, as well. Gore, running against Dukakis in 1988, said that only a Southern Democrat could win the White House. Edwards made the same pitch in 2004 against Kerry with a little bit of his personal background thrown in: \u201cI am more electable because I know what it\u2019s like to grow up in a working-class family.\u201d In that same Democratic campaign, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut also pitched his electability.\u00a0\u201cI have the capacity not only to unite Democrats, but to get independents and disgruntled Republicans to come together so I can actually get elected and defeat George Bush,\u201d he said at a candidate debate. \u201cI have demonstrated that I am more electable than Walter Mondale,\u201d Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who almost snatched the 1984 nomination from Mondale, said near the end of his campaign. In the 1992 Democratic race, California Gov. Jerry Brown depicted himself as the party\u2019s best choice by attacking then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton as having an \u201celectability problem.\u201d In the same race, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey claimed he was the most electable because of his Vietnam War service. Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin similarly offered himself as the candidate with the best chance of unseating President George H.W. Bush. It is extremely rare for the two major political parties to nominate an unelectable candidate. The most recent examples occurred when Republicans chose Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Democrats picked George McGovern in 1972 \u2015 both too extreme in their views for vast swaths of voters. Goldwater may have been overwhelmed by President Lyndon Johnson, but he was a harbinger of the coming conservative era; McGovern\u2019s thumping by President Richard Nixon helped create a generational chasm among Democrats that plagued the party for several more political cycles. It is an almost impossible task to determine who is electable when most of the options are. Indeed, some of those labeled as unelectable turn out to be winners. Bill Clinton withstood attacks from Brown about his electability, won the Democratic primary in fairly easy fashion and then withstood a barrage of attacks over his infidelity and business deals to win the White House. Barack Obama\u2019s full name \u2015 Barack Hussein Obama \u2015 and race were raised as reasons why he would be unelectable. So were his connections to ex-Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers and Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi. Reagan was deemed too conservative to win the 1980 election by both the media and Republican Party bigwigs. Reagan \u201cis perceived as a most conservative Republican,\u201d former President Gerald Ford said in 1979. \u201cA very conservative Republican can\u2019t win in a national election.\u201d \u201cMr. Reagan would be a sure-loser in November,\u201d Ford added. And, of course, there\u2019s the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. No one thought Donald Trump was electable at first. A thrice-married adulterer famous for playing a rich person on television who called Mexicans rapists and murderers; called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering\u201d the U.S.; talked about how sexually attractive his daughter is; and boasted on tape of using his fame to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d couldn\u2019t be elected! Right? But there he is. The 45th president of the United States. Maybe electability isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.",

Posts from ultra-conservative website Breitbart News, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham\u00a0(R-S.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, all figured in the avalanche of retweets. Trump also retweeted this 2018 post from his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. And this one from former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is Trump Jr.\u2019s girlfriend and a member of Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. Trump even resorted at one point to retweeting himself: Trump has used retweet swarms on at least two previous occasions this month. On May 1, he deployed the tactic to defend himself following the International Association of Fire Fighters\u2019 endorsement of Democratic presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, last Saturday, he swarmed again to criticize social media companies for de-platforming far-right extremists.",

But the sit-down never materialized. \u201cWhat if Hillary had come on and, forget politics for a second, but what if we could have talked about her humanity, why she got into public service?\u201d asked Stern, who declared his support for Clinton ahead of the election despite his long history of inviting Trump to appear on his show. He then suggested some questions he could have asked to \u201chumanize\u201d her: \u201cHere is a woman who dedicated her whole life to public service. What was her life like as a little girl growing up? What was her romance with Bill Clinton? What was she thinking when she was Secretary of State? What was she thinking when she was the First Lady? Was she saying to herself \u2018I wish I could be president\u2019 or was she satisified with that? There were a million questions I could have asked her that I think would have humanized her.\u201d Check out the clip here: In another part of the interview, Stern claimed Trump had only run for president as \u201ca gimmick\u201d to boost his reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted to be the president. I knew him,\u201d said Stern, who was promoting his new memoir Howard Stern Comes Again. \u201cHe had a great life at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d he added of Trump. \u201cHe was running around town. He played golf. He had a good time.\u201d Check out that segment here:",

On Friday, The Washington Post debunked the footage as a hit job, though its origins remain unclear.\u00a0A version shared on a Facebook page called Politics WatchDog continued to remain available with 2.6 million views as of Saturday, and the social media platform has no plans to take it down. Though the company has vowed to combat the sharing of fake news on its site, in a statement to The Guardian, a company spokesperson said it was trying to uphold free speech by leaving the edited clip up: There\u2019s a tension here: we work hard to find the right balance between encouraging free expression and promoting a safe and authentic community, and we believe that reducing the distribution of inauthentic content strikes that balance. But just because something is allowed to be on Facebook doesn\u2019t mean it should get distribution.

On Twitter, the video was shared by the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who later deleted his post then tweeted out an unintelligible comment\u00a0appearing to defend his decision to spread the footage.

      "content": " Fox News host Laura Ingraham featured white supremacist Paul Nehlen in a graphic of \u201cprominent voices censored on social media\u201d on her show \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d on Thursday night, and some are outraged. In one segment, Ingraham claims that recent criticisms from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about Facebook proliferating doctored videos are part of a plan by liberals to \u201csilence conservative voices\u201d ahead of the 2020 election. Ingraham talked about this claim with conservative commentator Candace Owens, who said that this is \u201cjust the way the internet works\u201d and insisted that Clinton\u2019s and Pelosi\u2019s remarks are an attempt to silence voters. Owens went on to say that silencing and banning conservatives \u201cworks for us,\u201d because \u201cwhen you ban somebody\u2019s favorite political commentator ... they double down and dig their heels in.\u201d Ingraham then featured a graphic of \u201cprominent voices censored on social media\u201d that included Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Owens, Michelle Malkin, Dan Scavino, James Woods and Nehlen. Nehlen is a notable inclusion as he\u2019s a white nationalist\u00a0so racist and anti-Semitic that he was kicked off Twitter\u00a0and Gab. The Republican Party of Wisconsin even\u00a0cut ties with him after his Twitter suspension, and\u00a0a state party spokesman said\u00a0he had \u201cno place in the Republican Party.\u201d HuffPost was the first to confront Nehlen about his open embrace of explicit white nationalism back in 2017, and as of April 2018,\u00a0The Daily Beast\u00a0declared that he was becoming one of the highest-profile white nationalists in America. Just some of his horrifying behavior includes his open support for the white supremacists who marched at the 2017 \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where an attende drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters and killed anti-racist activist Heather Heyer; he also has a locked Telegram channel where he calls himself \u201cUncle Paul\u2019 and \u201cshares memes praising mass murderers as religious heroes.\u201d The site Angry White Men, a blog that tracks white supremacists, has \ufefflong documented Nehlen\u2019s history of racist and anti-Semitic posts on social media. A recent entry in April of this year involved a report on Nehlen arguing with another white supremacist about the best way to start a race war. Considering his background, Ingraham\u2019s inclusion of Nehlen on a list of \u201cprominent voices\u201d was shocking for many on social media. Here\u2019s what people had to say: JFC. This is insane. Paul Nehlen is a white nationalist and an anti-Semite.https://t.co/spt7AmG5K4 It\u2019s unclear whether Ingraham\u2019s inclusion of Nehlen will spark advertisers to leave her show, which has happened before. Numerous companies fled the show\u00a0last year after she mocked\u00a0David Hogg, a survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left\u00a017 people dead. HuffPost has reached out to Ingraham\u2019s advertisers and will update this report accordingly. Thus far, Netsuite has declined to comment on its status with Ingraham and her show. A spokesperson for the Starkist tuna brand said:\u00a0\u201cWe do not endorse individual opinions. Our television ads appear on a number of cable networks as part of our national media buy.\u201d Abhi Lokesh, CEO of the photo printing service Fracture, published a blog post Friday saying the company would cease running advertisements on Ingraham\u2019s show. \u201cLast night one of our ads aired during an episode of The Ingraham Angle during which Laura Ingraham expressed alarming views that run entirely counter to the values that we hold as a company. We are taking this matter very seriously and as a result we are taking swift action,\u201d the post says. Lokesh also added that the company believes in \u201cfreedom of speech, but we certainly don\u2019t have to support hate speech with our advertising dollars.\u201d UPDATE:\u00a02:15 p.m. \u2014\u00a0Fox News defended the segment in a statement released Friday, saying that \u201cit is obscene to suggest that Laura Ingraham was defending Paul Nehlen\u2019s despicable actions.\u201d This story has been updated with statements from Starkist and Fracture.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u2019s brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The 2016 presidential candidate broke the news in a tweet Saturday, mourning his passing. \u201cWe lost my brother Tony last night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today. When he walked into a room he\u2019d light it up with laughter. He was kind, generous, & a wonderful husband to Megan & father to Zach, Simon, & Fiona. We\u2019ll miss him very much.\u201d Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh Rodham and Dorothy Howell, and was the youngest of their three children. Like his sister, Rodham also became politically involved, working for the Democratic National Convention in 1992 as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton launched his successful presidential bid. In 2007, Rodham joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton appears to have had a sometimes strained relationship with Rodham, who along with his brother Hugh had jokingly become known to Clinton\u2019s White House aides as \u201cThe Brothers Rodham,\u201d according to Politico. In 2015, the outlet reported that during Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, Rodham pushed the agency to approve visas. But that wasn\u2019t all. In 1999, a Washington Post article detailed the brothers\u2019 \u201cembarrassing business venture\u201d in which they attempted to turn a profit from harvesting hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The enterprise reportedly angered then-national security adviser Sandy Berger as Aslan Abashidze, a local politician in the port city of Batumi, claimed it was an indication of \u201cpolitical support\u201d from Bill Clinton himself. Abashidze was a rival of then-Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, a U.S. ally who became irked as a result. Eventually, Berger pressured the Rodham brothers into dropping the project altogether. In 2001, The New York Times revealed\u00a0that during the end of the Clinton administration, Rodham had convinced his brother-in-law, who was serving as president, to override Justice Department objections and pardon Edgar Allen Gregory Jr. and wife Vonna Jo Gregory, a Tennessee couple found guilty of bank fraud. A congressional probe subsequently discovered that the duo had paid Rodham nearly $250,000 for work as a \u201cconsultant\u201d while they attempted to secure the pardon. In 2016, Rodham briefly appeared with Hillary Clinton during a campaign\u00a0visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where their father was born and raised. Rodham had three children, two with wife Megan Madden, whom he married in 2005, four years after his divorce from wife Nicole Boxer, the daughter of former California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Rodham and Boxer share a son, Zach. The cause of death has not yet been made public. Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect more accurately the parentage of Rodham\u2019s children.",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " Until he abruptly reversed course Thursday, 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden was seeking to become the first Democratic presidential nominee since President Jimmy Carter to support the law banning the use of federal funds on abortion services. Though nominees through the decades had varied stances on choice \u2015 from John Kerry\u2019s \u201cpersonally pro-life\u201d dance to Hillary Clinton\u2019s full-throated support for reproductive freedom \u2015 they each came out in support of repealing the Hyde Amendment\u2019s ban on federal funding for abortion services even if, like Biden, they had to flip-flop. Carter was the first Democratic Party presidential candidate to take a position on the federal funding of abortion services. The Hyde Amendment was enacted by Congress during the 1976 presidential campaign and would be up for renewal in 1977. This was also the first presidential campaign since the Supreme Court legalized abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. A devout evangelical Christian, Carter took what would become a common abortion position for Democratic presidential nominees. He was personally opposed to abortion but would respect the court\u2019s constitutional interpretation legalizing the practice. But Carter went a bit further. He also supported the Hyde Amendment\u2019s ban on Medicaid funding being used for abortion services. \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe the federal government ought to finance abortions,\u201d Carter said at an October 1976 presidential debate. He continued to stake out this position while in office, particularly after a series of Supreme Court decisions said that the federal government had no obligation to fund abortion services. But he did endorse exceptions to the federal ban for rape, incest and the life of the mother. At the same time, he made callous statements about the federal funding ban that outraged women\u2019s rights advocates both inside and outside his administration. When asked about how the Hyde Amendment made it harder for poor women to access abortion services that rich women could easily afford, Carter gave a characteristic response: \u201cWell, as you know, there are many things in life that are not fair, that wealthy people can afford and poor people can\u2019t. But I don\u2019t believe that the federal government should take action to try to make those opportunities exactly equal, particularly when there is a moral factor.\u201d The National Organization for Women refused to endorse his reelection, even against Ronald Reagan, the first full-throated anti-abortion major party presidential nominee. Reagan\u2019s reelection opponent Walter Mondale, Carter\u2019s vice president, was a big supporter of abortion rights who endorsed dumping the Hyde Amendment. But the Republican Party spent more energy attacking his vice presidential pick Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman on a major party presidential ticket, as she was an outspoken pro-choice Catholic. A big part of the party\u2019s strategy since Nixon involved peeling off urban and suburban white Catholic voters from their traditional Democratic Party allegiance and highlighting the apparent contradiction between the Church and Ferraro was a way to play to these voters. (It also helped underline opposition to abortion rights as an extension of anti-feminism.) Democrats\u2019 1988 nominee Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was also a pro-choice opponent of the Hyde Amendment, although he couched his support for abortion rights within his personal religious opposition to abortion. Dukakis prevailed over a number of opponents in the Democratic Party primary who did support the Hyde Amendment. At the party\u2019s nominating convention a section was added to its platform that, for the first time, however euphemistically, called for repealing the Hyde Amendment, \u201cthe fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.\u201d Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton won the party\u2019s nomination in 1992. Like Carter, Clinton was a Southern governor who backed middle-ground social positions that conformed to his increasingly conservative state, including on abortion. As governor, he had opposed spending federal funds on abortions except in the cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother and signed legislation requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion. Those positions quickly softened in the Democratic Party primary. As the party\u2019s nominee, Clinton openly called for getting rid of the Hyde Amendment and argued that the national health care plan he was running on would provide funding for abortion services. Reproductive rights advocates welcomed Clinton\u2019s shift. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to back these kinds of pragmatic, get-along compromises in a conservative state,\u201d Harriett Woods, then-president of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, told the Associated Press in 1992. \u201cNow he is a national candidate responsible for a broader majority. I\u2019m pleased that he\u2019s growing.\u201d In office, Clinton proposed ending the Hyde Amendment by excluding it from the budgets he submitted to Congress. The legislature, however, did not rescind the rule, but instead loosened it to allow exceptions for rape and incest. (The Hyde Amendment already provided an exception for the life of the mother.) Clinton\u2019s health care plan would have paid for abortion coverage, but it too ran aground in Congress. Al Gore, Clinton\u2019s vice president, had a harder time squaring his reversal on the Hyde Amendment when he ran for president in 2000. In his first run for Congress, Gore sought to differentiate himself from his father, a famous liberal Southern senator, by taking more conservative positions. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a woman\u2019s freedom to live her own life, in all cases, outweighs the fetus\u2019s right to life,\u201d he said on the primary campaign trail in 1976 bid for Tennessee\u2019s 6th congressional district. By the time Gore made it to the Senate in 1985 he had adopted more pro-choice positions, including claiming he had always backed Roe v. Wade. But he continued to oppose federal funding for abortions. That was until Clinton chose him to be his vice president. Gore faced questions about his support for the Hyde Amendment immediately. He said that he still opposed federal funding for abortions, but he supported the use of federal money for abortion services in Clinton\u2019s proposed national health care plan. In the 2000 presidential campaign, Gore called for ending the Hyde Amendment. Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore\u2019s lone primary opponent, attacked him for flip-flopping on this issue. Bradley argued that Gore\u2019s past positions on abortion made him an anachronistic choice for a more modern and liberal Democratic Party and his flip-flopping made him untrustworthy. Gore said that he had \u201calways, always, always\u201d supported Roe v. Wade, but had changed his mind on his support for the Hyde Amendment after it was shown to him that the policy produced \u201can inequitable result.\u201d (This is practically identical to what has happened with Biden.) Abortion rights advocates came to Gore\u2019s defense. \u201cThe fact that he evolved doesn\u2019t make him any less pro-choice than a Bradley or anyone else,\u201d Kate Michelman, then-president of NARAL, said in 2000. This evolution, or flip-flop, however you want to cut it, fed into the media-driven narrative that Gore was inauthentic while his opponent, George W. Bush, the Yale legacy child of a wealthy century-old political dynasty, was someone you could have a beer with (even though Bush was a recovering alcoholic). Kerry\u2019s 2004 challenge to Bush featured attacks on him as both an inauthentic flip-flopper like Gore and, as with Ferraro, being a pro-choice Catholic. Unlike Gore, Kerry had a long record of support for abortion rights and repeatedly voted against the Hyde Amendment. He did, however, argue that he was personally opposed to abortion, but did not let his personal religious views interfere with the exercise of the Constitution. \u201cNow, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro-abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights,\u201d Kerry said about his support for allowing federal funding for abortions. The Hyde Amendment did not come up much during the 2008 presidential campaign. Barack Obama\u2019s lone statement on the issue came from the Reproductive Health Reality Check questionnaire sent out by Rewire News: \u201cObama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman\u2019s decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors.\u201d When in office, however, Obama affirmed the Hyde Amendment as part of a compromise to pass the Affordable Care Act. A group of about a dozen anti-abortion House Democrats held up passage of Obama\u2019s landmark health care bill at the last minute with demands that no federal funds for the program be used to cover abortion services. To obtain their votes, which were needed, Obama agreed to sign an executive order affirming that the Hyde Amendment principles extended to the Affordable Care Act. Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, was a longtime supporter of abortion rights and made sure the party endorsed them openly. The 2016 Democratic Party platform was the first to ever explicitly call for the end of the Hyde Amendment. The Democratic convention also featured speakers openly discussing their abortions. This development appeared to indicate that the Democratic Party would take the polar opposite position of the Republican Party on abortion. It would make a full-throated defense of abortion rights and move to roll back the restrictions imposed by their opponents. That was until Biden jumped to the top of the 2020 polls. As history shows, Biden\u2019s since-changed position on the Hyde Amendment could have made him the first Democratic Party nominee in 40 years to hold such a belief. His evolution on the issue recalls Gore\u2019s shift of just 25 years ago. Perhaps, he\u2019ll catch up to 2016 before the primary ends.",

      "author": "Jonathan Cohn",
      "content": " DETROIT \u2015 Elizabeth Warren took her presidential campaign to the Midwest this week, starting with two stops in Michigan where she unveiled a $2 trillion \u201cgreen manufacturing\u201d proposal. The choice of locale had little to do with state\u2019s Democratic primary, which comes well into the cycle on March 10, and everything to do with symbolism. Michigan is among the politically critical states Donald Trump won narrowly in 2016. This was Warren\u2019s way of saying that she can win there by seizing one of his signature issues: bringing factory jobs back to the U.S. The Massachusetts senator has been doing a lot of that lately. She rolled out her opioid plan in West Virginia and Ohio, two states ravaged by the epidemic, and introduced a plan to protect public lands during a swing through Colorado and Utah. When it was time to sketch out a scheme to increase affordable housing, Warren toured low-income neighborhoods in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. These trips have organizing value, especially because of Warren\u2019s now-famous \u201cselfie lines,\u201d where she offers a photo to anybody willing to wait. (Just think of all the images bouncing around on social media pages.)\u00a0But it\u2019s the attention these trips generate for her policies, not the pictures, that best explains why Warren has been gaining ground. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the professional political class was ready to dismiss her. She couldn\u2019t shake the controversy over her statements about Native American heritage and, despite being well-known and beloved on the activist left, her poll numbers dipped \u2015 relegating her to the middle of the second tier, with a bunch of other candidates looking up at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. Now she has been on the cover of Time magazine\u00a0and her\u00a0poll numbers\u00a0are on the rise. Although she remains well behind the front-runners, a recent Economist/YouGov survey found 42% of Democratic voters were at least considering Warren for the primaries. It was the second highest of any Democrat, just behind Biden and just ahead of Sanders. (Over the weekend, a new Iowa poll\u00a0produced strikingly similar results.) At this early stage of the primary campaign, with so many voters still tuning in for the first time, that means a lot. But it is one thing to climb back into the Democratic race and quite another to win it, to say nothing of prevailing in November. And there are reasons to wonder just how far policy can take Warren, starting with what happened to the last brainy presidential candidate who ran on an ambitious, detailed campaign agenda.\u00a0Warren\u2019s mantra is \u201cI have a plan for that,\u201d but Hillary Clinton had plenty of plans too. In 2016, she still came up short in the Electoral College. Warren, though, is not Hillary. In fact, her approach to policy is more reminiscent of the other Clinton, Bill, back when he first ran for president in 1992. In the run-up to that election, Bill more or less invented the modern version of campaigning on policy, eventually publishing a book, \u201cPutting People First,\u201d that turned into a governing blueprint for his first years in office. As president, he became famous for policy-laden State of the Union speeches that consistently bored pundits and impressed the public, buoying him in moments of political peril. The idea that Warren has more in common with Bill than Hillary might seem odd, given that Warren\u2019s unabashedly liberal agenda is an explicit rejection\u00a0of the Democrats\u2019 governing philosophy in the 1990s \u2015 one that was openly apologetic about big government, relied heavily on free trade and free markets, and led to the regulatory changes in banking that first attracted Warren\u2019s ire and pushed her into politics. But on bread-and-butter issues, Bill in 1992 ran a thematically populist campaign that worked because of how it fit together, who he was, and the kind of leadership he was proposing to unseat. In other words, he had a coherent, credible story to tell. Warren does too. That story starts with Warren\u2019s upbringing in Oklahoma, in a family that sometimes faced financial difficulty, especially after her father, who had juggled a series of blue-collar jobs, had to stop working because of a heart attack. It is not a story of overcoming extraordinary struggle. It is a story of overcoming ordinary struggle, like losing the family station wagon, punctuated by occasional crises and bad decisions, like the time Warren left college early in order to marry a man she would later divorce. The bemused, sardonic way she reminisces about that episode \u2015 \u201cyou know it\u2019s a problem when you have to refer to the husbands by their number\u201d \u2015 probably rings true to the tens of millions of Americans who have gone through divorce, or at the very least a large portion of the women among them. These recollections, so well known to reporters and followers but still new to most Americans, do more than establish a connection with potential voters. They give Warren a natural platform for talking about policy, because she can attest personally to the importance of things like a high minimum wage (which is what her mom got when she was supporting the family), strong unions (which is how her brother got his pension), and cheap community colleges (which is how she eventually got her degree). Maybe the best known of these is the story she tells about her experience as a working mother, sobbing because she couldn\u2019t find decent child care and was preparing to quit her job, until her Aunt Bee saved her by moving in and taking care of the kids. \u201cIf everybody in the world had an Aunt Bee, we\u2019d all be fine,\u201d Warren said during an MSNBC town hall in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the day after her Michigan tour. \u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d Then Warren pivoted to her child care plan, which she says will guarantee affordable, quality care for all families with kids. One risk of proposing so many policies is that they come to seem scattershot, so that the whole ends up being a lot less than the sum of the parts. Warren has managed to avoid this so far, in part because she\u2019s got such a clear, strong overarching message to her campaign \u2015 that she is fighting to make sure government is on the side of low- and middle-income Americans, not the wealthy and powerful corporations out to exploit them. It\u2019s a familiar trope that works best with a foil. Bill Clinton in 1992 had the advantage of running against a patrician, seemingly aloof George H.W. Bush in the middle of a recession. Hillary had a much tougher time because she was running against Trump, who promised, as she did, to protect working-class Americans. Trump had a very specific kind of working-class American in mind, namely the white kind, but he made enough promises \u2015 like great health care for everyone \u2015 to undermine Hillary\u2019s claim to the populist mantle. Warren has the luxury of running against a different version of Trump, one that still talks like a populist but has the governing record of a plutocrat. He gave huge tax cuts to the rich. He made it easier for corporations to take jobs offshore. He tried to take\u00a0health insurance away from tens of millions of people. He\u2019s knee-deep in corruption. Of course every Democrat can (and does) make these attacks. Warren has the credibility of somebody whose political career started as a crusader against greedy, corrupt banks. And then there are the plans. It\u2019s obvious from the details of her proposals that she\u2019s consulted widely with experts and has thought through some of the tougher design questions, like how you actually make sure there are enough new child care providers and that they will be good at what they do. Much of this necessarily goes beyond what even most politically engaged voters grasp. That may not matter. At the Detroit rally, a working mother named Hallie Bard, from the suburb of Farmington, talked about how much Warren\u2019s child care plan meant to her, even though she didn\u2019t know much about how the plan would actually work. \u201cI have been dealing with this for 15 years,\u201d Bard said. \u201cIt has prohibited me from taking jobs occasionally, because my entire check would go to child care and I am not about to underpay someone to care for the most important people in my life. \u2026 It\u2019s important to me that she gets it, that she understands there needs to be a dedication to that.\u201d But as the campaign moves forward, not everyone will take to Warren or her agenda so kindly. There will be philosophical objections from conservatives wary of what would likely be the largest expansion of government in half a century. There will also be more practical objections, some outlandish and some not. Her wealth tax would apply to only the very richest Americans, even though Republicans are sure to imply otherwise when they attack it as a big tax hike. But it could genuinely be difficult to enforce \u2015 and, without the big sums she envisions it collecting, financing all of those great-sounding initiatives on education and health care gets more complicated. This is just one big danger of proposing so many policies: It creates so many targets for opponents to attack. Another is feasibility. She\u2019s one of the few Democrats who has called for ending the filibuster, which would stop a progressive agenda cold even if Democrats take the Senate. But she is also calling for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to vote and overturning Citizen United \u2015 steps that, however advisable, aren\u2019t happening anytime soon. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the formidable political hurdles Warren still faces, starting but not ending with the fact that a large number of Americans still have issues with women who have brains or ambition or, heaven forbid, both. That was trouble for Hillary Clinton and will just as surely be trouble for Warren too. It\u2019s a good sign for\u00a0Warren that she\u2019s drawing healthy crowds: 500 in Detroit and 1,700 in Lansing, her campaign said. But both were overwhelmingly white, even though Detroit\u00a0is the blackest city in America.\u00a0It\u2019s just one reminder that she draws support heavily from college-educated, white liberal voters \u2015 an important constituency in the Democratic Party, for sure, but hardly enough to secure the nomination. Warren has time, however, and under the right circumstances policy really can be a strong political asset. Years ago, in the middle of yet another Democratic presidential campaign, Mark Schmitt of the New America Foundation observed, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you say about the issues, it\u2019s what the issues say about you.\u201d\u00a0Right now, the issues say Warren knows who she is and what she wants to do. A pitch like that could take her far.",

The former secretary of state joked about being \u201cblessed with stamina\u201d to keep running through the president\u2019s mind in a Twitter exchange with Democratic former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 election, also dinged the president with a jibe about Infowars, the conspiracy theory website run by far-right personality Alex Jones.

Trump\u2019s targeting of Clinton during Tuesday\u2019s rally led to widespread mockery on Twitter, where many people accused him of failing to update his material. Former Rep.

      "author": "",
      "content": "COLUMBIA \u2014 As nearly two dozen Democratic presidential candidates here for a ritual fish fry event that marks the symbolic kickoff of the South Carolina campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be enjoying considerable early support, especially from the capital\u2019s tight-knit black community. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s \u201cWorld Famous Fish Fry\u201d gathers African-American party leaders, deep-pocketed Democratic donors, presidential candidates and reporters in a backyard-style cookout full of free food and hokey line dances during the state\u2019s customary Democratic weekend. While the state\u2019s black Democrats are hardly monolithic, interviews with prominent Democratic operatives and Columbia locals reflect what the polls already appear to indicate: Biden, in spite of his recent gaffes, appears to have a clear leg up with black voters here. And that support could prove crucial to clinching the eventual nomination. \u201cIf you\u2019re flirting with the idea or if you\u2019re running for president, there\u2019s two things you know: The road to heaven and the White House runs through South Carolina,\u201d said South Carolina based Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. \u201cAs you look holistically at the Democratic Party, that is a mere reflection, I think, of the current mood and temperature of the Democratic Party as a whole.\u201d Rep. Marcia Fudge, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, agreed. \u201cSouth Carolina really can change an election, because it\u2019s the first state of the first four or five states that has a large minority population. And everyone knows that black and brown people for the most part are the most loyal and consistent part of the Democratic base. So it\u2019s a test: If you can\u2019t win here, the odds are you can\u2019t do well in other places that have large minority populations.\u201d Seawright touted the area\u2019s African-American and women voters, who turn out, in his estimation, at rates of 60 and 55 percent. It\u2019s a key demographic that threw overwhelming support behind then-candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and former President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. According to\u00a0nonprofit\u00a0Higher Heights, Clinton won more than 89 percent of the state\u2019s black women; Obama pulled similarly high numbers in his respective races. Biden\u00a0currently carries\u00a076 percent of black Democratic support, leaving a 12-point gulf between him and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s real power in black numbers. Word of mouth and recommendations, coupled with party loyalty, goes a long way in South Carolina, said Charleston NAACP president Dot Scott. Biden is seeing an onslaught of preliminary energy and support, she added, due in no small part to his close association with Obama, which in turn vollies him high above the other candidates. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt Biden that he served as the vice president under our first African-American president, so if we\u2019re speaking just about Biden and black votes, he\u2019s probably going to get the lion\u2019s share,\u201d said Scott. In lieu of valuable face time with Obama, several candidates are vying for the affection and blessings of Representative Jim Clyburn, arguably one of the most powerful House Democrats, who aligned himself with both Clinton and Obama. A source who spoke to Clyburn in recent weeks said the influential congressman was shown data from Rep. Cedric Richmond indicating that Biden has the best chance to win a general election. Clyburn found the pitch pretty convincing, the source said. Yet Clyburn is unlikely to make a public push behind a candidate at this unpredictable early stage, even though he recently came out in defense of controversial remarks made by Biden. In a recent testy exchange, Booker criticized Biden\u2019s remarks touting his relationships with segregationist leaders on Capitol Hill. While many in Washington expressed concern and speculated about how those remarks might threaten Biden\u2019s chances, voters in Columbia seemed less pressed. \u201cDespite the hiccup we\u2019re having,\u201d said Scott, referring to the exchange, \u201cI think we\u2019re smart enough to realize that sometimes things that are said are just not delivered well.\u201d Even Rep. John Lewis, perhaps the most prominent civil rights activist on Capitol Hill, jumped to the defense of Biden Friday morning. \u201cI don\u2019t think the remarks are offensive. During the height of the civil rights movement we worked with people and got to know people that were members of the Klan,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWe never gave up on our fellow human beings.\u201d Several Columbia residents said in interviews with Yahoo News they felt that Biden\u2019s comments were misconstrued. Albert Henry, a 39-year-old barber at a neighborhood mainstay (and Clyburn\u2019s cuttery of choice), Toliver\u2019s Mane Event. Henry, an undecided voter, feels like his peers \u2014 employed young black men \u2014 are hungry for a candidate who can guarantee job stability and easy access to health care. He says a candidate that looks like him \u2014 namely, someone black \u2014 would be a welcome step, he and his friends are far more concerned about who can work across the aisle to pass legislation. And Henry trusts Joe Biden at the gut level. Still, he\u2019s willing to give Booker and Harris a chance. \u201cI feel as though regardless of who represents me, I want to be represented by someone who can guarantee that I\u2019m able to go to work, make an honest living, provide for my family, and be a reliable citizen in the community,\u201d said Henry. \u201cBiden has a proven history there.\u201d Booker will have that opportunity Saturday morning, as he starts off his post-fish fry swing at the famous barber shop. He\u2019ll face a sepia portrait of a young Clyburn that sits across the way from a framed photo of Obama and Clyburn chatting. Underneath the portrait, the caption reads: \u201cJIM HAS THE PRESIDENT\u2019S EAR AND WE MUST HAVE THEIR BACKS!!!\u201d signaling an unflinching South Carolinian loyalty. In the meantime, Booker\u2019s prospects here are dimming.\u00a0Sliding poll numbers\u00a0have Booker holding onto Palmetto State support at 5 percent. And there\u2019s doubts that he\u2019ll be able to keep pace. Herbert Toliver, a barbershop owner of 40 years who maintains a close personal friend ship with Clyburn, declined to speak to Yahoo News on the record. Another one of Toliver\u2019s longtime regulars, 81-year-old Johnny Thomas, said he \u201csimply wants to provide for their family,\u201d a common refrain among working-class blacks here. Thomas, a self-identified Democrat, feels like this week\u2019s criticism of Biden was overblown. \u201cIt\u2019s all anyone is talking about down here. Many other candidates want to knock one another around. But Biden shows that he can work with many others, even the ones who call him names or call us names. He can solve a problem,\u201d added Thomas.

Yet Scott hears friends and colleagues speak highly of Sen. Kamala Harris in casual conversation, too, often in tandem with Biden. Harris has spoken publicly about her\u00a0disdain\u00a0for being assumed a de facto vice presidential candidate; though many in South Carolina support the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like her name comes up with Biden\u2019s name,\u201d said Scott. \u201cIt might be the fact that she\u2019s an African-American woman and we can\u2019t help but be proud of where the African-American women is and for, I think, the first time sincerely being looked at as the deal breaker here, for the candidates that come here.\u201d One common thread among Democrats here is a basic question about the candidates: Who will outfight, outlast, and outperform Donald Trump? For many Democrats in South Carolina, Joe Biden wins every time. \u201cOne thing I can tell you with absolute resolute is that we just want someone to change who\u2019s in the White House,\u201d says Scott. \u201cThat\u2019s how the conversation always ends.\u201d ___ Read more from Yahoo News: Trump says Iran\u2019s \u2018attack\u2019 on U.S. drone was likely not intentional  AOC accuses Trump administration of creating \u2018concentration camps\u2019  U.S. \u2018probably had excellent presidents who were gay,\u2019 Buttigieg says  Trump wants his next press secretary to be a cable news \u2018street fighter\u2019  Orlando Sentinel endorses \u2018not Donald Trump\u2019 for president",

      "subtitle": "Sens. Warren and Harris emerged the clear winners, crushing all the outdated stereotypes about female presidential candidates.",
      "author": "Emily Peck",
      "content": " Forget everything you thought you knew about women running for president. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) controlled and dominated the Democratic debates held in Miami this week, featuring 14 men and six women, over two nights, contending for their party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. On Wednesday, Warren commanded the stage and set the tone for the conversation. She won. The next day, Harris mostly\u00a0walked away with the whole thing, ripping the assumed front runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, in the night\u2019s most dramatic moment. Together these women shattered the conventional wisdom that surrounds female politicians. \u201cBy showing up as the leaders they are \u2014 powerful, smart and deeply connected to the issues impacting all Americans \u2014 [Warren and Harris] showed us what a president could be and it was thrilling,\u201d said Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder of the women\u2019s advocacy group Ultraviolet, calling Harris and Warren the winners of the debates. But Warren and Harris weren\u2019t even the only women in the fray \u2014 each night featured three female candidates on stage. A truly radical number. Out of the more than a hundred U.S. presidential primary debates, only five women have ever appeared onstage. Each had to shoulder the burden of being \u201cthe woman\u201d \u2015 the token female in a world of men. The only one on stage. This time, six women got to show the country that there are plenty of different ways to be a female candidate: From Warren\u2019s command performance to Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Harris\u2019s penchant to interrupt their way into the conversation (breaking the stereotypes on how women behave), to Marianne Williamson\u2019s loopy performance. \u201cSimply by being on the presidential debate stage this week, each woman made history and is changing the face of leadership,\u201d said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Foundation, which advocates for women in politics. Together, these women broke through the gender stereotypes that have tripped up female candidates in the past: Women are supposed to be interrupted, but not to interrupt anyone else. They allegedly mostly care about women\u2019s issues and don\u2019t go too deep on the \u201cimportant\u201d stuff like the economy. They aren\u2019t aggressive and lack confidence. And of course, needn\u2019t be taken too seriously. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. On Wednesday night, Warren \u2015 the only candidate polling in the double digits on the Miami stage \u2015 dominated the room. Her deep bench of policy ideas set the topics for at least the first hour. She was poised, calm and clear with her messaging. Warren stuck with the broad theme of her campaign \u2015 fighting for the structural changes needed to ensure the economy is working for everyone. The other candidates scrambled to respond to her. Harris was even more astonishing Thursday. The California senator, a former prosecutor, brought home the most dramatic moment of the two nights when she ripped into Biden for his comments on segregationists. She pulled off the hat trick of combining her personal history with the bigger political picture, telling Biden she was hurt to hear him wax nostalgic earlier this month about his relationship with two segregationist senators decades ago. \u201cAnd it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,\u201d she said, alluding to his role beating back federal integration efforts in the 1970s.\u00a0 \u201c[Y]ou know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Biden said she mischaracterized his record. It was a breathtaking and emotional moment, securing Harris\u2019s place as the night\u2019s winner and cementing her to the level of a serious presidential contender. Her performance, fierce, calm and assured, was a clear sign of how far women candidates have come over the past couple of years. (Her performance was marred, perhaps, by a moment during the health care conversation that she later walked back.) By showing off their executive chops, the two women may have dented the notion, held by many, that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump in 2020. \u201cBy excelling in their respective debates, Senators Warren and Harris challenged the narrative that a woman can\u2019t be the \u2018safe\u2019 candidate. Voters can feel safer with a woman onstage,\u201d said Hunter. The two nights of debates capped off what\u2019s been a monumental run for female candidates over the past few years, a fire born out of the ashes of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 defeat to Trump. In 2018, a wave of women won seats in the House of Representatives and they did it by running campaigns that defied beliefs about how female candidates are supposed to act. In the past, female candidates were encouraged to wear pants suits, try to model the behavior of their male counterparts, downplay their personal lives and act tough. (Clinton deja vu anyone?) But the 2018 candidates found a way to be more authentically themselves \u2015 think Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) talking about bartending and Instagramming herself cooking dinner but also talking about inequality or Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) at the kitchen table with her kids, but also looking at hard financial issues. But gaining seats on a deliberative body is one thing, women typically have a much harder time typically proving they can be the ultimate decider. The question coming into the 2020 presidential race is: Can the women running for the highest office in the country pull off a similar feat? After this week, the answer seems to unequivocally be yes. Harris\u2019s performance Thursday night was emblematic of the changes in campaigning over the last few years. \u201cTwenty years ago, a woman would be implored not to talk about race or her struggles as a student,\u201d said Hunter, marveling at Harris\u2019 performance. \u201cShe was honest and authentic. This is how campaigning has changed in the last few years. By sharing her personal story, Senator Harris showed voters how her personal experience would influence her decisions as a leader.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting, in fact, that over the two nights the six women candidates didn\u2019t speak much on gender issues. Paid leave and childcare barely were mentioned \u2014with \u00a0Gillibrand bringing up her family bill of rights on night two. Sexual assault didn\u2019t come up at all \u2015 somewhat surprising in this MeToo era. Reproductive rights was an issue both men and women discussed.\u00a0Memorably, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) took Washington Gov. Jay Inslee to task for boasting about his record on abortion. She reminded him that the three female lawmakers on stage \u2015 herself, Warren and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2014 had all \u201cfought pretty hard for a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\u00a0It was yet another moment showcasing the confidence and poise women brought to the table in these debates. Over the two nights, unbelievably, the women candidates spoke for more minutes than the men. The male candidates commanded 7.9 minutes each, on average, the women got 8.1 minutes, Vox reports. Of course, the presidential election is more than a year away, and in the end, a man could snag the Democratic nomination or, worse, Donald Trump our accused rapist-in-chief could even win again. At the end of the day, women leaders in politics will still have to struggle to overcome the old-school expectations for their gender, said Elizabeth Stapp, a professor who studies women\u2019s leadership issues at the University of Colorado\u2019s Leeds School of Business. \u201cTo the old guard, women must not take up too much space,\u201d she said. This week though, women did take up a whole lot of space. And it was glorious.",

All four are women of color, but only one \u2014 Omar \u2014 was born outside of the United States. The lawmaker was born in Somalia and immigrated to the U.S. when she was a child. Clinton has become a vocal and noted critic of the president since her defeat in 2016, lambasting his frequent invocations of her name, chastising him for spreading \u201csexist trash\u201d and accusing the Trump administration of conducting \u201cdespicable\u201d acts.

      "subtitle": "Tuesday\u2019s vote was a disappointment for James Zogby and other would-be reformers.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Democratic National Committee\u2019s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee rejected a proposal Tuesday to create a democratically elected body charged with reviewing the organization\u2019s finances after every presidential election cycle. James Zogby, a 26-year DNC member who drafted the proposal, expressed his disappointment with the committee\u2019s decision, arguing that it closes the door on independent oversight of the party\u2019s financial decisions. \u201cAbsent the creation of structures to hold people accountable, we have no guarantee that anybody would act different,\u201d said Zogby, who is also executive director of the Arab American Institute. \u201cYou can\u2019t be dependent on having a good person, you have to be dependent on having a good structure.\u201d On paper, there are already vehicles designed to hold the DNC accountable for major financial decisions. The Budget and Finance Committee is responsible for overseeing financial decisions, and an ombudsman council, created last summer, is charged with monitoring conflicts of interest in DNC decision-making. As a result, DNC Chairman Tom Perez, his allies and the members of Rules and Bylaws who voted down Zogby\u2019s proposal on Tuesday reasoned that a new committee would be duplicative. \u201cI felt at this point that setting up another committee wasn\u2019t really necessary, that we\u2019ve been doing a good job in reaching that process of transparency and we\u2019d see how that process continues,\u201d said Frank Leone, a member of Rules and Bylaws who voted against Zogby\u2019s plan. Daniel Halpern, co-chair of the DNC\u2019s Budget and Finance Committee, used similar logic in a letter to Rules and Bylaws recommending against the adoption of Zogby\u2019s idea. He noted that the budget panel plans to invite all DNC members to a yearly meeting where any of the body\u2019s more than 450 members can receive an \u201coverview\u201d of the budgeting process for the upcoming year and offer input. \u201cCreating more layers of oversight does not create more transparency or accountability,\u201d he wrote. The trouble with those arguments is that all of the existing accountability mechanisms are effectively controlled by Perez \u2015 or whoever succeeds him as chair. All of the members of the Budget and Finance Committee are appointed by Perez, as are the members of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. An appointee of the chair likewise controls the new ombudsman council. Zogby envisioned an oversight committee elected by the entire DNC membership, rather than mostly appointed by the DNC chair. The elected membership of that body would have less of a personal stake in assessing the decisions of the DNC chair than a group of people appointed by the chair. \u201cThe group that made the decision to spend the money can\u2019t be the one to say whether it works or it didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. Technically, the Rules and Bylaws Committee merely voted down a preliminary measure to draft Zogby\u2019s memorandum into a formal amendment. Since it was a voice vote, there is no record of the margin. But Zogby considers his idea dead for the foreseeable future. A longtime DNC member, who shares Zogby\u2019s concerns about financial transparency, only questioned whether the elected structure Zogby proposed might not also be vulnerable to pressure from the chair. However, the member, who requested anonymity for professional reasons, agreed that the Budget and Finance Committee is not adequate for the task. \u201cIt exists in name only,\u201d the member said. DNC members kept in the dark by the body\u2019s leadership have harbored concerns for years over how the group spends its money. The issue entered the national spotlight in November 2017 when former interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile published a tell-all book revealing the extent of the financial mess she\u2019d inherited. The crux of Brazile\u2019s revelations involved the timing of the joint fundraising agreement that the DNC struck with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The DNC normally forges joint fundraising agreements with a Democratic presidential candidate at the close of the primary, when they have locked up the party\u2019s presidential nomination. But during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, he paid little heed to the organization\u2019s declining financial and managerial standards. As a result, when Clinton began her run for president in 2015, she and her team discovered a dysfunctional organization on the brink of bankruptcy. They decided to forge a joint fundraising agreement in August 2015 \u2015 just four months after Clinton entered the race \u2015 that effectively put the DNC in receivership, according to Brazile. The Clinton campaign would fundraise for the DNC to shore up its finances, and in exchange, it would obtain veto power over key personnel decisions and control of almost all of the money. Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential bid, of whom Zogby was one, saw in Brazile\u2019s book additional evidence that the DNC had been biased toward Clinton throughout the presidential primary. But Zogby \u2015 who likes to note that in 26 years with the organization, he has never once seen the DNC\u2019s budget \u2015 also felt that his longstanding concerns about the DNC\u2019s lack of transparency had been vindicated. Although he was happy that the DNC\u2019s ethical lapses came to light, he remains tired of getting critical information through news accounts. It\u2019s part of what motivated him to push for a financial accountability mechanism outside of the DNC chair\u2019s control. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to wait for Donna Brazile to write a book to find out there\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. Perez\u2019s four-year term will expire at the beginning of 2021. Perez\u2019s election in February 2017 was contentious in part because figures like Zogby had rallied behind then-Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) in the hopes of not only empowering the party\u2019s left wing, but also transforming the DNC into a more democratic and transparent institution once and for all. The anonymous DNC member believes that real change will not be achieved until the DNC has a chair \u201cwho fundamentally wants to restructure the governance of the national committee.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be done by paper cuts. It\u2019s got to be a wholesale restructuring,\u201d the member said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never reach our potential by keeping our 18th- and 19th-century structure in place.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging that the bureau caved to \u201cunrelenting pressure\u201d from the president when it fired him. The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters. \u201cThis campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI\u2019s ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cas well as to frequent incidents of public and online harassment and threats of violence to Strzok and his family that began when the texts were first disclosed to the media and continue to this day.\u201d The complaint, which names as defendants Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump. It provides new details about the circumstances of Strzok\u2019s firing and amounts to the latest defense of his reputation, coming months after a fiery congressional hearing in which he insisted that his personal views never influenced his work. Multiple investigations are underway examining whether the FBI acted properly during the Russia investigation, and Strzok remains a frequent target of Trump\u2019s scornful tweets. A Justice Department inspector general report focused on the early days of the Russia probe is expected to be released in the coming weeks. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment on Strzok\u2019s lawsuit. Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence agent who helped lead FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, was removed from Mueller\u2019s team after the texts with FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to light. He was fired from the FBI last August. The lawsuit seeks reinstatement to the FBI, back pay and a declaration that the government violated his rights. Many of the texts, on FBI cell phones, were bitingly critical of Trump during his 2016 run for office. They were found by the department\u2019s inspector general during its investigation of the FBI\u2019s Clinton email probe. The watchdog office criticized both Strzok and Page, with whom he was having an affair, for their judgment in sending the messages but didn\u2019t find that the Clinton email investigation was tainted by political bias. In the lawsuit, Strzok attorney Aitapen Goelman says the FBI deputy director who fired him was responding to \u201cunrelenting pressure from President Trump and his political allies in Congress and the media.\u201d That deputy, David Bowdich, overruled the recommendation of a disciplinary official that Strzok be merely demoted and suspended, and denied him the chance to appeal, the complaint says. The FBI has said that Bowdich, as the FBI\u2019s No. 2 official, had the authority to overrule disciplinary findings. Bowdich said at the time that Strzok\u2019s \u201csustained pattern of bad judgment in the use of an FBI device\u201d called into question decisions made during the Clinton email investigation and the early stages of the Russia probe, the lawsuit says. The complaint also says the campaign to fire Strzok included \u201cconstant tweets and other disparaging statements\u201d from Trump, as well as the president\u2019s direct appeals to Wray and Barr\u2019s predecessor as attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to fire Strzok. In addition, the lawsuit says the administration discriminated against his viewpoint by firing him even though other government officials who have supported Trump in the workplace have kept their job. It notes that the White House has not fired counselor Kellyanne Conway despite the determination that she violated the Hatch Act \u2014 a law that limits political activity by government workers \u2014 by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity. \u201cThe Trump administration has consistently tolerated and even encouraged partisan political speech by federal employees, as long as this speech praises President Trump and attacks his political adversaries,\u201d the complaint contends. The lawsuit also says the Justice Department set out to smear Strzok\u2019s reputation and humiliate him when it disclosed nearly 400 text messages he had sent or received. In the complaint, Strzok aims to explain some of the texts that have attracted the most negative attention, including one in which he told Page \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d a Trump presidency. Many conservatives and critics of the Russia investigation have interpreted the text as Strzok saying that he would work to prevent Trump from being elected, but the suit says the message was actually meant to reassure Page that the American people would not support a Trump candidacy.

      "content": " Taylor Swift is finally coming clean about her decision to stay silent and not support \u2015 or condemn \u2015 a political candidate in the 2016 election. The \u201cArcher\u201d singer, who appears on the cover of\u00a0Vogue\u2019s\u00a0September 2019 issue, said she felt she would hurt Democratic nominee\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the election if she said anything. \u201cUnfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement,\u201d the 29-year-old told Vogue\u2019s Abby Aguirre. \u201cHe was going around saying,\u00a0I\u2019m a man of the people. I\u2019m for you. I care about you.\u00a0I just knew I wasn\u2019t going to help.\u201d At the time, Swift had a bit of a sullied public reputation after\u00a0Kim Kardashian\u00a0called her a \u201csnake.\u201d She cited that insult when explaining to Vogue that she thought her presence would\u2019ve only hurt Clinton \u2015 not helped. \u201cThe summer before that election, all people were saying was, \u2018She\u2019s calculated. She\u2019s manipulative. She\u2019s not what she seems. She\u2019s a snake. She\u2019s a liar,\u2019\u201d Swift told Vogue of the backlash she\u2019d received. \u201cThese are the same exact insults people were hurling at Hillary,\u201d Swift explained. \u201cWould I be an endorsement or would I be a liability? \u2018Look, snakes of a feather flock together. Look, the two lying women. The two nasty women.\u2019\u201d Many celebrities rallied to Clinton\u2019s side during the election.\u00a0Katy Perry regularly performed and campaigned for Clinton on the campaign trail, as did countless others in the candidate\u2019s\u00a0\u201carmy\u201d of Hollywood supporters, which included Beyonc\u00e9, LeBron James, Chrissy Teigen, John Legend \u2014 but not Swift, who faced further backlash for not picking a side in the election from celebrities and fans alike. The Daily Beast wrote an article on \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Loud Election Silence\u2014and Connection to Donald Trump\u201d while fans speculated on Twitter about who the singer was voting for. Everyone was talking politics on the internet and in Hollywood \u2015 everyone except Swift, that is. \u201cA notable voice has been missing from the chorus: that of Taylor Swift, the world\u2019s biggest pop star,\u201d declared a 2017 editorial in The Guardian, highlighting the singer\u2019s silence on Trump. \u201cHer silence is striking, highlighting the parallels between the singer and the president: their adept use of social media to foster a diehard support base; their solipsism; their laser focus on the bottom line; their support among the \u2018alt-right,\u2019\u201d the piece added. Swift had also stayed out of the limelight in past elections. In a 2008 interview for Lifetime\u2019s \u201cEvery Woman Counts\u201d special, she explained why she sidestepped any sort of major political statement. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna sit here and go into my political views because that\u2019s not what I chose to do,\u201d Swift said at the time. \u201cI chose to do music.\u201d When 2016 rolled around, Swift told Vogue, she did the only thing she felt she could do: disappear. \u201cLiterally millions of people were telling me to disappear,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I disappeared. In many senses.\u201d After the election, Swift shed her politically neutral platform and began endorsing specific politicians and causes. She told Vogue she took her time because her \u201cmistakes are very loud.\u201d \u201cWhen I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It\u2019s clickbait, and it\u2019s a part of my life story, and it\u2019s a part of my career arc,\u201d she added. Head to\u00a0Vogue to read more of Swift\u2019s interview.",

      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " Amid news of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide, President Donald Trump retweeted baseless conspiracy theories that attempt to link the convicted sex offender\u2019s death with former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Saturday evening. Terrence K. Williams, whose Twitter bio identifies him as an actor, wrote a tweet with hashtags related to one of the conspiracy theories. The president later shared the post with his followers. \u201cDied of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201d#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead. I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this!\u201d In a video uploaded with the tweet, Williams goes on to link Epstein\u2019s death to another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that suggests the Clintons were responsible for the death of White House aide Vince Foster, who died by suicide in 1994. There is no evidence proving the longstanding conspiracy theory called the \u201cClinton Body Count,\u201d which tries to link the family to a number of deaths.\u00a0Snopes, the fact-checking news site,\u00a0extensively debunked the false claims when they first surfaced. Trump also retweeted an account named @BreakingNLive that claimed the court documents involving Epstein\u2019s case, which were unsealed this week, showed that Bill Clinton \u201ctook private trips to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018pedophilia island.\u2019\u201d However, the tweet is misleading. The court documents, unsealed this week, include flight logs that show Clinton flew on the financier\u2019s private jet a number of times, but the documents do not indicate that Clinton traveled to a \u201cpedophilia island,\u201d nor do they contain the words \u201cpedophilia island.\u201d However, the court filings do mention that Epstein frequently traveled to the Caribbean. Epstein owned Little St. James Island, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands and was nicknamed \u201cpedophile island\u201d by locals, according to the Associated Press. The documents similarly do not indicate that Clinton traveled to Little St. James Island. The logs also show that Trump has flown on Epstein\u2019s jet. Both Clinton and Trump had relationships with Epstein, who was known to be well-connected to powerful people. Clinton, a longtime associate of Epstein\u2019s, said last month that he did not know anything about the \u201cterrible crimes\u201d that Epstein committed and said they haven\u2019t spoken in \u201cwell over a decade.\u201d Also last month, Trump, who has appeared in photos and video with Epstein at events and parties, said that he had a \u201cfalling out\u201d with Epstein and was \u201cnot a fan of his.\u201d A Trump official,\u00a0Lynne Patton, a regional administrator for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also shared an unfounded conspiracy theory after Epstein\u2019s death. In an Instagram post, Patton suggested that Epstein was \u201cHillary\u2019d,\u201d implying \u2014 with no proof \u2014 that Hillary Clinton was responsible for his death. Before Patton was assigned to work in the administration, she worked closely with the Trump family, planning events, including Eric Trump\u2019s wedding, and eventually becoming the Trump family\u2019s chief of staff.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump has more than quintupled down on his baseless claims of shady voting to explain why he lost the popular vote to Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 and this time he blamed Google. Trump has repeatedly insisted \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that 3 million (maybe as many as 5 million) votes were illegally cast by noncitizens. Three million happens to be close to Clinton\u2019s popular vote margin over Trump. But now Trump is insisting that up to 16 million votes were manipulated by Google to Clinton\u2019s benefit. \u201cMy victory was even bigger than thought!\u201d he gushed on Twitter. The claim comes just days after Ellen Weintraub, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, wrote a letter to the president telling him to shut up about his vote-fraud claims or come up with evidence that there\u2019s any truth to them. Trump established an investigative panel on voter fraud to substantiate his claims in 2017, but it came up with nothing and disbanded. Weintraub warned that Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims undermine faith in the election system. She said she was using words a \u201cformer casino operator\u201d could understand: \u201cYou need to lay your cards on the table \u2014 or fold.\u201d Instead of folding, Trump raised. Trump\u2019s new claim was apparently sparked by a Fox Business report Monday about psychologist Robert Epstein\u2019s research. He recently testified before senators that his research has shown that Google\u2019s search algorithms may have \u201cimpacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.\u201d His study sample, however, involved just 95 voters, 21 of whom considered themselves undecided. Google denied that its search algorithms are politically biased and has said that Epstein\u2019s study methodology was fatally flawed. \u201cThis researcher\u2019s inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016,\u201d Google said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cAs we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201d Clinton made much of the 21 undecided voters in Epstein\u2019s research in a Twitter clapback.",

Toobin said on Monday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that \u201cin a day of wackadoodle claims, this is the most wackadoodle of all because there is not even any claim that Google manipulated votes.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t go in there and change votes. No one claims that except Donald Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe idea is that searches were ranked in certain ways that helped Democrats rather than Republicans. This, too, has been long discredited, but it\u2019s all part of this incredible nervousness about his political standing.\u201d \u201cI was wrong about 2016. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to win or lose in 2020,\u201d Toobin added. \u201cBut what today\u2019s spate of craziness tells us is that he\u2019s really worried about losing.

On Tuesday, the singer tweeted a short clip of various 2016 presidential hopefuls, including Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about to observe the national anthem at a Democratic presidential debate. However, the video features Lizzo\u2019s song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d as the anthem. \u201cWhy men great \u2019til they gotta be great? Woo,\u201d Lizzo sings as Clinton, Sanders and others hold their hands over their hearts. The next day, Clinton responded to the tweet with the opening of the song\u2019s first verse: \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out...\u201d The full lyric is \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d Sadly, Clinton did not tweet that part. It\u2019s not clear why Clinton (or her team) chose to respond to this tweet in this way, but relating with singers and rappers seems to be all the rage these days. Rapper Cardi B has long been an admirer of Sanders, and last week the senator\u2019s team released a video of her interviewing him about police reform, minimum wage and health care. And earlier this month, the team of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted a line from \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d in response to a now-unavailable tweet. So, if this country is looking for something to unite both parties, it seems our biggest hope may lie in Lizzo.",

Images cropped up online Wednesday showing the 2016 Democratic nominee for president in Despar Teatro Italia, which is currently hosting a solo exhibition by the artist and poet Kenneth Goldsmith called \u201cHILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails.\u201d Goldsmith told HuffPost via email that Clinton\u2019s visit \u201cwas a surprise,\u201d while curator Francesco Urbano Ragazzi said organizers thought the possibility of her visiting was a joke. \u201cSomeone close to Mrs. Clinton contacted us very informally a few days before her visit. We realized that it wasn\u2019t a joke only when we saw the security service inside the exhibition space at 9 am on Tuesday,\u201d they told HuffPost via email. Goldsmith\u2019s exhibition makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some 60,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails, which, per WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013,\u201d according to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects. Then-candidate Donald Trump turned the emails, which were stored on a private server while Clinton was secretary of state, into rallying cry during the 2016 election. The documents are being displayed in an environment that \u201cconverts in a lo-fi format some of the furnishings of the Oval Office in the White House,\u201d the description says. \u201cEverybody was very excited [during Clinton\u2019s visit],\u201d Urbano Ragazzi said. \u201cI think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first.\u201d The description explains that \u201cthe pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump\u2019s efforts to make them monumental.\u201d \u201cIn this way, Goldsmith creates an anti-monument to the folly of Trump\u2019s heinous smear campaign against Clinton,\u201d it concludes. The artist shared on Twitter that Clinton read her emails for an hour and, per a translation from an Italian news outlet, said: \u201cThis exhibition is further proof that nothing wrong or controversial can be found on these emails. It makes them accessible to everyone and allows everyone to read them.\u201d He also recalled Clinton saying, as an aside, to Urbano Ragazzi: \u201cThey are just so boring.\u201d Goldsmith told HuffPost that he \u201choped that she would see it as an act of tribute and love,\u201d which he believes she did. Urbano Ragazzi added that organizers wanted Clinton to \u201cunderstand the intentions\u201d of the project. \u201cIn the digital age, making these documents available to everyone in a touchable format is a way to focus on something concrete in order to exit the impalpable toxicity of ideological narratives,\u201d they said, before adding: \u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary has been part of this image full of possibilities.\u201d The exhibition, which began in May, runs until Nov. 24.\u00a0It is curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi and organized by The Internet Saga and Zuecca Projects with collaboration and support from Circuitozero, The Bauers, NERO and Despar Aspiag Service. Clinton did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but the former senator tweeted some thoughts about the whole thing on Thursday: This article has been updated with Clinton\u2019s tweet.",

At the \u201cIn Defense of American Democracy\u201d conference at George Washington University, Clinton sounded the alarm on \u201cTrump\u2019s propaganda efforts,\u201d citing a \u201cvery disturbing\u201d investigation into his advertising by journalist Judd Legum. \u201cThe Trump campaign is already spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook each week to spread fake endorsements and outright lies about Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been doing this since after the 2017 inauguration, but it\u2019s getting at an even higher velocity now.\u201d Clinton added that \u201ceven though these posts violate Facebook\u2019s stated terms of service, they\u2019re still up.\u201d \u201cFacebook is still paid for them. And the people who are targeted to receive them still believe them,\u201d she said. Facebook did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. According to Legum\u2019s newsletter, Popular Information, the Trump campaign has used stock photo models to offer phony endorsements in Facebook videos. The attractive models smile as voiceovers offer support for the president. In a NowThis feature on his reporting, Legum said that the campaign has also used Facebook ads to ask voters to make an immediate donation in order to enter contests to win items such as a signed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. The contests are said to have enrollment deadlines of 11:59 p.m. on that given day \u2015 but they actually are promoted for multiple days or even weeks, Legum said. The ads are designed, he said, to \u201cscam\u201d Trump supporters. The often politically divisive sentiments pushed by Trump\u2019s ads have also raised concerns. Following the shooting last month in which a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas \u2015 having allegedly acted on a white supremacist manifesto decrying a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d \u2015 a review of Trump\u2019s campaign ads showed he used the same language to describe immigration. Earlier this year, about 2,200 ads claimed an \u201cinvasion\u201d was taking place, many of them warning social media users that \u201cillegal immigration is a serious threat to our country.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the conference was held at George Washington University but was not sponsored by the school.",

      "content": "Internet memes have come a long way since the Hamster Dance \u2015 but over the past few years, they\u2019ve taken on a more volatile, violent and racist tone, part of a propaganda war that morphed Pepe the Frog into a Trump-supporting Nazi. This is, in part, a reflection of Trump-era politics, according to a number of communications experts, professors and extremism reporters who spoke to HuffPost for the video above. As President Donald Trump campaigned for his election in 2016, he embraced and often promoted a series of increasingly violent memes aimed at his two greatest opponents, Hillary Clinton and the media. \u201cThe memes that people were sharing in 2016,\u00a0a lot of them followed the barbed tone that Trump was setting,\u201d said Ryan Milner, an associate professor at the College of Charleston who has studied memes for more than a decade. Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, said Trump has always been an expert when it comes to using memes for branding, well before the internet age. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that helped him to get elected,\u201d\u00a0Grygiel said. \u201cA lot of people may have discounted his rhetoric, or his childish way that he spoke, but he\u2019s actually a memetic expert, and wields a lot of influence because of his decades of using memetics to brand himself.\u201d Today, Pepe the Frog wears a MAGA hat, chants of \u201clock her up\u201d in regards to Clinton are commonplace, and extremists who once hid behind computer screens are making appearances in real life.\u00a0Memes have become a vehicle for any information \u2015 good or bad \u2015 to be sanitized and launched into the mainstream, and the people making them know it. \u201cAfter Trump was elected president,\u00a0you could often hear people in the so-called alt-right talk about how they memed Trump into the White House,\u201d said HuffPost senior reporter Christopher Mathias. \u201cThey were basically claiming a propaganda victory.\u201d Watch the video above to learn more.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton landed an icy dig on Friday amid the controversy over President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged strong-arming of the Ukrainian president to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son. \u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,\u201d she dryly tweeted \u2014 clearly referencing Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton attached a clip of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meltdown in a CNN interview Thursday when he said that \u201cof course\u201d he called on Ukrainian officials recently to investigate\u00a0Biden, after initially denying it. Clinton\u2019s attack was one of several in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article published Friday which reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d in a July phone call to\u00a0work with Giuliani on an investigation of\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s actions as well as those of his son, Hunter. Giuliani has claimed that Biden worked when he was vice president to shield a Ukrainian energy company linked to Hunter from a corruption probe. A Ukrainian official said earlier this year there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden. Trump\u2019s request for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens is part of a secret complaint filed against the president by a whistleblower in the intelligence community, The New York Times reported Friday. Trump hasn\u2019t denied pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. He has described the call with Zelensky as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d The possibility of a president leveraging the power of the U.S. government on a foreign country to probe a political rival to help his reelection has begun to trigger calls for impeachment. Former Texas Rep.\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\u00a0Julian Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first of the Democratic presidential contenders to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter on Friday. Like Clinton, both O\u2019Rourke and Warren referred to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Trump should be impeached if he is blocking the whistleblower complaint from being released to congressional investigators. Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, tweeted: \u201cImpeach NOW.\u201d",

A summary of the leaders\u2019 call released earlier in the day revealed Trump asked Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential contender Biden.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday\u00a0called for a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0in the wake of the allegations that Trump urged a foreign power to go after his political rival.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t get away from the issue of a private email server in the 2016 election. Donald Trump said it was \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d and she deserved to go to jail for it. Now, Trump has been caught using a secret computer system \u2015 a private server, if you will \u2015 to hide his election interference attempts. \u201cRepublicans have made it very clear that secret servers are a criminal offense,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who served on the Clinton campaign. \u201cWill they apply the same rules to Trump that they apply to everyone else?\u201d An explosive letter\u00a0from an unnamed intelligence official was released Thursday detailing attempts by the White House to cover up Trump\u2019s wrongdoing. On more than one occasion, White House officials put transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations into a \u201cstandalone computer system\u201d that was meant for storing sensitive and classified intelligence information. Officials were abusing that system, the letter says. They used it to protect politically sensitive conversations, rather than national security secrets. It\u2019s the place they put the transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with the president of Ukraine when he asked for foreign help in going after former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Hiding this transcript was deliberate. According to the whistleblower\u2019s letter, White House officials said they were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to move it there, away from the regular computer system that holds other call transcripts that are distributed to Cabinet-level officials. As secretary of state, Clinton used a private email account connected to a nongovernment server. Clinton said it was for convenience, so that she wouldn\u2019t have to carry around two phones \u2015 one for government work and one for personal use. And her aides said she was careful about how she handled classified information. The setup, however, also gave her and her aides control over what materials were preserved for public records. Clinton was not the first government official to use a personal email address for government work. But the issue dogged her relentlessly, pushed on by Trump and his conservative allies. There\u2019s no evidence that Clinton set up this system to deliberately hide wrongdoing.\u00a0But according to the whistleblower, Trump\u2019s White House used its second system for exactly those reasons. The call at the center of this issue is Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. According to both the whistleblower letter and a summary of the call released by the White House, Trump pressured Zelensky to have his government investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. In the Aug. 12 complaint, the whistleblower wrote that there were White House officials who were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the call, adding, \u201cThey told me that there was already a \u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d And if there were any doubt that the White House knew it was bad, officials moved the transcript to the secret system so that few people would ever know about it. \u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2015 as is customary \u2015 by the White House Situation Room,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. \u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that the White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump asking Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate 2020 candidate Joe Biden is the most direct example of the president encouraging foreign powers to target his political rivals. But it\u2019s not the only time he\u2019s attempted to solicit help from abroad. The July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump also wanted Zelensky to pursue a bizarre conspiracy theory related to Hillary Clinton, instead appears to be part of a pattern of behavior in which Trump has flouted the rule of law and tried to influence foreign powers to do his dirty work. Trump drew widespread criticism during the 2016 presidential race when he called during a July news conference for Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails. The request drew even more scrutiny when special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation later revealed that Russian hackers attempted to breach Clinton\u2019s personal office servers that same day. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d After WikiLeaks released a trove of Clinton\u2019s emails weeks before the 2016 election, Trump loudly applauded the organization for publishing the damaging information against Clinton. He praised the organization more than 140 times, saying at one rally, \u201cWe love Wikileaks!\u201d Along with Trump\u2019s personal request for foreign help in the election and celebration of WikiLeaks, his campaign sent fundraising emails to dozens of politicians in countries including Scotland, Canada, Iceland and Australia. Campaign finance watchdogs filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Trump\u2019s campaign violated federal election law that prohibits soliciting contributions from foreign nationals. Trump has faced few political consequences for his requests for a hostile foreign power to meddle in the U.S. election, despite the special counsel\u2019s investigation discovering numerous contacts between Trump associates and WikiLeaks or Kremlin-linked Russian nationals. Trump\u2019s campaign earlier this year did not say if it had a policy on accepting help from foreign agents, and Trump continued to openly acknowledge that he would take information on his opponents from foreign governments and sources. He denied that accepting foreign information on his rivals would amount to election interference, saying he would \u201ctake it\u201d in an interview with ABC News in June 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, \u2018We have information on your opponent.\u2019 Oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it,\u201d Trump told ABC News. Republicans, Democrats and the Federal Election Commission harshly criticized Trump for his comments during the interview, emphasizing that accepting or soliciting anything of value from foreign nationals related to a U.S. election would be breaking the law. But just over a month later, on July 25, Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. As he spoke with Zelensky, Trump was also holding up the delivery of $250 million in military aid to Ukraine. This time, it appears that Trump\u2019s pursuit of foreign interference for personal gain was too egregious for officials and lawmakers to ignore. The call prompted a whistleblower complaint, released on Thursday, that has moved Democrats to call for impeachment, and brought allegations that the White House was engaged in a cover-up. Trump, however,\u00a0has denied\u00a0any wrongdoing and described his call with Zelensky as \u201cperfect.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this article omitted the \u201cmillion\u201d from the amount of military aid pledged to Ukraine.",

The two addressed guests at the 50th anniversary dinner for NARAL Pro-Choice America, the oldest organization fighting for abortion rights in the U.S., delivering strong messages on the impeachment process initiated against President Donald Trump and the continued fight for reproductive freedom. Pelosi said that today was a \u201cvery sad time for our country.\u201d \u201cI say this to you with great sorrow and prayerfully, that we are at a place that I hoped we would never be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never thought we would see a president take the actions that he has. In fact, I don\u2019t think our Founders ever thought a president would do such a thing,\u201d she added. Pelosi also emphasized the right of every woman to reproductive health care, saying, \u201cWe have won in the court of public opinion, and now we must continue to win in the court of law.\u201d Clinton, too, began her address by first addressing the impeachment proceedings against the man she ran against for president in 2016. She said that Trump posed a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the nation\u2019s future and democracy, and she praised Pelosi for her leadership during this \u201chistoric\u201d time. She said the nation had also reached an important crossroads on reproductive freedom. \u201cIn the last Democratic debate, there was not one single question about abortion rights. It has to be a critical issue in 2020,\u201d Clinton said. Earlier in the week, NARAL President Ilyse Hogue released a statement\u00a0on the impeachment inquiry on behalf of the organization, which read, in part: No one is above the law. Evidence presented shows that this President has abused his power, obstructed justice and obstructed Congress from fulfilling their duty as he tramples our freedoms and pushes an extreme agenda. Meddling in elections is an affront to a vibrant democracy, which is vital for our freedoms to flourish, including reproductive freedom and the right to abortion. We applaud Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic Caucus for beginning this process and we encourage all those in Congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. An impeachment inquiry should not be taken lightly, but neither should the lawlessness of this President and his Administration.\u201d The event also featured Rep.

      "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
      "content": " The Trump administration is reportedly amping up its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails \u2014 reviving a controversial topic that dominated headlines during the 2016 presidential election and one that President Donald Trump continues to mention. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the State Department is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former officials who sent messages to Clinton\u2019s private email account when she was secretary of state. The New York Times confirmed the continuation of the investigation on Sunday. State Department investigators began contacting officials about the emails some 18 months ago, the Post reported. But the effort was apparently dropped before being revived in August. \u201cAs many as 130\u201d officials have been contacted by the Trump administration since then, the paper said, adding that\u00a0\u201cthose targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations.\u201d The emails were largely sent between 2009 and 2013, when Clinton was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. State Department officials denied to the Post that the probe was politically motivated. But one former senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation described it as a way for Republicans \u201cto keep the Clinton email issue alive.\u201d Trump, for one, has not dropped the matter. Just Wednesday, Trump \u2015 who\u2019s facing an impeachment inquiry following a series of troubling revelations related to a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015\u00a0touted a baseless conspiracy theory about Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cI think one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena,\u201d Trump told reporters\u00a0in New York while sitting alongside Zelensky\u00a0ahead of a bilateral meeting, referring to a cache of emails that was deleted by a Clinton aide in 2014. Trump suggested those emails \u201ccould very well\u201d be in Ukraine. Clinton came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election for her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business \u2015 and her choice to delete emails that she\u2019d deemed personal rather than turning them over to investigators. Then-FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but ultimately recommended the case be closed with no charges. Comey also said the FBI had found no evidence that the 33,000 deleted emails had been \u201cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d Some of the emails were recovered by intelligence officials, NBC News noted. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, has said she believes Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the email controversy mere days before the presidential election was a major factor contributing to her loss. \u201cAbsent that, I believe the evidence shows I would have won,\u201d Clinton said in 2017.",

The group similarly flipped Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s 2016 campaign assertion\u00a0that \u201cforeign governments cannot participate in the American political process\u201d with the below spot earlier in the week. It will run in the home states of vulnerable Republicans.",

Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is being positioned by Russia for a third-party run, warning the implication plays into President Donald Trump\u2019s hands. \u201cThe thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset,\u201d Amash tweeted early Saturday. \u201cHillary does \u2014 and did \u2014 drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump. Her attack on Tulsi does likewise.\u201d Amash, fed up with party politics and disillusioned by Trump\u2019s impact on the GOP, left the party in July, declaring himself an independent. Controversy has brewed over Clinton\u2019s remarks since the Friday release of a\u00a0\u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast interview in which she asserted without evidence that \u201csomebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary\u201d\u00a0is being groomed\u00a0\u201cto be the third-party candidate.\u201d Though the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Russia, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill\u00a0denied that interpretation on Friday, arguing she was instead referring to Republicans. While Clinton did not name Gabbard, the candidate complained on the Ohio debate stage earlier this week about a New York Times article\u00a0reporting that Russian state media has focused significant attention on her White House bid. Gabbard also appeared to lash out against CNN analyst Bakari Sellers, who recently claimed \u2015 again, without evidence \u2015 that she \u201cis a puppet for the Russian government.\u201d Clinton,\u00a0the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, later seemed to use that same message in her interview. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her so far. And that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d Both Stein and Gabbard vociferously rebuked Clinton\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016,\u201d Stein tweeted Friday. Russian bots aggressively promoted Stein\u2019s candidacy in the lead-up to the 2016 election, and she was famously photographed sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in 2015. Stein\u2019s condemnation was soon followed by a spate of tweets from Gabbard, who slammed Clinton as \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d employing lines that have been used by Trump. Gabbard has since received support from fellow Democratic candidates Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson.

      "content": " CNN host Van Jones criticized Hillary Clinton for her recent remarks suggesting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was \u201ca favorite of the Russians\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. \u201cShe\u2019s playing a very dangerous game,\u201d Jones said during a segment\u00a0on \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d on Friday. \u201cHillary Clinton, if you\u2019re concerned about disinformation \u2015 what the Russians do, is they spread disinformation and get us divided against each other \u2015 that is what just happened. Just throw out some information ... disinformation, smear somebody,\u201d he continued. Jones\u2019 remarks were in response to Clinton\u2019s Thursday appearance on the podcast \u201cCampaign HQ With David Plouffe.\u201d During a\u00a0conversation about the 2020 election with Plouffe, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, Clinton appeared to single out Gabbard, before unleashing accusations about\u00a0Jill Stein\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. (Stein slammed Clinton\u2019s comments on Twitter.) \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary ... and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d\u00a0Clinton said during the interview. She continued, \u201cShe\u2019s a favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d Though many interpreted Clinton\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d comment as referring to the Russians, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill said on Twitter on Friday that the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was referencing the Republican Party. Before making her \u201cgrooming\u201d remarks, Clinton and Plouffe were sharing their thoughts on President Donald Trump\u2019s election strategy. The former secretary of state did not reference Gabbard by name in that conversation, but when Merrill was asked by NBC News this week to confirm Gabbard was her target, he replied: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d Gabbard, who has repeatedly said she would not run as a third-party candidate\u00a0if she loses the Democratic nomination, fired back at Clinton\u2019s claims\u00a0in a series of tweets on Friday. The presidential hopeful and Iraq War veteran similarly criticized The New York Times on Tuesday\u2019s Ohio debate stage after it reported that Russian news media had frequently mentioned her. Elsewhere in the CNN segment with Burnett, Jones, who referred to Clinton as a\n\u201dlegend,\u201d suggested there was a \u201cbackstory\u201d to the Gabbard-Clinton-Russia debacle. He pointed to Gabbard\u2019s decision to resign as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president. \u201cIt\u2019s been payback hell ever since,\u201d Jones charged. He later added, \u201cI do not want somebody of her [Clinton\u2019s] stature to legitimate these kind of attacks against anybody \u2015 if you\u2019ve got real evidence, come forward with it, but if you\u2019re just going to smear people casually on podcast, you\u2019re playing right into the Russians\u2019 hands.\u201d Watch the entire CNN segment here.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump\u2019s recent letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan became the target of Twitter mockery last week for its both threatening and flippant nature, and\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0wanted in on the fun. In a Sunday tweet, the former Democratic presidential candidate shared a fake letter dated Oct. 16, 1962 \u2015 the start of the 13-day Cuban missile crisis \u2015\u00a0from President John F. Kennedy to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. For anyone who read Trump\u2019s missive to Erdogan, the parody \u2014\u00a0which first appeared on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d \u2014\u00a0bears more than a few similarities. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d it reads. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, ok? Get your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say \u2018Yay!\u00a0Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 But if you don\u2019t everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here,\u201d the note says in closing. \u201cGive you a jingle later.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House released Trump\u2019s Oct. 9 memo to Erdogan, which was written in the same boorish tone, warning the Turkish president not to attack the Kurds in northern Syria after Trump withdrew U.S. troops from the region. \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2015 and I will.\u201d Concluding the letter, Trump says, \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d Upon first look, the message\u2019s language caused some readers, including seasoned White House reporters, to wonder if it was real. Though Clinton\u2019s was not, Trump\u2019s sure was. But his bizarre approach failed to deter Erdogan from launching an offensive against the Kurds. According to the BBC, Turkish presidential sources told the outlet that when he received Trump\u2019s letter, Erdogan \u201cthoroughly rejected it and put it in the [trash] bin.\u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based watchdog organization, said that as of Sunday,\u00a0there have been 120 civilian casualties and 300,000 people displaced in the region.",

While lagging behind in a crowded Democratic presidential field, Gabbard has gotten renewed attention lately after a heated argument with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

The squabble seemed to give Gabbard renewed energy on the campaign trail. Gabbard noted in her early morning announcement that the threats of war, international tensions and the threats of a new cold war convinced her she should focus on the presidential race. \u201cI believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,\u201d she said in her statement. Gabbard, who launched her presidential bid in January, has emphasized her background as a combat veteran. Currently a major in the Army National Guard, she has served for more than 16 years and deployed twice to the Middle East, according to her announcement. She was first elected to Congress in 2012.",

He led from his soul.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a Baltimore native, followed Clinton\u2019s speech with a testament to Cummings\u2019 ability to embrace bipartisanship, especially when it came to his work to lower prescription drug pricing. \u201cElijah brought people together in life of different parties,\u201d she said, noting that in his death, he did the same. \u201cHe was willing to reach across the aisle, even across the Capitol and even down Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama later stepped up to the podium with remembrances of their own, honoring their longtime colleague and friend. Among the most politically poignant speeches was that given by Cummings\u2019 widow, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Dr. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who appeared to call out President Donald Trump\u2019s smears of the congressman and his district. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any challenges like we\u2019ve got going on right now, so his job became harder over time,\u201d she said, referring to Obama\u2019s tenure and adding that her husband was engaged in a \u201cfight for the soul of our democracy against very real corruption.\u201d At the time of his death, the congressman was chairing the House Oversight Committee, helming various probes into potential power abuses by the Trump administration. Evidently, the work provoked the president\u2019s ire. In July, he referred to the congressman\u2019s majority-Black hometown as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a racist Twitter rant on which he refused to let up. \u201cI want you all to know that it was not easy,\u201d\u00a0Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said.\u00a0\u201cAnd it got infinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks, and attacks on his beloved city. And while he carried himself with grace and dignity in all public forums, it hurt him.\u201d Elijah Cummings died on Oct. 17 at age 68 after suffering what his office described as \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges.\u201d Though Maya Rockeymoore Cummings acknowledged that her husband had \u201cdictated every aspect of his service\u201d and would not have wanted to be brought to the Capitol on Thursday, she felt \u201cvery strongly that they were trying to tear him down, and we needed to make sure that he went out with the respect and the dignity that he deserved.\u201d",

      "author": "Josephine Harvey",
      "content": " Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is cheering Twitter for its\u00a0decision to ban all political advertising on its platform \u2015 and now she\u2019s looking straight at Facebook. Twitter\u2019s announcement came from CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday. He said, in a series of tweets, that the social media giant would stop all political advertising globally in order to inhibit the spread of misinformation and to ensure that political reach was earned, not bought. Clinton, who had tweeted just hours earlier condemning Facebook\u2019s stance on allowing misinformation in political advertising, immediately praised Twitter for the move, which she characterized as the \u201cright thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world.\u201d \u201cWhat say you, @Facebook?\u201d she added. The former Democratic presidential candidate was plagued by issues with Facebook during her 2016 campaign against Donald Trump, which she blames, in part, for her loss. Clinton says she was subjected to an unprecedented campaign of disinformation and social engineering on the platform, orchestrated by Russian agents and bots. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned at a congressional hearing\u00a0about the company\u2019s proposed digital currency, which it is calling Libra. The hearing turned into a grilling on a wide range of issues with the platform, including privacy, data use and the spread of false information. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) demanded Zuckerberg explain whether Facebook would hypothetically allow her to run false political ads claiming Republicans had voted for the Green New Deal. After first being unable to answer, the Facebook exec said, \u201cProbably.\u201d His defense of his company\u2019s policy was that, although \u201clying is bad,\u201d it is not within a tech company\u2019s mandate to determine what politicians can or cannot say. Last month, Facebook (as well as Twitter and YouTube) refused to remove an ad run by the Trump reelection campaign that pushed debunked claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The Biden campaign condemned the platforms for allowing the ad. Other Democrats have challenged Facebook\u2019s policy, including 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was able to run a fake ad that claimed Zuckerberg endorsed Trump for 2020. However, when a left-wing political action group ran a version of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s hypothetical ad on Friday, claiming that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) supported the Green New Deal, Facebook halted paid distribution of the ad, saying that different rules applied for political action groups versus politicians. The Biden campaign also praised Twitter\u2019s Wednesday announcement, calling it \u201cencouraging\u201d that the company chose integrity over revenue. The Trump campaign slammed the move. Campaign manager Brad Parscale issued a statement calling it \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d and a \u201cvery dumb decision for their stockholders\u201d to walk away from \u201cmillions of dollars of potential revenue.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s campaign viewed Roger Stone as an \u201caccess point\u201d to WikiLeaks and tried to use him to get advanced word about hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton, a former top presidential adviser testified Friday. In reluctant testimony, former campaign CEO Steve Bannon told a federal court that Stone, on trial for lying to Congress and witness tampering, had boasted about his ties to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, alerting them to pending new batches of damaging emails. \u201cThe campaign had no official access to WikiLeaks or to Julian Assange,\u201d Bannon told the court. \u201cBut Roger would be considered if we needed an access point.\u201d It was the first time that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign acknowledged in court that they had actively sought material from WikiLeaks, which released emails that U.S. intelligence agencies determined had been hacked by the Russian government in order to damage Clinton. The White House had no immediate comment. Stone, a colorful political operative and Trump ally, is charged with witness tampering and lying to Congress about his attempts to contacts WikiLeaks about the damaging material during the 2016 presidential campaign. While Stone repeatedly \u201cimplied that he had a connection with WikiLeaks,\u201d he never stated it directly, Bannon said. The campaign took Stone\u2019s boasts seriously enough to follow up, asking why expected information about Clinton wasn\u2019t revealed when Assange held a press conference in October 2016. Bannon, who testified in response to a subpoena, did not say anything about Trump and said Stone had not been sent by anyone on the campaign to talk to Assange. Earlier this week, a former FBI agent testified about a flurry of phone calls between Stone and then-candidate Trump \u2014 including three calls on July 14, 2016 \u2014 the day that a massive hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers was reported. But the agent said she did not know what was discussed on those calls. As he left the courthouse, Bannon griped about being subpoenaed by prosecutors and Congress in addition to being interviewed several times by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team as it investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI was forced and compelled to come here today,\u201d he said as he climbed into a waiting SUV outside the courthouse. Bannon\u2019s testimony came after comedian and radio talk show Randy Credico told jurors that Stone pressured him into backing up lies he told Congress, threatening to take away his dog at one point. Credico said Stone pressed him to \u201cgo along\u201d with a false account of the operative\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. \u201cHe wanted me to go along with this narrative,\u201d Credico said in his second day of testimony. Stone called a Credico a \u201crat\u201d and a \u201cstoolie\u201d in a threatening April 2018 email. Credico also testified that Stone used repeated references from the movie \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d to intimidate him into either backing up Stone\u2019s testimony to Congress or refusing to testify. \u201cMy lawyers are dying to rip you to shreds. I\u2019m going to take that dog away from you,\u201d he said in the email, which Credico read aloud in court. And while Credico testified he considered the threat \u201chyperbole,\u201d he also said that Stone \u201cplays hardball\u201d and \u201cI did not want to rile the guy.\u201d The radio host told the court he\u2019s had his dog Bianca, a small breed known as a coton de tulear, since 2006. \u201cI have no wife, no kids, I\u2019ve been around the dog for 12 years,\u201d he said. Credico has occasionally provoked laughter in court and warnings from the judge. Thursday\u2019s testimony detailed the acrimonious collapse of the relationship between the liberal Credico and Stone, a longtime conservative operative who revered Richard Nixon so much that he has the disgraced former president\u2019s face tattooed on his back. Credico and Stone met in 2002 through the campaign of a third-party candidate for New York governor. Despite their political differences, Stone was a regular guest on Credico\u2019s radio show. \u201cHe\u2019s good on radio,\u201d Credico said of Stone. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guest to have on.\u201d Stone, a longtime Trump confidant and conservative operative who has a tattoo of former president Richard Nixon\u2019s face on his back, is accused of telling Congress that Credico was the source of his inside information about WikiLeaks. But Credico said he and Stone never discussed WikiLeaks before late August 2016, making it impossible that he was the \u201ctrusted intermediary\u201d that Stone had been referring to for months. Credico did manage to contact Assange through mutual acquaintance Margaret Kunstler, and hosted Assange on his radio show on Aug. 25, 2016. He says Stone, who had already claimed in interviews to have a back-channel link to Assange, immediately started asking Credico to put him in touch with Assange. Prosecutors have said Stone lied about his efforts to learn more about the WikiLeaks releases because the truth about his efforts would \u201clook bad\u201d for Trump. In an often-testy cross examination, defense attorney Robert Buschel tried to paint Stone as the victim of a con job by Credico, saying that the radio host repeatedly lied to Stone to exaggerate his connection and influence with Assange. They went through the pair\u2019s text exchanges before Credico\u2019s September 2016 trip to London. Credico wrote to Stone that a meeting with Assange, who was sheltering from prosecution in the Ecuadoran embassy, was \u201con the agenda.\u201d In reality, there was no meeting planned and the closest Credico got to Assange was delivering a letter from his radio station\u2019s administration to the embassy offering Assange a show on their channel. Credico said Stone was pestering him with requests and that he led Stone to believe he was working on making contact with Assange \u201cjust to satisfy him and get him off my back.\u201d Stone\u2019s trial is scheduled to resume on Tuesday.",

She made her controversial comment when discussing the possibility of a third-party candidate with host David Plouffe, who managed President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate,\u201d Clinton said, apparently referring generally to President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up. Which she might not, \u2019cause she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d The comments were widely interpreted as a reference to Gabbard, who\u00a0defended herself during last month\u2019s Democratic debate after a news report noted she is often a topic of Russia\u2019s state-run media. Clinton\u2019s spokesperson, Nick Merrill, asked later if Clinton meant to target Gabbard, answered: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d He later tweeted that Clinton had been referring to the GOP, not Russia, in her podcast comments. Gabbard\u2019s lawyers say that the statements are false and defamatory, and that Merrill\u2019s claim that Clinton had been referring to Republicans \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d \u201cThis Republicans-not-Russians spin developed only after you realized the defamatory nature of your statement, and therefore your legal liability, as well as the full extent of the public backlash against your statement,\u201d Gabbard\u2019s lawyers wrote. Gabbard\u2019s attorneys demanded that Clinton hold a press conference announcing a retraction, and issue statements on Twitter and to major news outlets. Clinton didn\u2019t immediately respond.",

Johnson has decided to delay the report\u2019s release until after the Dec. 12 general election, but details have already begun to leak, including allegations that Russian oligarchs bankrolled Conservative Party politicians. Clinton, whose 2016 Democratic presidential run fell on the same year of the Brexit referendum, drew parallels between Russian interference in U.S. elections and trouble in the U.K. \u201cThere is no doubt \u2015 we know it in our country, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it here \u2015 that Russia in particular is determined to try to shape the politics of western democracies,\u201d she said. The report, vaguely titled \u201cRussia,\u201d was developed by Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee and sent to Johnson in mid-October. The committee said it was up to Johnson to determine how to handle the information, but that it expected \u201cto be in a position to publish the report imminently.\u201d However, the report may not show the same level of widespread interference seen in the U.S., as confirmed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe that concluded in March. Earlier this month, BuzzFeed News cited two sources with direct knowledge of its findings who stated that British intelligence found no evidence that Russia shaped the result of the Brexit vote and the 2017 general election. So far, no evidence has been made public either.",

But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.\u201d Clinton was speaking to the BBC as part of a press tour alongside her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, to promote their new project, \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women.\u201d A slew of establishment Democrats have been mulling their own bids in recent days, just before some states\u2019 filing deadlines for candidates to get their names on the books for the primaries. Billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is expected to file paperwork in Arkansas this week in anticipation of a potential bid, although he has reportedly not made a final decision about the 2020 race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is also considering a last-minute candidacy. But it\u2019s unclear if Americans even want more Democratic choices. The party has spent months winnowing down a field that at one point topped 20 candidates, and recent polls show that many Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters already felt the party had several candidates who could defeat Trump. Clinton has stated multiple times that her presidential aspirations are over for now, although she has said she often imagines what the White House would\u2019ve been like were she elected in 2016. \u201cLook, I think all the time about what kind of president I would\u2019ve been and what I would\u2019ve done differently and what I think it would\u2019ve meant to our country and the world. So of course I think about it, I think about it all the time,\u201d Clinton said on Tuesday. \u201cWhoever wins next time is going to have a big task trying to fix everything that\u2019s been broken.\u201d",

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " One of the key takeaways from the Ukraine scandal has been that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and not a government employee, was running a rogue foreign policy operation meant to benefit Donald Trump\u2019s political interests. Giuliani was the key player pushing for the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was seen as an impediment to his goals in that country \u2015 which were primarily to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. And in the infamous July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he should talk to Giuliani to move forward on an investigation of the Bidens. But very little is known about Trump and Giuliani\u2019s own conversations \u2015 when they spoke, how often they spoke and what they said. That\u2019s because, according to officials who spoke to The Washington Post, Giuliani often called Trump on the president\u2019s personal cellphone. Trump \u2015 the man who was obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton used a private email server as secretary of state \u2015 continues to use a personal cellphone, despite warnings from security experts. The practice also, conveniently, allows him to avoid extra public scrutiny. Trump\u2019s cellphone does not have security features to shield his communications from espionage, and he has reportedly resisted measures to make his phone more secure. As president, Barack Obama also had a personal cellphone, but it had significantly more restrictions. Security officials examined his phone every 30 days for evidence of hacking, and it had no microphone or camera. He couldn\u2019t make calls, and he could receive email only from a small group of staffers and friends who were given a special address. There was also no texting. Asked for comment about Trump\u2019s use of a personal cellphone to talk with Giuliani, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said, \u201cJust because you saw something reported somewhere doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\u201d But she didn\u2019t reply to a follow-up inquiry on whether she was denying the report. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan is investigating Giuliani, as is the criminal division of the Justice Department. As those probes heat up, there\u2019s a chance that they could bring out his phone records. While Giuliani is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, he was also acting in a way that seemed to go far beyond the scope of an individual attorney. There is something called the \u201ccrime-fraud exception\u201d to attorney-client privilege, meaning the client can\u2019t use the attorney to commit a crime. The government can review an attorney\u2019s records in such an instance. As secretary of state, Clinton set up a private email address instead of using a government account. She said she did it because it was more convenient, allowing her to use one electronic device, rather than two, for work and personal matters. Her team then turned over all official correspondence so that it could be part of the official record. In the 2016 election, Trump said this separate server was \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d and she deserved to go to jail for it. Another central issue in the Ukraine investigation is the fact that White House staff moved the transcript of the July 25 call to a separate system meant to store national security secrets \u2015 even though the call addressed no national security secrets \u2015 because they didn\u2019t want the politically embarrassing and damaging information about Trump\u2019s maneuvers to get out. In conclusion, the man who made Clinton\u2019s email server a major issue in 2016 is now potentially using a personal cellphone to talk about foreign policy with a private citizen running a shadow operation and is keeping his politically damaging conversations on a secret server.",

      "content": " Clive Owen better start working on a gravelly southern accent because he\u2019s about to play Bill Clinton. The British actor has been cast to play the 42nd president in the upcoming FX series \u201cImpeachment: American Crime Story.\u201d The show\u2019s third season will focus on Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment trial. Owen\u2019s leading ladies include Beanie Feldstein as Monica Lewinsky and Sarah Paulson as Linda Tripp. The role of former first lady Hillary Clinton has not been cast, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The show will begin production this spring and tentatively air in the fall. Lewinsky will produce the season because executive producer Ryan Murphy felt that she was the only person who should be allowed to tell this particular part of American history. \u201cNobody should tell your story but you, and it\u2019s kind of gross if they do,\u201d Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter last year. \u201cIf you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the goddamn money.\u2019\u201d Although Owen\u2019s casting comes at a time when current President Donald Trump is going through an impeachment inquiry, Murphy told Deadline current events won\u2019t influence the Clinton-centric series, according to Deadline, which first reported the casting. \u201cWe do a show that is very thoroughly fact-checked and vetted and based on bestselling books by Jeffrey Toobin,\u201d Murphy\u00a0told Deadline\u00a0earlier this week. \u201cI think the reason why it\u2019s interesting is because you don\u2019t have to change anything to feel modern. And I think that idea of impeachment, obviously with Trump, is fascinating. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re changing things that much or mentioning Trump at all in our narrative.\u201d",
