      "content": " President Donald Trump\u2019s ex-pal and 10-day White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci gave White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney some tough love Thursday. Appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time,\u201d Trump\u2019s onetime ally, now a harsh critic, had some candid advice for Mulvaney: \u201cGet outta there.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, I\u2019ve met him a few times,\u201d Scaramucci said of Mulvaney. \u201cAs a guy, from a guy to a guy, I would say Mick, you gotta go,\u201d\u00a0Scaramucci told host Chris Cuomo. \u201cJust resign and get outta there. You\u2019re a young guy, you can rehab your career, you can own some of the mistakes that you made supporting this lunatic.\u201d Scaramucci made the comments while discussing the rough transcript of the Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which prompted the impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s conduct. \u201cI suspect that there\u2019s tons of them,\u201d Scaramucci speculated, referring to records of other Trump calls with world leaders. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Mulvaney\u2019s having a hard time, because he\u2019s looking at these transcripts. He knows that they are very odd; they\u2019re unpresidential.\u201d He suggested that if Mulvaney didn\u2019t stand down, it \u201chas to do with those elements that go on in your personality.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re under siege, Stockholm syndrome.\u201d he riffed. The acting White House chief of staff has been under fire in recent weeks for a series of damaging missteps. In attempts to put positive spin on Trump\u2019s decision to host the G-7\u00a0summit of world leaders at his own golf resort, and his alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine, Mulvaney struggled, and ended up creating more fodder for Trump critics. The back-to-back bad performances prompted speculation over Mulvaney\u2019s job security, although on Sunday he adamantly denied any consideration of resignation while appearing on Fox News. \u201cAbsolutely, positively not,\u201d he said. Scaramucci continued to be an outspoken Trump defender after being fired by the president in 2017. But this summer, he penned a withering op-ed for The Washington Post admitting he was wrong and vowing to work against Trump\u2019s reelection. He said the final straw had been the president\u2019s comments about the four progressive congresswomen of color who make up \u201cThe Squad\u201d \u2015\u00a0 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Trump wrote in a racist tweet that they should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d \u201cWhile it\u2019s difficult and embarrassing to admit my errors in judgment, I believe I still have the ability to make amends,\u201d Scaramucci wrote in his op-ed.

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " A bipartisan group of lawmakers said Wednesday they were deeply concerned that the NBA had kowtowed to China after the organization apologized for an executive\u2019s comments supporting protestors in Hong Kong. \u201cIt is outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition,\u201d the group, which included Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), wrote in a letter addressed to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cNBA players have a rich history of speaking out on sensitive topics of social justice and human rights inside the United States, and the NBA takes pride in defending their right to do so.\u201d \u201cYet while it is easy to defend freedom of speech when it costs you nothing, equivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values.\u201d The letter was also signed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The lawmakers\u2019 statement comes less than a week after the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager, Daryl Morey, posted a tweet in support of the democracy protests in Hong Kong, reading: \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The short-lived note prompted widespread anger in mainland China, where Communist Party leaders have ignited nationalist sentiment to encourage opposition to demonstrations\u00a0related to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Morey quickly deleted the message and issued an apology, but within days China\u2019s state broadcaster said it would stop showing Rockets games in the country and sponsors began suspending their contracts with the NBA. The team has been wildly popular in China, in large part because it drafted Yao Ming in 2002. The Washington Post noted that the NBA has since become the country\u2019s most popular sports league. The NBA, which makes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue in China, scrambled to contain the fallout. In a statement, the league said it recognized \u201cthat the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d A separate message in Chinese went further, saying the NBA was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate remarks.\u201d The response prompted its own backlash in the U.S., and lawmakers quickly lambasted the NBA for failing to defend free speech. Many called out Silver, the league\u2019s commissioner, for trying to have it both ways while attempting to batten down the organization\u2019s business interests. The lawmakers on Wednesday urged the NBA to take action to defend the rights of its players and staff, including steps to support their ability to express their opinions \u201cno matter the economic consequences.\u201d They also urged Silver to call China\u2019s bluff and refuse to air NBA activities in the country until government-owned broadcasters end their own boycott. \u201cYour statements come at a time when we would hope to see Americans standing up and speaking out in defense of the rights of the people of Hong Kong,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cYou have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government\u2019s targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it.\u201d Read the full letter below:",

      "content": " Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg\u00a0issued a rallying cry against Facebook, saying she may quit the social media platform due to its failure to curb the abuse that is frequently leveled against her. The 16-year-old from Sweden wrote in a post on Wednesday that \u201cthe constant lies and conspiracy theories\u201d that are spread on Facebook about her and others \u201cof course result in hate, death threats and ultimately violence.\u201d \u201cThis could easily be stopped if Facebook wanted to,\u201d Thunberg wrote, and the company\u2019s failure leaves her, \u201clike many others, questioning whether I should keep using Facebook.\u201d \u201cI find the lack of taking responsibility very disturbing,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that if they are challenged and if enough of us demand change \u2014 then change will come.\u201d Check out the post here: Thunberg\u2019s comment was in response to a video of Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) challenging Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday. The lawmakers confronted the billionaire tech boss over his company\u2019s failure to adequately police hate speech, its refusal to ban false statements in advertising, and its new digital currency project Libra. Check out the video here: Thunberg \u2015 who this week had a new species of beetle, the Nelloptodes gretae,\u00a0named after her by scientists at Britain\u2019s Natural History Museum \u2015 is currently touring North America after sailing to the U.S. for the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September. On her arrival in New York, she dinged President Donald Trump, who has called climate change \u201cbullshit\u201d and whose administration is pursuing an anti-environment agenda. \u201cMy message to him is just to listen to the science, and he obviously doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d Thunberg said at the time. On Thursday, Thunberg said people have been impersonating her to gain access to political leaders, actors, singers and musicians. \u201cI apologize to anyone who\u2019s been contacted \u2015 and maybe even misled by this kind of behavior,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI hope that those who want to sincerely reach out to me will do so using the recognized channels. The good news in all of this is that this just means we\u2019re having impact. Activism works. And see you in the streets!\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Robert Emmons Jr. is running for Congress in Illinois, challenging stereotypes about shootings in his hometown and seeking to unseat Democrat Bobby Rush.",
      "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman",
      "content": " Gun violence activist Robert Emmons Jr. is 27 years old and running for Congress in Illinois\u2019 1st District, seeking to unseat Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush, who\u2019s been in office for most of Emmons\u2019 life. Emmons, a progressive newcomer who is pushing for a Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d is placing gun violence at the center of his platform. His district, which includes Chicago\u2019s South Side, is one of the areas of the city with the highest rates of shootings. He moved to the lower-income area as a young teen and lost a close friend to gun violence in 2015. \u201cWe know what causes gun violence in our district,\u201d Emmons said in his campaign video. \u201cIt\u2019s not lack of morals... it\u2019s systemic poverty, it\u2019s educational inequity.\u201d He sees the solutions to gun violence in his district and beyond not as more law enforcement or even stricter gun laws \u2015 Illinois already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country \u2015 but rather as providing a living wage, making health care affordable, eliminating student debt and more. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m running: To make this the very last generation to be faced by everyday gun violence by addressing it by its root causes,\u201d Emmons told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s looking at what causes everyday gun violence: systemic poverty, a racist criminal justice system, our young people not having access to upward mobility.\u201d He hopes to challenge the myths people perpetuate about communities like his that suffer from everyday gun violence \u2015 and what the solutions are to address it. \u201cI hear a lot of mumbo jumbo saying young people in my community that look like me lack values or morals or it lies on the parents \u2015 it\u2019s none of those,\u201d Emmons said, noting the city has under-resourced schools and lead in its drinking water. Last year, Chicago schools serving low-income Black students were twice as likely as others to have a yearlong teacher vacancy, according to NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of morals or values \u2015 our parents are doing the best they can in a system that isn\u2019t designed for them to be successful, to fully be in the household, because they\u2019re working two to three jobs,\u201d Emmons added. But Emmons, who is Black, faces long odds against Rush, who is also Black and is known for his years of fighting for civil rights in the 1960s. Rush, who co-founded the Black Panther Party in Chicago in 1967 and was first elected to Congress in 1992, won the largely Democratic district last year with more than 73% of the vote. Emmons, born in the small town of Mays Landing, New Jersey, says he \u201cbecame the man I am today\u201d on Chicago\u2019s South Side, where he and his sister moved to live with their grandparents when he was about 13. He says that\u2019s the first time he saw everyday gun violence \u201cup close and personal.\u201d Every couple of months, his teachers would pull him and his classmates into their school auditorium to tell them someone had died in a shooting. After graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017, he juggled different roles in what he calls \u201csocial innovation,\u201d including as a program manager with One Goal, a group that helps students in underserved communities get into college, which helped him as a high schooler. He also consulted with the Obama Foundation as a youth community leader. When asked about his opponent, Emmons started off by saying how much he respects Rush\u2019s years of activism in decades past. Rush, who was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, lost his son to gun violence on the South Side in 1999. But Emmons noted Rush\u2019s support for the 1994 crime bill, which many have since criticized as leading to the over-incarceration of people of color, notably through so-called \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws that mandate harsh sentences. (In 2016, Rush said he felt \u201cashamed\u201d of voting for the bill.) He also criticized Rush\u2019s acceptance of corporate PAC money to his campaign. Rush, who is chairman of the House subcommittee on energy, has accepted $9,000 so far this cycle from the oil and gas industry, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. (Emmons, like many recent progressive candidates, doesn\u2019t take money from corporate PACs in his campaign.) Rush\u2019s campaign team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Emmons faces a tough path to victory in the 1st Congressional District, where former President Barack Obama, then an Illinois state senator, lost his challenge to Rush in 2000. Emmons has\u00a0raised $58,000, according to late-September campaign fundraising numbers, compared with Rush\u2019s $83,000 as of end of June. (Rush\u2019s latest fundraising figures have not yet been released.) Other contenders in the Democratic race include Sarah Gad, a University of Chicago law student running on tackling opioid issues, fueled by her own experience with addiction; and Darnell Leatherwood, a doctoral\u00a0candidate at the same school, who founded the nonprofit Black Boys Shine. Because the district is heavily Democratic, the March primary will almost certainly determine the winner of the seat. Emmons has scored endorsements from progressive groups People for Bernie and Brand New Congress. Brand New Congress had\u00a0backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in her 2018 race, in which she successfully unseated a 10-term Democratic incumbent in Queens. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids having to fight for the same things we have to fight for,\u201d Emmons said, who is married but does not yet have children. \u201cAs I\u2019m marching in the streets shutting down highways screaming \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 that\u2019s so my kids don\u2019t have to.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait our turn,\u201d he added. \u201cOur time is right now if we\u2019re going to truly change the trajectory of our future.\u201d This article has been updated with Emmons\u2019 latest fundraising figures.",

      "subtitle": "The Vermont senator was energetic in his first campaign event since suffering a heart attack.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The stakes in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate were particularly high for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who faced pressure to demonstrate his vitality to serve as president. Sanders\u2019 health may not have been the debate\u2019s central focus, but with an energetic performance he achieved the goal his campaign had set for him. Notwithstanding an occasional rasp in his voice, Sanders sounded as alert, impassioned and articulate as he ever has. The 12-candidate showdown at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was his first campaign event since his hospitalization for a heart attack nearly two weeks ago. With public polling showing Democrats doubting his physical viability, campaign aides vowed that the 78-year-old would assuage such concerns with a robust showing in the three-hour faceoff. He set the tone early, inserting himself into an exchange about the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to expound on a different topic. Discussing the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Sanders reiterated one of his campaign\u2019s enduring themes: That impeaching Trump \u2015 or otherwise confronting his crimes \u2015 is no substitute for delivering real economic relief for ordinary Americans. Sanders supports the president\u2019s ouster from office, but he said,\u00a0\u201cWhat would be a disaster if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump, and we\u2019re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, we\u2019re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change, we are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. \u201cWhat we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.\u201d Time and again during the debate\u2019s first hour, Sanders deployed the mix of passion, moral clarity, anger and dry wit that he is capable of when he is at his best. As part of a prolonged exchange over the middle-class tax hikes that his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan entails, Sanders managed to at once shame centrist critics and draw a subtle contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Warren, unlike Sanders, will not explicitly say that her support for the plan is tantamount to backing a tax increase for non-affluent earners. \u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d he said. Without naming them though, he saved his real ire for the likes of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who teamed up against Warren over her reluctance to explicitly defend tax increases that would help fund Medicare for All. \u201cThe issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d he said, prompting applause from the audience. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d Sanders\u2019 health and fitness to serve in the White House did not come up until the end of the second hour of the debate. CNN\u2019s moderators asked him, Biden and Warren \u2015 all of whom are septuagenarians and, if elected, would be the oldest to ever become a U.S. president \u2015 to speak directly to skepticism about their viability. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders began. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey interjected with a joke. \u201cAnd Sen. Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that\u2019s clear, as well.\u201d \u201cI do.\u00a0I\u2019m not on it tonight,\u201d Sanders quipped back, prompting laughter. Pressed again to address the health issue, Sanders invited everyone watching to attend his campaign\u2019s first rally since his heart attack \u2015 a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering on the East River waterfront in Queens on Saturday. Sanders extended a warm thank you to all those across the country who had reached out to express their concern while he was ill. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country \u2015 that is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d he said. To add to Sanders\u2019 solid performance, the campaign confirmed toward the end of the debate that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York would be endorsing Sanders at his comeback rally in Queens on Saturday. Sanders\u2019 aides were ebullient about his performance. Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager and the owner of a comic book store, said campaign staffers had started calling the senator \u201cWolverine,\u201d a reference to the fast-healing member of the X-Men, because of his \u201camazing regenerative powers.\u201d \u201cIf I can get a pint of his blood, I\u2019m going to store it for the next time I\u2019m ill,\u201d Weaver said. Sanders\u2019 supporters were apparently pleased with his showing as well. Over the course of the day Tuesday, Sanders raised over $620,000 from more than 40,000 contributions, according to the campaign. The campaign raised more money during the debate on Tuesday night than during any previous debate. From 9 to 10 p.m. Eastern, 35% of the donations coming into the Democratic small-donor site ActBlue were for Sanders, the campaign said. \u201cHands down, Bernie won the debate,\u201d said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. \u201cHis ideas dominated the night and his commanding performance left no doubt he\u2019s ready to go toe-to-toe with Trump and defeat him.\u201d Kevin Robillard contributed reporting from Westerville, Ohio.",

      "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2015 The chatter at Netroots Nation, a progressive gathering that attracts thousands of people each year, was expected to be on the rising influence of the left on the 2020 presidential election. But frustration with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, once considered an avatar of San Francisco liberalism, has emerged as a constant theme \u2015 centered on her recent criticism of progressive members of her caucus. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t act this way when Blue Dogs say stupid shit about other Democrats and about the party and constantly criticize the party,\u201d said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the popular liberal blog Daily Kos, referring to a group of conservative House Democrats. \u201cFor some reason, she\u2019s singling out these four for a special brand of conflict. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Progressive discontent toward the California Democrat has been simmering for months, with the feeling that the speaker has been putting the interests of the more conservative members of the caucus over the priorities of the left. She has pushed off pursuing impeachment of President Donald Trump and been slow to embrace ideas like the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d But it burst into the open when Pelosi gave an interview to The New York Times, dismissing the power of four of the biggest progressive stars in the House: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). The four women believed a House measure to provide emergency funding for the migrant crisis at the border didn\u2019t provide sufficient restrictions on how the Trump administration could spend the money. They were further incensed when the House later passed the weaker Senate version of the bill, after moderates signaled that they would provide the votes to support it. Omar said a vote for the bill was \u201ca vote to keep kids in cages and terrorize immigrant communities.\u201d \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got,\u201d Pelosi said when asked about some of their comments, expressing her displeasure that they voted against\u00a0the emergency funding legislation \u2015 and then chastised colleagues who did back it. Omar, Pressley and Tlaib, along with Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), spoke on a keynote panel Saturday morning and received a boisterous standing ovation. \u201cThe women of color who entered Congress \u2015 they\u2019re more than four votes,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People and moderator of the panel. \u201cFor millions of us, [they] represent blood, sweat and tears for us to have representation. They represent the best of American democracy.\u201d \u201cAnd yet, if you\u2019ve read the news, they\u2019ve faced attacks all year from the right wing and from Democratic Party leadership,\u201d she added to boos from the crowd. \u201cAs a young person \u2015 I\u2019m 19 \u2015 I feel like I can relate to the four people we heard speaking today better than Nancy Pelosi, and it makes me angry that that is the leadership the Democratic Party is basically putting up,\u201d Damen Alexander, an African-American political consultant from St. Louis, told HuffPost after the panel. Pelosi\u2019s comments to The New York Times infuriated progressive members of the House and their allies and escalated the long-brewing spat. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tweeted that moderate Democrats might as well be members of the \u201cChild Abuse Caucus\u201d for supporting a weaker Senate version of the border funding. But moderates, too, were incensed by the public criticisms that their progressive colleagues were lobbing their way, implying that they didn\u2019t support immigrant children and wanted to hurt them. A senior Democratic aide said there\u2019s been long-standing frustration at the positions and comments of \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2015 as Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib are known \u2015 making it harder for the moderates to take positions they believe best represent their districts and will help them win reelection. Netroots has never been the friendliest group for Pelosi, generally being a crowd that likes to root for outsiders. (The last time Pelosi spoke at the conference was in 2013.) But the frustration with her this year was more pronounced than in the past. And many of the liberal activists here \u2015 including some who supported her fight to become speaker when Democrats took back the majority in the 2018 elections\u00a0 \u2015 are baffled as to why she and her leadership team are aggressively picking fights with the progressive members. Speaking at a panel on Friday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tried to defend the pragmatic governing philosophy she argued was behind Pelosi\u2019s comments. But even she had to admit that the remarks were counterproductive. \u201cI don\u2019t think those comments were helpful to a broader picture of how we build progressive power in the House and what it looks like relative to overall Democratic power,\u201d she said. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) blamed Pelosi for the fact that, ultimately, a less progressive version of the border funding legislation ended up passing the House. \u201cShe is the leadership, so that\u2019s where the responsibility rests,\u201d he said during a Netroots discussion moderated by HuffPost on Friday, eliciting oohs and aahs from the audience. \u201cThe House has to carry its weight to restore the values of America. It failed on this occasion,\u201d he added, noting that a Democrat-controlled House should not be passing legislation that\u2019s a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats. Jayapal said the Senate shares a fair amount of the blame since a majority of the Democrats in the upper chamber voted for the bill. Pelosi had\u00a0chastised her caucus\u00a0members behind closed doors this week to stop tweeting their intraparty grievances and had indirectly criticized Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff for going after Pelosi and the moderate members on Twitter. But on Friday, the official Twitter account of the House Democratic Caucus tweeted an attack on Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff. Chakrabarti, who is also a person of color, had criticized a position taken by Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) in a late June Twitter discussion, which the House Democrats\u2019 account resurrected. Who is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\n\nHer name is Congresswoman Davids, not Sharice.\n\nShe is a phenomenal new member who flipped a red seat blue.\n\nKeep\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeHer\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeName\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeOut\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeOf\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeYour\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeMouth. pic.twitter.com/k4sV5hsbQl \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if everybody would just stop tweeting for a while,\u201d Haaland, a freshman member and one of the first Native American women elected to Congress, told reporters after her panel Saturday morning. Former Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.), who was a favorite of the Netroots crowd, cautioned in a Washington Post op-ed on Saturday that Pelosi needs to learn how to work with this new class of progressive fighters, but also\u00a0gave a defense of the speaker. \u201cI came to Congress fighting with the old establishment, but within months I came to realize that Pelosi can work for us even as she works to protect moderates,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI learned quickly that I could not fall on every sword.\u201d Both sides have been noting the racial politics of the fight. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have come to Pelosi\u2019s defense \u2015 upset that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the Justice Democrats are targeting one of its members in primaries. But Ocasio-Cortez has called out Pelosi for going after the four members, who are all high-profile women of color. Credo Action, a progressive group at Netroots, also noted the bad optics of Pelosi singling out these women. \u201cWe deserve better than white Democratic leaders who are willing to throw people of color under the bus to maintain their privilege,\u201d Credo Action Co-Director Heidi Hess said. \u201cNancy Pelosi needs to stop trying to shame and silence the progressive women of color in her caucus, stop enabling the moderates who want to compromise with Republicans\u2019 extremist agenda, and start leading her caucus with the urgency of someone who actually cares about the communities Trump is attacking every day.\u201d While the presidential election is still 16 months away, there were also warnings from progressives that excessive criticism of their ilk could discourage young people and people of color from voting. \u201cI think Pelosi needs to be very careful about making it seem she\u2019s denigrating the very people that deliver us the young and people of color votes that we have such a hard time turning out,\u201d Moulitsas said. This story has been updated to include Rep. Pramila Jayapal\u2019s comment that the Senate shares the blame for passage of less progressive border funding legislation.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "William Perry Pendley, a top Trump administration official in charge of managing one-tenth of all land in the United States, is a past contributor to 21st Century Science & Technology, a fringe magazine of the late cult leader, convicted fraudster and paranoid conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche. Documents also indicate that Pendley attended a conference in 1994 where two of LaRouche\u2019s associates called on anti-environmental groups to help kill Senate support for an international biodiversity treaty. Pendley wrote two pieces for 21st Century Science & Technology in the early 1990s when he was president of the right-wing nonprofit Mountain States Legal Foundation. The magazine was part of a network of LaRouche publications and chock full of pseudoscience, climate change denial and wild conspiracy theories. Its website, which is still live, features sections on \u201cGlobal Warming Fraud\u201d and calls for bringing back DDT, a banned toxic insecticide. LaRouche embraced a frenzy of conspiracy theories, contending that\u00a0Queen Elizabeth is an international drug trafficker, that AIDS is spread by mosquitos, that former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was a Soviet agent, and that the rock band The Beatles was \u201ca product shaped according to British Psychological Warfare Division specifications.\u201d The magazine was also a go-to platform for the so-called \u201cWise-Use movement,\u201d a group of anti-government organizations pushing to boost mining, drilling and logging on federal lands while deriding environmentalists as domestic terrorists. Pendley, a conservative lawyer with extreme anti-government and anti-environmentalism views,\u00a0was a key figure in that movement as it gained momentum in the 1980s. Pendley joined the Trump administration in mid-July as deputy director for policy and programs at the Bureau of Land Management and by the end of the month was elevated to the role of acting director\u00a0\u2015 thereby sidestepping the Senate confirmation process for the top BLM job. He\u2019s one of many high-ranking administration officials across the government with a history of battling the very agencies they now run. Pendley\u2019s ascent came as LaRouche\u2019s organization reemerged in national politics with a stunt aimed to embarrass those arguing for a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy framework for combating the climate crisis. Earlier this month, a woman working with LaRouche PAC appeared at a town hall meeting that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) held in her home district, pleading with the freshman lawmaker to consider \u201ceating babies\u201d as a solution to curbing planet-heating emissions. The stunt, immortalized in a viral video,\u00a0was widely mocked. But the beliefs that Pendley, 74, espoused in his writings have largely gone mainstream in the Republican Party. At least eight states across the South and Midwest have enacted laws to increase criminal penalties for anti-fossil fuel protests, according to the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law, which tracks anti-protest legislation. The progressive political action committee American Bridge first found \u2015 and shared exclusively with HuffPost\u00a0\u2015 Pendley\u2019s previously unreported writings. But a HuffPost investigation surfaced more details about his ties to LaRouche, highlighting the degree to which once-marginal extremists now control key portions of the federal government\u2019s response to a rapidly worsening ecological collapse. In a 1992 letter to the editor printed in 21st Century Science & Technology, Pendley came to the defense of the Sahara Club, a radical anti-environmental group dedicated to \u201cfighting eco-freaks and keeping public lands free.\u201d Two years earlier, the BLM had charged several Sahara Club members with trespassing following a protest motorcycle ride through an area of the Mojave Desert that had been temporarily closed to protect the imperiled desert tortoise. The magazine painted the arrests as a BLM setup and claimed that the tortoise was threatened solely because the agency refused to deal with a growing population of predatory ravens. A BLM official responded with a scathing letter clarifying that raven predation was only one of the threats to the tortoise population and calling into question the magazine\u2019s journalistic integrity. \u201cWe found it astounding that such an article would be included in a publication supposedly dealing with science and technology,\u201d the official wrote, adding that an internationally known scientist had flagged the article to the BLM with a note that read, \u201cThis appears to be the journal of scientific disinformation!\u201d The magazine also ran separate responses to the BLM official from the Sahara Club and Pendley. The Sahara Club claimed the federal agency closed the Mojave area as part of a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d it had against the club. Pendley accused the BLM of being a \u201cpushover\u201d for the Humane Society, which had filed a lawsuit challenging the government\u2019s proposed raven control program. \u201cRobbed of the only program that \u2015 according to the government\u2019s own documents \u2015 would have done the desert tortoise any good,\u201d Pendley wrote, \u201cthe government declared war upon the cattleman, the woolgrower, the miner, the off-highway vehicle (OHV) enthusiast and the City of Las Vegas.\u201d The following year, Pendley wrote an article in the magazine slamming a federal judge who ruled that a Montana rancher could not claim self-defense in the killing of a protected grizzly bear. Pendley called the decision \u201ca frightening embrace, by an agency of the U.S. government, of the view of many animal rights fanatics and environmental zealots that human beings are only co-equal inhabitants of the planet, no better than any other creature.\u201d The magazine and another LaRouche publication, the Executive Intelligence Review, also ran a number of stories in the late 1980s and early 1990s highlighting the work of Pendley\u2019s legal nonprofit. The fall 1989 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology, for example, includes a brief item about a hotline that the Mountain States Legal Foundation set up for the public to report \u201cacts of environmental terrorism.\u201d Pendley, who served as the group\u2019s president for nearly three decades, was quoted warning about \u201ca small band of radical environmental terrorists\u201d who had vandalized ski resorts and allegedly driven metal spikes into trees. He was referring to the radical environmental group Earth First!, although he didn\u2019t mention it by name. \u201cWe need more facts to establish participants, patterns, and to determine the existence of a conspiracy on the part of those who would kill fathers in the name of Mother Earth,\u201d Pendley said in the magazine. Freelance journalist Dennis King, who studied LaRouche and his followers for decades and published a book in 1989 titled \u201cLyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism,\u201d said it\u2019s significant that Pendley contributed to that magazine. While many in the wise-use movement shared LaRouche\u2019s views about environmental issues, very few publicly associated with the cult figure, he told HuffPost. \u201cIf you\u2019re writing for 21st Century Science & Technology, you\u2019re writing for people who really had some Nazi sympathies,\u201d King said. He noted that LaRouche and his followers had anti-Semitic beliefs and a long history of promoting and defending\u00a0Nazi scientists. That included\u00a0eulogizing Arthur Rudolph, the World War II German engineer who later\u00a0helped develop the Saturn V rocket\u00a0that put Americans on the moon. Pendley\u2019s pieces appeared in the magazine at the time that LaRouche was serving a federal prison sentence in Minnesota for fraud and conspiracy. The eight-time presidential candidate and convicted felon died in February at age 96. Pendley\u2019s antipathy for environmentalists goes back decades. He cut his teeth in government under James Watt, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Interior Department chief and widely considered among the most anti-environment Cabinet appointees in U.S. history. Pendley and Watt have close ties. They both hail from Wyoming and led the Colorado-based Mountain States Legal Foundation. Watt was the group\u2019s first president and Pendley held the position from 1989 until last December. In 1981, Pendley followed Watt to the Interior Department and worked to open federal lands to drilling and mining. The Washington Post once described him as \u201cWatt\u2019s ideological twin.\u201d In the 1996 book \u201cGreen Backlash,\u201d which documents the rise of the anti-environmental movement, British investigative journalist Andrew Rowell wrote that Pendley \u201chad been a close personal friend of James Watt\u2019s since 1975,\u201d six years before Watt appointed him to the Interior Department post. Under Pendley\u2019s command, the Mountain States Legal Foundation, an industry-funded group once described as the \u201clitigating arm of the Wise Use Movement,\u201d hosted a series of wise-use conferences. At a 1993 event, Pendley compared environmentalists to communists, saying they are \u201clike watermelons, red on the inside, green on the outside,\u201d according to Rowell\u2019s book. And one day before a 1994 wise-use event in Joseph, Oregon, that featured Pendley as a speaker, demonstrators in that town\u00a0hung, tarred and feathered effigies of two environmental activists. Pendley has compared the Earth First! group to the Nazis, saying \u201cthey are no better than Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts,\u201d according to Rowell. And in a 2013 interview with the Federalist Society, Pendley asserted that \u201cthe environmental community is no longer concerned about human beings.\u201d It\u2019s rhetoric that closely mirrors that of Watt and LaRouche. Watt likened environmentalists to the Nazis and described green activists as \u201ca left-wing cult which seeks to bring down the kind of government I believe in.\u201d In 1990, several years after he was forced to resign as Interior chief, he famously declared that \u201cif the troubles from environmentalists cannot be solved in the jury box or at the ballot box, perhaps the cartridge box should be used.\u201d LaRouche, through his media outlets, often railed against environmental \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201ceco-fascists,\u201d going as far as to compare the movement to Satanism. Earth First! was one of his organization\u2019s primary targets. In his 1996 book, Rowell wrote: \u201cLyndon LaRouche was one of the first people to brand anyone involved in any progressive protest as a \u2018terrorist\u2019. Following his lead many sections of society are now labelling environmentalists as terrorists. William Perry Pendley calls greens terrorists. MSLF [Mountain States Legal Foundation] has held conferences on eco-terrorism, and has been instrumental in having Earth First! labelled as a terrorist organisation.\u201d Early in Reagan\u2019s first term, LaRouche and his followers gained direct access to several administration officials, and in March 1981 LaRouche landed an invitation to have breakfast with Interior Secretary Watt, as journalists King and Ronald Radosh reported for The New Republic in 1984. While that sit-down proved largely unsuccessful in terms of winning over Reagan Cabinet members, the LaRouchians spent the next two decades working to forge alliances with anti-environmental organizations and industry groups, King told HuffPost. It\u2019s unclear if Pendley ever met LaRouche in person, either while working in the Reagan administration or at MSLF. But he did cross paths with two LaRouche associates at a \u201cWise Use Leadership Conference\u201d in Sparks, Nevada, in July 1994, according to documents collected by an organization affiliated with the Environmental Working Group and archived by Greenpeace. Elyssa Rosen, a representative of the environmental group Sierra Club, apparently infiltrated the conference. Her notes detail a bizarre, disorganized and delusional gathering. Attendees sold T-shirts that read \u201cClinton-Free Zone\u201d and likened environmentalists to witches and druids. Speakers at the event included Pendley, who reportedly stressed the need to \u201cexpose the hidden costs of environmental policy,\u201d as well as a \u201cLaRouche groupie\u201d and forest scientist named Michael Coffman, Rosen wrote in her notes. Also at the conference was Rogelio \u201cRoger\u201d Maduro, a close LaRouche associate and an editor at the magazine according to a memo in the archived collection. At the time, Maduro was leading the LaRouche organization\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign to kill U.S. Senate support for the Convention on Biological Diversity, a nonbinding conservation treaty. Maduro urged the wise-use leaders gathered in Nevada to make defeating the biodiversity treaty a top priority and disclosed that he was working with the American Sheep Industry Association on a paper to garner opposition, as detailed in a lengthy 1997\u00a0report by the Environmental Working Group. Coffman, a conspiracy theorist,\u00a0also reportedly called conference attendees to defeat the treaty. Later that year, Coffman published a piece in 21st Century Science & Technology titled \u201cThe Pagan Roots of Environmentalism.\u201d The collaborative effort by LaRouche\u2019s network and wise-use organizations ultimately proved successful. The treaty never came to the Senate floor for a vote, and the United States to this day has not signed on to the agreement. Maduro took credit in a September 1994 issue of Executive Intelligence Review, writing that the report he created for the sheep association was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in defeating the pact. He applauded several of the groups that were present at the July 1994 conference for mobilizing in a way that left \u201cU.S. Senate staffers flabbergasted, State Department officials screaming, and greenies weeping,\u201d but did not mention Mountain States Legal Foundation. Coffman also claims to have \u201cplayed a key role in stopping the ratification\u201d of the treaty. Ron Arnold, who is widely considered the father of the wise-use movement, told\u00a0with The Washington Post in 1995 that the movement was unaware it had joined forces with the LaRouche organization to fight the treaty. He claimed he didn\u2019t know Maduro would speak at the Nevada conference and that LaRouche followers were not welcome at future events. Pendley did not grant HuffPost an interview or respond to a list of emailed questions about his writings and the 1994 wise-use conference. Instead, he sent a statement after this story published in which he accused HuffPost of \u201ccherrypicking.\u201d \u201cAs someone in the public arena for nearly four decades, I\u2019ve given countless public statements and written scores of articles on a wide variety of topics,\u201d he said. \u201cCherrypicking a few of them out of context is neither useful nor connected to my current position. I\u2019m focused now on implementing the policy priorities of the Trump administration and Secretary Bernhardt within the authorities and mission given this agency by Congress. My personal views are irrelevant in this context.\u201d The Interior Department, which is the parent agency of the BLM and is headed by Secretary David Bernhardt, did not respond. Pendley has faced an onslaught of criticism since joining the Trump administration. Environmentalists and other critics fear his appointment signals a future sell-off of federal lands in the West, pointing to Pendley\u2019s long history of advocating for just that. Pendley has dismissed such concerns and refused to comment about his past statements, including describing basic climate science as \u201cjunk science\u201d and comparing immigrants to a \u201ccancer.\u201d All of it, he told a room full of reporters earlier this month in Colorado, is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his current job leading a bureau that manages more than one-third of all federal land and 700 million subsurface mineral acres. But the reality is that his opinions and experience taking on the federal government are what make him a perfect fit for the Trump administration, and no doubt a main reason he landed the high-ranking position. Nearly three decades after contributing to the LaRouche publication, Pendley and what\u2019s left of LaRouche\u2019s organization continue to pound similar drums. Along with its stunt at Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s town hall, the LaRouche organization has taken aim at 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. In September, the Executive Intelligence Review published a conspiracy-laden \u201cspecial report\u201d titled \u201c\u2018CO\u2082 Reduction\u2019 Is a Mass Murder Policy: Designed by Wall Street and the City of London.\u201d The report\u2019s landing page features a close-up of Thunberg wearing a hooded jacket. Up until his appointment to Trump\u2019s BLM, Pendley was posting under the Twitter handle @Sagebrush_Rebel, a reference to the Sagebrush Rebellion movement of the 1970s and \u201980s that sought to remove lands from federal control. His tweets often lashed\u00a0out\u00a0at environmental activists like Thunberg, whom he likened to a cult leader. In a phone interview, Rowell marveled at the number of environmental foes featured in his 1996 book \u201cGreen Backlash\u201d who went on to hold positions of power in the Trump administration, which has prioritized gutting environmental regulations, and to join the chorus that\u2019s taken to attacking and demonizing the next generation of environmental advocates. \u201cThere is nothing more fundamentally pathetic \u2015 a bunch of old right-wingers going after Greta,\u201d Rowell said.

      "content": " Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a Green New Deal co-sponsor, last week returned $46,900\u00a0in donations after violating a pledge to reject money from the fossil fuel industry by accepting contributions from lobbyists who worked for oil and gas companies. In the first six months of this year, the senator raised $10,000 from six lobbyists whose clients included oil giants Chevron and BP. His campaign received an additional $5,000 from four lobbyists who worked for fossil fuel companies, according to a third-quarter Federal Election Commission filing released last week. The campaign contributions, activists said, violated the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a popular oath overseen by more than a dozen environmental groups, which Markey signed in December. Signatories to the pledge vow to turn down donations of \u201cover $200 from oil, gas, and coal industry executives, lobbyists, and PACs.\u201d But a thorough review found 28 donations that violated the pledge, namely frolobbyists whose clients included, but were not primarily, fossil fuel firms. The loophole exposed a gap in a pledge that\u2019s become a key litmus test for how seriously Democrats take the corrupting influence of an industry increasingly\u00a0accused of crimes against humanity. MassLive first reported the campaign\u2019s decision. The activists who supervised the pledge last Wednesday sent an updated set of guidelines to the more than 1,800 campaigns who have signed, including a database of \u201cpolitically active\u201d fossil fuel companies to avoid. \u201cFollowing this clarification, the campaign identified donors who met a technical requirement of the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge, of which we were previously unaware,\u201d John Walsh, Markey\u2019s senior campaign director, said in a statement. \u201cWe quickly worked to ensure technical compliance with the pledge.\u201d Oil Change U.S., one of the main groups that control the pledge, offered forgiveness. \u201cCampaign finance is a sticky wicket, so we understand that mistakes will be made,\u201d Collin Rees, a senior campaigner with the nonprofit, said in an email. \u201cTaking ownership of those mistakes and rectifying them quickly is precisely in the spirit of the pledge, and exactly what we need to see from politicians willing to stand up to the fossil fuel industry.\u201d But Markey\u2019s opponents looked poised to use the donations \u2015 which were largely reported in the conservative press \u2015 as ammunition as the senator heads into a primary election next year with three opponents,\u00a0including a significant challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.). Markey, 73, an old-guard liberal first elected to Congress 40 years ago, boasts a lengthy record as a climate champion. A decade ago, he led the charge on Democrats\u2019 last major effort to curb planet-heating emissions. But, earlier this year, he emerged as a key ally of the insurgent faction of left-wing Democrats, partnering with freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to introduce a historic resolution outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Markey is now counting on the grassroots network of young Green New Deal activists to undercut Kennedy\u2019s message of generational change. The right-wing site Breitbart identified the first round of fossil fuel donors in June, which included $2,800 from Steve Elmendorf, a former deputy campaign manager for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid who now lobbies for British oil giant BP; $2,700 from Susan Brophy, who represents YPF S.A., one of Argentina\u2019s top petroleum producers; and $2,100 from David Castagnetti, another former Kerry aide who now lobbies for Chevron. Two other employees at Castagnetti\u2019s firm who are also registered as Chevron lobbyists each gave $500, while another Chevron lobbyist, Brian Arthur Pomper of the lobbying giant Akin Gump, gave $2,000. The conservative-leaning Boston Herald identified several more last week. Those included $1,500 from\u00a0Akin Gump partner Sean D\u2019Arcy, a lobbyist for the coal-fired utility FirstEnergy Solutions; $2,000 from Capitol Counsel founder Shannon Finley, who is registered to represent the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Exxon Mobil and Chevron; and $2,000 from Cassidy & Associates CEO Kai Anderson, who lobbied for the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline. The reports could dent Markey\u2019s best shield against Kennedy, the four-term congressman and heir to a political dynasty so beloved by Bay State voters that a fictional member of the clan received high favorable ratings in a speculative 2011 poll. The 39-year-old has also signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge and is pitching his candidacy as a generational shift. Markey isn\u2019t the first high-profile signatory to violate the pledge. Despite signing it last year, Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who nearly unseated Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in 2018, received dozens of donations from oil and gas executives, according to a December report from the watchdog site Sludge. A week later, activists removed him from the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge website. Facing fierce criticism from groups including Sunrise Movement, O\u2019Rourke, now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, signed the pledge in May. Markey\u2019s case was more nuanced, said Sunrise political director Evan Weber. The senator\u2019s campaign set up \u201can extremely rigorous\u201d system to vet donations from executives, trade groups and corporate political action committees working for the fossil fuel industry. But lobbyists whose clients include but are not primarily in the oil, gas or coal business fell through the cracks. The issue, he said, demonstrated the \u201cgrowing pains\u201d within a movement that blossomed from a high-profile Capitol Hill protest last November into a global coalition backed by climate scientists and, in at least one case, a national government. \u201cWhen we launched the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, it was little more than a symbolic idea to really force a conversation about the role of fossil fuel money in politics,\u201d Weber said. \u201cFrankly, we hadn\u2019t figured out all the minute details around campaign finance law.\u201d Sunrise Movement, which cut its teeth campaigning for climate hawks last year, made Markey one of its first 2020 endorsements in August, praising the senator for using \u201chis experience and seniority to advance the movement, not [using] the movement to advance himself.\u201d The Sierra Club followed suit. Markey has jointly announced a climate debate with two of his challengers, labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan and businessman Steve Pemberton, scheduled for early November. Kennedy has not committed to joining, though the press release stated: \u201cWe are still hopeful that Congressman Kennedy will join us.\u201d While Kennedy may attempt to seize on the snafu, the Green New Deal that Markey has championed represents a pressure point for the younger challenger. The Green New Deal movement is largely led by Democrats from the ascendant wing of hard-line progressives, such as Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Kennedy endorsed the Green New Deal as a policy framework last year, but only after facing pressure. Since then, he\u2019s allied himself with the movement\u2019s natural opponents. Former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), the high-ranking nine-term incumbent Ocasio-Cortez unseated, hosted a fundraiser for Kennedy in October, The Boston Globe reported. While Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and progressive Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins endorsed Markey,\u00a0Kennedy secured the backing of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), an avowed centrist who was one of just three Democrats to vote against the Green New Deal resolution in March. Kennedy also owns as much as $1.75 million worth of stock in fossil fuel companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, though his campaign said \u201cthese are family holdings over which the Congressman exercises no control.\u201d\u00a0And as progressive stalwarts such as Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) endorse Markey, Kennedy secured the backing of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), an avowed centrist who was one of just three Democrats to vote against the Green New Deal resolution in March. \u201cHe is proud of his strong record standing up to fossil fuel interests,\u201d Emily Kaufman, a campaign spokeswoman, said by email. To groups like Sunrise Movement, Markey\u2019s record remains a safer bet. \u201cWe\u2019re not really questioning Markey\u2019s commitment,\u201d Weber said. \u201cHe is one of the most outspoken champions for one of the most ambitious platforms on climate in American history.\u201d",

      "content": " In a letter to\u00a0Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday, a bipartisan group of legislators criticized the tech company for having removed an app from its App Store that aided pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The lawmakers highlighted Apple\u2019s hypocritical failure to live up to its own ethical principles, citing Cook\u2019s claim last year that Apple is a values-driven company. \u201cFor those of us who support the promotion of basic human rights and dignity, it was refreshing to hear a tech titan say that priorities were more important than profits,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cSo you can imagine our disappointment to read that Apple had removed HKMap.\u201d Apple pulled the app from its store\u00a0under pressure from the Chinese Communist Party earlier this month. Pro-democracy protesters in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory had been using the crowdsourced mapping app to track police movements. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but earlier this month, it defended the decision, telling Reuters in a statement that the app had been used to \u201cendanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.\u201d After noting that Apple has censored at least 2,200 apps in China, some of which undoubtedly helped aid oppressed ethnic minorities in the country, the lawmakers suggest that the tech giant may be complicit in that oppression. \u201cYou have said publicly that you want to work with China\u2019s leaders to effect change rather than sit on the sidelines and yell at them,\u201d they write. \u201cWe, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity.\u201d The letter boasts an impressive range of bipartisan support, with Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) co-signing along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.). The lawmakers close with an appeal to upholding democratic values and a suggestion that the company act in a way that matches its lofty vision. \u201cWe urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\u201d Read the full letter, below:",

      "subtitle": "One congressman accused the Facebook CEO of \u201chiding behind the poorest people in the world.\u201d",
      "author": "Ryan Grenoble",
      "content": " Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in defense of a proposed digital currency called Libra\u00a0that he would like regulators to sign off on. It went about as well for Zuckerberg as can be expected, given many lawmakers\u2019 extreme lack of trust in Facebook. Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) established the mood of the hearing early on, detailing Facebook\u2019s many high-level failures, including how it enables discriminatory housing practices, stifles competition, has repeatedly failed to safeguard consumer privacy, permitted foreign governments to interfere in elections, and willfully allowed politicians to lie on the platform. \u201cWith all of these problems I have outlined, and given the company\u2019s size and reach, it should be clear why we have serious concerns about your plans to establish a global digital currency that would challenge the U.S. dollar,\u201d Waters told Zuckerberg. \u201cIn fact, you have opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up.\u201d Zuckerberg countered by first acknowledging that Facebook has indeed made mistakes, and then warning that America risks falling behind if it doesn\u2019t move forward on digital currency adoption. \u201cWhile we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting,\u201d Zuckerberg cautioned in his prepared remarks. \u201cIf America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\u201d Zuckerberg also pushed Libra as a means to promote financial inclusion and increase access to banking systems for historically underbanked populations, like minorities and women. That claim didn\u2019t sit well with Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) who grilled the CEO for failing to support underbanked populations through more conventional and already existing systems like Minority Depository Institutions. \u201cWords are different than actions, sir,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about the underbanked and unbanked, how much of Facebook\u2019s money is in MDIs \u2015 that would provide services and help the unbanked and underbanked? Have you invested in any of the MDIs in America or any place else in the world?\u201d Zuckerberg conceded he wasn\u2019t sure. The back and forth provided an opening for Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) to later accuse Facebook of wanting to build an encrypted financial instrument that will mainly be \u201cgreat for tax evaders, drug dealers and terrorists.\u201d \u201cMr. Meeks called your bluff on this idea that you\u2019re creating a payment system for the poor and unbanked,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done no effort to help the unbanked anywhere else, at any other time.\u201d Sherman, who didn\u2019t ask a single question in his allotted time, closed with a shot at Zuckerberg, whom he accused of being dishonest about his true intentions. \u201cFor the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world, and say that\u2019s who you\u2019re really trying to help ...\u201d Sherman said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency: drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders.\u201d Other representatives strayed from the topic at hand, pressing Zuckerberg on other critical issues like sex trafficking on the site, and backsliding on\u00a0core civil rights issues like redlining\u00a0which are exacerbated by advertising bias. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) focused on Facebook\u2019s\u00a0refusal to fact check lies made by politicians, asking Zuckerberg to clarify how the platform regulates political behavior, given that politicians are allowed to \u201cspread disinformation\u201d in their paid Facebook advertisements. Zuckerberg affirmed that Facebook would remove any ad that deliberately advertises the wrong election date, as well as content that calls for violence, advocates physical harm, or would result in voter or census suppression. But he drew a blank when Ocasio-Cortez asked if, hypothetically, it would be OK for her to run ads targeting Republicans by falsely claiming they voted for the Green New Deal. \u201cDo you see a potential problem here with the complete lack of fact checking on political advertisements?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell congresswoman, I think lying is bad, and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would bad,\u201d Zuckerberg replied. This story has been updated with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s questions.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the 2020 presidential race, breaking with fellow first-term progressive women of color who call themselves \u201cthe Squad.\u201d \u201cAt a time when so many people find their lives threatened and their dreams denied, we need bold, compassionate leaders who put power back in the hands of people,\u201d Pressley said in an email to supporters on Wednesday. \u201cI am so grateful to call Elizabeth Warren a friend, a partner in good, and my Senator. I am proud to endorse her candidacy for President.\u201d The other \u201cSquad\u201d members \u2015 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.),\u00a0Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) \u2015 endorsed Warren\u2019s progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), last month. Pressley released a video announcement along with her emailed statement and said she would join Warren on the campaign trail on Thursday in North Carolina. \u201cI have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums,\u201d Pressley said in the video. \u201cAnd she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.\u201d Warren retweeted Pressley\u2019s video on Wednesday, writing: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be fighting alongside you to put power in the hands of the people.\u201d Pressley\u2019s endorsement grants Warren a high-profile congressional backer and may also boost her standing with Black voters in her quest to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Last year, Pressley became Massachusetts\u2019 first Black woman elected to Congress. She was the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. The current Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has a substantial lead among Black voters nationally and in South Carolina \u2015 the first state in the South to hold its primary. Black voters comprise more than 60% of the state\u2019s electorate. Warren has done considerable outreach to Black progressive groups\u00a0over the last year, but has struggled to overtake Biden. Pressley\u2019s endorsement comes a day after Biden published an essay that appeared to escalate his feud with Warren over their competing health care plans, and characterized Warren as elitist and condescending. Biden and Warren, along with at least seven other Democratic candidates, will face off at a Nov. 20 debate in Georgia.",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " Twitter will no longer allow political advertising on its platform out of concern for the spread of misinformation, founder Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday. \u201cWhy? A few reasons ... \u201d Dorsey began a long string of tweets. \u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions,\u201d Dorsey said. Twitter will take additional steps to quell foreign-made bots on the platform, which played a part in the Russia-backed 2016 disinformation campaign. Dorsey continued:\u00a0\u201cInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\u201d The new policy is a stark contrast to that of Facebook, which is grappling with increasingly vocal critics of its hands-off political advertising policy \u2015 the site refuses to fact-check claims made by politicians except in extreme cases. Facebook has refused to pull a Trump campaign ad that baselessly accuses former Vice President Joe Biden of promising $1 billion to Ukraine to benefit his son. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg also did little to clear up questions about Facebook\u2019s approach to stifling misinformation during a congressional hearing earlier this month, where he was not able to tell Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez definitively whether a hypothetical ad she described would be permitted on the platform. Dorsey appeared to take multiple swipes at his tech-giant counterpart. \u201c[I]t\u2019s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad \u2026 well ... they can say whatever they want!\u2019\u201d Dorsey wrote in one tweet. The Facebook founder claimed in a recent letter to employees that the company is \u201cworking hard\u201d to \u201cgive users more context on the content they see, demote violating content, and more.\u201d Zuckerberg has also used freedom of speech as his primary defense of Facebook\u2019s lassez-faire policy, which Dorsey addressed head-on: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression. This is is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.\u201d He called on lawmakers to enact \u201cmore forward-looking\u201d political advertising rules, acknowledging that it is \u201cvery difficult to do.\u201d\u00a0The entire problem posed by social media platforms engaging with political messaging is \u201cworth stepping back in order to address,\u201d Dorsey concluded. Zuckerberg responded to Dorsey\u2019s announcement in a Facebook earnings call Wednesday afternoon with a speech that one reporter described as \u201cimpassioned.\u201d Citing broadcasters who are legally required to air political ads, Zuckerberg reportedly reiterated he believes Facebook should continue serving paid political content. The news was also not taken kindly by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, Brad Parscale. \u201cThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known,\u201d Parscale tweeted. Twitter\u2019s new policy won\u2019t affect certain bipartisan topics, such as ads supporting voter registration, but it will extend to \u201cissue ads,\u201d Dorsey said. The policy will go into effect Nov. 22, with more details provided by Nov. 15. Read the full announcement below. This has been updated with Parscale\u2019s reaction to Dorsey\u2019s announcement.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " A slew of elections on Tuesday, covering territory from the Mississippi Delta to the wealthy Virginia suburbs to the city of Philadelphia, and offices from city council to governor, will collectively serve as a test of just how nationalized American politics has become. In Mississippi and Kentucky, two men \u2015 one a local political legend, the other the son of a popular former governor \u2015 will seek to convince their neighbors to turn against the Republican Party they trust wholly at the national level and elect Democrats to the governor\u2019s mansion. In Virginia, Republicans hoping to cling to control of the state legislature are counting on a pair of damaging local political scandals to matter more than suburban voters\u2019 support for gun control and loathing of President Donald Trump. And in Philadelphia, a local political machine is seeking to defeat a progressive whose campaign received a major boost from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who was previously the communications director for the Democratic Governors Association, said results from last year\u2019s midterm elections only point to things getting tougher for candidates trying to swim against the political tides. \u201cThe real story of the 2018 election was that everyone went to their political homes, turnout was through the roof, and places that were Republican were Republican, places that were Democrat were Democrat,\u201d Leopold said, arguing it would be a strong performance for Democrats if they win just one of the three governor\u2019s races this year in Louisiana, Kentucky and Mississippi. \u201cThat\u2019s the playing field we\u2019re in now during the Trump era, with hyper-vigilance and hyper-involvement. That makes red states redder and blue states bluer.\u201d Not a single federal office is up for grabs Tuesday. But the election results could also offer previews of key political questions ahead of the 2020 presidential election: Do Republicans stand any chance of reclaiming the suburbs in the Trump era? Can Democrats \u2015 conservative or otherwise \u2015 possibly hope to win back rural white voters in significant numbers? Here are the elections to watch on Tuesday. The two headline elections on Tuesday night are battles for governorships in Kentucky and Mississippi, both states where Democrats\u2019 decadeslong grip on state government finished its long decline during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Trump won both states by double digits in 2016, but this year, Democrats have managed to mount robust and well-funded campaigns in both states. In Mississippi, Democrats have something of a dream candidate: Jim Hood, the state\u2019s mulleted, four-term attorney general known for helping consumers win big settlements against insurance companies after Hurricane Katrina. Hood, who is one of just three statewide elected Democrats in the Deep South, is facing Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a fairly standard issue southern Republican of the country-club variety. Public polling has shown Hood with a chance of victory, and Republicans are worried enough about the outcome to deploy Trump to Tupelo \u2015 Hood\u2019s home base \u2015 to help lock down conservative voters ahead of the election. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a far-left Democrat running Mississippi \u2014 wait a minute,\u201d Trump told the state\u2019s voters on Friday night. \u201cHow\u2019s this guy, you know, I can\u2019t believe this is a competitive race. It\u2019s, like, embarrassing. I\u2019m talking to Mississippi, you know? I\u2019m talking to Mississippi. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Hood, who opposes abortion rights and supports gun rights, bears some similarities to Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. As Edwards did during the campaign that led to his upset victory four years ago, Hood has focused on Medicaid expansion as a political winner that would deliver health coverage to 100,000 more residents in a state with one of the highest uninsured rates in the country and played up his moderate bona fides.\u00a0(He\u2019s also\u00a0hammered Reeves as a political insider\u00a0and career politician \u2014 which is likely an effective charge, though not as effective as Edwards\u2019 attack on then-GOP Sen. David Vitter for picking \u201cprostitutes over patriots.\u201d) \u201cThey know I\u2019m a moderate and I\u2019m gonna get things done,\u201d Hood said of the state\u2019s voters ahead of Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cThey know nothing crazy is gonna come through that legislature, it\u2019s gonna be a conservative legislature.\u201d Part of Hood\u2019s effort to distance himself from his party, however, has meant declining to endorse Democrat Jennifer Riley Collins,\u00a0a former state American Civil Liberties Union director and retired Army colonel who is running to replace him as attorney general. She would be the first African American elected statewide in Mississippi since the Reconstruction era. (Mississippi is 38% African American, and its politics are sharply polarized along racial lines, requiring Democrats to make inroads with conservative whites to win.) In an interview, Riley Collins downplayed Hood\u2019s decision, and played up what her victory would mean for the state: \u201cIt means Mississippi is no longer a closed society. It means Mississippi is now open to all of its citizens,\u201d she said, adding that \u201covercoming barriers is nothing new for an African American woman in Mississippi.\u201d Both Hood and Riley Collins have an additional barrier: They\u2019re competing with Republicans under a Jim Crow-era law requiring a candidate to win not only a plurality of the vote, but also a majority of the state\u2019s legislative districts. If they don\u2019t, the state legislature gets to determine the victor. The Democratic candidate in Kentucky, Attorney General Andy Beshear, has not run as far from party orthodoxy as Hood has. The son of a popular former governor, he supports abortion rights, and,\u00a0by emphasizing education and health care, his campaign has largely reflected those run by successful 2018 congressional candidates. Beshear\u2019s relatively standard campaign has forced his unpopular opponent, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, to aggressively nationalize the race. Bevin\u2019s abrasive style \u2014 he once accused striking teachers of abetting child molestation \u2014 has alienated Kentucky voters. (Campaigning for him on Monday night, Trump declared: \u201cHe\u2019s such a pain in the ass, but that\u2019s what you want.\u201d) Bevin has repeatedly attacking Beshear for his abortion stance, linking him to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and dubbed him \u201cthe Hunter Biden of Kentucky\u201d during one debate. \u201cIn Kentucky, if you turn it into a shirts-and-skins exercise, it should be better for Republicans because there are more of us than them,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP political strategist based in Louisville. Public polling points to a close race in Kentucky, which is dominated by rural white voters, but Jennings noted Republicans are on a substantial winning streak in the state, outperforming expectations in 2014, 2015 and 2018. Democrats, similarly, are aware of how quickly a Kentucky election can turn against them: What appeared to be a close race in 2015 turned into a 9-point Bevin blowout. Remember when Virginia Democrats\u2019 scandals dominated national news? The state\u2019s Republicans hope you do. In early 2019, revelations about Gov. Ralph Northam allegedly wearing blackface and two sexual assault allegations against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax rocked the party, which had been steadily turning the state blue for more than a decade.\u00a0(Fairfax has denied the sexual assault allegations.) But 10 months later, the scandals have done little to dampen Democratic expectations. The party, backed by millions in outside spending from liberal groups and donors, is optimistic about taking back\u00a0the three seats they need to control the House of Delegates and the two seats necessary to capture the state Senate. Trying to stave off a dive into policymaking irrelevance, Republicans have resurrected the scandal. In a race for a GOP-held Senate seat in Loudoun and Prince William counties, two of the nation\u2019s wealthiest jurisdictions, Republican Geary Higgins is airing an ad alleging that his Democratic opponent, current state Del. John Bell, \u201csilenced\u201d two women who accused Fairfax. Other Republicans around the state have made similar attacks in mailers. On a conference call hosted by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Bell said the scandals were a non-issue for voters. \u201cI haven\u2019t had to explain it to a single voter. And voters see it for what it is: a complete distraction,\u201d he said, before firing back at Republicans: \u201cDid they get permission from those victims? I don\u2019t think they did. They completely used their tragedy.\u201d Bell, meanwhile, has joined almost every Democrat running for the legislature by placing a heavy emphasis on gun control. In his television ad, he picks up a bullet on a high school football field to highlight his efforts to overturn a law allowing firing ranges within 100 yards of a school. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the NRA, especially when it comes to keeping our kids safe,\u201d he says in the 30-second spot. And while Higgins and other Virginia Republicans spent the summer and early fall portraying themselves as moderates, he\u2019s ending the race with attempts to fire up conservatives. Higgins held a Monday afternoon rally with right-wing talk show host Mark Levin, and was endorsed by Trump just after midnight on Monday. Bell was confident that the president\u2019s endorsement would backfire in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Northam in 2017 and Sen. Tim Kaine in 2018. \u201cI wished he had done it about two weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve helped me even more.\u201d The Working Families Party, a national progressive group backed by unions, is looking to make a big splash in Philadelphia on Tuesday. It\u2019s fielded candidates for two at-large city council seats reserved for members of minority parties (i.e. not Democrats). Historically, Republicans have won those seats, but the WFP is hoping to \u201ckick the party of Trump out of city hall.\u201d The Democratic political machine in the city, led by former Congressman Bob Brady, has resisted this effort. When Councilwoman Helen Gym, a rising star in the city\u2019s Democratic circles, backed the candidacy of Kendra Brooks, a public education advocate who is running as an independent with the backing of the WFP, Brady lashed out at Gym for breaking party ranks. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid and she shouldn\u2019t do it, and I think it\u2019s going to hurt her in the long run,\u201d Brady told The Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cThey\u2019re taking votes from a Democratic candidate and that\u2019s our slate, and anybody that\u2019s taking votes from a Democrat is the opposition.\u201d But Brooks soon received an even more high-profile endorsement: Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, announced her support of Brooks in September. That endorsement set up a natural political science experiment: Do Philadelphia voters care more about their longtime party machine? Or about the preferences of a leading national progressive politician? In an interview, WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell argued that victories by Brooks and Philadelphia\u2019s other WFP-endorsed candidate, Nicholas O\u2019Rourke, would have an outsized impact. \u201cIt would change the politics of Philly dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll mean progressives [on the council] have a bloc.\u201d He said if their efforts in Philadelphia are successful, they could bring the strategy to other jurisdictions that have city council seats reserved for non-Democratic candidates, including Washington, D.C. \u201cWe want this to be a showcase of independent political power that could take hold in any city in the country,\u201d Mitchell said.",

The president called in to British radio station LBC for an interview Thursday with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, as the U.K. reached the now-postponed Brexit deadline. Farage, who hosts the LBC show, asked Trump \u2015 as someone who Farage said has faced \u201cmore tough press and perhaps unfair press than anybody else alive\u201d \u2015 to weigh in on Meghan\u2019s harsh media coverage. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching her interviews and I\u2019ve seen it and she has been taking it very personally,\u201d Trump answered, referring to a recent\u00a0ITV documentary in which the duchess opened up about dealing with the invasive British tabloids since her marriage to Prince Harry. \u201cI guess you have to be a little bit different than that, but she takes it very, very personally. I can understand it,\u201d Trump said. The president also lavished praise on Prince Harry and Queen Elizabeth, describing the whole royal family as \u201cterrific.\u201d \u201cWe had something that was so incredible,\u201d Trump gushed about meeting Harry when he\u00a0visited Buckingham Palace\u00a0in June. \u201cNow that was months ago \u2015 how time flies.\u201d Harry reportedly gave the president a rather frosty reception\u00a0during that visit, which followed an interview in which the president infamously described Meghan as \u201cnasty.\u201d Trump made the remark upon being told that she had once said she would leave the U.S. if he was elected president because he was \u201cmisogynistic\u201d and \u201cdivisive.\u201d The president later walked back his remarks, saying Meghan was \u201cvery nice\u201d and \u201cI hope she enjoys her life\u201d while also reiterating that she was \u201cnasty to me.\u201d Trump and the duchess did not meet during his latest U.K. visit. She was on maternity leave at the time. At the start of October, Harry announced that the couple was filing a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter between Meghan and her estranged father. He said the \u201cruthless\u201d British tabloid coverage of his wife was taking a painful human cost on his family. Others have come to the duchess\u2019 defense in the wake of the lawsuit, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who, having had her own share of unfair press, said she felt \u201can enormous amount of empathy\u201d for Meghan. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also spoken out, describing the media behavior toward Meghan as \u201cinexplicable\u201d and highlighting race as a potential factor in her mistreatment by the press.

      "author": "Josephine Harvey",
      "content": " Jane Fonda was already prepared to go to jail every week until January \u2015 but now she\u2019s more prepared than ever. The 81-year-old actor appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d Tuesday to discuss her recent arrests during protests at the Capitol while fighting the U.S. government\u2019s inaction on climate change. The Academy Award-winner, whose political activism goes back as far as the Vietnam War, was jailed overnight last Friday. She had been arrested every Friday before that for three weeks as part of the weekly \u201cFire Drill Fridays\u201d events in Washington, D.C., which she said she was inspired to attend after viewing teen climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s address to Congress in September. Moderator Whoopi Goldberg gifted Fonda a care package to show her support for her civil disobedience, complete with a neck pillow and thermal blanket so that Fonda will \u201calways be comfortable in the joint.\u201d Fonda was released without charges Saturday afternoon and told The Washington Post in an interview, \u201cMy 82-year-old bones hurt.\u201d Fonda will turn 82 in December, and with the date falling on a Saturday, she expects to spend her birthday in jail, she told\u00a0The New York Times. During Tuesday\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d Fonda said she felt the burden of protesting the fossil fuel industry should not just fall on young people. \u201cI\u2019m following what the young people are doing. I\u2019m not telling them. They are inspiring me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fossil fuel industry is doing more and more and more to harm us and our environment and our young people\u2019s futures.\u201d Fonda cheered the Green New Deal climate proposal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), which she said could be funded by cutting the \u201ctotally bloated\u201d military budget. She urged people to take action and engage in civil disobedience to demand change. Fonda acknowledged that getting arrested was a risk, but she said it was one she was willing to take to get her message heard. During her appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d the actor said she won\u2019t actually be permitted to bring in anything beyond the clothes on her back (the trick is wearing layers, she quipped), but she plans to keep protesting until January, when production of her Netflix show \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d resumes.

      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " Most Democrats expect the governing agenda of the next Democratic president to be set by, well, whomever that next president might be. Ben Cardin, Democratic senator from Maryland, has other ideas. \u201cI think we\u2019ll take up our own proposals,\u201d Cardin told The Hill on Tuesday. Asked if he would vote for a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d package \u2014 a policy supported by the two most popular 2020 contenders in the Iowa caucuses \u2015 the 76-year-old Cardin suggested the bill wouldn\u2019t even be granted a vote. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have a chance to do that,\u201d he said. Over the past two years, progressives frustrated with the timidity of the Democratic Party\u2019s opposition to President Donald Trump have trained their fire on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Pelosi\u2019s caucus had to drag her kicking and screaming into opening an impeachment inquiry into the president, and she repeatedly invokes political constraints as a reason to eschew a progressive agenda. \u201cWhat works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan,\u201d she recently told Bloomberg. As a practical matter, Pelosi\u2019s political instincts have been unreliable all year. Impeachment is popular, and both Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are polling just fine against Trump in Michigan, a state Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. But the deeper problem is not her judgment, but the outdated attitude she and other Washington Democrats like Cardin have maintained even as Democratic voters have moved on. The politics of the 2020 primary will alter public opinion, but a fall 2018 survey by the liberal think tank Data for Progress found a broad base of support for progressive policies among all voters \u2014 not just Democrats \u2014 with 68 percent supporting a wealth tax on fortunes of $100 million or more, 64 percent supporting a green energy infrastructure project and 57 percent supporting fully legalized marijuana. In July 2019, a Data for Progress/YouGov poll showed roughly 80 percent of Democrats support expanding Medicare into \u201cthe main health insurance provider for all Americans.\u201d the months since, Medicare for All polling has depended a lot on what Democrats on television have been saying about it. There is a strange balancing act taking place in which elected officials recognize that they must describe themselves as \u201cprogressive\u201d in order to meet the approval of rank-and-file Democratic voters, while at the same time insisting that ambitious reforms are dangerous and immoral. \u201cI don\u2019t find anything progressive about saddling our kids and our grandkids with a balance sheet that is so far in the red that they\u2019ll never be able to dig their way out,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told the Hill last month, dismissing Medicare for All with a talking point ripped straight from conservative think tanks. This is the caucus that warns us that Trump is a dangerous and unstable president, while voting to expand his military budget. It\u2019s the caucus that decries Trump\u2019s giveaways to the super rich, but lines up to support his bank deregulation bill. And it\u2019s the caucus that believes Senate Democrats should be slamming the door on the next president\u2019s agenda a full year before the election is even held. This tension between Democratic voters and their leaders has been evident all year. Back in June, the party experienced its most serious rupture\u00a0in years after Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) cut a deal to send billions of dollars in fresh funding to Trump\u2019s border detention camps. Saikat Chakrabarti, a progressive activist then serving as chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, responded with a Twitter screed in which he tore into \u201cfiscally conservative\u201d members of the New Democrat and Blue Dog caucuses as \u201cthe new Southern Democrats.\u201d \u201cThey certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the \u201940s,\u201d he wrote in a since-deleted Tweet. The analogy was more than a little overwrought; the most glaring divide between the Dixiecrats of yore and their northern colleagues was over Jim Crow and civil rights. But recent polling from Pew Research Center shows that today\u2019s Democratic party is more united and more progressive than ever around questions of race and immigration. What made the June vote so deflating was that elected Democrats in Washington had simply failed to stand up for the obvious values of their voters. But Chakrabarti was correct to note that a fissure has opened within the party, one that may well put an expiration date on the emerging Democratic mega-coalition. Since the Barack Obama presidency, rank-and-file Democrats have proved ideologically flexible \u2015 they generally identify as \u201dprogressive\u201d\u00a0or \u201dliberal\u201d\u00a0but continue to support more conservative Democratic incumbents in primary elections. Voters are typically willing to defer to top Democrats for what counts as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cprogressive.\u201d With a Republican in the White House, these contradictory impulses have had few governing implications.\u00a0But the increasingly fractious disputes among elected Democrats and liberal intellectuals that have been breaking out since Trump\u2019s election will eventually filter down to the electorate \u2015 particularly if either Warren or Sanders win the presidential nomination and Democrats in the Senate continue to badmouth key planks of their agenda. The sheer size of the Democratic voter wave on the horizon, meanwhile, seems to indicate that there will eventually be a lot of variation among them come 2021, especially as those voters begin to look beyond a common loathing for Trump. In the past, such massive coalitions have been key to progressive policy victories, but they have involved often vicious intraparty feuds that demanded skillful leadership and a willingness to risk political majorities for the sake of policy victories. Though primary voters continue to fret about \u201celectability\u201d as their overriding concern heading into the presidential primaries, the trend line for 2020 is a Democratic blowout. In 2017, Democrats crushed in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and picked up a Senate seat in Alabama \u2015 repeat, Alabama. In 2018, Democrats romped from Oklahoma City to Orange County, California, picking up 41 House seats and a Senate seat in Arizona. On Tuesday night, Democrats won a gubernatorial election in Kentucky and appear to have extinguished the last remnants of the Republican Party as an electoral force in Virginia. As ever, the future remains unwritten, but there is currently every reason to believe that Nov. 3, 2020, will be a big night for the Democratic Party. The sheer disgust that Trump evokes in much of the electorate is mobilizing otherwise ambivalent citizens to participate in record numbers, and most of them are voting Democrat. Voter turnout on Tuesday night was the highest for a Kentucky gubernatorial election in 24 years. Nationwide turnout in 2018 was the highest in 40 years for a midterm election. The big question will be what to do with this majority, which may not last long and may not reappear for decades to come. For many Democrats in Washington, the answer is: not much.",

      "content": "Nema Brewer\u2019s phone buzzed a little after 9 p.m. on Tuesday as she sat at home alone, too anxious to be around anyone else on an election night she\u2019d spent nearly two years waiting for. \u201cY\u2019all are going to win this,\u201d the incoming message, from a Republican friend Brewer had come to know well, told her. Too nervous to leave her home, Brewer frantically searched the internet for confirmation that Gov. Matt Bevin, Kentucky\u2019s unpopular leader, had really lost. Even when Democrat\u00a0Andy Beshear declared victory a few minutes after 10 p.m. \u2014 a result Bevin\u00a0hasn\u2019t formally accepted \u2014 Brewer still wasn\u2019t sure it was real. \u201cWe always believed that we could shock the world,\u201d Brewer told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u201cBut it was still kind of shocking when we did it.\u201d Aside from the governor himself, no one did more to cement Bevin\u2019s status as the least-popular Republican governor in the United States than Brewer, the public school employee who sparked Kentucky\u2019s mass mobilization of teachers last year, when thousands of educators responded to Bevin\u2019s proposed changes to public pensions by calling in sick and shutting down Kentucky schools. Bevin has spent four years mimicking President Donald Trump\u2019s bullying approach to politics. He has turned his ire on nearly anyone who questioned him, and the anger he inspired in so many Kentuckians seemed to turn Tuesday\u2019s election into a referendum on the governor, so much so that he was the only Republican on Kentucky\u2019s ballot who failed to win. But in a red state like Kentucky, where Trump is popular and the GOP is, too, beating Bevin was never going to be easy. It took nearly perfect circumstances in the Bluegrass State \u2014 and required a candidate, a party, a campaign and an energized grassroots movement working in concert to take advantage of it. And it needed teachers. The campaign to oust Bevin began on a blustery, cold day in April 2018, after the governor and Republicans in the state legislature forced through changes to an overburdened public pension system for teachers and state workers. Decades of teacher frustration over cuts to public education budgets\u00a0erupted into massive protests in Frankfort, the state\u2019s sleepy capital city, as thousands of red-clad educators, many of them locked out of legislative proceedings inside, swore to \u201cremember in November\u201d and drive Republicans out of office. The protests, which followed a similar outburst in West Virginia, were initially organized in a Facebook group called KY 120 United, which Brewer and another school employee had set up to link teachers in districts across the state. Its membership ranks swelled to nearly 40,000. A record number of Kentucky educators launched bids for public office during the 2018 campaign cycle, many with eyes set on state legislative seats. The teachers scored some early wins, but overall, 2018 was a bit of a disappointment. Republicans retained supermajority control of the state legislature, despite the best efforts of Democrats. The teachers tried not to get discouraged. \u201cWe\u2019ve been singularly focused on Matt Bevin for a year and a half,\u201d Brewer said. So, too, has Beshear. Always Bevin\u2019s most likely opponent in 2019, the son of popular former Gov. Steve Beshear used his post as state attorney general to antagonize Bevin, particularly through lawsuits that attempted to block some of the governor\u2019s biggest priorities. Beshear quickly allied himself with the teacher movement, greeting them on the steps of the capitol during the protests and taking up their cause. He sued Bevin to block the implementation of the pension bill, and in December, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in his \u2014 and teachers\u2019 \u2014 favor. As the governor\u2019s race began to heat up in 2019, the teachers helped set the agenda in the Democratic primary, focusing the race on public education in particular. Beshear, who had chosen high school assistant principal Jacqueline Coleman \u2014 an original KY 120 United member \u2014 as his running mate, won the primary in May, and turned his attention toward the fall election against his archrival. The teachers were ready, too. The experience of 2018 left Brewer feeling like they had \u201cgotten our sea legs a little bit,\u201d and were more organized and prepared to boost Bevin\u2019s opponent. From that point on, the teacher movement, which included other public workers and labor unions from the beginning, and Beshear \u2014 along with a Kentucky Democratic Party hell-bent on not losing again, after ugly defeats in 2015, to Bevin, and 2016, when Democrats lost a centurylong grip on the state House \u2014 formed something of a symbiotic relationship that benefited them both. Beshear wanted to focus the race on economic issues, like Bevin\u2019s cuts to public education, his targeting of public pensions, and his attempts to end Kentucky\u2019s embrace of Medicaid and Obamacare. Beshear showed an uncanny ability to stay on message, but the teachers also made that easier. The prominence of their issues in the race weakened Bevin\u2019s attempts to go after Beshear on social issues like abortion, and turned what Bevin wanted to be a national referendum on Trump and impeachment into a fight over local issues. When Beshear argued that Bevin was a bully who broke with Kentucky\u2019s more polite politics, the teachers provided a relatable face of who, exactly, Bevin had targeted. \u201cEverybody has a teacher they can look back on and say they helped them and made a difference,\u201d said David Patterson, communications director for the Kentucky Education Association. \u201cAnd those people decided that this drumbeat of denigrating and attacking teachers wasn\u2019t going to fly.\u201d And when Beshear, whom statewide Democrats have hailed for running one of the most organized campaigns in Kentucky history, needed an army of volunteers to help turn out the vote, the teachers were there. Nearly 1,000 educators volunteered for Beshear\u2019s campaign, Patterson said. Beshear and the state party knocked on more than 1 million doors during the campaign, and ran a get-out-the-vote operation that helped turn out voters in deep blue areas of the state, like Lexington and Louisville, and in rural counties. The teachers, meanwhile, staged election events in nearly all of the state\u2019s 120 counties, Patterson said, and ran their own canvassing efforts. \u201cWe knocked on so many doors, Brewer said. \u201cWe had people who\u2019d been out for months knocking on doors. We sent text messages. We made phone calls to friends and family. We had days of action. I\u2019ve never seen so much engagement from people who\u2019d never done it before.\u201d And in the end, the teachers allowed Beshear to aggressively expand the political map. One of the most impressive feats of Beshear\u2019s campaign is that he managed to appeal to both progressive-minded base voters in the big blue cities and more rural areas of the state that typically favor Republicans, seemingly without compromising on issues that normally terrify Kentucky Democrats. (Beshear supports abortion rights and some limited gun control measures.) Beshear ran up a 100,000-vote margin over Bevin in Louisville, won numerous counties in the Appalachian coalfields, and flipped suburban counties in northern and western Kentucky where Democrats had struggled to make inroads before. Early on, his campaign believed it could contend in those areas, and conservative educators, angry over Bevin\u2019s targeting of teachers, helped: Some even\u00a0canvassed for Beshear just three years after voting for Trump. There are any number of factors that change a statewide race that\u2019s decided by 5,000 votes, and any number of groups that may have made the difference: Beshear and his campaign, a revitalized Kentucky Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Governors Association \u2014 both of which poured late money into the race while leaving the particulars to locals who knew where it needed to be spent best \u2014 and the activists on the ground. But after Beshear won on Tuesday, seemingly everyone reserved praise for the teachers. Beshear thanked them in his victory speech, and multiple Democratic officials used the same descriptor to describe their impact on the race. \u201cThey were huge,\u201d said state Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey. Brewer, meanwhile, said this election was the first time in her time as an organizer \u201cthat the grassroots was really accepted in the process. Instead of us being the agitators, we were a part of the conversation. And I really commend the Beshear campaign for that.\u201d The immediate aftermath of Beshear\u2019s somewhat shocking victory in a state Trump won by nearly 30 points just three years ago led to searches for national meaning, even in a race defined by its distinctly local flavors. Republicans downplayed any national implications of the loss. The party held on to two state legislative districts that were up for grabs, and actually won control of two statewide offices Democrats had long held. Daniel Cameron, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, won the state attorney general race \u2014 an office Democrats had held for more than 70 years. And Republicans took over the secretary of state office. Those victories, they argue, show Bevin\u2019s loss was about him more than any broader problems for Trump or the GOP as a whole. \u201cOnly Bevin lost, but one bad apple did not spoil the bunch,\u201d Scott Jennings, a Louisville-based GOP strategist, wrote on Twitter. Many Republicans were reluctant to fully engage in post-defeat soul searching, noting Bevin was still contesting the race. In the campaign\u2019s final days, the party increasingly worked to nationalize the race and inject culture war topics into the state\u2019s electoral bloodstream. \u201cPresident Trump and Gov. Bevin are making Kentucky great again,\u201d a narrator said in one of the final ads from the Republican Governors Association. \u201cBut socialists in Washington want to impeach Trump and take us backward. Andy Beshear is part of their radical resistance.\u201d As the narrator mentioned impeachment, images of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared onscreen. And on Monday night, Republicans flew in Trump himself to make the case for Bevin. (\u201cIf you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. And if you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can\u2019t let that happen to me!\u201d Trump declared.) The move made sense \u2014 Trump remains popular in the state, and polling showed more than 60% of Kentucky voters oppose impeaching the president. But Democrats suggested Trump\u2019s campaign rally may have backfired in cities like Louisville and Lexington, where voters detest the president and huge margins voting for Beshear helped doom Bevin. \u201cHis showing up probably energized Democrats as much as it did Republicans,\u201d Self, the Kentucky Democratic Party chairman, said. \u201cWhile they had folks sitting in an arena, we had folks knocking on doors. And one of those certainly affects an election more than the other.\u201d National Republicans argued that their strategy of nationalizing the race was effective \u2014 Beshear\u2019s negative ratings from voters rose slowly throughout the campaign \u2014 but simply wasn\u2019t enough to convince conservative-leaning voters to put their personal dislike of Bevin aside. National Democrats, meanwhile, were touting Beshear\u2019s narrow focus on economic issues as a way the party could triumph in other red state gubernatorial races. \u201cHe was able to cut through that national noise. When Bevin was talking about impeachment and Donald Trump, he was talking about things that matter to people in their daily life like health care and education and roads,\u201d said Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo,\u00a0 chair of the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association. \u201cThis is a repeatable strategy.\u201d Regardless, Beshear\u2019s victory will have a major impact on Kentucky, where he has pledged to boost funding for public education,\u00a0raise teacher pay\u00a0and overhaul the school board Bevin stocked with his own appointees, many of them hostile to public schooling. Beshear plans to end Bevin\u2019s efforts to roll back Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which he said will protect health care for 95,000 Kentuckians, and restore voting rights to 140,000 convicted felons in a state with one of the country\u2019s highest rates of disenfranchisement. \u201cIt was an amazing night for working people in the commonwealth. It wasn\u2019t just teachers,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cA lot of people want to make this a referendum on Trump, a referendum on impeachment, a referendum on McConnell. For us, this was a moment to slam the brakes on a really bad governor.\u201d Nema Brewer\u2019s phone buzzed a little after 9 p.m. on Tuesday as she sat at home alone, too anxious to be around anyone else on an election night she\u2019d spent nearly two years waiting for. \u201cY\u2019all are going to win this,\u201d the incoming message, from a Republican friend Brewer had come to know well, told her.

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " EASTON, Mass. \u2015 It\u2019s a revolution either way. The question is whether Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey can keep it. The Green New Deal\u2019s elder statesman ostensibly came here Sunday night to defend his record on his signature issue in what was supposed to be a debate with his three primary opponents. But the only one who showed up, star labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan, all but endorsed the fight Markey\u2019s been waging for much of the past year, offering little contrast with the incumbent. \u201cThis needs to be a revolution,\u201d said Liss-Riordan, famous for suing ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft on behalf of underpaid drivers. \u201cBut this revolution hasn\u2019t started yet.\u201d That was news to Markey and his supporters. The senator repeatedly cited Virginia Democrats\u2019 historic victory last week running on a Green New Deal. And he brought people to back him up.\u00a0More than two dozen marched through the cold, eerily silent campus at Stonehill College, a private Catholic liberal arts school roughly 45 minutes south of Boston, in support of an incumbent who\u2019s transformed himself in 2019 as a climate revolutionary. \u201cWe can break the back of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Markey said to an auditorium filled with campaign volunteers. \u201cThe time has arrived for this political revolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I have introduced into the political dynamic.\u201d It was hard to believe Markey is in any way an underdog in the race. Liss-Riordan, despite attracting a small group of advocates who sang the union hymn \u201cSolidarity Forever\u201d ahead of the debate, \u201clikely won\u2019t even be on the ballot,\u201d said one Markey supporter. Markey\u2019s other challenger, businessman Steve Pemberton, dropped out last month. But Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a rising star in Washington and heir to the state\u2019s great political dynasty, seemed confident enough in the threat he posed to skip the debate altogether. \u201cThis particular debate should be held in a frontline community most impacted by our country\u2019s climate failures,\u201d Emily Kaufman, a Kennedy spokesperson, said by email, adding that \u201ca 2020 date will ensure better voter attention on this critical issue, rather than the middle of Veteran\u2019s Day weekend.\u201d The incumbent bet big on the Green New Deal earlier this year, sponsoring a resolution that outlined the core tenets of an industrial plan to transform the federal government in ways unseen since Markey, 73, was in diapers. In doing so, he lent the credibility of his four-decade career in Congress to a movement led by his party\u2019s insurgent left wing. Now Markey is counting on the grassroots activists who propelled the Green New Deal into the political mainstream, many of them teenagers and 20-somethings, to help him fend off Kennedy\u2019s message of a fresh face without serious policy distinction. So far, they\u2019re behind him. On Sunday night, Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, the newly elected socialist candidate to the Cambridge city council, endorsed Markey in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cHe\u2019s been the champion of the Green New Deal,\u201d Sobrinho-Wheeler said in an interview in Cambridge. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a member of \u2018the squad\u2019 or a new insurgent to fight for big, bold ideas. If you do, groups on the left are going to notice that.\u201d In September, Kennedy held a 14-point lead over Markey \u2015 42% to the incumbent\u2019s 28% \u2015 in a\u00a0Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll that surveyed a head-to-head race between the two Democrats. But another 29% were undecided. The Kennedy name is beloved by Bay State voters, so much so that a fictional member of the clan received high favorability ratings in a 2011 poll testing a hypothetical run. Besides cashing in on his name, Kennedy is pitching his candidacy as generational change. His early promotional materials make little mention of policy differences between himself and Markey. His campaign is quick to point out that Kennedy, too, signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a promise to reject contributions from donors in the oil, gas and coal businesses, and joined Markey in sponsoring the House version of the Green New Deal resolution. Against almost any other septuagenarian incumbent, Kennedy might have a compelling case. He has a fairly progressive record, including backing the Green New Deal, albeit after weeks of activists\u2019 nudging. Markey\u2019s hawkish record on foreign policy attracts criticism from the left, notably his votes to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and using military force in Syria in 2013. And Markey\u2019s signature effort to curb climate-changing emissions, the 2009 cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey, failed, albeit due to forces outside the then-congressman\u2019s control. But Markey\u2019s full-throated embrace of the Green New Deal has won loyal allies. Sunrise Movement, the grassroots campaigners backing the proposal, made Markey one of its first endorsements in 2019. Sierra Club, the old-guard environmental group with considerable electoral firepower, followed suit. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the face of the Green New Deal movement, endorsed Markey before Kennedy even officially entered the race. When reporters identified fossil fuel lobbyists among Markey\u2019s donors, groups like Oil Change U.S. \u2015 which oversees the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge \u2015 offered swift forgiveness and worked closely with the senator\u2019s campaign to expunge the contributions and enact a new, stricter vetting process for donors. Kennedy carries baggage that activists don\u2019t trust. He owns as much as $1.75 million worth of stock in fossil fuel companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, though his campaign has said these are \u201cfamily holdings over which the Congressman exercises no control.\u201d He\u2019s also received the backing of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), a hard-line centrist who was one of just three Democrats to vote against the Green New Deal resolution in March. \u201cHe apparently believes it\u2019s in his best interest,\u201d State Auditor Suzanne Bump, who endorsed Markey, said of Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. The primary election won\u2019t be held until next September, meaning there\u2019s plenty of time for each of the three contenders to make their case to a state that, despite being solidly blue, has a history of defying electoral expectations. (In 2010, Massachusetts elected right-winger Scott Brown as its first Republican senator since 1972 after former state Attorney General Martha Coakley, considered a shoo-in, neglected to aggressively campaign in the special election.) But climate change could be the deciding issue of the race. The issue was already top of mind in the state. Last year, in a WBUR poll, two-thirds of Massachusetts voters said climate change is already increasing the frequency and devastation of storms in the region.\u00a0National polls indicate\u00a0that the climate crisis is now a top concern for Democratic primary voters going into the 2020 election. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, more than 1.2 million Massachusetts voters cast ballots. In the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial primary, under 600,000 Bay Staters voted. Given those figures, and the increased participation during presidential elections, turnout in next September\u2019s Senate primary could reach about 1 million, said Nathaniel Stinnett, executive director of the Boston-based Environmental Voter Project. The nonpartisan get-out-the-vote group, which uses algorithms to identify registered voters who don\u2019t usually cast ballots but likely care deeply about environmental issues and then urges them to vote,\u00a0estimated that as many as 260,000 voters in the Senate primary will be Bay Staters who list climate or the environment as top priorities. \u201cThat means climate voters could have an enormous impact on this election,\u201d Stinnett said.

      "author": "Travis Waldron",
      "content": " A tumultuous year for Latin American politics took another sharp turn on Sunday when Bolivian President Evo Morales, the region\u2019s longest-serving leftist leader, suddenly resigned amid massive protests and pressure from the armed forces following last month\u2019s disputed election. Morales said Monday he was headed for Mexico after being granted asylum there. The former president, a socialist who became Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president when he took office in 2006, was not the only Bolivian lawmaker to step down: his vice president and Socialist Party leaders in the Bolivian House and Senate also resigned, as did many of Morales\u2019 ministers. The resignations came after the Organization of American States \u2014 the member group of 35 nations in the Americas \u2014 issued a preliminary report that it said found \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in Bolivia\u2019s October election. The departures, Morales said, were an attempt to calm the nation amid what he called a military-led coup against his government, and he warned in a speech from La Paz that \u201cdark forces have destroyed democracy in Bolivia.\u201d Now the country, which had stabilized under Morales after years of unrest, finds itself in the position of having no legitimate elected leader. Morales\u2019 opponents have painted his ouster as an effort to restore democracy after his 14 years in power, his supporters at home and abroad say it\u2019s a coup, and the future is anything but certain in the splintered Andean nation. Morales was first elected in 2005 as part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d that swept leftist politicians into power across Latin America \u2014 most notably in Venezuela, where socialist Hugo Chavez won the presidency in 2001, and Brazil, which elected left-populist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva president in 2002. An ardent critic of neoliberalism in South America during the 1980s and 1990s, Morales raised taxes on certain industries and instituted an ambitious slate of social reforms that eventually helped cut Bolivia\u2019s poverty rate in half. A global boom in commodities prices fostered vast economic growth that helped stabilize what had once been South America\u2019s poorest nation. Morales won reelection in 2009 and again in 2014. In 2016, facing constitutional term limits that would have prevented him from running for a fourth term, he put forth a referendum on whether he should be allowed to run again. The referendum failed,\u00a0and Morales initially said he would respect the result. But in 2017, a court ruled the referendum invalid, saying that Morales had been subject to an illegal smear campaign. He pledged to run again even as his opponents declared the decision an \u201cattack on democracy.\u201d Although Morales remained popular, especially among parts of his base, the referendum polarized Bolivia and motivated opponents who\u2019d long sought to remove him from power. Inside MAS, Morales\u2019 socialist party, there had long been a belief that the party\u2019s political opponents wanted nothing more than to end the social programs Morales had instituted. The saga over the referendum, however, also deepened mistrust of Morales not only by his opponents, but even by some Bolivians who had once supported him. Ahead of the Oct. 20 elections, most polls showed Morales comfortably ahead of a cohort of opposition candidates. Carlos Mesa was his most notable opponent; Mesa had served as president from 2003 to 2005 but resigned amid protests led by Morales. The polls did suggest Morales could struggle against a unified opposition in a head-to-head race, so the question entering Election Day was whether Morales would successfully avoid a runoff election. To do so, he needed to either win a clear majority of votes, or top 40% and finish at least 10 points ahead of his closest challenger. Early on, results appeared to show Morales running well ahead of Mesa but potentially short of the threshold he needed to avoid a runoff, and as Bolivia\u2019s election commission updated publicly available results, Mesa declared that he had indeed qualified for a second round against Morales. Late that evening, the election commission suddenly stopped publicly updating results \u2014 and didn\u2019t come back online again until the next day. When it did, it showed that Morales had gained a few percentage points of support and had cleared the runoff threshold. It was a bad look for Morales and the electoral authorities, who struggled to provide an initial explanation. Mesa and many Bolivians who\u2019d long sought to end Morales\u2019 hold on the presidency were incensed\u00a0and immediately cried foul. Protesters took to the streets across the country. Mesa and the opposition did not present any specific evidence of fraud, but the OAS immediately called for an audit of the election results and processes. Morales agreed to the audit\u2019s terms, but Mesa, who said he did not trust the agreement, did not. As the audit took place over the subsequent two weeks, Bolivia\u2019s protests intensified, and supporters and opponents of Morale clashed across the country. The protests broke out on Oct. 21 across the country as frustration with Morales boiled over.\u00a0Protesters targeted election offices and other government buildings over the initial days of the demonstrations. The protests intensified on Oct. 25 after Bolivian electoral officials declared Morales the outright winner of the election, and Bolivians from across the ideological spectrum took to the streets again. \u201cThere are indigenous and workers both on the side of the government and the opposition forces,\u201d a former Morales ambassador wrote of the demonstrations. Two people died in the initial round of protests. A third person, a student, later died, inspiring even larger protests and arguments between both sides about who was to blame: The police claimed the student had been fatally injured by protesters, who argued that police had shot the student as he ran into an alley. Morales painted the death as the beginning efforts of \u201ca new sort of coup\u201d in which the opposition was \u201clooking for dead people to accuse us.\u201d Last week, anti-Morales protesters targeted Patricia Arce, the mayor of the small town of Vinto and a member of Morales\u2019 party.\u00a0Protesters dragged Arce through the street, cut her hair and doused her with red paint after setting fire to her city hall offices. Morales and his supporters also faced widespread allegations of fostering violence and attacking protesters, especially after a caravan of miners said this week that they had been shot at while driving to join demonstrations in the capital. In some areas of the country, footage of the protests showed police beginning to join in as the demonstrations continued last week \u2015 a key sign that Morales\u2019 grip was weakening. The OAS said Sunday morning that its audit had found significant irregularities in the Bolivian electoral process. The problems in the computerized electoral system were \u201cof such magnitude that they must be deeply investigated by the Bolivian State to get to the bottom of and assign responsibility in this serious case,\u201d the OAS said. It also questioned the likelihood that Morales had won enough votes to avoid a runoff and called for new, immediate elections. Morales\u2019 supporters have claimed there were no specific irregularities on election night \u2015 that the OAS report was too vague in its assertions and that there was a misunderstanding of Bolivian electoral processes. The Center for Economic Policy Research, a progressive think tank based in Washington, released an analysis this week that it said \u201cfound no evidence that irregularities or fraud affected the official result.\u201d But Morales called for new elections on Sunday and said that he would replace the electoral tribunal overseeing them in an attempt to placate opponents. Mesa and the opposition were unmoved and continued calling for his resignation. Protests broke out again. Morales also lost support from some of his key allies, including some top labor organizations and Indigenous groups, some of which had already turned against the president over environmental policies that threatened their land and had contributed to outbreaks of fires in the Bolivian Amazon this summer. But there were few signs that Morales was prepared to leave office before his term expired in January or new elections were held \u2014 until Sunday afternoon,\u00a0when the armed forces got involved. \u201cAfter analysing the conflicted domestic situation, we ask the president to resign his presidential mandate to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability, for the good of our Bolivia,\u201d Army Gen. Williams Kaliman said. The general added that he had ordered \u201coperations in the air and on land to neutralise armed groups acting outside the law.\u201d After the military\u2019s pronouncement, reports emerged that Morales was considering fleeing to Argentina. Within hours of the general\u2019s call for his resignation, the embattled president went on TV and told Bolivians that he had agreed to step down. His vice president also resigned, and Senate President Adriana Salvatierra, who would have finished Morales\u2019 term under the Bolivian constitution, soon followed. Across the region, Morales\u2019 leftist allies joined him in decrying the \u201ccoup\u201d that was underway. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Latin America has an economic elite that does not know how to live with democracy and the social inclusion of the poorest,\u201d da Silva, newly freed from prison in Brazil, tweeted. Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro and Argentina\u2019s newly elected President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez also backed Morales, while Mexico offered asylum if he needed it. Progressive U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) both called Morales\u2019 resignation a coup on Twitter. From his presidential campaign account, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted\u00a0that he was \u201cvery concerned about what appears to be a coup in Bolivia,\u201d and said the United States \u201cmust call for an end to violence and support Bolivia\u2019s democratic institutions.\u201d Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement that supported Morales\u2019 resignation and backed calls for a new election. \u201cIn order to restore credibility to the electoral process, all government officials and officials of any political organizations implicated in the flawed October 20 elections should step aside from the electoral process,\u201d Pompeo said. On Monday, President Donald Trump weighed in, saying,\u00a0\u201cwe are now one step closer to a completely democratic, prosperous, and free Western Hemisphere.\u201d The Bolivian opposition, meanwhile, cheered Morales\u2019 departure and suggested the protests wouldn\u2019t end. \u201cToday we won a battle,\u201d Luis Fernando Camacho, a prominent opposition figure, declared. \u201cOnly when we can be sure that democracy is solid, then will we go back home.\u201d Jubilant rallies filled the streets across Bolivia while Morales supporters staged their own counter-protests. The protesters are united more by their opposition to Morales than by a coherent ideology, and at times, leaders took more extremist turns. Videos that spread across social media appeared to show protesters burning the Indigenous flag that had flown atop the presidential palace. Camacho, the opposition leader, entered the governmental palace and placed a Bible over the Bolivian flag. \u201cThe Pachamama,\u201d he said, referencing the Indigenous earth goddess, \u201cwill never return to the palace. Bolivia belongs to Christ.\u201d On Thursday, Mesa, the presidential candidate, decried efforts to paint Morales\u2019 ouster as a coup and said the military had only recommended his resignation because \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to take lives\u201d by trying to rein in the protests. Mesa wasn\u2019t alone in pushing back on that narrative. \u201cDo not be fooled\u201d by Morales\u2019 claims of a coup, a top Bolivian Indigenous organization that has opposed encroachment onto its lands under Morales told its followers. Other Indigenous groups, as well as major Bolivian labor organizations that had once backed Morales,\u00a0joined in the calls for his resignation. For now, the Bolivian government is expected to name an interim leader, and Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, an anti-Morales lawyer and senator, has said she will seek to become the new head of the Senate, which would put her in line to temporarily assume the presidency under Bolivia\u2019s constitution.\u00a0\u00c1\u00f1ez said this week that she wants new elections, but it\u2019s not clear what will happen next. Morales\u2019 efforts to hold on to power over the last three years had already raised concerns about the health of Bolivia\u2019s democracy. Even if he\u2019d remained in power, his ability to govern would have been in question \u2014 Bolivia had become more polarized, and a slim mandate or the prospect of new elections wouldn\u2019t have given him the broad support he once enjoyed. The military\u2019s role in Morales\u2019 decision to step aside will heighten those concerns not just in Bolivia, but across Latin America, as generals have begun to reassume more powerful roles in societies where armed coups and military dictatorships were once the norm, including in Bolivia. The region steadily redemocratized after the fall of military dictatorships in Brazil, Chile, Bolivia and other nations three decades ago. But democracy seems on the brink across the region now. Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s socialist leader, has maintained his authoritarian grip on power with support from the military amid regime-change efforts from opposition forces and the United States. Concerns about the militarization of security in Brazil were already prevalent before the 2018 election of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, a former Army captain who stocked his Cabinet with military men \u2014 and whose son, in a signal to pockets of supporters who\u2019ve favored a return to military rule, recently endorsed the return of dictatorship-era policies. Chilean President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era turned to the military during mass protests there and invoked a state of emergency in Santiago that raised ugly memories of the Pinochet era. Other leaders across Latin America have increasingly turned to the armed forces for stability in the face of burgeoning crises. Bolivia\u2019s situation differs from those countries in many ways, and some observers have suggested that the Bolivian military has no interest in seizing power. It\u2019s unclear what the next moves from the armed forces or the opposition will be. But protests in Bolivia continued Monday, with Morales supporters marching against the opposition. On social media, reports circulated that the military and police had been deployed into the streets as the protests began. There\u2019s a clear vacuum of power in Bolivia now \u2014 and even those who support Morales\u2019 resignation may worry about whether Bolivian democracy will emerge intact, given that Latin American history offers little hope of democracy surviving a change in power that resulted from any military influence at all. This story has been updated with Bernie Sanders\u2019 tweet and tweets about the military taking the streets.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " It is quite a time to be a billionaire with socially liberal politics who dislikes President Donald Trump. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is no longer considering an independent run for president. The Democratic Party has not one, but two, major presidential candidates whose campaigns are devoted to taking on billionaire power. And former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate who many well-heeled donors thought would sail to the White House, has shown some signs of weakness. As a result, the superrich residents of moderate-minded coastal communities are starting to panic. They are casting about for last-minute solutions, including a late-in-the-game bid by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a trial balloon by Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who\u2019s now a Bain Capital executive. \u201cThere is great fear among the monied parts of the Democratic Party that this populist insurgency is coming and that when it comes \u2026 there is going to be a serious regulation of wealth that this country has not seen since the early to mid-\u201960s,\u201d Gary Gerstle, a professor of U.S. history at the University of Cambridge and author of \u201dLiberty and Coercion: The Paradox of American Government From the Founding to the Present.\u201d \u201cThey see a threat to their prerogatives and their wealth that they have not had to deal with under Democrats or Republicans for 60 years. They have a right to be worried.\u201d But the failed attempts by billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019 company to impose its will on municipal elections in Seattle, a city of under 750,000, show how the ultrarich of the Democratic Party might struggle to shape a rowdy, unpredictable 2020 primary fight. In late July, with the Seattle City Council\u2019s nonpartisan primary elections looming, the city\u2019s embattled left found itself on the defensive. Mayor Jenny Durkan, who has adopted an enforcement-heavy approach to the city\u2019s homelessness problem since her 2017 election, warned residents of Seattle\u2019s diverse, working-class southeastern neighborhoods against electing progressive community organizer Tammy Morales to the City Council. \u201cAnother socialist\u201d like Morales, she said in a mass email, would \u201ccause more division in the city.\u201d Morales, who went on to win the city\u2019s open 2nd District seat on Tuesday, easily pushed back against the charge, denying that she identifies with the socialist label. But for the city\u2019s community of progressive activists, it was a frightening omen that city elections would be dominated by the same homelessness crisis that had provoked a showdown with Amazon and divided them from the institutional left, including elements of organized labor. Then in October, Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, dramatically ramped up the company\u2019s involvement in the race and completely changed the dynamic. The company, which calls Seattle home, contributed an additional $1 million to a $2.4 million effort by the Seattle Chamber of Commerce to defeat candidates who had either previously supported raising taxes on big business to address the homeless problem or had not expressly ruled out the idea going forward. Amazon\u2019s total contribution to the effort would end up being $1.5 million. Two of its biggest targets were Morales and Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, a proud socialist who served as a driving force behind the city\u2019s pioneering $15 minimum wage and an effort to raise city revenue to address homelessness through a big-business-focused \u201chead\u201d tax. (The City Council ended up repealing the tax under intense pressure from Amazon and over Sawant\u2019s objections.) The outside threat united the city\u2019s normal fractious progressive movement, according to Morales. Bezos \u201cwas very helpful at unifying the left in the city. There was a clear rejection of the narrative coming out of the Chamber,\u201d she said. The races gained national attention when the two populist presidential contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), weighed in in support of the progressives. Sanders even used his text message network to encourage 43,000 Seattleites to vote for the left-leaning candidates. The candidates\u2019 involvement \u201ckept the conversation going in a way that was very helpful,\u201d Morales said. Many of the city\u2019s mainstream liberals, who might otherwise be wary of Sawant in particular, felt forced to choose between Amazon and the left. And to Amazon\u2019s chagrin, they chose the left, according to Laura Loe, a housing advocate who spoke to many such voters. \u201cThere are people who would never vote for a socialist, but they said, \u2018There was no way I was going to vote for somebody backed by Amazon money,\u2019\u201d recalled Loe, who is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the end, despite the cash advantage, just two out of the seven\u00a0City Council candidates whom Amazon backed prevailed; one of them, incumbent Debora Juarez, also received support from organized labor PACs. Markham McIntyre, a spokesman for the Seattle Chamber of Commerce PAC that served as a vehicle for Amazon\u2019s money, sounded a conciliatory note when asked about the losses. \u201cThe business community stands ready to work with the new Seattle City Council,\u201d McIntyre said in a statement to Reuters. \u201cHow our local government chooses to partner \u2015 or create division \u2015 matters.\u201d There are shades of the Seattle results in the Democratic presidential primary, in which leading candidates have turned tech executives in general, and Bezos in particular, into the faces of their calls to increase taxes on billionaires and diminish their political influence. Warren\u2019s calls to break up Amazon and other large technology firms is perhaps the best-known example. Shortly after announcing her plan to disassemble the conglomerates, she held a rally in Long Island City, the New York neighborhood where local resistance scuttled a plan to build a major Amazon facility there in exchange for big tax breaks. But she has been far from alone in taking on the titans of the technology industry, to say nothing of the broader billionaire class. Sanders held his massive comeback rally in October in Long Island City as well. And in a new 30-second video advertisement his campaign is now airing in Iowa, Sanders says that, although Trump is the \u201cmost corrupt president\u201d in history, the \u201cgreed and corruption undermining our democracy is bigger than one man.\u201d As he says the latter, images of Bezos, oil billionaire Charles Koch and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, appear on screen. Andrew Yang, a millionaire entrepreneur whose candidacy is premised on the idea that corporations will be automating millions of jobs in the near future, is joining the populist parade. His first television advertisement \u2015 a 1-minute spot he is spending $1 million to air in Iowa \u2015 features an image of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the narrator promises that Yang will create an economy in which \u201cBig Tech and Wall Street are held accountable.\u201d Even South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has attracted scrutiny for the support he has received from the superrich, including many leading tech executives, singles out Amazon for criticism in his stump speech. In a riff on his expansive vision of freedom, Buttigieg draws applause from crowds in Iowa when he says, \u201cI\u2019m not terribly interested in preserving Amazon\u2019s freedom to not pay any income taxes at all.\u201d The responses of some of the country\u2019s leading billionaires \u2015 and, not to be excluded, mega-millionaires \u2015 is, as a first resort, to go on television with furrowed brows and denounce the criticism of their power as attacks on the very foundations of the country. Given her high standing in the polls, Warren has been the principal target of their fulminations. Hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman has delivered the most dramatic performances, tearing up on CNBC as he fretted about what Warren\u2019s 2% wealth tax might do to the country. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has expressed similar alarm at Warren\u2019s wealth tax, professing he would be willing to pay double his net worth in taxes but not $100 billion. (In fact, a New York Times analysis found that Gates, who is presently worth $97 billion, would still be worth $13.9 billion if Warren\u2019s wealth tax had been in place since 1982.) And in a Sunday interview on CBS, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose $31 million salary he erroneously claimed he has no say over, asked Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other progressives not to \u201cvilify people who worked hard.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that the effect of these statements does anything more than strengthen Warren. A majority of Americans think that the government both does too much for wealthy people and should do more to curb income and wealth inequality in the country, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by HuffPost in March. Among Democrats, those figures exceed 80%. One in five Americans and 37% of Democrats think that the existence of billionaires is a \u201cpolicy failure,\u201d the same poll found. \u201cTheir lack of self-awareness is amazing,\u201d a veteran Democratic campaign strategist, who asked for anonymity for professional reasons, said of the various wealthy businessmen\u2019s anti-Warren remarks. \u201cDo they think that a billionaire going on TV and complaining about how Warren\u2019s plans are un-American is going to help their cause? On the contrary, it\u2019s like a massive in-kind donation to Warren\u2019s campaign every time they do it \u2015 certainly in the primary election but with the general electorate, too.\u201d Will Ritter, a Richmond, Virginia-based Republican ad maker, questioned whether veering too far to the populist left would make it harder for Democrats to appeal to the general electorate. \u201cWhen the Democrats resort to demagoguery and false promises, they run the risk of not being taken seriously by an educated, moderate voter,\u201d Ritter said. The trouble for the nation\u2019s socially liberal superrich people is that they are evidently unconvinced that Biden, or any other of the candidates they consider acceptable, has enough of a shot at winning the Democratic nomination and beating Trump. As a result, some billionaires have not been content to throw potshots from the sidelines. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and media mogul who is worth over $52 billion, announced last week that he is considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bezos, the richest man on the planet, reportedly encouraged him to do so. If he entered the race, Bloomberg would have virtually limitless resources to finance his bid, even if he plans to skip the first four primary and caucus states. But the track record of other self-funders currently in the race does not portend well for his chances. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, a mega-millionaire financial entrepreneur with business-friendly policies similar to Bloomberg\u2019s, failed to qualify for the third debate despite spending nearly $27 million and announcing his candidacy earlier than anyone else. Likewise, billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, who is running as an anti-establishment progressive and has poured upwards of $47 million into his race, remains mired in single digits in the polls. \u201cI find it laughable,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a Pittsburgh-based Democratic campaign consultant. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a super-liberal Democrat that supports Bernie or a moderate Democrat that supports Biden, I don\u2019t think anyone thinks the problem is we don\u2019t have enough rich people in government.\u201d But for some billionaires, the stakes of the Democratic presidential primary are about more than just who gets the chance to take on Trump. It\u2019s about whether the Democratic Party, an institution that suits many of the wealthy\u2019s preferences on so-called social issues related to race and gender, is still a place where they can feel at home \u2015 and exercise influence. Particularly since Bill Clinton\u2019s victory in 1992, the Democratic Party has functioned as a home for the multiracial working class alongside a portion of the moderate-minded, wealthy elite. The party\u2019s accommodation of not just affluent professionals but also self-styled liberal billionaires was driven partly out of self-interest: National elections require ever-larger sums of money to compete. The 2008 financial crisis and accompanying growth in the income and wealth gaps punctured a hole in that d\u00e9tente, according to Gerstle of the University of Cambridge. \u201cThese two wings have existed pretty comfortably, and that comfort is being exposed as extremely uncomfortable, and so it\u2019s going to make the primary season for Democrats, particularly if Bloomberg jumps in the race, really interesting to watch,\u201d Gerstle said. Gerstle likened the rage fueling the current left-populist wave to the disgust with concentrated wealth that last gripped U.S. society during the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th century. The resentment that emerged from those movements fueled the reforms of the Progressive Era and, later on, the New Deal. One difference, he noted, is that the superrich of the present era prefer to display their wealth less ostentatiously, a phenomenon most evident in the casual dress code of tech entrepreneurs and investors concentrated on the West Coast. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s not going to mask their wealth and power, but it did for some time,\u201d Gerstle said. Even if their motives are understandable, though, to some observers, billionaires\u2019 apparently indefatigable instinct to pile on against populist Democrats against all evidence of its ineffectiveness is a mystery. For Joe Sanberg, though, a successful investor and progressive activist leaning toward either Sanders or Warren, it is not a surprise. He believes many of his successful peers in the investment world are out of touch not just with workers but also with small-business owners and entrepreneurs outside of the most rarefied enclaves. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of perspective,\u201d said Sanberg, an early investor in Blue Apron and co-founder of the socially responsible online banking firm Aspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring someone out of a narrow perspective just by telling them. You have to get them out of their echo chamber.\u201d Kevin Robillard contributed reporting.",

      "author": "Christopher Mathias",
      "content": " Over 80 members of the House of Representatives have now called on White House senior adviser Stephen Miller to resign after leaked emails published this week showed his affinity for white nationalism. HuffPost contacted the office of every House member and asked whether Miller should resign. All told, over 80 representatives, all Democrats, have said he should. \u201cHell yes,\u201d responded Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). \u201cI feel pretty secure in my belief that flaming white nationalists should have no place in the White House, the halls of Congress or anywhere, for that matter,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). \u201cA person with his hateful beliefs should not be making decisions at the highest levels of our government,\u201d said Mark Takano (D-Calif.). \u201cHe should resign, and if he doesn\u2019t, he should be fired.\u201d The widespread calls for Miller\u2019s resignation echoed demands\u00a0Thursday by leaders of the Black Congressional Progressive Caucus, Black Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus. \u201cAs documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Stephen Miller has embedded himself in white nationalist doctrine for years, including promoting racist propaganda from fringe sites like VDARE and InfoWars,\u201d the Democratic caucus leaders said in a joint statement calling for Miller\u2019s resignation. \u201cAnd as the chief architect of the Muslim Ban and cruel family separation policies, Stephen Miller has spent the last three years turning his bigotry into policy \u2013 with President Trump\u2019s blessing.\u201d On Tuesday, the civil rights advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0published the first of a series of bombshell reports analyzing 900 emails Miller sent to former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh in 2015 and 2016. They show Miller, working at the time for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), attempting to shape Breitbart\u2019s political coverage, namely regarding stories related to race and immigration. In some emails, Miller informed Breitbart of stories published by white supremacist website\u00a0VDARE and racist conspiracy theory website\u00a0InfoWars \u2014 and then suggested how Breitbart might promote them. In another email, Miller recommended that Breitbart write about the deeply racist 1970s French novel \u201cCamp of Saints,\u201d which depicts brown immigrants \u2014 including Indians who \u201ceat feces\u201d \u2014 descending upon Europe like a plague, killing people and raping women. The novel is a favorite among neo-Nazis and other assorted fascists. In all 900 emails, SPLC reporter Michael Hayden noted he was \u201cunable to find any examples of Miller writing sympathetically or even in neutral tones about any person who is nonwhite or foreign-born.\u201d Miller went on to work for President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign before being selected as a senior adviser in the White House, where he\u2019s often credited with crafting the administration\u2019s cruel immigration policies. \u201cStephen Miller, Trump\u2019s architect of mass human rights abuses at the border (including child separation & detention camps w/ child fatalities) has been exposed as a bonafide white nationalist,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s still at the White House shaping US immigration policy. Miller must resign. Now.\u201d \u201cEach day we allow a white nationalist to be in charge of US immigration policy is a day where thousands of children & families lives are in danger,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote in another tweet. \u201cThis year alone, under Miller\u2019s direction, the US has put almost 70,000 children in custody.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted: \u201cAs I said earlier this year: Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. And now we have the emails to prove it. This type of racism and hatred has no place in our government. Miller needs to step down. Now.\u201d The White House did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the calls for Miller to resign or whether the president might fire Miller. \u201cUnfortunately, we know that President Trump, who said that there were \u2018very fine people on both sides\u2019 when white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, welcomes his racist views to help sow hate and division in America,\u201d Takano told HuffPost. In a statement to Axios, White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham called the Southern Poverty Law Center \u201can utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization.\u201d \u201cThey libel, slander, and defame conservatives for a living,\u201d said Grisham, providing no evidence that the SPLC\u2019s story about Miller is false. Another White House official anonymously attempted to accuse the SPLC of anti-Semitism. \u201cThis is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against Jewish staffer,\u201d the unnamed official told Axios. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who thinks Miller should resign, noted in a statement to HuffPost that the White House adviser \u201cis damn lucky that there wasn\u2019t someone like him in charge at Ellis Island when his great-grandfather sought refuge in this country after fleeing Eastern Europe to escape persecution by the Nazis.\u201d \u201cHaving someone like him in a powerful position at the White House sends a very bad message to Americans and the world,\u201d Wilson said. Here\u2019s the list of congresspeople who have called for Miller\u2019s resignation so far: Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) Rep. Ra\u00fal Manuel Grijalva (D-Ariz.) Rep.

      "subtitle": "*Almost* the least they could do.",
      "author": "Matt Fuller",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans and Democrats stepped aside from the heated debate over impeachment Tuesday to do their most basic duty: Continue funding the government. The House voted 231-192 on a bill that would extend current funding levels until Dec. 20, with 181 Republicans and 10 Democrats voting no, and 12 Republicans and 219 Democrats voting yes. (Independent Justin Amash of Michigan also voted no.) With appropriators still stuck on a number of issues \u2015 most significantly: President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall \u2015 Democrats and a handful of Republicans gave more time to the members negotiating a long-term deal. (Current government funding runs out on Nov. 21.) Lawmakers struck an odd tone Tuesday. They bemoaned that this continuing resolution was confirmation that \u201cCongress is not getting its work done,\u201d in the words of Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), because this temporary extension represented failure on a larger deal.\u00a0Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said passing this bill was a \u201crecognition of failure.\u201d But many lawmakers also celebrated the bipartisan bill and its extraneous riders. \u201cThis legislation avoids controversial policies and instead contains provisions that reflect shared priorities,\u201d Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said. Contrary to the usual calls for a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution, this bill was loaded with new provisions and extensions. The most controversial extension was one for expiring portions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill would reauthorize three provisions in FISA until March, effectively decoupling government funding from the FISA debate. Of particular note are the broad authorities to wiretap terrorism suspects. The so-called \u201cSection 206\u201d provisions allow the government to conduct \u201croving\u201d wiretaps so that they can thwart suspects who are, for example, switching cell phones. The bill would also reauthorize the ability of the FBI to examine the business records of terrorism suspects, as well as a \u201clone wolf\u201d provision that gives the FBI greater authority to go after terrorist suspects who are not connected to any country or group. \u201cYesterday, Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi said the president has \u2018abused his power for his own personal, political benefit,\u2019\u201d Amash tweeted Tuesday. \u201cToday, she wants to extend the president\u2019s power to do warrantless surveillance of Americans.\u201d Concerns over reauthorizing those FISA sections was enough for Amash to vote no, as well as some progressives. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) saw the inclusion of those provisions, she summoned the words of former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge Randy Jackson: Aside from the FISA provisions, the bill also includes a number of other reauthorizations and changes. It would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. It would give the Census Bureau money \u2015 at an annualized rate of $7.3 billion\u00a0 \u2015 to prepare for the 2020 Census. It would extend a number of health care programs, including funding for community health centers, which many Republicans oppose over concerns of family planning. It would also block the government from taking back $7.6 billion from states in highway funding, which Republicans also oppose. As a carrot for Republicans and Democrats, the bill lays the groundwork for a 3.1% pay raise for the military next year. It would also allow people who have received money from a Sept. 11 compensation fund to also apply for money from a state-sponsored compensation fund for terrorism victims. And, as is customary in Congress, it would include a year\u2019s salary \u2015 $174,000 \u2015 for former Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019s widow, Maya Cummings, who is running to replace the longtime Baltimore lawmaker who died in October. Still, the overwhelming majority of Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, even though failure to pass the short-term bill would result in a shutdown. The ranking Republicans on the Appropriations Committee, Kay Granger of Texas, said Congress had a responsibility to get a long-term deal done, which was why she was voting no. But Democrats said their responsibility was to keep the government funded. Rules Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) mentioned a number of extensions he liked, while also noting the inclusion of some he didn\u2019t like, such as the FISA provisions. But, he said, shutdowns cost the government and the American people billions of dollars. \u201cThe choice before us today is whether we are going to vote to cause a repeat of that devastation, or not,\u201d McGovern said. The one-month funding extension became necessary to avert a government shutdown because Senate appropriators have still not reached agreement over a full omnibus bill. The biggest hurdle remains Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. Democrats want to give Trump as little as possible for the wall, while Republicans and the president himself want billions to build a wall as quickly as possible. Republicans and Democrats agreed to overall spending numbers in July \u2015 $738 billion for defense and $632 billion for non-defense programs \u2015 but they\u2019ve been deadlocked on how to divvy up those numbers among the various programs. With another month, lawmakers hope they can work out a deal to avoid a shutdown that would, perhaps more importantly to the lawmakers, keep them in D.C. over the holidays.",

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) plans to propose a bill Thursday that would invest $1.2 trillion over the next decade in 12 million new, affordable rental units. The legislation, a draft of which HuffPost obtained, is arguably the most ambitious Green New Deal policy unveiled since the movement for a sweeping industrial plan to shrink climate-changing emissions and expand protections for the poor went mainstream a year ago. It\u2019s the marquee proposal in a wave of anticipated bills from a half dozen House Democrats seeking to make high-quality, affordable housing a central plank of the alternative political vision they hope to pitch ahead of the 2020 election. More U.S. households rent than at any point since 1965, according to Pew Research Center data that found a sharp increase following the foreclosure crisis that started a decade ago. Over 11 million Americans spend more than half their paychecks on rent, per research from the affordability advocacy group Home1 that Curbed cited. A National Low Income Housing Coalition survey last year concluded that a renter working 40 hours a week and earning the federal minimum wage could afford a two-bedroom apartment in exactly zero counties nationwide. It\u2019s not just an urban crisis. Homelessness has increased in rural states such as South Dakota, according to figures from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \u201cPeople make it sound like the people in the Midwest don\u2019t have the same problems as people in New York and California, and this is one issue that unites us all,\u201d Omar told HuffPost by phone Wednesday morning. \u201cWe are truly struggling.\u201d The bill comes a week after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released the so-called Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, a joint bill to spend, by one estimate, $172 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade the nation\u2019s 1.2 million federally-owned rental units with clean power, efficient appliances and plumbing that won\u2019t leach lead into water. Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) are expected to introduce more proposals in the months to come. Omar\u2019s bill, dubbed the Homes For All Act, goes further. Over a decadelong timeline, it outlines plans to build 9.5 million new units of public housing at the cost of about $800 billion. The legislation earmarks $200 billion for a federal Housing Trust Fund to build 2.5 million new affordable housing units available for low-income families. Another $200 billion would establish a Community Control and Anti-Displacement Fund at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide grants to local governments to combat the effects of gentrification. The combined $1 trillion, for context, equals out to about what the 2009 stimulus bill to keep the U.S. economy from sliding into a depression spent when adjusted for inflation. But the four-comma spending figure puts legislative meat on the bones of multi-trillion-dollar climate platforms Democratic presidential candidates ranging from progressives such as Sanders and Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\u00a0to centrists Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg have proposed. Real estate accounts for about 12% of planet-heating emissions in the United States, federal data shows, but the actual figure could be as high as 39%, according to the U.S. Green Building Council,\u00a0a nonprofit that promotes sustainable construction. Building new public housing \u201cdesigned built and operated to the highest possible environmental standards\u201d could seriously make a dent in those emissions, Omar said. It could also send market signals that compel private industry to follow suit. New York\u2019s public housing agency\u2019s request in the 1990s for energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, spurred a major shift toward energy saving in the appliance market,\u00a0according to a study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. As millions of Americans and refugees from overseas are displaced by extreme weather, sea-level rise and conflict over increasingly scarce freshwater, Omar said, clean, desirable public housing is key to resettling them. \u201cWhen I came to the United States, [homelessness] was the first thing \u2026 that was jarring to me and that I never really expected,\u201d said Omar, herself a Somali refugee who first arrived to New York from Kenya in 1995 and then eventually settled in Minneapolis. \u201cTo arrive and see people sleeping on the side of the street is something that has stayed with me.\u201d It would be shocking if the Homes For All Act became law in the next year. President Donald Trump, a Republican real estate developer with a history of housing discrimination, rejects the reality that emissions from buildings and vehicles are destabilizing the global climate. He would almost certainly veto the bill even if it passed the GOP-controlled Senate. The legislation is also likely to face strong opposition from centrist Democrats who, in some cases, voted for President Bill Clinton\u2019s welfare reform in the 1990s, when the party embraced fiscal conservatism to court a base of white, suburban voters. The effort put new restrictions on public services for the poor and all but ended investments in the federal housing projects that boomed half a century earlier under President Franklin Roosevelt, a fellow Democrat. That included passing the Faircloth Amendment, which barred the federal government from building new public housing after 1999 and severely limited the renovations the Department of Housing and Urban Development can fund. Since then, federal authorities have demolished about 250,000 units and left much of the existing public housing stock in squalor. The bill would repeal the Faircloth Amendment and require Congress to fully fund public housing operations in the federal budget the same way it does Medicare and Social Security. That could, if enacted, reverse a decline in public housing and federal housing vouchers from 45 units per 1,000 American households in 1993 to 35 units per 1,000 American households today, said Yonah Freemark, a housing policy expert and doctoral student in city planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThat decline is indicative of a failure of the federal government to keep up with population growth and a failure to maintain what\u2019s there,\u201d he said. He dismissed critics who say public housing agencies are hotbeds of corruption. \u201cSure, there are examples of poor performance in public agencies, but there are also examples of slumlords.\u201d The bill has no co-sponsors yet. But it\u2019s likely to gain support from progressive allies who back the Green New Deal movement to restore the last century\u2019s federal safety net and update it to address the climate crisis. Omar said she plans to appeal to her more moderate colleagues to \u201crewrite their legacies\u201d and correct for the injustices that came from Democrats\u2019 rightward shift nearly three decades ago. She compared the dynamic to criminal justice reform, invoking the Democrats and Republicans who supported draconian laws in the 1990s that punished millions of mostly minority men for nonviolent offenses and who are now considering ways to reverse the trend. \u201cThis is their opportunity to make amends,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t have the foresight of the harm some of the policies we propose could have. They are now presented with some of those harms that they\u2019ve caused and they get to fix it.\u201d That\u2019s a political message that could buoy Democrats in critical swing states Trump won in 2016. Michigan, for example, is slated to face a shortfall of more than 150,000 affordable units by 2045, the state housing agency forecast in April.\u00a0That forecast comes two years after the Home Builders Association of Michigan issued a \u201cwake-up call\u201d over the looming housing crisis. \u201cEven in rural communities, this is a serious challenge,\u201d said Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive who came in second in last year\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary in Michigan. \u201cPeople are realizing the gig they\u2019re working in an economy where there\u2019s an underemployment epidemic don\u2019t allow them to put a roof over their heads.\u201d Homes for All Act by Alexander Kaufman on Scribd",

      "author": "Christopher Mathias",
      "content": " Multiple Jewish groups have called on White House senior adviser Stephen Miller to resign after leaked emails published last week showed the extent of his white nationalist worldview. Jews Against White Nationalism, an initiative involving eight Jewish organizations, released a statement Tuesday calling Miller a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d and the \u201carchitect of the Trump administration\u2019s cruel and endless attacks on immigrants.\u201d \u201cAnd with irrefutable proof of his deep-seated racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand with evidence that he has promoted websites spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories, he cannot be allowed to remain a federal employee.\u201d The eight organizations \u2014 Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, The Jewish Vote, T\u2019ruah, Never Again Action, J Street, IfNotNow, Jews for Racial & Economic Justice, and the Jewish Vote \u2014 launched an online petition addressed to Miller. \u201cAs your fellow American Jews,\u201d the petition states, \u201cwe will not rest until you resign.\u201d The petition adds to mounting pressure from the Jewish community to get Miller to leave the White House, and offers a sharp rebuke to the White House\u2019s twisted attempt to smear Miller\u2019s critics as anti-Semites. Over the last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center has published a series of bombshell stories analyzing 900 emails it obtained showing Miller messaging editors of the far-right website Breitbart in 2015 and 2016, when he was working as an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). The emails show Miller actively shaping Breitbart\u2019s coverage of race and immigration by suggesting that editors there aggregate stories from white supremacist websites; writing about the book \u201cCamp of Saints,\u201d a racist French novel favored by fascists and neo-Nazis that depicts feces-eating brown people invading Europe; and promoting immigration policies once praised by Adolf Hitler. In response, the White House, while never providing evidence that the emails weren\u2019t authentic, lashed out at the SPLC, calling it an \u201cutterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization.\u201d An unnamed White House official also told Axios\u00a0that it was \u201cclearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against Jewish staffer.\u201d And after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) launched a petition calling for Miller\u2019s resignation, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Yahoo News\u00a0that \u201cthose defaming\u201d Miller \u201care trying to deny his Jewish identity which is a pernicious form of anti-Semitism and this outrageous smear dishonors the memories of Jewish victims of anti-Semitic persecution across the globe.\u201d Sophie Ellman-Golan, a leader of the Jews Against White Nationalism campaign, called the Trump administration\u2019s allegations of anti-Semitism \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe White House is so clearly trying to use scurrilous accusations to silence very real criticism,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cOne of the things that disturbs me the most is witnessing the White House trying to render the word anti-Semitism meaningless while actually making the rise of this thing much worse,\u201d Ellman-Golan said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve seen the rise of anti-Semitism accompany this president\u2019s administration, and really so much of that has been incited by Trump and members of the Republican Party, so much of the harm against Jews. And yet this is the party that\u2019s eagerly throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism, and using Jews to hit at their political opponents.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by Washington Post columnist Paul Waldman, who is Jewish, in a recent article. \u201cI\u2019m sure that at some point, someone made a more repugnant attempt to use an accusation of anti-Semitism to shield someone from accountability for their own bigotry,\u201d Waldman wrote. \u201cI just can\u2019t recall any.\u201d Earlier this week, the Jewish Democratic Council of America called Miller a \u201cracist, a bigot, and a shanda \u2015 a shame and an embarrassment to the Jewish community and America.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League and the National Council of Jewish Women were also among dozens of civil rights organizations to send a letter to President Donald Trump imploring him to fire Miller. \u201cIn his role as your senior advisor, Stephen Miller has promoted hate speech spewed from neo-Nazis, bigots, and white supremacists,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHis advancement of white nationalist ideology has resulted in policies \u2015 and violent acts \u2015 that actively harm immigrants, people of color, and marginalized communities.\u201d Reached for comment on Jewish groups\u2019 calls for Miller to resign, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said only that \u201cMiller is dedicated to this country and I am proud to work alongside him every single day with the goal of making our nation even greater. He is a friend and colleague, and we are lucky to have him in the White House.\u201d On Thursday morning, over 100 Democratic members of the House of Representatives published an open letter demanding that the president fire Miller. \u201cMiller\u2019s emails and the sentiments expressed in them are incompatible with public service and render him unfit to shape any policy \u2015 immigration or otherwise,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe refuse to tolerate white nationalism and xenophobia in the White House or elsewhere in the United States. Mr. Miller must be fired immediately.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) secured the endorsements of three additional New York lawmakers ahead of his comeback rally in Queens on Saturday: state Sens. Michael Gianaris and Jessica Ramos of Queens, and state Sen. Luis Sep\u00falveda of the Bronx. \u201cBernie is the best candidate to fight back against the deep-pocketed corporate interests that weaken our democracy and exploit our economy,\u201d Ramos, who unseated a Queens Democrat aligned with state Republicans in September 2018, said in a statement announcing her endorsement. \u201cIn Senator Sanders we have a leader who will protect all members of our society, especially those seeking human rights and better working conditions free from unethical practices.\u201d Gianaris, who as deputy state Senate majority leader is one of the most powerful Democrats in New York, echoed Ramos\u2019 sentiments. \u201cBernie Sanders is the best choice to reduce this growing chasm between the ultra-rich and working people,\u201d he said in a statement. The trio joins a group of five New York lawmakers who had already endorsed Sanders\u2019 bid: New York City Councilman Rafael Espinal, state Assemblymen Ron Kim and Phil Steck, and state Sens. Julia Salazar and James Sanders. (James Sanders is not related to the Vermont senator.) Although New Yorkers cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary in April, well after the crucial early states, some presidential contenders have already sought endorsements from the state\u2019s robust bench of young, progressive lawmakers. Sanders still has fewer endorsements from New York state and New York City elected officials than Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who announced that she had secured the backing of\u00a014 lawmakers at a mid-September rally in Manhattan. Sanders, 78, is hoping to regain momentum after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 that polling indicates raised doubts in the minds of many Democrats about his fitness to serve in the White House. Sanders, seeking to reassure the public of his health and vitality, delivered a strong debate performance on Tuesday and hours later announced he\u2019d secured endorsements from\u00a0Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two of the Democratic Party\u2019s young, progressive stars. Saturday\u2019s rally in Queensbridge Park, chosen in part for its proximity to the country\u2019s largest public housing development, is Sanders\u2019 first major campaign event since his hospitalization. He will be joined onstage at the rally by Ocasio-Cortez, who is expected to formally announce her endorsement there. Sanders courted Ocasio-Cortez in conversations over the course of a month, culminating in a visit she paid to Burlington, Vermont, at the end of September. She met with Sanders and his wife, as well as a group of aides, over two meals, where they developed a rapport, according to someone familiar with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s thinking. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Sanders is not altogether surprising. Ocasio-Cortez got her start in politics volunteering for Sanders\u2019 2016 bid; the pair are both self-described democratic socialists and have collaborated on, among other things, legislation limiting interest rates on credit card debt. But prior to announcing her endorsement of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez had spoken positively about Warren, too. And Warren had apparently made efforts to develop a relationship with her. Ocasio-Cortez was drawn to Sanders\u2019 vision of a rejuvenated democracy where ordinary Americans take a more active role in the political process, according to the person with knowledge of her thinking. \u201cThey\u2019re ideologically aligned, but they\u2019re mission-aligned as well,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey get along really well. They brighten each other up.\u201d Saturday\u2019s rally will give Ocasio-Cortez an opportunity to show if her star power is a major draw for aspiring national leaders. \u201cIf he gets enough of the young, left-wing demo out, the age issue disappears, the health issue is softened and Bernie gets new life. It makes him young again,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York City Democratic strategist. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get a big crowd, then those two issues remain in place.\u201d Michael Ceraso, a Democratic campaign consultant who worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, expressed doubt that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blessing would help him broaden his appeal \u201cin the areas where he has deficits,\u201d such as older voters. But it is likely to help him maximize turnout among the young voters Sanders is relying on to carve a path to the Democratic nomination, according to Ceraso. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cresonates with those young voters who are looking for a reason to vote,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " When moderate House Democrats lined up behind an impeachment inquiry, it looked as if those among them facing primary challenges from the left would be depriving their competitors of a powerful talking point. But the emergence of Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a figure of interest in the impeachment hearings has complicated that calculation in one of the country\u2019s most contentious Democratic primary races. Rep. Henry Cuellar, an eight-term incumbent whose 28th Congressional District covers parts of South Texas, is a longtime friend of Perry\u2019s \u2015 shortly after the latter began his lengthy tenure as Texas\u2019 governor, Cuellar served as his secretary of state, an appointed position. Now, the 64-year-old Cuellar faces a 2020 primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, 26, an immigration and human rights attorney who has sought to make an issue out of Cuellar\u2019s ties to Republicans \u2015 including Perry. She has taken to calling Cuellar, who has broken with Democratic Party orthodoxy on gun regulations, immigration enforcement and abortion rights, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s favorite Democrat.\u201d And on\u00a0Thursday, Cisneros demanded that Perry testify before the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry. She didn\u2019t name Cuellar, but the implication was clear. \u201cWe continue to hear credible testimony from witnesses appearing in the impeachment inquiry that Energy Secretary Rick Perry was both \u2018in the loop\u2019 and may have played a role in Donald Trump\u2019s corrupt attempted bribery of Ukraine for his personal political benefit \u2014 and yet Secretary Perry has refused to do his duty and honor the Congressional subpoena to testify about what he knows,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhen I serve in Congress, honoring our Democracy and upholding the Constitution will be among my highest obligations, but I know those outcomes rely on public servants like Secretary Perry to be willing to put country ahead of political party.\u201d Perry has refused to testify in closed-door impeachment hearings. Pressure on him to testify is likely to grow stronger following this week\u2019s explosive round of public testimony. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that Perry was part of an instrumental group of Trump administration officials tasked with creating a backchannel to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the purpose of pursuing political investigations to benefit Trump. (Perry has denied Sondland\u2019s version of events, through a spokesperson.) Asked whether he would echo Cisneros\u2019 call for Perry to testify, Cuellar appeared to endorse the idea without mentioning Perry by name. \u201cMy position is unchanged: anyone with information should appear before the committee and answer questions under oath,\u201d Cuellar told HuffPost in a statement. Cisneros said she does not believe that Cuellar\u2019s statement amounts to a request that Perry testify. \u201cSecretary Perry has refused to do his duty and honor the congressional subpoena to testify and produce any relevant documents,\u201d she said on Friday. \u201cAs a longtime friend of Perry, I urge Congressman Cuellar to join me in calling on Secretary Perry to testify about what he knows.\u201d Cuellar, who is an attorney, served under Perry only briefly as Texas\u2019 secretary of state, leaving office in October 2001 after just six months in the post. Cuellar went on to run for Congress in 2002, winning on his second go-round in 2004. During his time in Congress, Cuellar has maintained warm relations with Perry. He was the only House Democrat to vote against a 2012 resolution condemning the name of Perry\u2019s family ranch, which includes a racial slur for African Americans. That same year, he broke with his Democratic colleagues in the state when he declined to oppose the then-governor\u2019s partisan redistricting plan. And according to Andrew Kreighbaum, who was a local reporter at the time, Cuellar even spoke about the possibility of feeling conflicted if Perry were the GOP nominee against then-President Barack Obama in 2012. When Trump nominated Perry to his Cabinet, Cuellar spoke up on his behalf and urged his colleagues in the Senate to vote yes on his confirmation. Cisneros was raised in the 28th district and moved back to it from New York to run for Congress. Backed by the left-wing group Justice Democrats\u00a0as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0and Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0of Massachusetts, Cisneros\u2019 campaign is based on the premise that a solidly Democratic district deserves a more progressive representative in Washington. She is running on a progressive platform of fighting for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a Green New Deal and a more humane immigration policy. But she has also raised eyebrows by picking up the backing of more mainstream Democratic validators, including some local labor unions and the deep-pocketed, pro-abortion rights group EMILY\u2019s List. Cuellar maintains that his bipartisan approach is in keeping with the heavily Latino, low-income district\u2019s preferences. He has the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). This story has been updated with additional comments by Cisneros.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 A group of progressive lawmakers that includes Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed the Trump administration\u2019s support for the right-wing leaders who have taken power in Bolivia following the ouster of socialist President Evo Morales, saying Friday that the White House\u2019s \u201cdangerously misguided\u201d backing risks creating \u201ca full-blown humanitarian emergency\u201d in the South American nation. \u201cWe are troubled by statements from Administration officials, including President Trump, that welcome these developments in Bolivia that bear the hallmarks of a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d\u00a0the group of lawmakers said in a letter drafted by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a progressive who has been outspoken on human rights issues in Latin America throughout his career in Congress. The letter was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday. Morales, who was first elected in 2005, resigned on Nov. 10\u00a0amid pressure from Bolivia\u2019s armed forces as protests erupted across Bolivia after a disputed October election, in which his opponents accused him of fraud. The Organization of American States, a regional body of governments from across the Americas, said in a preliminary audit that it had found \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in the election. Morales (who says he is the victim of a coup and has fled to Mexico), his supporters, and some independent groups have questioned the evidence behind the OAS findings. Morales\u2019 decision to seek a fourth term \u2014 even after he initially lost a 2016 referendum asking Bolivians to alter constitutional term limits to allow him to do so \u2014 and the fraud allegations sparked the protests that led to his resignation. But his departure came two months before his current term would have ended in January. And his ouster paved the way for the rise of right-wing figures \u2015 including Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, a conservative senator who declared herself interim president\u00a0\u2015 to power. President Donald Trump welcomed Morales\u2019 ouster as a \u201ca significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d and his administration immediately recognized \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s legitimacy as interim leader. But since taking power, \u00c1\u00f1ez and her allies have threatened lawmakers from Morales\u2019 Movement for Socialism party and journalists with prosecution while also unleashing the military, which they exempted from prosecution, to crack down on pro-Morales demonstrations. Protesters have accused the military of killing at least eight people during a demonstration last week. \u201cWe urge you to consider an immediate change in course and to take action to support democracy and human rights in Bolivia,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\u00a0\u201cWhile there is legitimate debate surrounding Morales\u2019 decision to run for a fourth term, it is simply not acceptable for the U.S. administration to welcome the forced removal of a democratically-elected leader before the end of their mandate.\u201d \u201cOur government should call for the prompt restoration of constitutional order, and for an immediate end to all persecution and attacks targeting leaders and supporters of Evo Morales and his political party,\u201d they said. \u201cAdditionally, we call for the adoption of protective measures for those facing threats.\u201d Warning that \u201cBolivia\u2019s escalating crisis threatens to spiral into violent internal conflict,\u201d the progressives argued that the administration\u2019s backing of the current Bolivian leadership \u201ccould well contribute to a further breakdown in the rule of law in Bolivia and a full-blown humanitarian emergency, with large migrant outflows.\u201d \u201cWe strongly urge you to revise this approach and support the prompt restoration of constitutional order, dialogue between opposing political factions, fair and inclusive elections and respect for the human and cultural rights of all Bolivians,\u201d they wrote. Although it was addressed to the Trump administration, the letter also marked the latest effort from progressive lawmakers to set themselves apart from Democratic leadership on foreign policy and human rights issues, particularly in the Americas. In March, progressives came out against the Trump administration\u2019s decision to back Venezuelan opposition to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has become increasingly autocratic and authoritarian as an economic crisis has crippled his country. Millions of people have fled Venezuela, and Trump has aggressively supported efforts to remove Maduro from office by imposing economic sanctions and making thinly veiled threats of military force. Progressive lawmakers argued in March that Trump\u2019s sanctions and threats of \u201cAmerican military-led regime change\u201d would only \u201churt ordinary people\u201d and exacerbate Venezuela\u2019s crises. Progressive Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said at the time that the coordinated effort to challenge the White House even as top Democrats backed Trump\u2019s strategy\u00a0was a deliberate move to reshape foreign policy conversations within the party. Khanna was not among the 14 lawmakers who signed the Friday letter about Bolivia. The signatories were Reps. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Susan Wild (D-Pa.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Debra Haaland (D-N.M.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.), Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Alan Lowenthal (D-N.Y.). Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), Washington D.C.\u2019s representative to Congress, also signed the letter. Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have both previously called Morales\u2019 ouster a coup. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are the\u00a0only Democratic presidential candidates to have done so. Pompeo, in a new statement Thursday, reiterated the United States\u2019 support for \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s transitional government and renewed condemnations of Morales and other party officials who Pompeo said were responsible for \u201cegregious irregularities and manipulation of the vote\u201d in October\u2019s elections. But he also said the United States opposed crackdowns on the press and protesters. \u201cWe support robust press freedoms and peaceful assembly and protest. Violence, repression, and political intimidation have no place in a democracy,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe call on all parties to refrain from such violence, to observe the rule of law, and to respect the rights of all citizens to participate in building Bolivia\u2019s future, whatever their views. Security services must respect the rights of peaceful protestors, and the Bolivian authorities must ensure accountability for any violations of the right of citizens.\u201d",

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) shot back on Twitter, saying that the \u201cpublic whatever is called public sentiment.\u201d She added: \u201cWielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s harsh comments followed a quote from a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez in a Washington Post op-ed\u00a0 Friday that the \u201cgreatest threat to mankind\u00a0is the cowardice of the Democratic Party.\u201d Along with Ocasio-Cortez, frequent Pelosi critics among progressive Democrats elected in 2018 include Reps. Ilhan Omar\u00a0of Minnesota,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0of Massachusetts \u2015 known collectively as the \u201csquad.\u201d Pelosi dismissed the women\u2019s political clout in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd published Saturday, as she defended herself against criticism (including in the HuffPost story \u201cWhat The Hell Is Nancy Pelosi Doing?\u201d) that she too often caves to the Republicans on legislative matters. She has come under particular attack from House liberals for her push to pass the Senate Republican bill \u2015 instead of the House version \u2015 that\u00a0increased funding to deal with conditions at the U.S border with Mexico but lacked humanitarian guarantees for detained immigrants, particularly children. Pelosi insisted that the bill \u2014 which the squad of four voted against, along with dozens of other Democrats \u2014 was the strongest she could get. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said, referring to the four Democratic women. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d She blamed the shortcomings of the border bill on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whom she described as \u201cauthentically terrible.\u201d \u201cWith all due respect, the press likes to make a story that is more about Democrats divided than the fact that Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t care about the children,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIf the left doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m left enough, so be it,\u201d Pelosi concluded defiantly. \u201cAs I say to these people, come to my basement. I have these signs about single-payer (health care) from 30 years ago. I understand what they\u2019re saying. But we have a responsibility to get something done, which is different from advocacy. We have to have a solution, not just a Twitter fight.\u201d Check out Dowd\u2019s article here.",

      "content": " It\u2019s not often that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) receives praise from inside the White House of President Donald Trump.\u00a0But it happened on Thursday. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said the freshman lawmaker had \u201cnailed\u201d her line of questioning to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during a House hearing earlier this week. Ocasio-Cortez asked Powell about the Phillips curve, an economic model that says inflation is supposed to rise as unemployment drops. CNBC reported\u00a0that the concept was used by the Fed to guide policy. However, in recent years, low unemployment hasn\u2019t led to rising inflation. Ocasio-Cortez put Powell on the spot about the issue, and he admitted that the link \u201cwas broken at least 20 years ago\u201d and the relationship between the two had \u201cbecome weaker and weaker and weaker.\u201d Kudlow applauded Ocasio-Cortez for her queries. \u201cI got to give her high marks for that,\u201d Kudlow told Fox News. \u201cShe got that out of the chairman.\u201d He added that the White House agreed: \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s been my position. That\u2019s been the president\u2019s position: Strong growth doesn\u2019t cause higher inflation and interest rates. It looks like the Fed is going to cut their rates.\u201d The agreement likely ends there; the point of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s questions was to say that if the Phillips curve was wrong about unemployment driving inflation, other assumptions about inflation might also be wrong. \u201cDo you think that could have implications in terms of policymaking?\u201d she asked Powell. \u201cThat there is perhaps room for increased tolerance of policies that have historically been thought to drive inflation?\u201d Her specific example was increasing the minimum wage, something Kudlow has called \u201ca terrible idea.\u201d",

      "author": "Amy Russo",
      "content": " Amid an ongoing clash between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the House Democratic Caucus chided the freshman congresswoman\u2019s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, on Friday. The caucus\u2019 criticism of Chakrabarti centered on comments he made about Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) last month.\u00a0In an exchange with a Twitter user, Chakrabarti charged that Davids was among a group of Democrats voting \u201cas a block to criminalize immigrants.\u201d At that time, Davids had just\u00a0voted to pass\u00a0a bill for emergency federal appropriations for both humanitarian aid and security at the U.S.-Mexico border, meaning President Donald Trump\u2019s wall. The only Democrats who voted against the House version of the bill were Ocasio-Cortez and her so-called squad of congressional newcomers: Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.). Critics of the measure argued it amounted to capitulation to the president and that it was a mistake to trust his administration\u2019s use of the funds. Davids has also voiced support for Dreamers\u00a0and, in a political podcast last year, expressed a willingness to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position typically associated with progressives like Ocasio-Cortez. Doubling down on his criticism, Chakrabarti added, \u201cI don\u2019t believe Sharice is a racist person, but her votes are showing her to enable a racist system.\u201d In a public jab at the chief of staff, the House Democrats\u2019 account posted a screenshot of Chakrabarti\u2019s old tweet on Friday, asking why he was singling out Davids and telling him to \u201ckeep her name out of your mouth.\u201d\u00a0The account also accused him of \u201csingling out a Native American woman of color.\u201d Who is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\n\nHer name is Congresswoman Davids, not Sharice.\n\nShe is a phenomenal new member who flipped a red seat blue.\n\nKeep\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeHer\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeName\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeOut\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeOf\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeYour\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffeMouth. pic.twitter.com/k4sV5hsbQl In defense of his past remarks, Chakrabarti noted that the screenshotted tweet had been part of a longer discussion. He also called Davids\u00a0\u201ca friend\u201d and added that he wasn\u2019t \u201cinterested in substance-less Twitter spats.\u201d The scuffle began earlier this week when Chakrabarti, in a tweet that has since been deleted, compared moderate Democrats to segregationists. \u201cInstead of \u2018fiscally conservative but socially liberal,\u2019 let\u2019s call the New Democrats and Blue Dog Caucus the \u2018New Southern Democrats,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did the 40s.\u201d According to Politico, Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), New Democrats\u2019 vice chair for outreach and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, condemned the comparison. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez has feuded with Pelosi, who dismissed the congresswoman and her allies. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi\u00a0told The New York Times. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Hitting back on Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez wrote that the \u201cpublic \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment.\u201d Since then, the tit-for-tat has continued, though on Wednesday, Pelosi told her colleagues to stop tweeting their grievances about colleagues, NBC News reported. It appears the advice was ignored by her caucus\u2019 account.",

      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " On Saturday, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd published an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that reads like an excerpt from The Great Gatsby reimagined for the 21st century. In Dowd\u2019s telling, Pelosi savored chocolates \u201cwith delight,\u201d decked out in \u201cpurple Manolo heels\u201d as she regaled Dowd with war stories about \u201cher vineyard getaway in Napa\u201d and the time U2\u2032s lead singer attended a speech she gave in Ireland. \u201cBono came,\u201d she told Dowd, apparently with a bright grin. \u201cAnd that was really fabulous.\u201d Pelosi has had a rough go of it lately, and the Dowd interview is the strongest evidence yet that the most powerful Democrat in America is losing touch with the country. Pelosi dismissed calls to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, claiming that Trump \u201cself-impeaches\u201d practically \u201cevery day\u201d \u2015 whatever that means. She downplayed former President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with a White House intern as \u201cdoing a dumb thing as a guy\u201d \u2015 a curious position in the Me Too era \u2015 and suggested that Trump himself might have helped Democrats secure liberal priorities in a recent immigration bill had he not been so busy in North Korea. But the interview really went off the rails when Pelosi lit into freshmen Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who all recently voted against that immigration bill, objecting to billions of dollars in fresh funding for the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2015 two agencies the president has relied on to wage a campaign of terror against children, refugees and communities of color. As Pelosi was devoting time from her congressional recess to badmouthing her colleagues, the targets of her wrath \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley \u2015 were spending much of their time away from Capitol Hill visiting Trump\u2019s border camps and detailing their horrors to the public. According to Pelosi, the opposition from Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley didn\u2019t matter, because Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley don\u2019t matter. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ninety-five Democrats voted against the border bill Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent over from the Senate, which Pelosi chose not to amend. Some of Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenants voted nay. The progressive freshmen were not isolated and alone. They spoke for 40 percent of the caucus. The Dowd interview inspired an immediate outcry from progressives, but Pelosi\u2019s office is standing firm. Pelosi aide Drew Hammill emphasized to HuffPost that when Pelosi talked to Trump before the border bill passed, the president really was rattled by bad press and claimed he was open to humanitarian concessions. Talks soured when Trump left town for the North Korea talks and Pence took over. Ocasio-Cortez and Co. had been criticizing the bill for weeks and refusing to vote for anything the speaker proposed, trashing the bill after it passed. Pelosi wasn\u2019t attacking members of her caucus out of the blue, just responding to criticism, he said. The trouble, of course, is that the bill really is bad, which is why Democrats are now pleading with the Trump administration to do nice things with their new funding. And of course, the progressive crew weren\u2019t the only Democrats creating procedural headaches. Pelosi could be badmouthing Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), who organized a flank of conservative Democrats to blow up a House package that put humanitarian strings on the border funding. This is not how a savvy leader rallies her troops. And it\u2019s certainly not the way anyone attuned to the demographics of the modern Democratic Party talks about its next generation of political talent. Indeed, a political neophyte wouldn\u2019t know from Pelosi\u2019s comments or virtually any of her public acts this year that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley are members of the speaker\u2019s own party, much less that the four women supported Pelosi in the leadership battle this past fall. When conservative Democrats backed by Gottheimer challenged Pelosi from the right after the November elections, the lefty freshmen stuck with Pelosi and urged their supporters to do the same. Pelosi has rewarded them with persistent contempt. Politics is a messy business at the best of times, and these are not the best of times. But Pelosi\u2019s leadership is damaging the Democratic Party. By catering to a very narrow, very elite slice of the electorate, she has removed herself from the mainstream of party thought and distanced her caucus from the interests of working people \u2015 who vastly outnumber the people who base their votes on pricey footwear. Three-quarters of Americans support raising taxes on the rich. Sixty-one percent of Republican voters say the gap between the rich and the poor is a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cvery big\u201d problem. In the 2018 midterm elections, voters in Missouri and Arkansas voted to raise the minimum wage as voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voted to expand Medicaid \u2015 socialized medicine! \u2015 to 300,000 additional Americans. The partisan divide on immigration is the sharpest it has ever been, but even here, Democrats have an opportunity: \ufeffSixty-two percent of Americans say immigrants \u201cstrengthen the country because of their hard work and talents,\u201d compared to 28 percent who say immigrants are a \u201cburden.\u201d You won\u2019t win a Republican primary running as a liberal Democrat, but you very well might win over a solid chunk of Republicans in a general election \u2015 and that\u2019s more than enough to carry the day. Ask Sherrod Brown or Tammy Baldwin, two of the most liberal members of the Senate, who represent Rust Belt states Donald Trump won in 2016. Pelosi instead seems to be betting the party\u2019s fortunes on voters like Dowd, whose most recent column accuses Democrats of engaging in \u201cbilingual pandering\u201d during last week\u2019s presidential primary debates and jeopardizing the party\u2019s prospects with \u201ctalk about busing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings and abolishing private health insurance.\u201d Her argument for Pelosi\u2019s leadership prowess relies entirely on the self-evidence of this claim: Go too far left, she insists, and you\u2019ll lose the middle. Okay \u2015 but particularly on economic issues, the middle is the left. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that Pelosi chose to assail four women of color with progressive voting records in an interview with a wealthy columnist who gets weirded out by Spanish. Or maybe they\u2019re both living in the same bubble, their politics based on the same outdated elite assumptions. In 2016, the Democratic Party\u2019s campaign theme was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d an unabashed effort to bring women, people of color and young people into the party coalition. Voters of color make up 43 percent of the Democratic Party\u2019s electorate today, the highest share on record. The Democratic Party has been growing steadily more progressive since 2001, with self-identified \u201cliberals\u201d now substantially outnumbering \u201cmoderates\u201d and \u201cconservatives\u201d among the party faithful. This plurality is who Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley represent. In 2019, Pelosi stands athwart history, calling for an addendum. Democrats are Stronger Together \u2015 but don\u2019t expect her to actually listen to any of them.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump launched an inaccurate, vitriolic attack against progressive Democratic congresswomen on Sunday, referring to them as foreign-born and telling them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d In Twitter postings, Trump didn\u2019t name anyone in his rant, though he apparently was targeting a group that includes four high-profile lawmakers who won election last November \u2015 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. All four are women of color \u2015 though only Omar was born outside of the U.S. Born in Somalia, her family immigrated to the U.S. when she was a child. Ocasio-Cortez, like Trump, was born in New York, while Tlaib was born in Detroit and Pressley in Cincinnati. The freshmen congresswomen have been outspoken critics of Trump, particularly over his handling of immigration and overcrowded detainment centers which have caused a humanitarian crisis along the U.S-Mexico border. Omar and Tlaib both took shots at Trump at an event on Saturday, with Tlaib telling the crowd: \u201cWe\u2019re going to impeach the MF\u2019er, don\u2019t worry!\u201d Trump, in his criticism of the unidentified \u201c\u2018Progressive\u2019 Democrat Congresswomen,\u201d said they \u201coriginally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all).\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can\u2019t leave fast enough,\u201d he continued. Omar\u00a0hit back at Trump on Twitter, calling him \u201cthe worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen.\u201d \u201cYou are stoking white nationalism [because] you are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda,\u201d she said. Ocasio-Cortez also rebuked Trump, blaming him for the border crisis that she accused Trump and corporations of profiting from. \u201cYou are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet.\u201d Pressley retweeted Trump\u2019s comments while stating \u201cTHIS is what racism looks like.\u201d Tlaib, taking to Twitter, invited Trump to \u201ckeep talking\u201d as she continues \u201cfighting corruption in OUR country.\u201d \u201cI do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U.S. Congresswoman,\u201d she said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also quickly assailed the president, saying in a tweet that his comments reaffirm that his signature Make America Great Again slogan \u201chas always been about making America white again.\u201d Pelosi criticized Trump\u2019s tweets as\u00a0\u201cxenophobic comments meant to divide our nation\u201d and said that instead of attacking members of Congress, \u201che should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) also was among the first to call out Trump\u2019s tweets as blatantly racist. \u201cThat is a racist tweet. Telling people to go back where they came from? I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said during an interview on Fox News. \u201cThese are American citizens elected by voters in the United States of America to serve in one of the most distinguished bodies,\u201d he said. Rep. Nanette Barragan (D-Calif.), appearing on CNN on Sunday, also slammed Trump, calling his words \u201cincredibly racist.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to be the daughter of immigrants from Mexico,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to bring a perspective and experience to Congress in my policy decision-making \u2015 and that\u2019s what the diversity of the Democratic Party does and I\u2019m proud that we have more women in Congress and more women of color in Congress than ever before.\u201d Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who\u00a0recently left the Republican Party to become an independent, also called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cracist and disgusting\u201d on Twitter. The Trump reelection campaign attempted to defuse the intense backlash, with an official insisting \u2015 despite the unambiguous wording of the president\u2019s tweet \u2015 that \u201canyone who says the president told members of Congress to go back to where they came from is lying.\u201d Matt Wolking, deputy director of Trump\u2019s \u201crapid response\u201d team, justified that spin in a tweet of his own by noting that the president told the congresswomen to \u201cthen come back and show us how it is done.\u201d Wolking did not address the inaccuracy of Trump claiming that more than one of the congresswomen he clearly had in mind \u201coriginally came\u201d from another country. Meanwhile, a host on Sunday\u2019s \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Fox News \u2015 Jedediah Bila \u2015 treated Trump\u2019s tweets as a jocular matter, saying, \u201cSomeone\u2019s feeling very comedic today.\u201d She added: \u201cI think President Trump is making an important point. (He\u2019s) saying if you don\u2019t like what this country stands for, you\u2019re not going to change it and take away all these things that Americans value so much. Like, if you don\u2019t like it leave, and go set up camp somewhere else.\u201d With his tweets, Trump\u2019s waded deeper into a dispute between the four progressive congresswomen and Pelosi that stemmed from the quartet\u2019s discontent with the recent legislative efforts to increase funding for immigration and border control agencies to deal with the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley were among the most outspoken critics of a bill that finally passed,\u00a0arguing that the legislation did not go far enough to improve standards at detention centers. After Pelosi criticized the women, urging them to come talk to her in private if they have a complaint,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez accused the speaker of being disrespectful of them while singling out \u201cnewly elected women of color.\u201d Trump, speaking to reporters on Friday of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know where they came from.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, Tlaib, and Amash.",

      "content": " By\u00a0A.C. Thompson Members of a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant, according to screenshots of their postings. In one exchange, group members responded with indifference and wisecracks to the post of a news story about a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant who died in May while in custody at a Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Texas. One member posted a GIF of Elmo with the quote, \u201cOh well.\u201d Another responded with an image and the words \u201cIf he dies, he dies.\u201d Created in August 2016, the Facebook group is called \u201cI\u2019m 10-15\u201d and boasts roughly 9,500 members from across the country. (10-15 is Border Patrol code for \u201caliens in custody.\u201d) The group described itself, in an online introduction, as a forum for \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d discussion about work with the patrol. \u201cRemember you are never alone in this family,\u201d the introduction said. Responsible for policing the nation\u2019s southern and northern boundaries, the Border Patrol has come under intense scrutiny as the Trump administration takes new, more aggressive measures to halt the influx of undocumented migrants across the United States-Mexico border. The patrol\u2019s approximately 20,000 agents serve under the broader U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which has been faulted for allegedly mistreating children and adults in its custody. The agency\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its most recent acting chief, John Sanders, resigning last week. ProPublica received images of several recent discussions in the 10-15 Facebook group and was able to link the participants in those online conversations to apparently legitimate Facebook profiles belonging to Border Patrol agents, including a supervisor based in El Paso, Texas, and an agent in Eagle Pass, Texas. ProPublica has so far been unable to reach the group members who made the postings. ProPublica contacted three spokespeople for CBP in regard to the Facebook group and provided the names of three agents who appear to have participated in the online chats. CBP hasn\u2019t yet responded. \u201cThese comments and memes are extremely troubling,\u201d said Daniel Martinez, a sociologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who studies the border. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly xenophobic and sexist.\u201d The postings, in his view, reflect what \u201cseems to be a pervasive culture of cruelty aimed at immigrants within CBP. This isn\u2019t just a few rogue agents or \u2018bad apples.\u2019\u201d The Border Patrol Facebook group is the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces. An investigation by\u00a0Reveal uncovered hundreds of active-duty and retired law enforcement officers\u00a0who moved in extremist Facebook circles, including white supremacist and anti-government groups. A team of researchers calling themselves the\u00a0Plain View Project\u00a0recently released a hefty database of offensive Facebook posts made by current and ex-law enforcement officers. And in early 2018, federal investigators found a raft of disturbing and racist text messages sent by Border Patrol agents in southern Arizona after searching the phone of Matthew Bowen,\u00a0an agent charged with running down a Guatemalan migrant\u00a0with a Ford F-150 pickup truck. The texts, which were revealed in a\u00a0court filing in federal court\u00a0in Tucson, described migrants as \u201cguats,\u201d \u201cwild ass shitbags,\u201d \u201cbeaners\u201d and \u201csubhuman.\u201d The messages included repeated discussions about burning the migrants up. Several of the postings reviewed by ProPublica refer to the planned visit by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, including Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Veronica Escobar, to a troubled Border Patrol facility outside of El Paso. Agents at the compound in Clint, Texas, have been accused of holding children in neglectful, inhumane conditions. Members of the Border Patrol Facebook group were not enthused about the tour, noting that Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from Queens, had compared Border Patrol facilities to Nazi concentration camps. Escobar is a freshman Democrat representing El Paso. One member encouraged Border Patrol agents to hurl a \u201cburrito at these bitches.\u201d Another, apparently a patrol supervisor, wrote, \u201cFuck the hoes.\u201d \u201cThere should be no photo ops for these scum buckets,\u201d posted a third member. Perhaps the most disturbing posts target Ocasio-Cortez. One includes a photo illustration of her engaged in oral sex at an immigrant detention center. Text accompanying the image reads, \u201cLucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC.\u201d Another is a photo illustration of a smiling President Donald Trump forcing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s head toward his crotch. The agent who posted the image commented: \u201cThat\u2019s right bitches. The masses have spoken and today democracy won.\u201d The posts about Escobar and Ocasio-Cortez are \u201cvile and sexist,\u201d said a staffer for Escobar. \u201cFurthermore, the comments made by Border Patrol agents towards immigrants, especially those that have lost their lives, are disgusting and show a complete disregard for human life and dignity.\u201d The head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Joaquin Castro, reviewed the Facebook discussions and was incensed. \u201cIt confirms some of the worst criticisms of Customs and Border Protection,\u201d said Castro, a Democrat who represents San Antonio. \u201cThese are clearly agents who are desensitized to the point of being dangerous to migrants and their co-workers.\u201d He added that the agents who made the vulgar comments \u201cdon\u2019t deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.\u201d Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said the postings are more evidence of the sexism and misogyny that has long plagued the Border Patrol. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re the worst at recruiting women,\u201d said Gaubeca, whose group works to reform the agency. \u201cThey have the\u00a0lowest percentage of female agents or officers\u00a0of any federal law enforcement agency.\u201d In another thread, a group member posted a photo of father and his 23-month-old daughter lying face down in the Rio Grande. The pair drowned while trying to ford the river and cross into the U.S.; pictures of the two have circulated widely online in recent days, generating an outcry. The member asked if the photo could have been faked because the bodies were so \u201cclean.\u201d (The picture was taken by an Associated Press photographer, and there is no indication that it was staged or manipulated.) \u201cI HAVE NEVER SEEN FLOATERS LIKE THIS,\u201d the person wrote, adding, \u201ccould this be another edited photo. We\u2019ve all seen the dems and liberal parties do some pretty sick things\u2026\u201d",

      "content": " Game on. The battle between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) with her progressive \u201csquad\u201d went full tilt over the weekend. Now, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) has tweeted she\u2019s \u201csorry not sorry\u201d that Pelosi is \u201csalty\u201d about \u201cWHO is wielding the power to shift\u201d public sentiment and the future of the Democratic Party. Omar leaped into the fray Sunday in a tweet to Ocasio-Cortez, in which Omar called her colleague \u201csis.\u201d Omar was responding to Ocasio Cortez\u2019s clapback to a dig by Pelosi in a column\u00a0Saturday by New York Times writer Maureen Dowd. Pelosi dismissed the women \u2014 along with freshmen Reps.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0of Massachusetts \u2014 as a tiny squad with no real support in Congress. \u201cAll these people have [is] their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in response: \u201cThat public \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d The latest tensions between Pelosi and the freshmen Democrats erupted Friday when a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez was quoted in a Washington Post op-ed saying that the \u201cgreatest threat to mankind is the cowardice of the Democratic Party.\u201d The new source of friction was the clash over Pelosi\u2019s decision to back the Senate border funding bill \u2014 instead of the House version \u2014 even though it lacked guarantees for humanitarian aid for detained immigrants, particularly children. Pelosi told Dowd it was the strongest bill she could get, and indicated that the upstart Democrats needed to be realistic. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti also joined the action, calling Pelosi\u2019s attacks on her young Democratic colleagues \u201cbaffling.\u201d He said Pelosi is \u201cjust mad that she got\u00a0outmaneuvered (again) by Republicans\u201d on the border bill. Chakrabarti also wondered what is so occupying Pelosi\u2019s time that she can\u2019t launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. \u201cWhat is this legislative mastermind doing?\u201d he asked. There\u2019s been no response yet from Pelosi to Omar or Chakrabarti. The speaker did, however, invite the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team to the Capitol to celebrate the players\u2019 \u201cinspiring\u201d\u00a0World Cup victory. Ocasio-Cortez was the first to extend an invitation last month\u00a0to team co-captain Megan Rapinoe after the star midfielder said there was no way she\u2019d accept an invitation to the \u201cfucking White House.\u201d As for a House tour, Rapinoe responded to Ocasio-Cortez: \u201cConsider it done!\u201d",

      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " Two days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called a meeting admonishing her caucus to stop publicly criticizing each other on Twitter, the official House Democrats Twitter account launched a public broadside against a staffer for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The tweet itself is a cheap smear, the strain of context-free character assassination deployed by 4chan-dwellers and alt-right agitators, assailing a prominent liberal with a snippet of an old Twitter conversation. Two days later, party leaders are hoping everyone will forget the whole thing, and President Donald Trump\u2019s racist rant targeting Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) has sucked up most of the oxygen in Washington. But the House Dems\u2019 tweet carries a symbolic power that a turn of the news cycle can\u2019t erase. One of Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenants, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.),\u00a0the caucus chair, effectively declared war on Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti on Friday night. Nobody in leadership has apologized for it, recanted or publicly rebuked anyone. The tweet is still live. Not since Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexual misconduct scandal in 2011 had the Democratic Party leadership targeted one of its own with such ferocity. Divided over how to oppose Trump and his agenda, party leadership attempted to purge its own ranks, and only eased up when the president himself attacked the same members that leadership had been blasting for weeks. On Sunday \u2015 the same day as Trump\u2019s Twitter rant \u2015 Axios published selective results from a whites-only poll that some Democrats were circulating in an attempt to discredit Ocasio-Cortez. Axios didn\u2019t say who was pushing the poll, or even who had conducted it, or what questions were asked \u2015 only that \u201csome of the most influential Democrats in America\u201d were giving it a look, and some of the numbers didn\u2019t look great for Ocasio-Cortez. The divide between Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi represents just about every split in the modern Democratic coalition \u2015 generational, ideological, race, class, strategy, values, all of it. But beneath it all is a simple struggle for power. House Democrats and their agenda have been hijacked by the corrupt machine politics of New York state. From the governor\u2019s mansion to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, New York is a political patronage system designed to insulate corrupt elites from public accountability. The reason the subways don\u2019t work even as the state government devotes seemingly endless amounts of money to the problem is because corruption taints every contract the government signs. Though often described as a liberal state, New York exhibits all of the horrors Democrats typically associate with right-wing rule. It has the highest income inequality of any state in the country, its police officers rape and kill citizens without facing criminal consequences, and the state imposes nakedly racist restrictions on voting. Each of these outrages has its own distinct characteristics, but they all share one thing in common: corruption. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and his office have aggressively sought leniency in cases involving elite offenders. Vance declined to prosecute Harvey Weinstein, despite a mountain of damning evidence, after receiving campaign contributions from Weinstein\u2019s lawyers. In 2012, Vance decided not to pursue what looked like a slam-dunk criminal fraud case against Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. after the Trumps\u2019 lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, donated $25,000 to Vance\u2019s campaign. Vance\u2019s office even pressed a New York judge for leniency with convicted underage sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Vance\u2019s coziness with New York\u2019s power elite was so flagrant that the New York Attorney General\u2019s office began investigating him for misconduct \u2015 only to have Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) personally intervene to crush the inquiry. Cuomo\u2019s campaign got a check from Weinstein\u2019s lawyers after the probe was called off. Ocasio-Cortez represents a greater threat to this machine than Trump, which is why Democratic leadership in Congress is now diverting time, attention and resources to defend the machine\u2019s turf, instead of focusing on the president. Her primary defeat of then-Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) in 2018 challenged this system. This year, she endorsed Tiffany Cab\u00e1n in a race for Queens district attorney. On election night, Cab\u00e1n \u2015 a queer Latina socialist \u2015 appeared to have narrowly defeated machine-backed candidate Melinda Katz. After a controversial accounting in which thousands of ballots were rejected, Katz now leads Cab\u00e1n by less than two dozen votes. A fair accounting might vindicate Cab\u00e1n, and it might vindicate Katz. But Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and the rest of the machine don\u2019t want a fair accounting. New York state legislators are blocking a voting rights bill that would requalify many of the ballots thrown out in the Cab\u00e1n-Katz contest. The legislature actually passed the voting rights bill earlier this year \u2015 they\u2019re just refusing to send it to Cuomo\u2019s desk after several conservative Democrats lost their seats to more liberal challengers in 2018. After Ocasio-Cortez ousted Crowley, House Democrats selected Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) as caucus chair, the fifth-ranking slot in House leadership. Jeffries has a modestly liberal voting record, but he\u2019s a dedicated machine man with a more conservative record than his opponent in the leadership contest, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). True to the New York machine playbook, Jeffries courts large campaign contributions from wealthy individuals and corporate Political Action Committees. And his district, like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, includes parts of Queens. Jeffries controls the @HouseDemocrats Twitter handle that attacked Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff over the weekend. His spokesman Michael Hardaway confirmed to the Daily Beast that the tweet was not an accident, but the caucus did not respond to an inquiry from HuffPost. The contours of the situation are clear. Threatened by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s national rise within the party, her opponents in the New York machine are trying to take her down \u2015 whatever the consequences for Democratic policy priorities. Chakrabarti, the Ocasio-Cortez staffer Jeffries attacked,\u00a0co-founded Justice Democrats before joining the New York congresswoman\u2019s office. Justice Democrats exists to pull the Democratic Party left by primarying corrupt or conservative Democrats in safe seats. The bluer a district, the more likely a candidate is to face a Justice Democrats-backed challenger, and the bluest districts in America are in New York. A competent House speaker wouldn\u2019t allow party energy to be squandered this way. But a speaker in firm control also wouldn\u2019t set caucus-wide rules of conduct \u2015 stop criticizing other Democrats on Twitter, say \u2015 only to see them flagrantly violated by the chair of the caucus itself. Nancy Pelosi may look like she\u2019s in charge of the House majority, but the New York machine is running its own show.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) rebuked President Donald Trump\u2019s bold-faced racism on Sunday after he said on Twitter that\u00a0progressive Democratic congresswomen\u00a0should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they \u201coriginally came from,\u201d which he described as \u201ctotally broken and crime infested.\u201d In response, Ocasio-Cortez reminded him that America\u00a0is\u00a0her country. \u201cMr. President, the country I \u2018come from,\u2019 & the country we all swear to, is the United States,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBut given how you\u2019ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet.\u201d Doubling down on her criticism, Ocasio-Cortez said the president was incapable of conceiving of a nation that could bring about the election of progressives, empowering them to \u201ccall your bluff & offer a positive vision for this country.\u201d In a spate of tweets that morning, Trump claimed that \u201d\u2018progressive\u2019 Democratic congresswomen,\u201d who he did not name, \u201coriginally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all).\u201d He clearly taking aim at Ocasio-Cortez and three other Democratic House members who took office this year \u2015\u00a0Ilhan Omar of Minnesota,\u00a0Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, all of whom are women of color. Omar is the only one in the so-called \u201csquad\u201d of lawmakers who was not born in the U.S.; she immigrated with her parents from Somalia as a child. Continuing his attack, Trump slammed the congresswomen for \u201cloudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.\u201d Capping off the smear, the president urged the lawmakers to \u201cfix\u201d the \u201cplaces from which they came,\u201d then \u201ccome back and show us how it is done.\u201d One by one, each of Trump\u2019s apparent targets condemned his remarks online;\u00a0 Omar shamed Trump for \u201cstoking white nationalism\u201d and embracing a \u201chate-filled agenda.\u201d Pressley called Trump\u2019s message \u201cwhat racism looks like,\u201d telling the president the only place she and her colleagues would be going \u201cback to\u201d is Washington. Shortly after, Tlaib spoke out, saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud of my Palestinian roots & a WEAK bully like you never wins.\u201d \u201cThis is what America looks like,\u201d she added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who Trump said \u201cwould be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements\u201d in an apparent reference to her feud with Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of the squad, also rejected what she termed the president\u2019s \u201cxenophobic comments meant to divide our nation.\u201d",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) defended her decision to block certain Twitter users after the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University urged her not to block people based on their \u201cviewpoints.\u201d The progressive lawmaker argued on Twitter on Thursday that among her some 5.2 million followers on the social media platform, she has fewer than 20 users blocked due to reported harassment. She added that none of the blocked users are her constituents. \u201cHarassment is not a viewpoint,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cSome accounts, like the Daily Caller, posted fake nude photos of me & abused my comments to spread it. No one is entitled to abuse.\u201d In January, the Caller, a right-wing news site, published an explicit photo of a woman who was not Ocasio-Cortez, along with\u00a0a misleading headline that did not clearly state it was not the lawmaker in the photo. The publication later said it regretted the headline and changed it. The Knight First Amendment Institute, which works to defend freedom of speech in the digital age, issued a letter to Ocasio-Cortez in hopes of \u201cdissuading\u201d her from blocking Twitter users due to their \u201cviews.\u201d The institute argued that Ocasio-Cortez uses her personal account as \u201can extension\u201d of her formal office. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July, New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind (D) and GOP congressional candidate Joseph Saladino (a controversial YouTuber known as Joey Salads), filed separate lawsuits against Ocasio-Cortez, claiming the representative had blocked them on Twitter. Hikind\u2019s lawsuit cited a July ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, in a legal challenge by the institute, which found that the First Amendment forbids President Donald Trump from blocking his critics from viewing his Twitter account.\u00a0The decision upheld a May 2018 ruling. \u201cThe First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialog because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,\u201d Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote\u00a0in the July ruling. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, addressed the institute\u2019s letter in another tweet from her personal account on Thursday. \u201cPeople are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they\u2019d like,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse.\u201d The Knight First Amendment Institute acknowledged in its letter that Ocasio-Cortez \u201cmay wish to block users for reasons that are both reasonable and constitutionally legitimate \u2015 for example, because their speech is threatening.\u201d The institute also noted the persistent threats and abuse that women of color often face on social media, and wrote that those attacks \u201ccan deter speech and political participation that are crucial to our democracy.\u201d \u201cWe would welcome the chance to work with you to develop a social media policy that both complies with the First Amendment and helps you address threats, abuse, and harassment,\u201d the institute\u2019s letter read. CORRECTION: A prior version of this article stated that the Knight First Amendment Institute represented Hikind and Saladino in their July lawsuits. It did not.",

Conway fired back on Twitter, slamming the freshman lawmaker for voting against a border aid bill last month: Ocasio-Cortez was among 95 Democrats and seven Republicans who voted against the bill in the House. Many of these lawmakers wanted restrictions placed on the money to ensure it would be spent helping the migrants instead of on enhanced security measures. Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter, saying the bill lacked accountability. Then, she attacked Conway for not showing up to a House committee hearing last month to explain her repeated violations of the Hatch Act:",

      "content": " Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) said she would consider getting rid of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. In an interview with The New Yorker released Wednesday, the congresswoman was asked about her previous calls to abolish ICE, which is a DHS agency that enforces federal immigration laws inside the country, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the \u201ccore structure of ICE\u2026 and frankly, the entire Department of Homeland Security,\u201d saying their roles were \u201cextrajudicial\u201d and \u201clack effective oversight.\u201d She noted that DHS was formed in 2002 and ICE in 2003 under the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \u201cWould you get rid of Homeland Security?\u201d the interviewer asked. \u201cI think so. I think so,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez responded, adding that the country needs to \u201cundo a lot of the egregious mistakes\u201d from the Bush administration. \u201cI feel like it is a very qualified and supported position... in terms of being able to make the argument that we never should have created DHS.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez doubled down on her suggestion to get rid of DHS later on Wednesday, tweeting that it\u2019s \u201creally not that radical\u201d and that discussing reorganizing the department \u201cshouldn\u2019t be out of the question.\u201d The congresswoman also told The New Yorker that DHS had been ignoring congressional requests for documents on migrant children who had been separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration\u2019s hardline immigration policies, as well as on conditions in U.S. immigrant detention facilities. \u201cThey have been completely noncompliant,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said of DHS. \u201cThey won\u2019t give us a shred of paper that helps us find these kids.\u201d DHS told HuffPost on Thursday that it has been complying with the subpoena the House oversight committee issued in February. Homeland Security, with\u00a0over 200,000 employees, has a\u00a0mission of \u201cpreventing terrorism; securing our borders; enforcing immigration laws; securing cyberspace; and ensuring disaster response and resilience.\u201d It is unclear which, if any, functions Ocasio-Cortez would want to maintain or re-allocate to other agencies. HuffPost reached out to Ocasio-Cortez but did not immediately receive a response. ICE and CBP have come under fire after reports emerged of horrific conditions in immigrant detention facilities the agencies operate. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments on getting rid of DHS quickly caught the attention of right-wing media and conservative politicians, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who slammed the idea to reporters on Wednesday as \u201cjust absolute irresponsibility.\u201d Earlier this week, Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) committed to making weekly visits to the ICE detention facility in his district in Aurora to demand more oversight after health issues were reported there, including cases of mumps and chickenpox among detainees. A report earlier this year from the inspector general for DHS found that ICE was not adequately policing contractors running detention centers and that serious problems, including health care deficiencies, were going unreported. In her interview with The New Yorker, Ocasio-Cortez described the CBP-run\u00a0detention facility she and other members of Congress visited\u00a0in El Paso, Texas, last week as \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cinhumane.\u201d The congresswoman described concrete cells with women in sleeping bags on the floor, and one toilet at the back behind a concrete slab but without a door. \u201cThis is where detainees are being kept. I wouldn\u2019t even call it living. Because it was that inhumane,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt was the physical manifestation of Trump\u2019s rhetoric in calling migrants animals. Because that\u2019s how these women were being treated,\u201d she added, noting some women told her their hair was falling out and that they had sores in their mouth. One of the women she spoke to, who were all from Cuba, had been there for 60 days. Two of them said they had been separated from their children. On the day of her visit, Ocasio-Cortez said women were held in cells without water and at least one had said officers told her to drink out of the toilet. \u201cThe cruelty is the point,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The New Yorker, using a phrase coined by journalist Adam Serwer to refer to President Donald Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies. Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress are scheduled to speak at a House hearing on Friday about the conditions they witnessed at U.S. immigration detention facilities.

But Ocasio-Cortez said the real problem is white supremacy, and argued that it\u2019s an issue Republicans won\u2019t address because that would mean taking on part of their base: The suspected gunman in El Paso is a white man who reportedly shared a white supremacist manifesto online before the shooting. The hate-filled document attacked immigrants, claiming there is a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d President Donald Trump has also called immigration an \u201cinvasion,\u201d including in his campaign ads on Facebook.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has thrown down the political gauntlet with a declaration that the \u201cgreatest threat to mankind\u201d is the \u201ccowardice of the Democratic Party.\u201d Corbin Trent made the dramatic statement in an interview\u00a0with Ryan Grim that appeared in Grim\u2019s essay Friday in The Washington Post. Trent, a co-founder of Justice Democrats, which helped propel Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0and her other progressives to victory\u00a0in the House, told Grim that the Democratic leadership is \u201cdriven by fear. They seem to be unable to lead.\u201d Grim, Washington Bureau chief of The Intercept (and formerly of HuffPost), pointed in his piece to the compromise the House made on the Senate\u2019s border aid bill. The House supported it instead of its own version of border aid, even though the Senate bill failed to address the humanitarian crisis of immigrants detained at the border. Ocasio-Cortez called support for the Senate bill an \u201cabdication of power.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted that a vote for the Senate bill was a \u201cvote to keep kids in cages and terrorize immigrant communities.\u201d And Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) challenged: \u201cIf you see the Senate bill as an option, then you don\u2019t believe in basic human rights.\u201d Grim argued in the Post that the old-guard Democrats \u2014 led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 were buffaloed long ago by The Gipper: by\u00a0Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential landslide in 1980 and 1984 reelection. They suffered a \u201ctraumatic political coming-of-age\u201d in Reagan\u2019s rise and have never been the same, he argued. Because of that experience, their consistent fallback position is: \u201cNow is not the time; push too fast or too far, and there\u2019ll be a backlash,\u201d according to Grim. The old-era Democrats are still now \u201cunable to embrace the new political environment in which the progressive agenda is genuinely popular,\u201d he noted. \u201cFor people under a certain age, this slinking in the corner is deeply strange behavior.\u201d For the newcomers, Grim emphasized, \u201cRepublicans shouldn\u2019t be feared, they should be beaten.\u201d Check out Ryan Grim\u2019s op-ed here.",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took aim at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Saturday, calling the Democratic Party\u2019s reluctance to impeach President Donald Trump a \u201cnational scandal.\u201d \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2015 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted late Saturday. The freshman lawmaker\u2019s tweet follows reports that a U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint last month allegedly involving Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. House Democrats are looking into whether Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the foreign government to dig up dirt on Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, who previously sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, attacking reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post about the matter as \u201cfake news.\u201d Despite the explosive allegations against Trump and the majority of House Democrats publicly supporting the start of an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi has refused to move forward with the process, claiming it would only further divide the country. She also reportedly told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) last week that she doesn\u2019t believe impeachment would pass a vote on the House floor. A representative for Pelosi did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Ocasio-Cortez and several other progressive House Democrats have repeatedly urged Pelosi for more than a year to pursue impeachment of the president, citing conflicts of interest between Trump\u2019s presidency and his business empire. More Democrats began calling for an impeachment inquiry following Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report, which outlined several instances of potential obstruction of justice committed by Trump. Nearly all of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have said they would support the House opening an inquiry. \u201cAfter the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,\u201d Warren tweeted Friday. \u201cBy failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\u201d Biden, who has stated in the past that he agrees with Pelosi\u2019s stance on impeachment, told CBS News on Friday that Trump \u201ccould be impeached\u201d depending on the results of the House\u2019s probe into the whistleblower complaint. \u201cI\u2019m not making that judgment now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House should investigate.\u201d",

Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d Huckabee Sanders\u2019 time at the White House was defined by verbal attacks on journalists and a defense of the president that often meant standing by his lies. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that Huckabee Sanders lied to reporters in 2017 about former FBI director James Comey\u2019s firing. She falsely told the public that the FBI had \u201clost confidence\u201d in Comey, later admitting that the claim had been fabricated. On another occasion, Huckabee Sanders tweeted a doctored video from the far-right conspiracy website InfoWars to justify a White House ban on CNN reporter Jim Acosta. Since stepping down from her position, Huckabee Sanders is considering a run for governor in her home state of Arkansas \u2014 a move which Trump has openly supported. If she launches a campaign, she will likely work closely with the president once again.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2015 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, offered some qualified criticism Friday of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s disparaging comments about some of Jayapal\u2019s progressive colleagues, even as she defended Pelosi\u2019s overall leadership style. \u201cI don\u2019t think those comments were helpful to a broader picture of how we build progressive power in the House and what it looks like relative to overall Democratic power,\u201d she said during a panel discussion at the liberal Netroots Nations conference in Philadelphia. Jayapal was being asked to respond to a public spat between Pelosi and four newly elected progressive congresswomen nicknamed \u201cthe Squad\u201d: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. In an interview with New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd last Saturday, Pelosi made light of the Squad\u2019s influence. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said of the Squad. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d The four congresswomen were the only Democrats to vote against a House emergency border funding bill, which contained new conditions designed to ensure humane treatment of the asylum seekers surging across the border. The Squad thought that the conditions on how the money would be spent were insufficient and wanted to block additional funding for\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0entirely. In the end, the GOP-controlled Senate passed a bipartisan border funding bill by a margin of 84 to 8\u00a0that contained far fewer humanitarian regulations aimed at improving conditions in the detention facilities holding the asylum seekers. When the bill came back to the House, moderate Democrats forced a vote on the Senate version without amending it to include the more-liberal House provisions, defying Pelosi\u2019s wishes and saddling her with a rare legislative loss. That Pelosi subsequently lashed out at the Squad for the first dissenting vote, rather than the centrists who foiled her plans when the Senate bill came back to the House, irked many progressive activists. It is also only the latest of many times when Pelosi has spoken dismissively about Ocasio-Cortez or her colleagues. In response, Ocasio-Cortez has gone so far as suggesting the four women are targets because they are not white. In an interview with The Washington Post, she criticized Pelosi for persistent \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color,\u201d which she called \u201coutright disrespectful.\u201d Jayapal, whose agenda largely depends on Pelosi\u2019s cooperation, couched her modest criticism of the remarks with a far lengthier defense of the governing philosophy she believes Pelosi intended to articulate. \u201cI believe that it all comes down to votes,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re on the outside or the inside, you\u2019ve got to be able to leverage the votes.\u201d Thus, according to Jayapal, Pelosi, an expert vote counter, was merely pointing out that because the Squad does not command the support of a larger bloc of votes, they lack the power to dictate House Democrats\u2019 agenda. \u201cI think what Pelosi was talking about is if you only have four votes in the House that you can\u2019t get what you want done,\u201d she said. Jayapal, who is an immigrant from India, added a subtle repudiation of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments questioning Pelosi\u2019s racial sensitivity. \u201cI don\u2019t typically find Pelosi to be someone who disrespects members,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt disrespected as a woman of color by Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) spoke alongside Jayapal on the panel at Netroots Nation, which was about how to enact ambitious progressive legislation. Jayapal arrived late from Washington because she had to vote on a defense spending bill, so initially Merkley had the panel to himself. He blamed House Democratic leaders for the passage of the unamended Senate bill, which he had voted against in the Senate. He argued that many Senate Democrats voted for the border security legislation on the assumption that House Democrats would pass their more ambitious version again and force the two legislative chambers into a conference committee that would produce a compromise. As a result of the House\u2019s failure to force the bills into a conference committee, Merkley said, \u201cWe lost all the leverage that the progressives like Rep. Jayapal had worked so hard to get. It just went down the tube.\u201d \u201cThe House has to carry its weight to restore the values of America,\u201d he added. \u201cIt failed on this occasion.\u201d When Jayapal arrived, she blamed Senate Democrats for passing the more conservative legislation by such a wide margin. That created a situation, she said, in which moderate House Democrats wondered why they could not just vote for such a consensus-driven bill. \u201cWe cannot have the Senate passing these big bipartisan votes because it affects what happens in the House,\u201d she said.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) who sparked controversy earlier this summer by comparing House Democrats to Southern segregationists, is leaving her office, HuffPost confirmed Saturday. Communications Director Corbin Trent will also step down from his role. According to a statement from Ocasio-Cortez, Chakrabarti will join climate change-focused nonprofit New Consensus to help further develop the Green New Deal, an ambitious economic and environmental initiative promoted by Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats. \u201cI am extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in NY-14,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cFrom his co-founding of Justice Democrats to his work on the campaign and in the official office, Saikat\u2019s goal has always been to do whatever he can to help the larger progressive movement, and I look forward to continuing working with him to do just that.\u201d Trent will return to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign where he will direct communications for her 2020 reelection bid. \u201cWith the Ocasio2020 campaign beginning to ramp up, I\u2019ve asked Corbin to transition to the campaign full-time and he has agreed to do so,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to growing the movement with him in Queens and the Bronx and across the country.\u201d Chakrabarti, an alum of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign, co-founded Justice Democrats in 2017, a progressive political group that jump-started Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional run, leading to the defeat of incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley (D), who hadn\u2019t faced a primary challenger since 2004. In June, Chakrabarti appeared to inflame existing tensions between Ocasio-Cortez and moderate Democrats, writing in a now-deleted tweet that the New Democrats and the Blue Dog Caucus should instead be called the \u201cNew Southern Democrats,\u201d a reference to pro-segregationists. \u201cThey certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did the 40s,\u201d he wrote. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had feuded publicly with Ocasio-Cortez in the past over her progressive views, spoke out, calling the tweet \u201coffensive,\u201d according to Politico. In July, Pelosi privately warned her colleagues to stop airing their political grievances on Twitter, telling them to come to her instead, NBC News reported. Shortly after Pelosi delivered the word of caution, the House Democrats\u2019 Twitter account took aim at Chakrabarti online for a critique of Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), who\u00a0voted to pass\u00a0an emergency federal appropriations bill for humanitarian aid and security at the southern border, such as President Donald Trump\u2019s wall. Frustrated by Davids\u2019 decision, which the bills\u2019 opponents said gave into Trump\u2019s demands,\u00a0Chakrabarti said she was one of a horde of\u00a0Democrats voting \u201cas a block to criminalize immigrants.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe Sharice is a racist person, but her votes are showing her to enable a racist system,\u201d he clarified. In response, the\u00a0House Democratic Caucus account tweeted back,\u00a0\u201ckeep her name out of your mouth.\u201d According to The Intercept, which first reported the news, Chakrabarti\u2019s last day was Friday.",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has raised nearly $130,000 in campaign funds since President Donald Trump targeted her and three other progressive freshman congresswomen with racist tweets on Sunday morning. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reelection campaign took in more than $70,000 on Monday alone.\u00a0The donations came from nearly 12,000 individual contributions and averaged $10.84, according to information provided by the campaign. She is highlighting the controversy in Facebook posts that feature a photo of Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) \u2015 a group nicknamed the \u201cSquad\u201d who elicited Trump\u2019s xenophobic vitriol. \u201cThe\u00a0#Squad has never been just four people,\u201d her campaign wrote in a fundraising post. \u201cOur Squad is everyone who recognizes the cruelty and bigotry of this Administration, and is committed to advocating, legislating, and working every day for a more just and equitable world. Our squad is big.\u201d Fundraising data provided by the congresswoman\u2019s campaign showed that she benefited from a text message and email blast that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent this supporters asking for donations in response to Trump\u2019s outburst. Sanders asked supporters for donations that would be split between Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign and the campaigns of the four congresswomen targeted by Trump. Sanders\u2019 effort alone netted Ocasio-Cortez and the three other congresswomen nearly $37,000 each as of Tuesday afternoon. \u201cThis was a racist attack against Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d his campaign wrote in an email solicitation. \u201cIt is unacceptable, and we must stand in solidarity with these young legislators.\u201d House Democrats were enmeshed in a bitter, public slugfest over the weekend as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), her staffers and allies hurled insults in social media and the press at members of the \u201cSquad\u201d and their staffs. Pelosi had supposedly been angry about the left-leaning women\u2019s votes against a House border funding bill in late June. But many veteran Democrats also harbor hostility to the new members because they fear the kinds of progressive primary challenges with which the Squad is associated \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley both unseated Democratic incumbents. Trump managed to unify the Democratic Party in mutual disgust with a Twitter rant Sunday morning telling the young congresswomen, three out of four of whom were born in the United States, to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries. He has since stood by his remarks, arguing that their rhetoric, which he baselessly labeled \u201canti-USA,\u201d merited the response. Long before the backlash to Trump\u2019s attacks, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s savvy digital operation and populist appeal had enabled her to build a prodigious fundraising operation. Although she represents a safely Democratic congressional district, she raised $1.2 million from April through June \u2015 84% of it in increments of less than $200. She also raised over $100,000 over the course of a few days at the end of January and the beginning of February in response to an anonymous House Democrat\u2019s comments encouraging a primary challenge against her.",

It started when Trump tweeted out a truncated quote from Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0that warned how Democrats could lose the 2020 election. Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cI think that we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to Donald Trump if we do not have a presidential candidate that is fighting for true transformational change in the lives of working people in the United States.\u201d Trump cut off the last part of her argument, tweeting: The New York Democrat fired back a few hours later and told the president that impeachment was a very real possibility. In April, Ocasio-Cortez said she\u2019d support a resolution introduced in March by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) that would look into whether the House should impeach the president. Currently, nearly 70 members of the House, overwhelmingly Democrats,\u00a0have called for an impeachment inquiry of Trump.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) should be shot, mocking her as a \u201cvile idiot.\u201d On Thursday, Gretna officer Charlie Rispoli wrote that the congresswoman \u201cneeds a round, and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d according to NOLA.com, which first reported the remarks. The comment was written in response to a phony news article Rispoli shared that falsely accused Ocasio-Cortez of saying, \u201cWe pay soldiers too much.\u201d On Wednesday, fact-checking site Snopes.com debunked that story as a fake. Asked by NOLA.com for a reaction to Rispoli\u2019s now-deleted post, Chief Arthur Lawson called it \u201cdisturbing,\u201d but did not see it as a threat. \u201cI will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end.

In May, Ocasio-Cortez revealed in a Twitter thread that she has faced a \u201cflood of death threats,\u201d sometimes inspired by coverage on Fox News. \u201cI\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\u201d she wrote, noting that she doesn\u2019t even see them all \u2015 only \u201cthe ones that have been flagged as particularly troubling.\u201d Last week, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)\u00a0sent a letter to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, calling for the Capitol Police Board to \u201cre-examine\u201d its evaluation of security threats against Congress, citing Trump\u2019s remarks about Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues as the reason for his concern. \u201cAs you are familiar, inflammatory remarks targeting individuals on social media and in public arena were a central feature of the presidential campaign and now, presidency of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s rhetoric may insinuate more attacks on Members of Congress.\u201d At a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said there were 4,894 cases of threats made against congressional lawmakers last year. \u201cSo far, for this year, we have 2,502 cases,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re on par to probably break last year\u2019s record.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The location, in the shadow of New York\u2019s dirtiest power plant, is a deliberate choice by the senator and his campaign.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " On Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is due to hold his first rally since his heart attack earlier this month \u2015 and he\u2019s planning to make it a big one. Sanders, 78, had a strong debate performance on Tuesday, trying to put to rest any lingering doubts about whether he\u2019s fit enough to be president. And this past week, he rolled out the endorsement of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.), two of the Democratic Party\u2019s young progressive rising stars. The Sanders campaign is obviously hoping for a large crowd on Saturday, when Ocasio-Cortez is slated to join the Vermont senator on stage in Queens, New York, to formally endorse his candidacy. And the campaign is hoping to set the senator apart from some of his opponents \u2015 including other progressives \u2015 by choosing a location and message that reflect his commitment to affordable housing, the Green New Deal and taming corporate power. The \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering is slated to take place in Queensbridge Park, which is in the shadow of both the country\u2019s largest public housing development and New York\u2019s dirtiest power plant. In a nod to his surroundings, Sanders plans to focus his remarks on expanding affordable housing and lifting up racially diverse, poor and working-class communities like those in the neighboring Queensbridge Houses. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ... try to capture the energy of the housing justice movement here,\u201d said New York state Sen. Julia Salazar, a Sanders backer who unseated a Brooklyn Democrat in September 2018 on the strength of calls for greater tenant protections. Sanders\u2019 supporters see his ambitious affordable housing plan as a key point of contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a progressive rival who has overtaken Sanders in national and early-state polling. Sanders has, among other things, called for a national universal rent control law capping rent increases at 3% annually, while Warren has focused on increasing federal funding for the construction of affordable housing. Sanders is also attempting to distinguish himself from Warren through the selection of an industrial and working-class Queens locale. Warren held a rally focused on taking on Big Tech this past March in Long Island City, but in mid-September she chose the more scenic Washington Square Park, in the heart of Manhattan\u2019s upscale Greenwich Village, as the site of her largest campaign rally to date. Sanders, who also convened supporters for a blowout rally in Washington Square Park during his 2016 presidential run, made a point of picking a site with more populist significance this time around. \u201cQueensbridge was a deliberate choice,\u201d a Sanders aide told HuffPost. \u201cIt is a symbolic gesture by Bernie ... saying that this is no longer about being in the heart of Manhattan, this is about the working families in the outer boroughs who have been neglected,\u201d said New York Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Flushing Democrat backing Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for all Americans who feel neglected by Wall Street.\u201d As Sanders speaks on Saturday, the smokestacks of the Ravenswood Generating Station, a fuel oil and natural gas plant, will tower above the park. Fittingly, Sanders will likely be discussing his twin priorities of fighting climate change and environmental injustice. As of 2014, the power plant was emitting more carbon dioxide than any other facility in the state, making it a longstanding thorn in the side of the city\u2019s robust environmental movement. The confluence of Ravenswood, a second power plant in the adjacent neighborhood of Astoria and the traffic flows coming off of the Queensborough Bridge and nearby highways makes Western Queens, once nicknamed \u201cAsthma Alley,\u201d one of the most polluted areas in New York City. The Queensbridge Houses, whose 7,000 low- and moderate-income residents live in the heart of this smoggy corner of New York, are thus a prime example of environmental injustice \u2015 a term that describes how marginalized communities bear the brunt of ecological depredation. But if the setting embodies ills that are plaguing American society, it also has the makings of a potential solution. The site makes plain the case for a Green New Deal that could employ residents of the public housing development to transform the Ravenswood plant into a source of renewable energy, according to Pete Sikora, climate director for the progressive group New York Communities for Change, which has not endorsed in the Democratic presidential primary. Ravenswood\u2019s operators have already submitted a plan to convert the dirty energy source into a facility capable of housing renewable energy storage batteries that Sikora and others believe federal help could usher into reality. \u201cThis backdrop is a beautiful symbol for the Green New Deal,\u201d said Sikora, who supports Sanders in a personal capacity and plans to attend Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cHopefully Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are going to make that point in their speeches.\u201d Northwest Queens has become a hotbed of left-wing politics in recent years, as young newcomers and middle-class families get priced out of Manhattan and trendy swaths of Brooklyn and bring their left-wing, anti-establishment political views to these neighborhoods abutting the East River. The Democratic Socialists of America has a vibrant presence in Northwest Queens, providing a key source of experienced canvassers to aid insurgent candidates willing to take on one of the city\u2019s most influential Democratic Party machine apparatuses. Other, less ideologically radical upstarts in the region, like the New Queens Democrats, have attacked the machine\u2019s arcane levers of power, like the opaque county committee that rubber-stamps candidates for the vast borough\u2019s court system. The combined firepower of Northwest Queens\u2019 ascendant left has produced some of the most significant progressive wins in the country in the past few years. With the help of DSA\u2019s volunteer army, Ocasio-Cortez racked up some of her highest electoral margins in Northwest Queens against then-Rep. Joe Crowley (D) in June 2018. A year after Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win, the activists and rank-and-file progressives of Northwest Queens again flexed their muscles in a historically contentious Democratic primary to fill a vacant district attorney post. In that case, the left\u2019s preferred candidate, the Astoria-based public defender Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, ended up coming a few dozen votes shy of victory. Queens\u2019 bastion of left-wing activism has also punched above its weight outside of the electoral arena. In February, Amazon withdrew its offer to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, amid vocal opposition to the tax subsidies it was due to receive from the city and state to set up shop in the borough. Polls showed that the public favored Amazon\u2019s arrival, but the outspoken skepticism of local elected officials in Northwest Queens, keen to prove their bona fides to restive constituents, contributed to the massive company\u2019s decision to pull out. \u201cThis is ground zero,\u201d said Kim, the Flushing assemblyman, who represents neighborhoods east of Long Island City but was an early and vocal opponent of Amazon\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe progressive wave is happening there.\u201d Saturday\u2019s choice of neighborhood is more than just symbolic for Sanders, though. If he hopes to compete in New York\u2019s primary in April, he will need to maximize turnout in areas like Northwest Queens and neighborhoods in Brooklyn where voters broke for him in the greatest numbers in 2016. The rally is a way of reminding his base that he cares about them and needs their support, according to Salazar, who represents the liberal Brooklyn strongholds of Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Bushwick. \u201cThe people who live Western Queens and the advocates there have demonstrated that they are at least largely aligned with a really progressive \u2015 democratic socialist, potentially \u2015 platform, so that\u2019s definitely favorable for Bernie,\u201d Salazar said.",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) confronted the acting secretary of homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, on Thursday amid a report this month that DHS employees belonged to a secret Facebook group that shared violent, racist images among its members, including a photoshopped meme of the congresswomen being assaulted. McAleenan was grilled by the freshman lawmaker during a hearing before the House Oversight Committee about the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Ocasio-Cortez used her time to point to a July ProPublica report that uncovered the secret group, where around 9,500 members, some who belonged to Border Patrol, joked about migrant deaths and posted the violent memes. During her questioning, she asked if the acting secretary had seen photoshopped images of herself shared in the group, and asked if any members of Border Patrol affiliated with them were still responsible for working with migrant women and children. \u201cDid you see the images of officers circulating photoshopped images of my violent rape?\u201d the lawmaker asked. \u201cDo you think that the policy of child separation could have contributed to a dehumanizing culture within CBP that contributes and kind of spills over into other areas of conduct?\u201d McAleenan replied that he had, but demurred about any potential Border Patrol officers that had been reprimanded to for their involvement, saying simply that some had been placed on \u201cadministrative duties.\u201d An investigation by Customs and Border Patrol said this week it determined at least 62 current border agents were in the offensive group. \u201cWe do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP. This is an agency that rescues 4,000 people a year. It\u2019s absolutely committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with,\u201d McAleenan replied. He went on to note that the posts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said he had ordered an ongoing investigation \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of learning about the group. Ocasio-Cortez stood by her line of questioning on Twitter later that day, noting that in her estimation, Trump administration policies were \u201cgravely dehumanizing\u201d and had stripped \u201call involved of human decency.\u201d At its core, abuses at the border are not about whether some CBP officers are good or bad people.\n\nIt\u2019s about how our border policies are gravely dehumanizing, & strip all involved of human decency.\n\nOnce you order people to violate others\u2019 rights, a culture can quickly devolve. https://t.co/Z6a18TWtvj President Donald Trump and his immigration officials have faced a nonstop whirlwind of criticism over their hard-line border policies, including the short-lived but devastating \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that saw thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. Recently, border officials have been operating under the White House\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which has seen thousands of asylum-seekers sent back across the southern border while they wait for their cases to be heard. Lawmakers also fired blistering criticism at McAleenan amid ongoing reports of filthy, overcrowded conditions at migrant detention centers along the southern border. \u201cWhat does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces? Can\u2019t take a shower?\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the oversight committee, said during the hearing. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and one of the country\u2019s most coveted progressive campaign surrogates, endorsed Sen. Ed Markey\u2019s reelection on Friday. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blessing, delivered in a two-minute video, aims to strengthen the Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s position ahead of what is likely to be a difficult primary a year from now. Boston labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan and businessman Steve Pemberton have already launched Democratic bids challenging Markey. But Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is actively considering a Senate run and is expected to prove the most formidable opponent if he jumps in. All else being equal, Kennedy\u2019s family name grants him exalted status in the Bay State. Reliable independent polls show him with a double-digit lead in a hypothetical, head-to-head matchup with Markey. \u201cEd Markey is a proud and strong progressive champion for working families \u2015 not just in Massachusetts but across the country,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in the endorsement video. Ocasio-Cortez, who co-sponsored her Green New Deal resolution with Markey, one of Capitol Hill\u2019s veteran climate change experts, emphasized Markey\u2019s leadership on the issue. The Green New Deal, which has become a touchstone for young climate activists, is a blueprint for shifting the U.S. entirely to renewable energy in the coming decades in a way that is economically, socially and racially equitable. \u201cWhen I first got to Congress and we started to discuss big, bold plans \u2015 a solution on the scale of the crisis \u2015 many members shied away. A lot of people said we can\u2019t do too much, we can\u2019t go too fast in order to pursue change for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Ed Markey was one of the few people who had the courage to stand up and take a chance \u2015 and take a chance on a freshman congresswoman and take a chance on this plan.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is the second House member to endorse Markey. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and ally of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, announced his support for Markey on Monday. Markey, 73, has served in Congress since more than a decade before Ocasio-Cortez, 29, was born. And even though Kennedy is younger, at 38, the prospect of a Markey-Kennedy battle affirms that for the predominantly millennial and generation Z progressive activists, ideology is stronger than generational loyalty. Markey, who shepherded a cap-and-trade bill through the House in 2010 and played a key role in a 1996 bill modernizing the telecommunications infrastructure, is widely viewed as more progressive than Kennedy. Although Kennedy is officially a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he held off on supporting marijuana legalization until November and did not join the co-sponsors of a single-payer health care bill in the House until February. Markey is preparing to establish himself as the choice for the state\u2019s considerable population of progressive-leaning Democrats. Elizabeth Warren, his Massachusetts colleague in the Senate whose bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination\u00a0Markey endorsed in July, returned the favor with a video endorsement\u00a0last month. And the Sunrise Movement, a Boston-based group of young climate activists who have engaged in civil disobedience to push for the Green New Deal,\u00a0endorsed him in August. The Massachusetts Senate primary is set for Sept. 15, 2020. The Democratic nominee is highly favored to win the November general election in the solidly blue state.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday announced her first endorsement of a 2020 congressional primary challenger over a Democratic incumbent, throwing her high-profile support behind Marie Newman\u2019s bid to unseat Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois. Newman, who is backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, challenged conservative-leaning Lipinski for Illinois\u2019s 3rd Congressional District seat last year, but lost by about 2,000 votes. The eight-term House member is one of the few Democrats with a record of opposing abortion rights and discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. \u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times. Newman, a former advertising executive turned nonprofit founder, has also nabbed key endorsements from two presidential candidates: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). She said in a statement Tuesday that she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d to receive Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support and hopes to work with her in Congress on policies focused on social, climate and economic justice issues. \u201cI\u2019ve watched my community grow and progress and [Lipinksi] fall behind,\u201d Newman tweeted in response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement. \u201cThis is about electing someone who knows this district, who will fight for bold progressive policies that will make life more affordable for everyone.\u201d Justice Democrats has taken aim at several Democratic incumbents in the 2020 congressional elections, hoping to replace them with progressive-leaning candidates, including immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros in Texas and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adviser Morgan Harper in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement follows the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s push to protect House Democrats from primary challengers. The group implemented a controversial policy earlier this year that cuts off business with vendors who work with candidates who are mounting primary challenges. The DCCC did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThe momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party that fights for its voters, not corporate donors,\u201d\u00a0Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement.",

      "content": " A group of young men in \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d campaign shirts supporting Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell at an annual political picnic in Kentucky were captured in a photo smiling as one of them pretended to strangle a cardboard cutout of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Social media accounts of some of the men identified by Twitter users were taken down \u2014 or shut down by Twitter for inappropriate postings \u2014 by Monday. But at least one Instagram account of a local Republican backer who also attended the picnic had it up late in the day. It was also later removed. Ocasio-Cortez slammed back at the Senate majority leader after seeing the post, asking if McConnell is \u201cpaying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d McConnell campaign spokesman Kevin Golden told HuffPost in an email that Team Mitch \u201cin no way condones any aggressive, suggestive, or demeaning act toward life-sized cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d He said the men are \u201cnot campaign staff; they\u2019re high schoolers, and it\u2019s incredible that the national media has sought to once again paint a target on their backs rather than report real, and significant news in our country.\u201d Some of the same men also appeared in a photo on the official \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d Instagram account for the Fancy Farm picnic, holding aloft cutout faces of Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The photo was the second controversial image to come out of Team Mitch\u2019s participation at the Fancy Farm picnic. Another photo showed cardboard gravestones,\u00a0including one with the name of the Kentucky senator\u2019s Democratic challenger in 2020, Amy McGrath. The campaign tweeted the image under the headline: \u201cThe Grim Reaper of Socialism.\u201d McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, Kevin Golden, insisted the gravestones were a homage to a cartoon in the Louisville Courrier-Journal that featured gravestones, also including one of McGrath. Both images linking killing and death to political targets come at a particularly fraught time, after a weekend that saw two mass murders \u2014 including the apparently hate-fueled attack in El Paso, Texas, that has left 22 people dead. Critics are linking the violence to political leaders\u2019 hate speech and racist attacks. Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshman congresswomen of color \u2014 along with African American Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 have been viciously attacked in recent weeks in public statements by President Donald Trump.",

Co-host Joy Behar, however, told the audience that the real \u201cenemy is the guy tweeting in his toilet\u201d \u2014 meaning President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez called out Pelosi for her \u201coutright disrespectful\u201d attacks \u201csingling out newly elected women of color\u201d in a Washington Post interview published Wednesday. That followed Pelosi\u2019s slam in a New York Times interview Saturday that Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of first-term Democratic congresswomen \u2015\u00a0Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) \u2014\u00a0that, although the women had their \u201cpublic whatever and Twitter world,\u201d they had little support in Congress.

You have to stop discounting that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying to people,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this had to do with color. I think this is more, I don\u2019t know, B.S.\u201d She said later that if these women can\u2019t deliver a vote on a bill they back, \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to bitch about this.\u201d Co-host\u00a0Meghan McCain\u00a0also supported Pelosi\u2019s position in the feud, noting that the Democratic leader was the one who helped deliver the 2018 midterms for the party. But she also sniped that it was \u201cDemocrat-on-Democrat crime,\u201d adding that Republicans \u201csee the bigger picture\u201d and generally stay united. Though\u00a0Sunny Hostin was critical, she also emphasized that the younger women are energizing a disaffected segment of the Democrats, which shouldn\u2019t be discounted. \u201cI think you\u2019re seeing a generational clash ... it\u2019s unfortunate because I would hope that they could work together and that Pelosi would harness this sort of fervor that they have brought into the party,\u201d Hostin said. \u201cThere can be power if the two generations get together.\u201d The latest fissure erupted after Pelosi ended up ditching a House measure to instead\u00a0back the Senate version of a border security bill last month, even though it offered no guarantees for humanitarian aid for detained immigrant children. Goldberg indicated at the start of the segment that the four first-term congresswomen were the only Democrats to vote against the Senate version, but, in fact,\u00a095 Democrats in the House voted against it.

On Saturday, NOLA.com reported on the post that officer Charlie Rispoli wrote Thursday, calling the congresswoman a \u201cvile idiot\u201d who \u201cneeds a round, and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve.\u201d According to NOLA,\u00a0officer Angelo Varisco then hit the \u201clike\u201d button. In a Monday press conference, Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson announced that both had lost their jobs that day for violating the department\u2019s social media policy. \u201cThis incident we feel has been an embarrassment to our department that these officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congress[woman], a member of our government,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate that.\u201d Though it is a felony crime to threaten a sitting member of Congress, Lawson told NOLA he did not feel the Facebook post represented a legitimate threat. The Gretna Police Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Rispoli wrote the comment while sharing a fake news article that falsely claimed Ocasio-Cortez said,\u00a0\u201cWe pay soldiers too much.\u201d Fact-checking site Snopes.com debunked that story on Wednesday. On Monday afternoon, the congresswoman responded to news of the threatening remark on Twitter, blaming President Donald Trump for \u201csowing violence\u201d and \u201ccreating an environment where people can get hurt & he claims plausible deniability.\u201d \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s goal when he uses targeted language & threatens elected officials who don\u2019t agree w/ his political agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s authoritarian behavior.\u201d Last week, the president began attacking Ocasio-Cortez along with three other lawmakers of color \u2015 Reps.\u00a0Ilhan Omar\u00a0(D-Minn.),\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).

Trump\u2019s remarks have since drawn widespread condemnations for their blatant racism, though he has repeatedly doubled down on the comments. And he is now targeting the women by name,\u00a0including in tweets and in statements made at his Wednesday North Carolina rally,\u00a0as well as in media interviews. In May, Ocasio-Cortez opened up on Twitter about the security risks of her job, stating that she has received a \u201cflood of death threats.\u201d \u201cI\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\u201d she wrote. During a\u00a0House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund confirmed that lawmakers will likely be at higher risk this fiscal year compared to the last. So far, this year 2,502 cases of threats have been seen, Sund said, noting that \u201cwe\u2019re on par to probably break\u201d last year\u2019s record total of 4,894 cases.",

      "content": " The 2020 general election is still more than a year away, but it\u2019s never too early for some truly unhelpful polling coverage. As part of the latest salvo of Democratic infighting, Axios published Sunday what they called an \u201cexclusive poll\u201d from May of white likely voters without college degrees. The results, Axios\u2019 Mike Allen wrote, have been circulated by top Democrats to show\u00a0\u201cthat one of the House\u2019s most progressive members \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 has become a definitional face for the party with a crucial group of swing voters.\u201d Just don\u2019t ask where it came from. \u201cThe group that took the poll shared the results with Axios on the condition that it not be named because the group has to work with all parts of the party,\u201d Allen wrote. Why it matters: With public trust in polling frayed, and pollsters adopting an increasingly diverse array of methods to keep up with the times, transparency has become more crucial than ever both for the firms conducting surveys and the outlets reporting on them \u2015 making the idea of reporting on an \u201canonymous poll\u201d an unfortunate outlier. Here are some of the Associated Press\u2019s guidance for survey reporting: \u201cReputable poll sponsors and public opinion researchers will disclose the methodology used to conduct the survey, including the questions asked and the results to each, so that their survey may be subject to independent examination and analysis by others\u2026. Polls paid for by candidates or interest groups may be designed to produce results that are beneficial to that candidate or group, and they may be released selectively as a campaign tactic or publicity ploy.\u201d Here\u2019s an excerpt from CNN\u2019s new standards for writing about polls: \u201cEvaluating the validity of a poll is only possible if pollsters are transparent about what they are doing. Transparency has become a critical part of how those in the survey research world assess the validity of other research ... A poll\u2019s existence alone does not make it news, and journalists shouldn\u2019t be any more credulous about numbers than they are about words.\u201d In this case, readers have no way of knowing who commissioned the poll, who conducted it, how they identified the voters they surveyed, what methodology they used to interview them or what exactly respondents were asked. That makes it basically impossible to evaluate the survey in any meaningful way. Go deeper: Beyond the questionable sourcing, the polling data provided doesn\u2019t make a clear case that white voters who aren\u2019t college graduates see Ocasio-Cortez as the face of the party. The numbers included \u2015 name recognition and favorability for Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), as well as opinions on capitalism and socialism \u2015 suggest that both congresswomen have unusually high national profiles for freshman representatives and that neither is popular among the subgroup surveyed. But those numbers don\u2019t establish whether they\u2019re seen as defining all Democrats. That\u2019s an eminently pollable question: A 2017 CNN survey, for instance, asked, \u201cThinking about Democratic leaders today\u2015which one person best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party?\u201d It also doesn\u2019t establish whether they\u2019re actually less popular than Democrats in general. The bloc polled \u2015 white voters who aren\u2019t college graduates\u2015 is Republican-leaning in general. And in one publicly available poll,\u00a0a February Economist/YouGov survey, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s net favorability rating (that is, the share who rated her favorably minus the share who rated her unfavorably) among white voters without degrees was roughly in line with ratings for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and for Democrats as a whole. That\u2019s obviously one datapoint, and a dated one at that. But it suggests that these voters tend to be consistent either in liking the Democratic Party and its politicians or in disliking them. There are a few additional hazy details in the Axios story. The headline implies that its findings reflect \u201cswing states,\u201d but the article doesn\u2019t make it clear whether the poll was conducted nationally or only in battleground states. And although the article provides exact percentages on how few of the voters polled viewed Ocasio-Cortez and Omar favorably, it doesn\u2019t include numbers on how many viewed them outright unfavorably, rather than having no opinion. The bottom line: Basing a story on unsourced, thinly contextualized polling data isn\u2019t savvy; it\u2019s deeply credulous.",

      "content": " The worst thing about touring immigrant detention facilities at the border was seeing cruelty occur under the American flags hung everywhere, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Friday while testifying on family separations and the treatment of migrants. \u201cChildren are being separated from their families in front of an American flag,\u201d the congresswoman told the House Oversight Committee as she fought back tears. \u201cWe cannot allow for this.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a fierce critic of the Trump administration, was among four Democratic members of Congress to testify before fellow lawmakers about what they saw during visits to the border. They described seeing migrants covered in filth from an inability to shower or change, with canker sores from unhealthy food, and only thin blankets for sleeping on concrete. They called on Congress to act as migrants report overcrowded facilities and little access to care or medication. The Trump administration has blamed the number of undocumented immigrants arriving at the border \u2015 which dipped last month but hit record numbers earlier this year \u2015 on loose immigration laws, demanding more funding, a border wall and legal changes to restrict access to asylum. But the Democrats argued the administration has exacerbated the crisis through its policies, including the family separations it carried out last year. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who represents a district on the border with Mexico, also testified at the hearing. \u201cThis is not a matter of resources, but a matter of will,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the power to change this. Do we have the will?\u201d She called her city, El Paso, \u201ca modern day Ellis Island.\u201d Volunteers there have helped migrants for years. Over the last year, they have ramped up efforts to feed, shelter and care for the thousands of migrant families released weekly by the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cMy community, with a fraction of the resources available to the federal government, has responded more strategically, thoughtfully and compassionately than the federal government has,\u201d Escobar said. During testimony from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), she displayed a drawing by a detained child showing people being held in a cell and asked the audience not to look away. Wiping away tears, Tlaib went on to tell the stories of the people she met at various border facilities, including one about a pregnant woman who has since been released. She also noted that 100 Border Patrol agents died by suicide from 2007 to 2018. Family separations were hard on agents as well as migrants, she said. \u201cThe dehumanization is not only with those families, but it\u2019s also with the agents that we\u2019ve told to do this to these families,\u201d Tlaib said. Describing the Trump administration\u2019s current strategy as cruel and intentional, she said it\u2019s \u201cdead set on sending a hate-filled message, that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America. In our America.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said 100 Border Patrol agents had died by suicide between 2017 and 2018. The time period was 2007 to 2018.",

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Two of the nation\u2019s best-known progressive lawmakers are set to propose a bill to declare the climate crisis an official emergency. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plan to introduce the joint resolution on Tuesday along with Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), adding momentum to a movement aimed at forcing governments to recognize the magnitude of the threat greenhouse gases pose. \u201cPresident Trump has routinely declared phony national emergencies to advance his deeply unpopular agenda, like selling Saudi Arabia bombs that Congress had blocked,\u201d Keane Bhatt, a spokesman for Sanders, said in a statement. \u201cOn the existential threat of climate change, Trump insists on calling it a hoax. Senator Sanders is proud to partner with his House colleagues to challenge this absurdity and have Congress declare what we all know: we are facing a climate emergency that requires a massive and immediate federal mobilization.\u201d The Guardian first reported the resolution on Monday. It\u2019s an entirely symbolic gesture, explicitly stating that \u201cnothing in this concurrent resolution constitutes a declaration of a national emergency for purposes of ... any special or extraordinary power.\u201d The resolution officially acknowledges the risk of continued emissions and aggregates federal scientists\u2019 forecasts of increased extreme weather and public health crises as the planet warms. It nods to the ways in which climate change exacerbates existing social inequities, such as racism and poverty. Without naming it, the resolution makes the case for the sort of Green New Deal outlined in a February resolution all three lawmakers sponsored, touting the United States\u2019 \u201cproud history of collaborative, constructive, massive-scale federal mobilizations of resources and labor in order to solve great challenges, such as the Interstate Highway System, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Reconstruction, the New Deal and World War II.\u201d On the off chance that Congress were to pass the resolution and President Donald Trump sign it, the United States would join 16 other countries and 740 local governments in declaring a climate emergency. Just last month, New York City became the largest city in the Americas to proclaim a climate emergency, following Hoboken, New Jersey, Oakland, California, and San Francisco. The fact that there\u2019s a resolution at all is a victory for advocacy groups like Climate Mobilization, which is tracking emergency declarations, and Extinction Rebellion, the activist group pushing governments to ramp up efforts to address the crisis. But, generally speaking, there are reasons to be skeptical of declaring a national emergency on climate change. In February, climate researcher Alex Trembath argued in Slate\u00a0that proclaiming climate change a national emergency threatens to give the federal government carte blanche to circumvent democracy in the name of mitigating the crisis. In The Outline, writer Casey Williams warned that such a declaration could open the door to untested, potentially disastrous geoengineering projects. \u201cRefusing a national emergency logic is not a call to \u2018do nothing\u2019; it is an insistence that climate change demands the resuscitation of democratic politics, not its suspension,\u201d he wrote.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " QUEENS, N.Y. \u2015 Less than a week after President Donald Trump told her to \u201cgo back\u201d to her country, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) returned to her home \u2014 New York City. She held a town hall in Corona, Queens \u2014 her first since the end of June. The topic of the forum, held in the auditorium of a public school, was immigration \u2015 the same issue that had landed her in the crosshairs of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Trump. But facing hundreds of her diverse and adoring constituents, some of whom held homemade signs welcoming her, the freshman congresswoman defended her progressive vision of immigration reform against attacks from both Republicans and her fellow Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re here. They sent me back to Queens \u2015 and I\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d she began with a chuckle, drawing sustained applause and shouts of \u201cwelcome home\u201d from the crowd. Ocasio-Cortez trained her fire first on Trump, arguing that his remarks revealed his racist character. \u201cAll you need to do is hear what the president did this week to know that this is not about immigration at all. Because once you start telling American citizens to quote \u2018go back to their countries,\u2019 this tells you that this president\u2019s policies are not about immigration, it\u2019s about ethnicity and race,\u201d she said. \u201cHis biggest mistake was that he said the quiet part loud.\u201d But without naming names, the New York congresswoman also acknowledged that she has been taking flak for her positions from fellow Democrats. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it real with you all, even within our party it\u2019s a difficult issue. ... One of the reasons I get in trouble is because I talk about immigration too much. It\u2019s because I try to protect our community quote-unquote too much. It\u2019s because I say that there are some things that should not be up to politics and putting kids in cages is one of them,\u201d she said, prompting loud applause. Ocasio-Cortez called for the creation of a commission \u2014 modeled after the storied commission that analyzed the causes of the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 to look into the causes and impact of the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. \u201cThat kind of study is what\u2019s going to be required in order to reunify as many children with their parents as possible,\u201d she said. In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez also proposed a similar commission to study the damage and aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In a subsequent tweet, she added an appeal for a panel to study reparations for the descendants of slaves. Rarely, if ever, has Ocasio-Cortez felt more pressure from her party leadership than in the past few weeks. At the end of June, Ocasio-Cortez and the three Democratic colleagues \u2015 Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) \u2015 who are together known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d were the only House Democrats to vote against a border funding bill backed by Speaker Pelosi and House leadership that sought to provide greater resources for federal authorities to deal with a surge of asylum-seekers at the Southern border. The congresswomen cast their votes as a matter of conscience, arguing that there were inadequate humanitarian strings attached to the new money and that border funding should be conditional on an end to practices like the detention of children. The bill passed easily, despite their opposition. The Republican Senate passed a border funding bill with none of the conditions the House approved. But rather than pass their bill again in the House and force a conference committee to draw up a compromise between the two chambers, moderate Democrats in the House led a revolt against Pelosi that forced the passage of the unamended Senate bill. Rather than publicly chide the moderates, Pelosi targeted the Squad, telling a New York Times columnist on July 6, \u201cThese people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d A war of words ensued between members of the Squad, who felt unfairly singled out, and Democratic leadership and its staffers, who are wary of the progressive primary challenges that propelled Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley to power. The tiff came to a head on July 12 when the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 official Twitter account insulted Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff and Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff retweeted it. Ocasio-Cortez defended her vote against the original House vote again on Saturday, even as she avoided reviving the now-dormant feud with Pelosi and her allies. She argued that it lacked the key humanitarian provisions, like the addition of doctors to facilities run by the Customs and Border Protection agency. \u201cI got heat from my own party for ... making that point,\u201d she said of the vote. \u201cBut if we really want to pass a humanitarian bill, then let\u2019s pass a humanitarian bill. If it\u2019s not a humanitarian bill, don\u2019t call it a humanitarian bill.\u201d The event, which was translated into Spanish, Mandarin, Bangla, Tibetan, Nepali and American Sign Language in real time, felt like a window into an alternative progressive universe where the heavily populated, diverse and more liberal communities in coastal cities actually drove the policy agenda on Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez even indulged the audience with her vision of a proactive immigration policy that does not merely react to Trump, but tears down barriers that preceded him. She called for making immigration enforcement a civil, rather than a criminal, matter once again. Her appeal echoes the message of former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino presidential candidate, who has made turning unauthorized border crossing into a civil, rather than criminal, offense a cornerstone of his campaign. \u201cEspecially when it comes to immigration ... it feels like we\u2019re always coming from a defensive place. We\u2019re just trying to protect what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about the world that we want and are fighting for.\u201d Thanks to the existence of the Senate, partisan gerrymandering in the House and exaggerated fears of a mythical conservative swing voter, Democratic leaders in Congress are often cautious to the point of inaction. They are constantly seeking a balance between policies that curb Trump\u2019s worst excesses and more milquetoast maneuvers designed not to turn off the moderate voters they believe they need to win elections. It\u2019s a reality Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged, noting that her Democratic colleagues shot down an amendment to the defense budget she proposed that would have banned U.S. troops at the Southern border. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that the committee did not issue any recommendation to members on whether to vote for the amendment because of the objections of more moderate Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee. Even if Democrats have unified control of the federal government, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that immigration policy is going to change. Because if we elect a party that thinks creating a humane border is going to lose them the election, they\u2019re not going to create that humane border.\u201d \u201cA lot of the work we need to do is cultural, because we need to make immigration policy a commonsense, non-radical thing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. Perhaps in an attempt to move that cultural needle, Ocasio-Cortez did not repeat her characterization of the border detention centers as \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d She also sought to give historical context to another town hall speaker\u2019s call to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, noting that its creation in 2003 combined many federal agencies with different functions that could easily be spun off once more. \u201cReorganizing and getting rid of DHS is not as radical as George Bush\u2019s implementation and creation of DHS,\u201d she said. Whether Ocasio-Cortez will succeed in building more support for her policy agenda inside Congress with such arguments remains to be seen. But she has a powerful campaign war chest at her disposal and \u2015 as the ecstatic throngs of supporters who came to see her on a steamy Saturday attest \u2015 she enjoys a grassroots following that is likely unparalleled in the House. To the extent that her supporters were aware of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s feud with Pelosi, they appeared to side with their congresswoman. \u201cPelosi needs to go. Her day has come and gone,\u201d said Rhoda Dunn, a real estate broker from Jackson Heights who brought a homemade \u201cWelcome Home AOC\u201d sign. Some of those in attendance were not even from the district, but had instead come from other parts of New York City to see the rockstar congresswoman in person. One such Ocasio-Cortez fan, Michael Howard, traveled from Far Rockaway, a neighborhood in southeast Queens represented by Rep. Gregory Meeks. Meeks succeeded Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez ousted in June 2018, as chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party, and is a political adversary of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s in borough politics. \u201cHer and these three other congresswomen who are trying to save this country more than anyone else in Washington, D.C. \u2015 they\u2019re like the Ninja Turtles,\u201d Howard said, referencing a popular culture franchise. \u201cAnd Bernie Sanders is Splinter,\u201d he added referencing the ninja turtles\u2019 fictional teacher.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Thursday. To respond, she attached a NowThis video of her with Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) shouting, \u201cExperience doesn\u2019t pay the bills!\u201d The video was filmed for Pay Our Interns, a nonprofit group that advocates for more paid internships in the government, for-profit and nonprofit sectors. In September, Congress approved a spending package for the 2019 fiscal year that set aside about $14 million\u00a0to pay congressional interns, the first time that the Hill allocated funds for paid internships. The House received about $8.8 million to distribute across lawmakers\u2019 offices, and the Senate got $5 million. The appropriations bill added an average of $20,000 for each House member and $50,000 for each senator to pay interns. Last month, Pay Our Interns released the results\u00a0of its House internship audit and found that only 9% of congressional offices advertise paid internships, while 61% advertise that they don\u2019t offer paid internships. \u201cMany believe our work on Capitol Hill is done because Congress appropriated the funds, but these numbers prove that our work is only beginning,\u201d Pay Our Interns co-founder Guillermo Creamer said in a June 25 statement. \u201cIt is astonishing to see that so many offices have decided not to use any of the $20,000 allocated for intern pay. What is even more alarming is the percentage of offices that provide no information about intern salaries whatsoever.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has pointedly advocated for a living wage for congressional interns. She said in December that all interns in her office would be paid $15 an hour with benefits, and announced in February that she would pay her staff no less than $52,000 a year. The amount, first reported by Roll Call, was almost unheard of for many congressional staff members in their 20s who work long hours with little to no pay.",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) served up a bit of sass in response to a news article that criticized her for spending $300 on a haircut. On Wednesday, the freshman congresswoman was targeted by conservative news outlet\u00a0The Washington Times in an article titled \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.\u201d The piece explained that Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0\u201cspent nearly $300 on her hairdo\u201d at the Last Tangle Salon in Washington, D.C., last month. The article went on to say that she \u201cshelled out $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights\u201d and that a\u00a0\u201c20% tip would have added $52 to the bill.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why hair maintenance would be news. The outlet also clearly does not understand how much it costs for a woman to get her hair done in America, as it quoted the president of Americans for Limited Government, Richard Manning, calling Ocasio-Cortez \u201cthe Eva Peron of American politics.\u201d \u201cShe preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with spending money to make yourself look better, especially as a personality who depends upon visual mediums for her power. But it is a bad look to spend hundreds of dollars to get your hair done to make a video decrying income inequality.\u201d Democratic socialist publication Jacobin tweeted about the article, quipping that it\u2019s sad to see democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u201cdo things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.\u201d On Thursday morning, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Jacobin\u2019s missive about the article with some statistics about poverty in America and how the policies of democratic socialists are not to blame. \u201cOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They\u2019re just mad we look good doing it,\u201d she wrote, accompanied by a hair toss emoji. Many people on Twitter were incredulous that the cost of the New York congresswoman\u2019s haircut was \u201cnews\u201d: Does anyone actually realize how bonkers it is to be finger wagging at AOC for not getting a $20 haircut (also fuck you, no one at Supercuts is touching my hair) while actual BILLIONAIRES paid a lower tax rate than working class people last year? THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED https://t.co/f4QryDVTSm The Washington Times piece also notes that the 29-year-old \u201ccould have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop.\u201d \u201cHer high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,\u201d reads the piece, which explains that the barbershop serves \u201cmembers of Congress and the public\u201d and charges $20 for a men\u2019s cut. Anyone who has ever been to a hair salon can tell you that a men\u2019s haircut almost always costs less than a woman\u2019s, which the article does acknowledge, even though it undercuts the main point of the piece. The absurdity of that comparison was also not lost on Twitter:",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) used part of her time questioning\u00a0Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to attempt to define the boundaries of the social giant\u2019s hands-off advertising policy in a Wednesday afternoon hearing. \u201cI just want to know how far I can push this in the next year,\u201d the congresswoman said. Facebook drew concern this month when it quietly dropped its policy banning false claims in its advertising \u2015 including political advertising \u2015 in a broad defense of free speech.\u00a0Critics expressed fears that politicians or other parties acting in bad faith could abuse the policy to spread falsehoods that could impact elections. Ocasio-Cortez quickly managed to stump Zuckerberg by asking whether she would hypothetically be allowed to run political ads claiming that Republican candidates voted for the Green New Deal, the wide-ranging environmental legislation championed by the Democrats\u2019 progressive wing. \u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d Zuckerberg responded. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to do that,\u201d she stated. \u201cI think probably,\u201d Zuckerberg ventured. The House Financial Services Committee had convened the public hearing out of concern on Facebook\u2019s proposed digital currency, Libra. But members also used their time to grill the Silicon Valley billionaire about his company\u2019s troubled record on privacy, data and the spread of misinformation. Prior to her Green New Deal scenario, Ocasio-Cortez presented Zuckerberg with another hypothetical ad that was easier for him to answer. Asked whether she could pay to target predominantly Black area codes and tell them the wrong election date, Zuckerberg replied with a definitive no. \u201cI think lying is bad, and I think that if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad,\u201d Zuckerberg told Ocasio-Cortez. He later added: \u201cIn a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying so they can judge their character for themselves.\u201d Zuckerberg clarified that calls for violence or attempts at voter suppression are not permitted on Facebook. But he did not have a straight answer on whether or not the company would take down objective lies, instead saying, \u201cit depends on context.\u201d",

      "author": "Josephine Harvey",
      "content": " Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his company\u2019s refusal to police political advertising, even as Facebook\u2019s rival Twitter announced a blanket ban on all political ads on its platform. Despite a well-publicized grilling last week by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) over Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing misleading ad campaigns from politicians, Zuckerberg has reaffirmed his stance on the topic: It\u2019s not within a tech company\u2019s mandate to stifle political speech. The Silicon Valley billionaire made his comments Wednesday in Facebook\u2019s quarterly earnings call, which happened to begin just an hour after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced his own company\u2019s policy shift. Dorsey, in a string of tweets, said Twitter would stop running political ads to limit the spread of misinformation and because the company believes political reach should be earned, not bought. In the earnings call, Zuckerberg noted that although he has considered whether Facebook should continue to carry political ads, his current decision is that the practice should not stop: \u201cRight now, the content debate is about political ads. Should we block political ads with false statements? Should we block all political ads? In a democracy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news. Ads can be an important part of voice \u2014 especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so they can get their message into debates.\u201d Last Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez fiercely questioned Zuckerberg during a congressional hearing that covered a range of issues with Facebook, including whether the company would allow a hypothetical ad pushing false claims about Republicans supporting the Green New Deal. Zuckerberg said, \u201cI think probably,\u201d and that while he was against lying in ads, it was not Facebook\u2019s call to censor political speech. Ocasio-Cortez applauded Twitter\u2019s decision this week, saying that if a company is unable to run basic fact-checking on paid political advertising, then the right call is to simply stop it altogether. Other Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden have criticized Facebook in recent weeks for permitting deliberately false or misleading advertisements. Biden\u2019s campaign cheered Twitter\u2019s move on Wednesday, as did former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign condemned the move, calling it a \u201cdumb\u201d decision that would cause the company to lose millions in potential revenue and silence conservatives.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ignited a furor among progressive activists in July when she dismissed objections about a border funding bill from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and the three other members of the \u201cSquad.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got,\u201d Pelosi said, explaining why protestations from the progressive group of freshman legislators did not faze her. Ocasio-Cortez is trying to change that calculation. On Tuesday, she became the first sitting House member to endorse Jessica Cisneros, an immigration attorney challenging Rep. Henry Cuellar, a conservative Texas Democrat, from the left. She\u2019s also endorsed Marie Newman, the progressive challenging conservative Democrat Rep. Dan Lipinski in Illinois. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to pass \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 unless the [House Democratic] caucus changes, then I need to be a part of changing the caucus. That\u2019s just how it is,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, adding that her ambitious goals for climate action also require a different kind of Democratic Party in Congress. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to die, and I want to cut our carbon emissions by 50% in 10 years.\u201d \u201cIf we want to pursue an ambitious agenda that delivers for working-class America, the Democratic Party has to change who they answer to. And they have to answer to working-class people.\u201d Without ever mentioning Pelosi, she added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because of something I said. It\u2019s because of something everybody else said: \u2018You don\u2019t have the votes, people here aren\u2019t going to support that.\u2019 Then we have to change the people who are here if we are serious about delivering for working-class people.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, of course, came in with a reputation for taking on incumbents. As a political newcomer, she launched a long-shot bid against Joe Crowley, the powerful Democratic congressman from New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District who was considered a future leader of the party. Her win shook up national politics, setting off a firestorm in Washington as party leaders grappled with what they had missed in the mood on the ground. But the victory didn\u2019t do much to endear her to some of her new colleagues. Ocasio-Cortez told HuffPost this week that she isn\u2019t afraid of making new enemies by opposing Cuellar, Lipinski and potentially others \u2015 because the ones who will be mad at her probably weren\u2019t her fans anyway. For one thing, Ocasio-Cortez maintains that many House members likely to take issue with her involvement in the race wrote her off from the moment she walked in the door. \u201cThe reception that I got here was very chilly, and that was before I did anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are folks who just weren\u2019t going to work with me, and nothing I could have done would have changed that \u2015 unless I fundamentally changed who I am.\u201d Realizing there is little she can do win over some of her fellow Democrats has freed her to pursue her vision of change with less fear of political blowback on the Hill, according to Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cIf anything, it almost created more breathing room for me, because it ... was really clarifying,\u201d she said. From the beginning, Ocasio-Cortez has pursued an \u201cinside-outside\u201d organizing strategy. She joined a climate change sit-in in Pelosi\u2019s office on her first day on Capitol Hill, but she also recognizes that she needs to have allies in the halls of Congress to move her agenda forward. She counts it as a sign of progress, for example, that the creation of a public health insurance option is now the default position of many of her moderate colleagues. And Ocasio-Cortez is quick to downplay any past differences she had with Pelosi. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s former chief of staff,\u00a0Saikat Chakrabarti, left shortly after his tweets\u00a0about other House Democrats escalated a spat between members of the Squad and party leaders. \u201cThe whole idea that there\u2019s a conflict was very overblown,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what we can accomplish given the limitations of a Republican Senate and Trump as president. People are pretty pragmatic and they\u2019re open-minded.\u201d Still, the New York congresswoman\u2019s allies privately wonder whether her independence has cost her some legislative victories. She introduced two amendments to the defense spending authorization bill in July: one barring the Department of Defense from sending U.S. troops to the border with Mexico, and another prohibiting the detention of undocumented immigrants in DOD facilities. Both amendments failed, with over 50 Democrats voting against them. Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, the group that recruited Ocasio-Cortez and is now sponsoring other challengers, acknowledged that the lawmaker is still figuring out the best way to calibrate her inside-outside strategy. \u201cAOC navigating her inside-outside strategy will be one of the defining questions of not just her political career, but of the entire progressive movement,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult path to navigate, but few have done it as well as she has with less than a year in Congress.\u201d Tellingly, perhaps, Ocasio-Cortez has yet to endorse Justice Democrats\u2019 entire slate of challengers. Even her endorsement of Cisneros came days after the establishment-minded group EMILY\u2019s List, which backs female candidates supportive of abortion rights, got behind Cisneros\u2019 candidacy. Ocasio-Cortez told HuffPost that she is limiting her involvement in primary challenges against her colleagues to heavily Democratic districts where she believes that members of Congress do not have the excuse of justifying centrist positions as politically necessary. She is fond of noting that Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump in Cuellar\u2019s district by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty modest proposal, a pretty modest ask that we consider a D+20 district to be grassroots-supported, divested of lobbyist money, to support \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis district is almost as progressive as mine. So why is there such a huge difference? Why is it so conservative?\u201d Cuellar is frequently ranked as one of Congress\u2019 most conservative Democrats. As of this Congress, he had an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association for opposing tougher gun regulations (though he has since voted to tighten background checks). He received a score of 15% from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2018, having voted for legislation that would legally treat fetuses as people. And Cuellar has received over $5.5 million in corporate PAC contributions over the course of his career. \u201cIf this is a D+20 district, what room do we give to people in a D+1 district?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked. With that in mind, the New York representative said she is equally interested in elevating Democrats in swing seats \u2015 those in the party\u2019s \u201cfrontline\u201d program for vulnerable incumbents \u2015 who have taken progressive stances that expose them to political risk. She singled out for praise Rep. Mike Levin, a California Democrat who unseated a Republican last November. Notwithstanding his \u201cfrontline\u201d status, he is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a co-sponsor of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation that would create a single-payer health care system. Levin is one of three vulnerable freshman Democrats for whom Ocasio-Cortez raised $30,000 apiece in an end-of-March fundraising appeal on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m very, very committed to not just Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, but transformational majorities in the House and Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to dedicate a lot of my time.\u201d While Ocasio-Cortez said she is a \u201cteam player,\u201d one thing she has no plans to do is pay the sum of $150,000 in \u201cdues\u201d that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee asks of rank-and-file House members. \u201cWhen I talk to frontliners about what they need, they just prefer that I give them the money,\u201d she said. Without so much as lifting a phone to call donors, Ocasio-Cortez has raised nearly $3.4 million for her reelection campaign. She may have to spend some of that money dispatching with local competition: She has already drawn 11 challengers \u2015 eight Republicans and three Democrats. However, the prospects of another Democrat, let alone a Republican, prevailing in the heavily Democratic district where she is a household name remain scant. Ocasio-Cortez declined to go into more detail about how she would use her financial resources to support people like Cisneros and Newman. A candidate\u2019s campaign can, for example, directly transfer up to $2,000 to another campaign each election cycle. \u201cA lot of those decisions are based on evolving dynamics,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much help would a given candidate need? Where can we expand the movement?\u201d Rather than setting her sights on 2020 or 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said she is trying to figure out how to shape what the country will look like in 2050. \u201cOne of the benefits of being a younger member is that I have the luxury of looking at things in terms of decades. How do we turn Tennessee blue again? How do we turn West Virginia blue?\u201d she concluded. \u201cThese are questions that seem impossible to some people because perhaps they are impossible in a cycle or two. But I think about the changes that I want to see in my life.\u201d",
