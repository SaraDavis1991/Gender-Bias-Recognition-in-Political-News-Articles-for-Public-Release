Both men died from of glioblastomas, an extremely form of aggressive brain cancer. McCain was 81; Kennedy was 77. McCain\u2019s death was jolting for those who admired both men. Kennedy\u2019s widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, honored McCain on Saturday and hailed the Vietnam veteran as an \u201cuncompromising patriot and a man of immeasurable courage.\u201d Getting to know McCain was \u201cone of the great privileges of my life, and I know my late husband, Ted, felt the same way,\u201d she said, adding that McCain\u2019s example \u201csummons us, in his memory, to live up to what is best in ourselves and to honor what is best in others.\u201d Victoria Kennedy also honored the differences between the men, noting that McCain was pleased when he successfully negotiated disagreements. He \u201cdeclared from the floor of the Senate that the proudest and most satisfying moments of his career when he worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address our greatest challenges,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThough he and Teddy had different political philosophies and were from different political parties, they both loved this country and loved each other,\u201d she said.  Others also commented on the sad coincidence, including San Francisco-based activist Barbara Townsend. Preet Bharara, former U.S. attorney from the Southern District of New York, noted that \u201chistory does rhyme.\u201d",

      "content": " With Sen. John McCain\u2019s death on Saturday, political observers have turned their attention to a replacement in the Senate. Arizona law requires Gov. Doug Ducey to select the person to fill McCain\u2019s seat. Whomever Ducey selects will face re-election in a November 2020 special election and again for the seat\u2019s regularly scheduled election in 2022. Arizona law requires that the governor appoint someone who belongs to the same party as the person who vacated the seat, meaning a Republican in this case. (Technically, the law specifies the party the person belonged to when they were elected.) In November\u2019s election,\u00a0meanwhile, the GOP faces the prospect of losing the state\u2019s other Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jeff Flake. Regardless, Arizona will have two new senators come January 2019, a marked departure from the state\u2019s outsized influence only a few years ago when it was represented by McCain and Republican Jon Kyl, who had served as minority whip during part of his long tenure in the chamber. Speculation around McCain\u2019s replacement was renewed when,\u00a0the day before he died, McCain\u2019s office announced he was discontinuing medical treatment\u00a0for an aggressive glioblastoma.

      "subtitle": "He cut off a supporter who had termed Barack Obama an Arab, but there are reasons why he needed to step in.",
      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " It was one of Sen. John McCain\u2019s finest political moments. At a rally for his presidential bid late in 2008 campaign, an audience member backing the Arizona Republican tells him she doesn\u2019t trust his opponent, then-Sen. Barack Obama and insists that the Illinois Democrat is an Arab. McCain didn\u2019t let her finish. Instead, he shook his head, took the microphone away from her and did something that would have seemed unimaginable during the most recent presidential election: He politely defended his opponent. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign issue is all about,\u201d he said, prompting applause from some other audience members at the gathering in Minnesota. The short exchange was a shining moment for McCain that gained attention at the time.\u00a0Instead of indulging in his supporter\u2019s falsehood, he corrected her and showed grace toward his political foe. And it wasn\u2019t an isolated moment. At the same rally, the crowd earlier had booed McCain\u2019s response to another supporter who said that Obama \u201ccohorts with domestic terrorists\u201d\u00a0and that Americans would have to fear an Obama presidency. McCain said Obama was a \u201cdecent person\u201d and that there would be no reason to be scared if he won the White House. McCain displayed character and civility that day, as he showed similarly throughout much of his military and political career. Clips from that rally had periodically resurfaced even before his death, as he\u00a0publicly feuded with President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2015 who in his short political career has become known for mocking and insulting his opponents and encouraging his supporters to do the same. The moments were guaranteed to be shared again following his\u00a0death on Saturday. Still, context is needed about that rally and the vitriol toward Obama that surfaced at it. McCain\u2019s campaign and his controversial running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, had disparaged Obama over his acquaintanceship with William Ayers, a domestic terrorist during the Vietnam War era, and exaggerated the link between the two. A campaign ad\u00a0from a group opposing Obama also played up the link between him and Ayers, who was part of the radical, left-wing group Weather Underground responsible for a series of bombings that happened when Obama was a child. Palin\u2019s speeches also often inspired rage, with some in her audiences yelling \u201ckill him,\u201d \u201ctreason\u201d or \u201cterrorist\u201d at the mention of Obama. Some speakers at McCain-Palin events\u00a0used his middle name, \u201cHussein,\u201d in what was clearly intended as a way to question his patriotism \u2015 and which also fueled the birther conspiracy theory. Writing about the campaign atmosphere at the time, then-New York Times columnist Frank Rich noted that when McCain, during his appearances, \u201casks the crowd \u2018Who is the real Barack Obama?\u2019 it\u2019s no surprise that someone cries out \u2018Terrorist.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis sleight of hand at once synchronizes with the poisonous Obama-is-a-Muslim e-mail blasts and shifts the brand of terrorism from [Bill] Ayers\u2019s Vietnam-era variety to the radical Islamic threats of today,\u201d Rich wrote. And even as McCain\u2019s responses to the barbs directed at Obama during the Minnesota rally 10 years ago garner renewed praise, some noted that he could have made a broader point. When the woman refers to Obama as an Arab and McCain says, \u201cNo ... he\u2019s a decent family man, citizen,\u201d without mentioning that that Arabic-speaking people can also be decent citizens.  McCain\u2019s campaign later condemned the offensive comments made at the Minnesota event, calling them\u00a0\u201cinappropriate rhetoric.\u201d Eventually, in his memoir, McCain revealed that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of then-Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who labeled himself at that point an \u201cindependent Democrat.\u201d Despite their contentious 2008 campaign, McCain and Obama maintained a mutual respect for each other. While conceding to Obama on the night of the election, McCain stopped his supporters from booing his opponent\u00a0and said he admired how Obama \u201cinspired the hopes of so many millions of Americans.\u201d McCain has reportedly asked Obama to give a eulogy at his funeral. In a statement released after McCain\u2019s death, Obama\u2019s regard for the senator was clear. \u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cAt John\u2019s best, he showed us what that means.\u201d McCain, for his part, offered a typically candid assessment when asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in 2017 how he wanted to be remembered: \u201cHe served his country and not always right. Made a lot of mistakes. Made a lot of errors, but served his country. And I hope we could add honorably.\u201d",

The two men have been political foes for several years. Trump made headlines in the summer of 2015 when he mocked McCain\u2019s military record at a political forum in Iowa, suggesting he wasn\u2019t a \u201cwar hero\u201d because he had been held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for over five years. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump said at the time.

The former Republican presidential nominee was often spoken of as a military hero, a political maverick and as someone with a bit of a temper. But he was far from a humorless politician. McCain had a great sense of humor, in fact.\u00a0Like many politicians running for president, he appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The difference with McCain, though, was that he really seemed to relish the experience, making plenty of jokes at his own expense. In one clip, seen below, McCain appears on the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d to explain to host Seth Meyers his many outlandish ideas for shoring up votes in the 2008 presidential election. They include strategies like \u201cThe Reverse Maverick,\u201d \u201cThe Double Maverick\u201d and, our favorite, \u201cThe Sad Grandpa,\u201d in which McCain is to appear on television and sadly proclaim, \u201cCome on, Obama\u2019s going to have plenty of chances to run for president \u2015 it\u2019s my turn!\u201d The Arizona senator could also dish it out, but in ways that weren\u2019t mean-spirited. During the 2008 Alfred E. Smith dinner \u2015 a tradition where both presidential candidates tell jokes and roast each other \u2015 McCain dryly (and brilliantly) overhyped then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s upcoming turn at the podium after claiming to have seen the transcript of his routine. \u201cYou are all about to witness the funniest performance in the 63-year history of this event,\u201d McCain said. \u201cLet\u2019s not add to the mounting pressure he must be feeling. Just prepare yourself for nonstop hilarity. The funniest 15 minutes of your life or any other.\u201d How do you follow that? On \u201cSNL,\u201d he usually played himself, but in this sketch parodying a Lifetime movie, McCain plays a creepy husband who wants nothing more than to be close to his darling wife, played by Amy Poehler. It\u2019s a long bit but worth watching. McCain leaves behind a celebrated legacy. He was a decorated veteran and a lifelong public servant. And, as his onetime legislative partner, the\u00a0former Sen. Russ Feingold, points out, \u201che was also really fun.\u201d It certainly looks like it.",

John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) death after reportedly turning down the release of an official White House statement celebrating his late Republican colleague as a \u201chero.\u201d The Washington Post reported Sunday that Trump decided to nix the complimentary official statement that White House aides, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, prepared for the president in the days before the late senator\u2019s death. McCain died on Saturday after he was\u00a0diagnosed about one year ago with an aggressive form of brain cancer. He was 81 years old. Instead, the president posted a brief tweet that did not praise McCain at all, writing, \u201cMy deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!\u201d The president\u2019s tweet differed significantly from the laudatory statements released by current and former government officials and staffers on both sides of the aisle, who all praised McCain as a war hero that devoted his life to public service. The Post\u2019s report that Trump deliberately avoided using a statement celebrating McCain\u2019s life comes days after Trump failed to comment on the announcement that the senator would cease treatment\u00a0for cancer, an indication that he was reaching the end of his life. The Post previously reported that Trump\u00a0did not release a statement because he did not want to comment on the Arizona Republican until after his death.\u00a0By contrast, McCain\u2019s colleagues sent messages of public support after the announcement was made on Friday. McCain and Trump\u2019s relationship has been contentious ever since the now-president insisted on the campaign trail that the senator was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he was captured. Even in the final weeks of McCain\u2019s life, Trump made his disdain for the senator clear \u2015 failing to mention the war hero during the signing of a defense bill that bore his name. Earlier this year, Trump was reportedly disinvited to McCain\u2019s funeral. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush will reportedly deliver eulogies.",

      "content": " UPDATE:\u00a04:40 p.m. \u2015 President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday afternoon that he had ordered the White House flag to be flown at half-staff until Sen. John McCain is interred this weekend. After backlash over his initial response to McCain\u2019s death, he also issued a formal statement in tribute to the late senator, saying he respected his \u201cservice to our country.\u201d PREVIOUSLY: White House flags returned to full staff on Monday after a brief tribute to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died less than two days earlier. Meanwhile, flags remained lowered at the U.S. Capitol building, just 2 miles east of the president\u2019s official residence and workplace. The buildings had lowered their flags Saturday evening following McCain\u2019s death. The White House was operating under a protocol of keeping the flag at half-staff for a day and a half following the death of a sitting member of Congress. Anything beyond that would require a presidential proclamation \u2015 a relatively simple order to draft but one that President Donald Trump does not appear to have much interest in. Presidents typically issue a proclamation when a high-profile figure dies, ordering all public buildings and military bases to fly the U.S. flag at half-staff until the day of interment. Trump did not issue a proclamation for McCain, whose body will be laid to rest Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who controls the Capitol\u2019s flags, told HuffPost in an email Monday that the flags \u201cwill remain lowered through the day of internment (sic).\u201d \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t respond to any shouted questions about McCain or others\u201d when approached by reporters Monday morning, according to a White House pool report. Trump has done little to hide his disdain for McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee and decorated Vietnam veteran. He infamously mocked McCain\u2019s military record at a political forum in Iowa in the summer of 2015, soon after announcing his bid for president. Trump suggested McCain wasn\u2019t a \u201cwar hero\u201d because he had been \u201ccaptured\u201d during the Vietnam War. McCain was held in North Vietnam as a prisoner of war for over five years after his plane was shot down while he was flying a bombing mission over Hanoi. McCain\u2019s rebuttals were often more measured than Trump\u2019s brash rhetoric.\u00a0But he frequently criticized the president\u2019s policies and tone, taking aim at Trump\u2019s friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and famously sinking legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He reportedly disinvited Trump to his funeral. Despite an outpouring of tributes from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Trump tweeted a curt statement Sunday expressing his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to McCain\u2019s family. His tweet was met with fierce backlash from veterans and media pundits, including Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. \u201cStill not a kind word about McCain himself,\u201d Hume tweeted about Trump\u2019s statement. Other Twitter users slammed Trump for using a picture of himself in his Instagram post about McCain\u2019s death. Trump\u2019s apparent refusal to honor McCain with the White House flags didn\u2019t go unnoticed on Twitter either. Trump had to get the last attack in on John McCain.  \n\nSimply disgusting.  Simply despicable!https://t.co/KmNspb10D9 The easiest way to reconcile Trump bitching about NFL players \u201cdisrespecting the flag\u201d with his refusal to dip the WH flag for McCain or the slaughtered in Jacksonville is by positing that Trump believes he is the flag, and the flag is him This story has been updated with additional context about White House flag protocol.",

      "content": " Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died Saturday at the age of 81 after a long career in public service, will be remembered in multiple ceremonies this week. The first will be in Phoenix on Wednesday, on what would have been his 82nd birthday. Officials in a number of states and municipalities have ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, including at the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings. Flags at the White House, however, were raised to full-staff less than 48 hours after McCain\u2019s death. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., on Monday\u00a0placed a portrait of McCain on its \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d wall, located on the museum\u2019s first floor. Here\u2019s a calendar of other major events that will honor McCain\u2019s life. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state in the rotunda of the Arizona state Capitol. The public can pay their respects beginning at 2 p.m. local time following a private service at 10 a.m., according to McCain\u2019s office. Arizonans will hold a memorial service for McCain at North Phoenix Baptist Church. Tickets are no longer available but the event will be livestreamed on McCain\u2019s website. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. His Senate colleagues and staff will honor him in a ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. Eastern time Friday. Members of the public will be able to enter through the Capitol Visitor Center and\u00a0pay their respects from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. McCain will become one of about three dozen people in U.S. history to be honored through this tradition, according to the Architect of the Capitol. Lying \u201cin state\u201d refers to government leaders and military members, and lying \u201cin honor\u201d refers to private citizens. Past dignitaries who have been memorialized in this way include former presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, as well as civil rights icon Rosa Parks. The most recent person to lie in honor was evangelical leader Billy Graham, who died in February. A televised funeral service will begin at 10 a.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. At McCain\u2019s request, former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u00a0are set to deliver eulogies. McCain ran presidential campaigns against both men. President Donald Trump, however, does not plan to attend. McCain reportedly did not want him there, after Trump\u2019s relentless personal attacks on McCain. McCain\u2019s family will hold a private service at his alma mater in Annapolis, Maryland, before laying him to rest at the academy\u2019s cemetery. This post has been updated with additional memorial events for McCain.",

John McCain\u00a0(R-Ariz.). The organization, also known as American Veterans, tweeted that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed in the lack of traditional and appropriate respect in the White House\u2019s reaction\u201d to the decorated Vietnam veteran\u2019s death. \u201cAMVETS is calling on the White House to show appropriate respect for the passing of Sen. McCain,\u201d AMVETS tweeted. \u201cHe was a war hero, twice a presidential contender, and a national treasure who devoted his entire adult life to protecting and improving the American way of life.\u201d Trump has faced significant backlash over his response to McCain\u2019s death. He issued a curt tweet on Sunday wishing McCain\u2019s family well, though not mentioning anything about the late Arizona lawmaker\u2019s legacy. White House flags were lowered to half-staff after McCain\u2019s death on Saturday, but returned to full-staff early Monday.\u00a0The White House was operating under a protocol of keeping the flag at half-staff for a day and a half following the death of a sitting member of Congress.

AMVETS has been critical of some Trump administration decisions previously, including the president\u2019s appointment of a Defense Department official to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs after David Shulkin was booted from the position. But the organization\u2019s flurry of tweets on Monday marks an escalation in their criticism of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the White House would mark American hero John McCain\u2019s death with a two-sentence tweet, making no mention of his heroic and inspiring life,\u201d AMVETS National Executive Director Joe Chenelly said in a statement Monday. He continued: \u201cAnd by lowering flags for not one second more than the bare minimum required by law,\u00a0despite a long-standing tradition of lowering flags until the funeral, the White House is openly showcasing its blatant disrespect for Senator McCain\u2019s many decades of service and sacrifice to our country as well as the service of all his fellow veterans.\u201d The American Legion, another prominent veterans organization, also called on Trump to issue an \u201cappropriate\u201d proclamation honoring McCain\u2019s legacy and ordering the nation\u2019s flags be lowered to half-staff through the interment of his body. \u201cThe American Legion urges the White House to follow long-established protocol following the death of prominent government officials,\u201d\u00a0Denise Rohan, national commander of The American Legion, told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cMr. President, just this year, you released presidential proclamations noting the deaths of Barbara Bush and Billy Graham,\u201d she continued. \u201cSenator John McCain was an American hero and cherished member of The American Legion.\u201d Veterans of Foreign Wars, the largest and oldest war veterans organization, also called on Trump to continue honoring McCain. \u201cThe U.S. Flag Code calls for lowering the flag to half-staff on the day of and the day after the death of a member of Congress,\u201d a VFW spokesman told HuffPost. \u201cThat the White House did on Saturday and Sunday. We have asked the White House if the honor could be extended. No response back yet.\u201d This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",

Col.\u00a0Tran Trong Duyet told Vietnam News that he felt \u201cvery sad\u201d upon learning of the death of the decorated war hero. McCain was held in captivity by the North Vietnamese in Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d by American POWs, after his plane was shot down in October 1967 during a bombing mission over Hanoi. McCain was subjected to repeated beatings and interrogations while being held captive and sustained lifelong injuries that prevented him from raising his arms above his head. \u201cI had a lot of time meeting him when he was kept in the prison,\u201d Duyet said.\u00a0\u201cAt that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance.

      "author": "Tommy Craggs",
      "content": " Here\u2019s a smarmy tweet from Matthew Dowd, who was a strategist for former President George W. Bush and who now serves as a political analyst for ABC News: The tweet is referencing the White House\u2019s decision to return its flag to full staff just two days after the death of Sen. John McCain (it would later take the flag back to half staff). The flag business had set off a great pious harrumphing among establishment types, liberal and conservative alike. Jake Tapper alone did so much garment-rending that for a minute I thought he\u2019d have to host today\u2019s show wearing nothing but a big yellow ribbon over his crotch. And here was Dowd\u2019s contribution to the discourse: a photo probably pulled off Google Images, where a version of it has been indexed via the website of South Carolina state Rep. Bill Hixon. It\u2019s not hard to see why Dowd chose this particular shot. It hits all the proper elegiac notes: the flag, the soldier, the salute, the dying sun of some alien desert. But the thing about this photo is that it\u2019s a fake. The original was photoshopped to drop the flag to half staff. The real photo can be seen here. It was taken in southern Iraq by Marine Sgt. Tisha L. Carter-Valrie. The soldier in the photo is her husband and fellow Marine sergeant, James E. Valrie, who died in 2009 after a bout with kidney cancer. The date was April 3, 2003, two weeks into a catastrophic war of which McCain was an enthusiastic salesman. The photo was quickly pressed into service of its own. The USAA put it on a postcard. KISS put it on their website. A Marine had it tattooed on his forearm. \u201cUnfortunately, with all the wonderful ways it has been used,\u201d Carter-Valrie wrote in the Los Angeles Times on the 10th anniversary of the war, \u201cthe photograph has also been manipulated and in some cases used in ways I found disrespectful.\u201d People flipped it so the flag flies in the other direction \u2014 \u201cbut by doing that,\u201d Carter-Valrie pointed out, \u201cit makes my husband look like he is saluting with the wrong hand.\u201d Nor did she like the version, spotted on an anti-war website, in which the flag was turned upside down. Nor did she like the version, sometimes disseminated on Memorial Day, in which the flag was moved to appear at half staff. That was the photo Dowd came across and circulated. People seem to like it. By 3 p.m., it had been retweeted more than 2,000 times. Carter-Valrie would not be happy if she saw it, I don\u2019t think, but that\u2019s a minor consideration when there are postures to be struck. And maybe in its fraudulence, the photoshopped image serves some larger truth. What a perfect tribute, after all\u00a0\u2014 to McCain, to the war he and Dowd\u2019s old boss wanted so badly, to the establishment ghouls who helped them sell it. A glib and phony artifact from a war sold on glib and phony pretenses.",

New Trump statement on McCain\u2019s death is still full of shade. pic.twitter.com/pa7NxIrOeh The White House garnered negative press after people noticed White House flags had returned to full staff on Monday, less than two days after McCain had died. The White House was operating under a protocol of keeping the flag at half-staff for a day and a half following the death of a sitting member of Congress. Anything beyond that would require a presidential proclamation. Prior to the statement, Trump had only tweeted his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to the McCain family. On Sunday, he turned down the release of an official White House statement that would have celebrated his late Republican colleague as a \u201chero,\u201d according to The Washington Post. Trump and the late senator from Arizona had a contentious relationship. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump attacked McCain\u2019s status as a war hero. While in office, Trump criticized McCain\u00a0again for voting against a Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year. Even in the final weeks of McCain\u2019s life, Trump made his disdain for the senator clear \u2015 failing to mention the war hero\u00a0during the signing of a defense bill that bore his name.

      "author": "Kate Sheppard",
      "content": " Climate change is one of the issues on which the late Sen. John McCain was roundly praised for bucking his party. But McCain was arguably the reason we don\u2019t have a sane climate law in place right now. The Arizona Republican\u2019s\u00a0early work on climate change with then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman (Conn.) was indeed groundbreaking, producing the 2003 and 2005 iterations of the proposed Climate Stewardship Act. While those bills had little chance of success, they were presented at a time when the George W. Bush administration was prevaricating on whether global warming was even a problem and dismissing the work of government scientists, and when fossil fuel interests were shoveling money into efforts to sway the public against taking action. McCain\u2019s work, by comparison, was respectful of science, bipartisan and forward-looking. (Inside Climate News has a thorough rundown of that work over the years, which I will not try to replicate.) Heading into the 2008 election, the fact that both major parties had put forth presidential nominees who accepted the conclusions of climate science was a notable event, though global warming remained far from a top issue in the debates. It seemed as if climate action was a given no matter who won that election, even if McCain and Barack Obama offered different approaches (and even if McCain\u2019s running mate and advisers had some interesting things to say on the issue). But then \u2026 it wasn\u2019t. Obama won, and rather than help pass an ambitious climate plan, McCain took his ball and went home. The House passed a climate bill in June 2009. But when attention finally turned to the Senate a year later, it was McCain\u2019s friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who took up the climate mantle for the Senate GOP, partnering with Lieberman (now an \u201cindependent Democrat\u201d) and John Kerry (D-Mass.). The trio seemed on pace to produce a thoroughly moderate bill that capped carbon from major emitters while giving significant handouts to polluters to ease the transition. What was McCain up to? Well, he was busy railing against Obama\u2019s climate plan as \u201cirresponsible, ill-conceived\u201d and a \u201ccap-and-tax\u201d policy rather than \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d (even though it was strikingly similar to McCain\u2019s own previous plans). He was claiming that he \u201cnever\u201d supported capping carbon emissions at a specific level, even though his past proposals did just that. McCain was staying far, far away from the first potentially viable climate bill in the Senate. He even voted for a resolution to block the Obama administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency from moving forward on its own greenhouse gas regulations. The resolution was a straightforward assault on climate empiricism \u2015 the kind of thing that McCain had once rejected. The bill would\u2019ve thrown out the underlying scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health. And then just when it seemed as if the Senate climate bill might go somewhere, Graham withdrew his participation in a spat with Democratic leaders over timing. Graham later said some utterly nonsensical things about climate change before ultimately announcing\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t even vote for the legislation he had helped author. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced a few weeks later that there was no way they had the votes to pass a cap-and-trade bill and they were abandoning the effort. It\u2019s tough to say whether McCain\u2019s supporting the legislation could have made a big difference. As an elder statesman whom Graham clearly idolized, McCain might have been able to keep him on task. And he could have brought along the Senate\u2019s other moderate Republicans, who in turn might have brought along some waffling moderate Democrats. But we won\u2019t know, because McCain abstained, and now eight years later we\u2019re even further away from a sound national climate policy. It wasn\u2019t until seven years after the bill\u2019s failure, when Donald Trump\u2019s election had so lowered the bar for conservatives that simply acknowledging the reality of climate change was reckoned an act of political bravery, that McCain, now fighting a deadly form of brain cancer, started caring about climate change again. But it\u2019s much easier to say climate change is important than it is to pass legislation to meaningfully deal with it \u2015 and it\u2019s especially easy to say it when there\u2019s no chance in hell that the sitting president is going to sign any such bill. There\u2019s a plausible counterfactual that if we\u2019d elected John McCain president in 2008 (or in 2000 even), his administration would have implemented a climate change policy and not faced the same backlash from congressional Republicans. That\u2019s fun to imagine, but what we have before us is an actual record \u2015 one in which McCain retreated from his own proclamation that \u201ctime is short and the dangers are great\u201d and allowed humanity to continue careening down a path to climate disaster.",

John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died on Saturday. The order wasn\u2019t surprising. The government lowers flags all the time when notable figures pass away. But it began a day of drama, not only for the White House but across the federal government where employees were caught up in President Donald Trump\u2019s stubbornness to pay tribute to a man who had sharply criticized him. Federal employees at three government agencies told HuffPost they received at least three emails Monday about what to do with the flag. In the morning, they were told to lower the flag to half-staff. Midday, they were told to cancel that order and raise it again. And then around 5:00 p.m., they were again told to lower it. All of them said they\u2019d never seen anything like it. Usually, flag-lowering is pretty standard \u2015 you get a notification with a start and end date. \u201cIn small towns when you lower the flag people want to know why and use it as a signal to lower their own. It put us all in a bad position to explain why we would be putting our flags back up,\u201d said one employee at a post office who had to deal with the confusion. At a U.S. Department of Agriculture facility, the manager who sent out the emails about the flags had to then follow up with clarification because she was getting backlash from employees. She clarified that she had nothing to do with the orders \u2015 they came from Washington. \u201cUnfortunately, there was no explanation attached when the order was sent,\u201d she wrote. But in Washington, it was clear what was going on. As flags around the Washington Monument were at half-staff, the flag at the White House remained defiantly at the top of the flagpole. Trump refused to lower the flag to half-staff because he didn\u2019t want to honor McCain, one of his most outspoken opponents in the Republican Party. Only later in the day, around 5:00 p.m., did Trump finally issue a proclamation ordering flags down to half-staff. He did so after significant criticism, including from the nation\u2019s largest veterans organizations. That\u2019s when federal facilities were then told to go ahead and lower the flag once more. Federal agencies said they received the guidance from the Department of Homeland Security, although that department does not actually decide what to do. They simply forward the guidance to federal facilities. Ultimately, the decision on flags is made by the White House. Trump also eventually put out a formal statement honoring McCain, which he had previously refused to do. Trump still couldn\u2019t resist taking a dig at the deceased senator, saying he respected him \u201d[d]espite our differences on policy and politics.\u201d",

John McCain in his workplace of more than three decades. McCain (R-Ariz.), a figure respected on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, died Saturday at 81. McConnell led a series of solemn tributes to the deceased senator on the floor of the Senate and used his remarks to suggest adding McCain\u2019s portrait to the Senate Reception Room, a rare honor, or renaming a hearing room after him. McConnell said the Senate is \u201ceager to work on concrete ways ... to provide a lasting tribute to this American hero long after this week\u2019s observances are complete.\u201d His suggestions skirted the idea proposed just after McCain\u2019s death by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who said the Russell Senate Office Building should take McCain\u2019s name. The building, the Senate\u2019s oldest, is named after former Sen. Richard Russell, a Georgia Democrat who held his seat for almost 40 years. His legacy is now controversial. Russell was an opponent of civil rights legislation and co-authored the 1956 Southern Manifesto, a declaration read on the Senate floor criticizing the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education ruling in favor of desegregation. He died in 1971, and the building was named after him the next year. Schumer said he planned to introduce in the Senate a resolution on renaming the building. In his remarks Tuesday on the senator\u2019s death, Schumer again raised his proposal and said he would begin circulating a letter among his colleagues that day to drum up support. Although his idea may seem a good fit, Schumer has reportedly yet to win over many Republicans in the Senate, including, apparently, McConnell, who notably did not mention the building in his planned remarks on Tuesday. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told The Washington Post, \u201cI think I\u2019d be in favor of naming almost any building for McCain, but I\u2019m not sure that I want to make a decision on a specific building at this point.\u201d Also that day, President\u00a0Donald Trump was accused\u00a0of insensitivity to McCain\u2019s death, as the flag atop the White House was returned to full staff while those at the U.S. Capitol and elsewhere around Washington remained at half-staff. Trump, a political foe of McCain, issued a statement Monday afternoon after receiving backlash to say the White House flag would remain at half-staff until McCain is interred. The\u00a0president also said, \u201cI respect Senator John McCain\u2019s service to our country,\u201d two days after issuing a very brief condolence statement on Twitter. As a reminder of McCain\u2019s absence, his desk in the Senate chamber remained empty, covered in a black cloth topped with a vase of white roses.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 A bipartisan effort to rename a Senate office building to honor Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died Saturday, is being met by opposition from some Republican senators, who expressed concern about dishonoring the legacy of the controversial man for whom the structure was named. The Russell Senate Office Building, one of three Senate office buildings near the U.S. Capitol that house member offices, was named after the late Democratic Sen. Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia in 1972. A New Deal supporter with a career that spanned four decades, he has a long list of accomplishments, among them being the chief sponsor of the National School Lunch Act, which provided free or low-cost school lunches to impoverished students. A skilled legislator and longtime friend of Lyndon Johnson, Russell served as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and at one point ran for president. But he is now most known for being an avowed segregationist and a \u201cracist,\u201d as his 76-year-old niece admitted to The Washington Post\u2019s James Hohmann, and Russell\u2019s record on civil rights is shocking today. Hohmann writes: Russell successfully filibustered anti-lynching bills. He voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he called \u201cshortsighted and disastrous.\u201d He blocked bills to eliminate poll taxes. He co-authored the \u201cSouthern Manifesto\u201d to slow the integration of public schools after the Supreme Court unanimously ordered it in Brown v. Board of Education. As a Dixiecrat \u2014 Southern Democratic politicians opposed to their party\u2019s support for civil rights \u2014 Russell openly argued the white race was superior and once vowed that he would oppose \u201cany measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our states.\u201d He later toned down his rhetoric and pinned the reason for his opposition to civil rights legislation on the less controversial states\u2019 rights. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Tuesday began circulating a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building for McCain, whose office is there, in honor of his legacy as a war hero and public servant. The effort has picked up support from many Republicans, including Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. But some Southerners expressed concern about taking Russell\u2019s name off the building, arguing that it deserves to be there, despite his opposition to civil rights. \u201cHe did so many other things,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) told reporters on Tuesday, citing Russell\u2019s creation of the school lunch program. \u201cHe was a big supporter of the Great Society, the War on Poverty. Now, we all know those things failed, but he was a big champion of them.\u201d Perdue added, \u201cThis was a guy who was a giant in the Senate. This renaming thing because of one issue, it\u2019s somewhat troubling.\u201d Perdue said he supported the creation of a bipartisan select committee of senators to recommend how best to honor McCain\u2019s legacy in Washington, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) announced on Tuesday. McConnell suggested renaming the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room after McCain, the committee\u2019s most recent chairman, or adding his portrait to the Senate Reception Room. Notably, however, McConnell did not address Schumer\u2019s proposal to rename the building. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), another influential Southerner in the Senate, said Russell was a \u201cwell respected\u201d man in the South. But Shelby said he had not made up his mind on whether to support changing the name of the Russell building. \u201cYou want to get into that, [then] you have to get into George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and most of our Founding Fathers, maybe with the exception of Hamilton. It\u2019s easy to prejudge what they should have done. We didn\u2019t live in that era,\u201d Shelby told reporters on Tuesday. When HuffPost noted that Washington and Jefferson, who both owned slaves, predated Russell by over 100 years, Shelby responded,\u00a0\u201cThey did. But so did others.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not justifying anything. I\u2019m a Southerner. I\u2019m just saying Russell was a man of his time.\u201d The junior senator from Alabama, Democrat Doug Jones, meanwhile, had a different view of Russell\u2019s legacy. As a former U.S. attorney in Alabama, Jones is known for prosecuting Ku Klux Klan members for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four African-American girls. \u201cHe certainly was a giant for sure,\u201d\u00a0Jones said of Russell. \u201cBut\u00a0I think if you go look at the overall body of work, it would be good to see [McCain\u2019s name on the building].\u201d",

Several sources, including Carla Eudy, a fundraiser and McCain family friend who helped plan the services, told People magazine on Wednesday that an invitation had \u201cnot [been] extended\u201d to the former Alaska governor. NBC News\u2019 Kelly O\u2019Donnell also reported\u00a0the snub. A \u201cPalin family source\u201d told O\u2019Donnell that \u201cout of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point.\u201d \u201cThe Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear,\u201d the source added. It\u2019s not clear why Palin was not invited to the services. As People noted, McCain had, in a documentary and book released in May,\u00a0expressed regret for choosing Palin as his 2008 running mate instead of Joseph Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut. Reacting to the news, Palin told the UK\u2019s Daily Mail that it felt like a \u201cperpetual gut-punch\u201d whenever she heard of McCain\u2019s supposed second-thoughts. She said,\u00a0however, that she would not believe the comments unless she heard it firsthand from her former running mate. \u201cI attribute a lot of what we\u2019re hearing and reading regarding McCain\u2019s statements to his ghostwriter or ghostwriters,\u201d Palin said, adding:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know unless I heard it from Sen. McCain myself.\u201d After news broke of McCain\u2019s death on Saturday, Palin had nothing but praise for her late colleague: Several dignitaries, including the two men who bested McCain in his two bids for president, have been invited to attend the late senator\u2019s funeral and memorial services this week. Former President Barack Obama, who beat McCain and Palin in 2008, will be speaking at the late senator\u2019s funeral service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. George W. Bush, who won the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 after a heated primary race against McCain, has also been invited to give a eulogy. Palin, however, won\u2019t be the only conspicuous absence at McCain\u2019s funeral and memorial services. President Donald Trump has also not been invited to attend.",

John McCain. \u201cIt bothers me greatly when the president says things about John McCain.

He was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017 after a routine physical revealed a blood clot over his left eye. His family announced he was\u00a0discontinuing his cancer treatment\u00a0just days before his death. Graham and McCain had been close friends in the Senate. Trump and McCain, however, have had contentious interactions since the 2016 presidential campaign. Many people criticized Trump\u2019s tweet about McCain\u2019s death, saying it was delayed, simplistic and neglected to mention any of McCain\u2019s achievements for the country. Trump also drew criticism for not calling for flags to be lowered to half-staff and kept there until McCain\u2019s burial. The White House initially returned its flag to full-staff on Monday, following the minimum protocol for the death of a sitting member of Congress, though a presidential proclamation for keeping flags at half-staff longer is typically issued when a high-profile figure dies. On that front, Graham told Dickerson that he \u201ccalled some people around\u201d Trump to right the wrong and get the flag lowered again. On Monday afternoon, Trump issued a proclamation to keep flags at half-staff until McCain\u2019s Sunday burial, and the White House flag was lowered again. Additionally, Graham said he told Trump that he could learn a thing or two from McCain. \u201cJohn McCain was a big man, worthy of a big country. Mr. President, you need to be the big man that the presidency requires,\u201d Graham said he told him.",

      "author": "Doha Madani",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden honored the memory of Sen. John McCain at a memorial service at the North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona on Thursday. Biden gave an emotional eulogy for McCain, who died at the age of 81 on Saturday after a battle with brain cancer. They had a decadeslong friendship that began in the early days of their time in Washington. The former vice president\u2019s speech was a powerful reflection on McCain\u2019s life and legacy as the nation mourns his loss. \u201cTo paraphrase Shakespeare, we shall not see his like again,\u201d Biden said. Here are some of the most heartbreaking moments of Biden\u2019s eulogy.  McCain and Biden were both young men who experienced hardship and loss early in their lives. McCain endured torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam while he was serving the Navy. Biden lost his first wife and their young daughter in a car crash in 1972, just a month after winning his first Senate race in Delaware. Both men met shortly after their personal tragedies, when McCain served as a Navy liaison for the Senate, but they never touched on their pasts, Biden said. \u201cAnd we would sit on that plane, late into the night while everyone else was asleep, and just talk, getting to know one another,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019d talk about family. We\u2019d talk about politics. We\u2019d talk about international relations. We\u2019d talk about promise.\u201d \u201cWe talked about everything but captivity and the loss of my family, which had just occurred, my wife and daughter,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe only two things we didn\u2019t talk about.\u201d  Biden recounted the years early in his career that he spent getting to know McCain, telling the crowd they \u201cjust hit it off.\u201d The former vice president told stories of the friendship McCain had with Biden\u2019s sons and second wife, Jill Biden. \u201cAs a young man, he\u2019d come up to my house, he\u2019d come to Wilmington, and out of this grew a great friendship that transcended whatever political differences we had or later developed. Because above all, we understood the same thing. That all politics is personal. It\u2019s all about trust. And I trusted John with my life,\u201d Biden said. Beau Biden, one of Joe Biden\u2019s children, died in 2015 from glioblastoma, the same rare brain cancer that McCain was diagnosed with last year. The former vice president spoke candidly about something universal: how much cancer sucks. \u201cWe both knew then from our different experiences ... that there are times when life can be so cruel \u2014 pain so blinding, it\u2019s hard to see anything else,\u201d Joe Biden said. \u201cThe disease that took John\u2019s life, took our mutual friend Teddy [Kennedy]\u2019s life nine years ago, and three years ago, it took my beautiful son Beau\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s brutal, it\u2019s relentless, it\u2019s unforgiving. And it takes so much from those we love and the families who love them that in order to survive, we have to remember how they lived, not how they died,\u201d Biden continued.  In his speech, Biden captured the feeling of grief, describing the absence of McCain as \u201call consuming.\u201d Biden addressed the McCain family directly on what they may be feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s like being sucked into a black hole inside your chest, and it\u2019s frightening,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I know something else, unfortunately, from experience: that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say or do to ease the pain right now. But I pray you take some comfort knowing that because you shared John with all of us your whole life, the world now shares with you the ache of John\u2019s death.\u201d  Biden managed to bring some levity to his emotional speech, telling stories of times the two senators would talk to each other in a brutally honest fashion. \u2033Whenever I was in trouble, John was the first guy there, and I hope I was there for him. And we never hesitated to give each other advice,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019d call me in the middle of a campaign and say, \u2018What the hell did you say that for? You just screwed up, Joe.\u2019\u201d They always had each other\u2019s backs, Biden said. There has been an outpouring of kind words about McCain in recent days from Democrats and Republicans alike. Biden said on Thursday that the senator\u2019s death has been felt so resoundingly because of how McCain\u2019s love of his country gave Americans \u201cconfidence.\u201d \u201cJohn believed so deeply and passionately in the soul of America. His faith in the core values of this nation made them somehow feel it more genuinely themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHis conviction that we as a country would never walk away from the sacrifices generations of Americans have made to defend liberty and dignity around the world it made Americans proud of themselves. His belief \u2014 and it was deep \u2014 that Americans can do anything, withstand anything, achieve anything was both unflagging and ultimately reassuring.\u201d  Biden ended his speech by addressing McCain\u2019s family. He told McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, that the late senator \u201cowed so much of what he was to you.\u201d And then Biden spoke directly to McCain\u2019s children. \u201cYou may not have had your father as long as you would have liked, but you got from him everything you need,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo pursue your own dreams. To follow the course of your own spirit. You are a living legacy \u2014\u00a0not hyperbole. You are a living legacy, living proof of John McCain\u2019s success.\u201d  Watch Biden\u2019s full eulogy below.",

Asked if he had bungled his response to the death of McCain, with whom he\u2019d clashed throughout his presidency, Trump replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I did at all.

According to a report in The Washington Post, Trump issued that tweet in lieu of a complimentary official statement that White House aides, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, had prepared for the president shortly before McCain\u2019s death from an aggressive form of brain cancer. Trump also wouldn\u2019t answer Bloomberg\u2019s questions as to whether he thought McCain would have been a better president than Barack Obama, who beat the late senator in the 2008 election. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on it,\u201d he said as Huckabee Sanders reportedly stared at him in the room. \u201cI have a very strong opinion, all right.\u201d Huckabee Sanders must be \u201chaving a nervous breakdown\u201d over his response, Trump joked.",

      "content": "The late Sen. John McCain was honored by his congressional colleagues and members of the public at the U.S. Capitol on Friday. The senator from Arizona became the 31st person to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, according to the Architect of the Capitol website, which says the country\u2019s \u201cmost eminent citizens\u201d are given the honor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the most memorable moments from the ceremony. The skies were clear in Washington until about 10 minutes before the honor guard carried McCain\u2019s casket into the Capitol. New York Times reporter Emily Cochrane said, \u201cOne woman described it as \u2018the heavens are weeping.\u2019\u201d President Donald Trump \u2015 who was not invited to McCain\u2019s memorial \u2015 said in a statement Monday that he asked Vice President Mike Pence to give an address at the ceremony. \u201cFor 35 years, John served in these very halls under this very dome. And he fought for what he believed in,\u201d Pence said at the service. \u201cIn my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn\u2019t always agree either. And he almost always noticed. But his support for limited government, for tax reform and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure. And he will be missed. As President Trump said yesterday, we respect his service to the country.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also spoke. \u201cHe had America\u2019s fighting spirit,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI will miss a dear friend whose smile reminded us that service is a privilege.\u201d McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) participated in a joint wreath laying. CNN reported that McCain \u201cexpressly wanted Schumer, a Democrat, so he and McConnell jointly laid the Senate wreath.\u201d McCain will also be remembered at a memorial service at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral on Saturday.\u00a0His body will be laid to rest Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

He was a congressman. He was a senator. He was a nominee for president of the United States,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThese are all the titles on a wall of a life well lived. He was a great man.\u201d In an extraordinarily rare moment, the entire cathedral burst into applause as she declared\u00a0\u201cthe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\u201d The declaration appeared to be a direct dig at President Donald Trump \u2015 who did not attend the service \u2015 and his campaign slogan. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were in attendance. \u201cThe America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. She is resourceful, confident and secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she is strong. America does not boast because she has no need to,\u201d she declared. The 33-year-old went on to share her own loving relationship with her father, who she said never used his many accomplishments, pains and sacrifices as a means to make her feel small but used his greatness to raise her up, just as he did for others. \u201cJohn McCain was defined by love,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my father got sick, when I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy he said, show them how tough you are. That is what love meant to John McCain.\u201d \u201cAll that I am, all that I hope, all that I dream is grounded in what you have taught me,\u201d she said. \u201cDad, your greatness is woven into my life, it is woven into my sister\u2019s life, and it is woven into my brothers\u2019 lives, and it is woven into the country.\u201d",

The Democrat eulogized the late Arizona senator, his Republican opponent in the 2008 presidential election, during McCain\u2019s funeral on Saturday at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Obama,\u00a0reportedly listed in the program as McCain\u2019s friend, called him a man of passion who had the best interests of the country at heart, even when he was wrong. \u201cTo know John was to know that as  quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe knew more than most his own flaws, his blind spots. And he knew how to laugh at himself, and that self-awareness made him all the more compelling.\u201d Obama mentioned the recently resurfaced video from the 2008 campaign in which his then-rival defended him after a woman said she could not trust Obama because he is an \u201cArab.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d McCain responded. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d Obama said McCain\u2019s actions in that moment didn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cAs Joe Lieberman said, it was John\u2019s instinct,\u201d Obama said, referring to McCain\u2019s friend and former colleague in the Senate, who also delivered a eulogy. \u201cI never saw John treat anyone different because of their race or religion or gender, and I\u2019m certain that in those moments referred to during the campaign, he saw himself as defending America\u2019s character, not just mine.\u201d Obama said that in a time of political upheaval, it\u2019s important to rise above the easy route of anger. \u201cSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that. ... What better way to honor John McCain\u2019s life of service than, as best we can follow his example, to prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved to the few, it is open to all of us. In fact, it is demanded of all of us as citizens of this great republic.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cThere are some things worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are deeply in his debt.\u201d",

He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country,\u201d the 43rd president said during a memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington. \u201cHe was courageous, with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen. He was honest, no matter who it offended \u2015 presidents were not spared,\u201d he said, drawing laughs. \u201cBack in the day, he could frustrate me, and I know he\u2019d say the same thing about me,\u201d he said, appearing to draw a laugh from McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain. \u201cBut he also made me better.\u201d Former President Barack Obama echoed a similar sentiment during his own eulogy at the service, stating that McCain \u201cmade us better presidents \u2014 just as he made the Senate better. Just as he made the country better.\u201d President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2015 who appeared to be a target of many of the service\u2019s eulogies \u2015 clashed with McCain during his presidency and did not attend the service. Bush, who successfully ran against McCain for the White House in 2000, emphasized that it was the Vietnam veteran\u2019s loyalty to his country and respect to his fellow human being, whether it\u2019s friend or foe, that made him so great. \u201cHe was honorable. Always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings. He loved freedom with a passion of a man who knew its absence. He respected the dignity inherent in every life, a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots; there was something deep inside of him that made him stand up for the little guy, to speak for forgotten people, in forgotten places.\u201d Bush concluded his speech by stating that though the senator \u201chas moved on,\u201d\u00a0his legacy will continue. \u201cHe would probably not want us to dwell on it, but we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure, and we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequal.\u201d",

At the service in Washington, D.C., Saturday, former U.S. presidents and first ladies sat upfront together, and the cameras caught what looked like a sweet moment between Michelle Obama and the Republican president her husband replaced. George W. Bush, it appears, snuck the former first lady a piece of candy he got from wife, Laura Bush. The two couldn\u2019t seem more opposite. Obama\u2019s husband, former President Barack Obama, largely ran against the policies of Bush \u2015 including the disastrous Iraq War \u2015 when campaigning for president in 2008. But it appears that time has softened the relationship between Bush and the Obamas \u2015 or Michelle, anyway. The two have been known to share what look like genuinely friendly moments when appearing together. Here they are attending a 2015 event in Alabama to mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches from Selma to Montgomery. In 2016, they had another camera-ready moment when Obama wrapped her arms around Bush during the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Not the most important news story, but these two seem to have some chemistry.",

      "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Sen. John McCain\u2019s final journey ended Sunday on a grassy hill at the U.S. Naval Academy within view of the Severn River and earshot of midshipmen present and future, and alongside a lifelong friend. A horse-drawn caisson carrying the senator\u2019s casket led a procession of mourners from the academy\u2019s chapel to its cemetery following a private service. The senator\u2019s widow, Cindy, and his children were among those who walked behind the caisson. Joining them were family and friends as well as members of McCain\u2019s Class of 1958, military leaders and academy midshipmen. About 4 p.m. a flyover of military aircraft honored the Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam and held more than five years as a prisoner of war. After the American flag was removed from the casket, a grieving Cindy McCain pressed her check to its surface and McCain sons Jimmy and Jack shared a hug. The burial was private as per the wishes of McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential nominee died Aug. 25 from brain cancer at age 81. Vehicles that had carried mourners began leaving the area between 4:30 and 5 p.m. One scheduled speaker at the service, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said before the service that he would tell the audience that \u201cnobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten.\u201d Also expected to pay tribute were David Petraeus, a retired general and former CIA director, and McCain\u2019s son Jack. As the hearse carrying McCain passed through a gate and into the academy, there was loud applause from the several hundred people lining the street outside on the hot and muggy summer day. Many held their hands over their hearts and waved American flags. Some shouted, \u201cGod bless you.\u201d People in the crowd held signs that read \u201cSenator John McCain Thanks For Serving! Godspeed\u201d and \u201cRest In Peace Maverick.\u201d For his final resting place, McCain picked the historic site overlooking the Severn River, not Arlington National Cemetery, where his father and grandfather, both admirals, were buried. Years ago Chuck Larson, an admiral himself and an ally throughout McCain\u2019s life, reserved four plots at the cemetery \u2014 two for McCain and himself, and two for their wives, now widows. Larson died in 2014, and McCain wrote in a recent memoir that he wanted to be buried next to his friend, \u201cnear where it began.\u201d Among the pallbearers on a list provided by McCain\u2019s office were Frank Gamboa, his academy roommate; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; and two men who were POWs with McCain in Vietnam, John Fer and Everett Alvarez Jr. Tributes to McCain began Wednesday in Arizona and continued for the remainder of the week. On Saturday, speeches by his daughter Meghan and two former presidents \u2014 Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama \u2014 remembered McCain as a patriot who could bridge painful rivalries. While their remarks made clear their admiration for him, they also represented a repudiation of President Donald Trump\u2019s brand of tough-talking, divisive politics. Trump and McCain were at odds during the 2016 campaign and for much of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain,\u201d said Graham, R-S.C. \u201cNo. 1, Americans appreciate military service. ... If you work hard and do your homework and know what you\u2019re talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you\u2019ll be remembered,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That\u2019s the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do we remember this man? Because of the way he conducted his public life.\u201d",

According to the Arizona Republic, he has agreed to serve at least through the end of this year. If Kyl chooses to step down at that point, Ducey will have to name another successor. Kyl said he would not run for the seat in 2020. Kyl\u00a0joined top K Street firm Covington & Burling\u00a0shortly after his retirement in 2013, and was recently\u00a0retained by Facebook\u00a0to help the social media network combat partisan bias in its news distribution. Ducey contacted Kyl in the hours after McCain\u2019s death on Aug. 25 to see if he\u2019d return to Capitol Hill. The governor said in his statement he was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and former colleague McCain. \u201cEvery single day that Jon Kyl represents Arizona in the United States Senate is a day when our state is being well-served,\u201d the statement read.

Politico reported that the NRCC did not ask the family or friends of the lawmaker for approval to use his words. A spokesman for the group defended the spots, saying in a statement to CNN that the Kirkpatrick ad \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d McCain died last month at the age of 81 after battling brain cancer.

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " A Democratic candidate for a California House seat invoked the name of a prominent Republican senator who famously rejected an Islamophobic attack to slap down a similar narrative being used against him by the GOP incumbent. \u201cThe first thought that came to mind ... is that Republican John McCain would be rolling in his grave today if he saw this ad,\u201d\u00a0Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar\u00a0told ABC News on Wednesday about his opponent\u2019s attempt to link him to terrorism. His reference was to a 2008 campaign moment when McCain, then the GOP presidential nominee, defended Democratic opponent Barack Obama against a voter who said he was an \u201cArab.\u201d McCain died in August. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.),\u00a0Campa-Najjar\u2019s opponent, is facing a tough battle for re-election in a conservative district near San Diego after being indicted in August on charges of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds for personal expenses. He has enlisted his father, a longtime former congressman himself, and several retired Marine Corps generals to accuse Campa-Najjar of sympathizing with terrorists. Hunter\u2019s campaign further claimed in an ad that Campa-Najjar changed his name to hide his family\u2019s connection to terrorism, and portrayed him as a Muslim radical who would \u201cinfiltrate\u201d Congress and present a threat to national security. \u201cMore than any poll ... that ad shows you that I\u2019m not a threat to national security, but I sure as heck am a threat to Duncan Hunter\u2019s seat,\u201d\u00a0Campa-Najjar added in the ABC News interview. Campa-Najjar, 29, who is of Palestinian and Latino descent, would be among the youngest members of Congress if elected in November.\u00a0He previously worked in Obama\u2019s administration as a Labor Department public affairs officer, where he carried a federal security clearance. He\u2019s also Christian. Hunter\u2019s attacks reach into Campa-Najjar\u2019s controversial family history, including the participation of his grandfather,\u00a0Yasser al-Najjar, in the deadly attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\u00a0Campa-Najjar said he never knew his grandfather, who was killed by Israeli agents 16 years before the candidate was born. He has condemned the Munich attack and said he shouldn\u2019t be judged by his family member\u2019s actions. Hunter Sr., the GOP congressman\u2019s father, spoke to reporters in front of a retired aircraft carrier in downtown San Diego earlier this week to lay out his case against Campa-Najjar. Holding up poster boards featuring images of Campa-Najjar\u2019s family, the former congressman accused the Democrat of ongoing ties to his father, a former member of the Palestine Liberation Organization. \u201cVery simple, this has nothing to do with race, it has to do with terrorism,\u201d Hunter Sr.\u00a0told reporters. \u201cThis is terrorism.\u201d Campa-Najjar, listening quietly nearby, shook the former congressman\u2019s hand after the presentation said he is all but estranged from his father. \u201cDuncan Hunter Jr. can\u2019t stand on his own two feet like a grown man and fight his own battles,\u201d\u00a0Campa-Najjar said. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand next to me.\u201d",

During a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d segment, Davidson joked that Crenshaw, who lost his eye during an explosion in Afghanistan in\u00a02012, looked like \u201ca hitman in a porno movie.\u201d McCain, whose father, Senator John McCain, was permanently injured in a Vietnamese prison for POWs, tweeted on Sunday that Davidson\u2019s joke was \u201cincredibly tone-deaf\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d to veterans. McCain further elaborated her disgust at Davidson on \u201cThe View\u201d Monday. \u201cI had such a problem with this over the weekend,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI\u2019m not a snowflake, I can laugh at jokes.\u201d Although Davidson has said losing his father, a New York City fireman, on 9/11 has inspired an interest in comedy that pushes buttons, McCain said that was no excuse. \u201cI would think if your father died in 9/11, I don\u2019t know his story, but maybe you would be more empathetic to people who sacrificed,\u201d McCain said. She then suggested that Davidson was only targeting Crenshaw because he\u2019s a Republican. \u201cI will say that if it were Tammy Duckworth, who is also a hero, as well, and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, if someone had been making fun of her, I don\u2019t know if we would have the same reaction,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s a Republican, but the response was, conservatives are angry.\u201d Whoopi Goldberg said the real issue was the joke just wasn\u2019t that funny, but\u00a0McCain claimed Davidson didn\u2019t have the standing to mock veterans like Crenshaw. \u201cHe said that\u2019s how he deals with it, and that\u2019s fine if he finds catharsis in comedy, which a lot of people do, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to take shots at someone else\u2019s service and people\u2019s physical pain,\u201d McCain said. Joy Behar disagreed. \u201cHe has a right to do it. You have a right to speak out against it.\u201d You can see the complete segment below: (h/t: RawStory)",

      "content": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who rocketed to the national spotlight when his Congresswoman wife Gabrielle Giffords was shot in a failed assassination attempt, announced Tuesday he\u2019s running to finish John McCain\u2019s last term in the U.S. Senate. Kelly is a top Democratic recruit to take on Republican Martha McSally in one of the most closely contested Senate races of the 2020 election. McSally is a former Republican congresswoman who was appointed to McCain\u2019s seat last year after she narrowly lost to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. McSally leaned heavily on her record as the first woman to fly a combat mission as a fighter pilot, but she was hurt by her embrace of President Donald Trump. If Kelly is nominated, the race would pit a Navy veteran and astronaut against a trailblazing Air Force pilot in the contest to replace McCain, a legendary Navy flyer who was famously shot down and held captive. Democrats are eagerly watching the Arizona contest, having already defeated McSally in a Senate race just a few months ago. Kelly and Giffords have for years pushed Congress to enact gun control measures with little success. They shifted their focus to state legislatures in recent years, helping to strengthen background checks and domestic violence protections, among other modest protections Gov. Doug Ducey appointed McSally to the vacant Senate seat after his first appointee, former Sen. Jon Kyl, resigned after only a few months in office. The seat is a top target for Democrats because McSally just lost a Senate race in November and Democrats posted a strong showing in the November election, winning three statewide contests and picking up legislative and congressional seats. The 2020 election will decide who finishes the last two years of McCain\u2019s term. The winner would have to run again for a full six-year term in 2022. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego of Phoenix is also considering a Senate run, which would likely set up a tough fight for the Democratic nomination. Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a lifelong Republican who became a Democrat and a fierce critic of Trump, announced last week that he won\u2019t run, saying he didn\u2019t want to fight in a contested Democratic primary.",

      "content": " Meghan McCain had no time for President Donald Trump sending a tweet on Wednesday that boasted about his visit to Hanoi, Vietnam, for his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The daughter of the late war hero, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) bluntly responded to Trump bragging that he\u2019d spent more time in the country than Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who came under fire in 2010 for suggesting he served in Vietnam while a member of the Marine Corps Reserve. \u201cI have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHis war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud \u2015 he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!\u201d Meghan McCain, a panelist on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d responded on Twitter with a sobering question. \u201cHave you taken a trip to the Hanoi Hilton yet?\u201d she wrote, referring to the term U.S. captives used for the jail where her father was held as a prisoner of war and tortured by the North Vietnamese for more than five years. Trump and the late senator often clashed, with the president sparking controversy early in his presidential campaign by saying that McCain was not a war hero because he was captured. When McCain died in August after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Trump was excluded from the\u00a0invitation list the senator had prepared for his funeral. Following McCain\u2019s death, flags at the White House flew at half-staff for only one-and-a-half days while flags remained lowered for several more days at the U.S. Capitol. A swift backlash prompted the president to order the White House flags lowered until McCain was interred. Hours after Trump sent his tweet attacking Blumenthal, the president\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified to Congress that the president suggested during a conversation with him that he purposefully avoided the draft for the Vietnam War. Trump was deferred from the military draft because of bone spurs in his heels. Cohen told a House committee on Wednesday that though Trump claimed the bone spurs gained him the deferment, \u201cwhen I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He finished the conversation with the following comment: \u2018You think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u2019\u201d The daughters of the podiatrist who diagnosed the president with the bone spurs in 1968 told The New York Times in December that their father did so as \u201ca favor\u201d to Trump\u2019s father.",

Right-wing firebrand Michelle Malkin told the CPAC crowd that she blamed congressional Democrats and Republicans \u2015 including \u201cthe ghost of John McCain\u201d \u2015 for failing to enact stricter immigration legislation. \u201cRemember when Congress promised that they were going to enact a nationwide visa entry-exit system to track legal short-term visa holders?...\u00a0One has yet to be built ... Both parties are to blame,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m looking at you retired (House Speaker) Paul Ryan. And yes, I\u2019m looking at you (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell. And yes, I\u2019m looking at you, Bush family. And yes, I\u2019m looking at you, the ghost of John McCain.\u201d The crowd cheered loudly, with some giving her a standing ovation, as Malkin called out the members of the Republican establishment and ended with the mention of McCain, who died last year after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. McCain was often the focus of criticisms from President Donald Trump, who stirred controversy early in his White House campaign when he said the longtime Arizona senator was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he was captured during the Vietnam War. McCain left the president off the list of people he wanted to attend his funeral; he asked former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush to eulogize him instead. After Malkin\u2019s remarks made headlines, McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, responded to the conservative pundit. \u201cYou never knew Sen. John McCain,\u201d McCain wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou should be so lucky.\u201d Malkin\u2019s comments were echoed as the conference concluded when Fox News host Jeanine Pirro said the pundit was right to call out McCain and other Republican leaders. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan also made her disdain for those comments known. The \u201cView\u201d co-host responded to conservative podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey on Sunday, accusing Malkin and Pirro of using \u201cthe ghost\u201d of her late father as \u201cghoulish and deeply disturbed political propaganda.\u201d This story has been updated with a response from Meghan McCain.",

Malkin accused journalists of trying \u201cto turn it into a stupid catfight rather than talking about the real problem that there has been and the fight that\u2019s going on on immigration.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always had my heart in the place of the grassroots of the conservative movement, not the Republican Party,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is that the ghost of John McCain and all of the other big business, Chamber of Commerce-type of Republicans that have been selling out the American people, that\u2019s where the Republican Party needs to reconnect, and they can\u2019t simply rely on the Democrat Party falling apart.\u201d During her CPAC talk, Malkin called for immigration reform, railing against the development of sanctuary cities, which she laid to several politicians including \u201cthe ghost of John McCain,\u201d whom she named while pointing skyward.

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Sunday attacked the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Twitter for the second time this weekend, accusing him of sharing the infamous Russia dossier with the media and mocking him over his academic record at the U.S. Naval Academy. The president falsely claimed recently unsealed court documents proved McCain sent the dossier, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele and alleged Russia has salacious material about Trump that could be used for blackmail, to the FBI and media ahead of the 2016 election. \u201cHe & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual),\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. Court documents actually revealed David Kramer, a former State Department official and McCain associate, shared the dossier with several media outlets in December 2016 \u2015 after Trump won the presidency. No evidence has surfaced that McCain himself leaked the unconfirmed dossier to the press, which he denied doing. He confirmed in his 2018 memoir that he gave the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in December 2016. Kramer\u2019s role in disseminating the dossier was disclosed in a recently unsealed transcript of a court deposition he gave in December 2017. Trump has repeatedly claimed the dossier was \u201cfake\u201d and \u201ctotally discredited,\u201d though many of its claims have been proven at least partially true. Trump also used his Sunday tweet to knock McCain\u2019s grades when he was a student decades ago at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, claiming he was \u201clast in his class.\u201d McCain, who died in August 2018 after a more than year-long fight with brain cancer, graduated fifth from the bottom\u00a0of his class in 1958. \u201cI was something of a discipline problem to begin with,\u201d McCain had said of his time at the academy. \u201cThe problem being, I didn\u2019t like discipline.\u201d Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, recently revealed in congressional testimony that during the 2016 presidential campaign, he made threats on behalf of his boss to schools Trump had attended to prevent them from releasing his academic record to the public. Trump on Saturday quoted Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation resulted in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, as calling the Russian dossier \u201ca very dark stain\u201d against McCain. \u201cHe had far worse \u2018stains\u2019 than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years campaigning to repeal and replace,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to McCain\u2019s vote against the GOP bill to kill the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and one of the late senator\u2019s children, tore into Trump over his tweets. \u201cNo one will ever love you the way they loved my father,\u201d she tweeted on Saturday. \u201cI wish I had been given more [Saturdays] with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d She posted another response on Sunday that said, \u201cMy father lives rent free in your head.\u201d She later deleted the tweet. In an apparent reaction to the TV personality\u2019s words, Trump retweeted a message on Sunday penned by one of his supporters. \u201cMillions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain,\u201d the tweet read. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close friend of McCain\u2019s, defended his former colleague\u2019s legacy on Sunday. \u2033[McCain] stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history of the body,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished.\u201d Graham had been an outspoken Trump critic before becoming one of the president\u2019s most high-profile supporters in recent months, sparking confusion and anger from some of those who, like him, had been staunch McCain allies. Trump and McCain, the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, frequently butted heads over the last few years. Trump, who avoided military service multiple times as a young man, infamously mocked the decorated Navy veteran for having been held as a prisoner of war for over five years during the Vietnam War. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), during an appearance Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d called on Trump to apologize for his tweets attacking McCain. \u201cI\u2019ve long thought that his personal and direct attacks on Sen. McCain was one of the most detestable things about President Trump\u2019s conduct as a candidate,\u201d Coons said. \u201cI frankly think that the president\u2019s continued attacks on the now late Sen. John McCain is something that is regrettable.\u201d This story has been updated to include Graham\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s retweet.",

      "content": " Sen. Johnny Isakson\u00a0of Georgia, breaking with a silence adopted by virtually all of his GOP colleagues, tore into President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0for his recent attacks on the late Sen. John McCain\u00a0nearly seven months after the Arizona Republican\u2019s death. In an interview published Wednesday in The Bulwark, a news outlet recently established by conservative critics of Trump, Isakson said \u201cAmerica deserves better\u201d than the president\u2019s persistent assaults on McCain. \u201cI just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better,\u201d he told the website. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s president of United States, owns all the real estate in New York, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. Nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us.\u201d He also said McCain \u201cwas better than I am, and I know it. John was the best of my generation. John McCain was and is a great human being.\u201d Isakson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, doubled down on his criticism of Trump in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting\u2019s \u201cPolitical Rewind\u201d program, calling the president\u2019s recent attacks on McCain \u201cdeplorable.\u201d \u201cYou may be a Republican, you may be a Democrat \u2015 we\u2019re all Americans,\u201d Isakson said. \u201cWe should never reduce the service that [veterans] give to this country.\u201d Asked during the radio interview if he believes Trump is unstable, Isakson skirted a direct answer, saying he respects the office of the presidency \u201cno matter who\u2019s in it.\u201d Trump, after a series of weekend tweets assailing McCain,\u00a0on Tuesday told reporters he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of McCain,\u00a0who died last August after battling brain cancer. The president slammed the lawmaker for helping to kill a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. \u201cI think that\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Trump said ahead of a joint press conference at the White House with far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\u00a0\u201cPlus, there are other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and never will be.\u201d And Trump could not resist revisiting the subject on Wednesday. In a speech at a tank plant in Lima, Ohio, Trump complained that he gave McCain \u201cthe kind of funeral that he wanted,\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d According to Politico, Trump in Ohio reiterated that \u201cI\u2019ve never liked him much.\u201d\u00a0His comments received a cool reception, Politico reported. As part of various tributes to McCain, his coffin lay in state at the U.S. Capitol, and his main funeral service was conducted at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral. It was unclear what Trump was referring to in his comment about McCain\u2019s funeral. The president was pointedly not invited \u2015 per McCain\u2019s instructions \u2015 to the gathering at the National Cathedral. Those delivering eulogies there included former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Trump and McCain had several public spats before the senator died. Trump in 2015 infamously mocked McCain\u2019s five-year internment as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, saying that because he was \u201ccaptured\u201d he wasn\u2019t \u201ca war hero.\u201d Trump avoided military service as a young man during the Vietnam War era. When he was draft-eligible, he received deferments because a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs in his feet. The president revived his attacks on McCain when he tweeted on Saturday that the decorated Navy veteran\u2019s legacy was stained by his vote against repealing and replacing Obamacare. Trump also falsely accused McCain in a Saturday tweet of \u201cspreading\u201d the infamous Steele dossier, which alleges Russian blackmail against Trump, to the media. He also mocked the late senator\u2019s academic record from when he was a student years ago at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Meghan McCain, a co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and a daughter of the late senator, defended her father against Trump\u2019s attacks on Saturday. \u201cNo one will ever love you the way they loved my father,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI wish I had been given more [Saturdays] with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d But few Republican lawmakers have responded by directly challenging Trump\u2019s jabs at the late senator. McCain\u2019s close friend, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), became a target of ridicule for a tepid response to Trump\u2019s weekend tweets that did not specifically call out the president. \u201cAs to [McCain] and his devotion to his country: He stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history the body,\u201d Graham tweeted on Sunday. \u201cNothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished.\u201d Graham, up for re-election in 2020, has transformed from a staunch Trump critic into one of the president\u2019s loudest cheerleaders since McCain\u2019s death. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2015 who has been crucial to pushing Trump\u2019s agenda through Congress \u2015 defended McCain\u2019s legacy on Twitter an hour before Isakson\u2019s radio interview Wednesday. But, like Graham, he not directly take issue with Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cIt was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate,\u201d McConnell tweeted. Following McCain\u2019s death last year, Isakson berated Trump from the Senate floor when the flag at the White House only remained at half staff for only a day. The White House later lowered the flag again to half staff until the end of the various funeral services for McCain. \u201cAnybody who in any way tarnishes the reputation of John McCain deserves a whipping,\u201d Isakson said then, \u201cbecause most of those who would do the wrong thing about John McCain didn\u2019t have the guts to do the right thing when it was their turn.\u201d This story has been updated with Trump\u2019s Wednesday comments on McCain.",

McSally\u2019s compliments came two days after Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of McCain and \u201cnever will be.\u201d On Sunday, he also attempted to soil McCain\u2019s legacy on Twitter, referring to him as \u201clast in his class\u201d McCain.

The crowd included members of the military, who remained largely quiet during the comments,\u00a0according to USA Today. \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this, I didn\u2019t get \u2018thank you,\u2019 but that\u2019s OK.

The president signed a proclamation ordering that the flags at the White House be lowered to half-staff to honor McCain after his death. Customarily, they remain lowered until a person\u2019s interment, but Trump had the flags raised to full staff after only one day, then returned them to half-staff after a public outcry. During the speech, the president harped on McCain\u2019s defiance in opposing Trump\u2019s and other Republicans\u2019 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from millions of Americans. Trump also bashed McCain for turning over to the FBI a copy of the infamous dossier that Christopher Steele compiled on Trump and Russia. \u201cThat\u2019s not the nicest thing to do,\u201d Trump added. He has long criticized McCain \u2015 even after his death \u2015 and renewed those attacks over the weekend with a series of tweets. McCain\u2019s family, including his daughter Meghan McCain, hit back at the president. Some Republicans reiterated their admiration and respect for McCain but stopped short of calling out the president directly.

Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) demanded that President Donald Trump present the nation with X-rays of his feet to prove once and for all the bone spurs in his heels he claimed for a medical exemption from the Vietnam War draft. Kerrey, a former Navy SEAL who lost part of his right leg during the war, said on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d that \u201cyou don\u2019t grow out of bone spurs.\u201d If Trump had them in the 1960s, Kerrey said, he\u2019d still have them now (unless he underwent surgery, which Trump has never mentioned). The challenge followed Trump\u2019s latest disparaging remarks about the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years. McCain, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer, died in August. \u201cWhile John McCain was flying combat operations in Vietnam, you were, I think, falsifying that you had bone spurs in order not to go to Vietnam,\u201d said Kerrey, a 1992 presidential candidate who retired from the Senate in 2000. \u201cNow, I know lots of people who avoided the draft, but this isn\u2019t what he\u2019s saying. He said \u2018I physically couldn\u2019t go.\u2019 Well, Mr. President, get your feet X-rayed and let\u2019s see those bone spurs. I don\u2019t think he has them.\u201d Kerrey said he also believed Trump \u201csees all of us who went to Vietnam as fools. We were the suckers. We were the stupid ones. We were the ones that didn\u2019t have the resources to be able to get out of the draft.\u201d The daughters of a podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with the foot condition in 1968 said in December that it was as \u201ca favor\u201d to Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump. \u201cWhat he got was access to Fred Trump,\u201d Elysa Braunstein told The New York Times. \u201cIf there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and Trump would take care of it immediately.

The \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host lamented that Trump, during a speech at a tank factory in Ohio on Wednesday, had undermined his own message by going after McCain and George Conway, husband to top White House aide Kellyanne Conway. \u201cI think the president\u2019s record is so, so smart,\u201d Kilmeade said. \u201cBut the problem is, he swamped his own message by going after George Conway, and in that speech, inexplicably segue into going after John McCain. It makes absolutely no sense. ... John McCain passed away six months ago.\u201d Trump, during his speech Wednesday, complained that he never got a \u201cthank you\u201d for approving McCain\u2019s state funeral arrangements. \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this, I didn\u2019t get \u2018thank you,\u2019 but that\u2019s OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain.\u201d His comments followed a series of attacks he\u2019s made in recent weeks against McCain, who died in August 2018, more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer. He said on Tuesday at the White House that he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of the Arizona lawmaker and \u201cnever will be.\u201d Over the weekend, in a series of tweets, Trump blasted McCain for helping to kill a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also called out McCain\u2019s academic record when he was a student years ago at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and falsely claimed there was evidence that he had provided the infamous Steele dossier, which alleges Russian blackmail on the president, to the media. Trump and McCain regularly butted heads over the past few years. The president infamously claimed McCain, a decorated Navy veteran, wasn\u2019t a \u201cwar hero\u201d because he was \u201ccaptured\u201d and held for over five years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War.

John McCain, one eyebrow-raising comment in his latest string of jabs against the late Arizona lawmaker. \u201cWashington National Cathedral was honored to host the funeral service for Sen. John McCain. All funerals and memorial services at the Cathedral are organized by the family of the deceased; only a state funeral for a former president involves consultation with government officials,\u201d a cathedral spokesperson told HuffPost on Thursday. \u201cNo funeral at the Cathedral requires the approval of the president or any other government official.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump claimed that\u00a0he was not thanked for signing off on the funeral arrangements for the Republican senator, who died in August 2018. \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,\u201d Trump told a crowd at an Ohio military tank plant on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this. I didn\u2019t get thank you, that\u2019s OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain.\u201d McCain died from brain cancer at the age of 81 in his home state of Arizona after a long career in public service. In addition to his funeral at the Episcopal cathedral, which Trump was not invited to, the former prisoner of war\u00a0lay in state\u00a0in the Arizona Capitol and the United States Capitol. His family buried him in the cemetery of the U.S. Naval Academy, his alma mater in Annapolis, Maryland. Lying in state at the U.S. Capitol requires congressional authorization, but not presidential authorization. In reality, Trump only gave approval for the use of military transportation to bring McCain\u2019s body back to Washington. At the time of McCain\u2019s death, the president also signed a proclamation ordering that flags at the White House fly at half-staff to honor the late senator. Flags usually remain at half-staff until the person\u2019s interment, but Trump raised them up after just a day \u2015 and then lowered them again after public outrage. Trump\u2019s comments in Ohio came just days after his renewed Twitter attacks on the dead senator, which isn\u2019t new behavior for a president who has long criticized McCain. The president bashed the Vietnam War veteran for his role in killing a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also falsely accused McCain of \u201cspreading\u201d to the media the Steele dossier, which reports allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan\u00a0hit back at Trump\u00a0over the weekend for those earlier attacks.\u00a0McCain\u2019s daughter Bridget said on Thursday that Trump \u201cis a child\u201d and that had he been at her father\u2019s funeral, he would have come only \u201cfor the credit and not for any condolences.\u201d",

As part of an interview set to air Friday morning, Fox Business reporter Maria Bartiromo asked Trump about the disparaging comments that he made about McCain during a trip to a military tank plant in Lima, Ohio. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Bartiromo asked the president after telling him that he spent \u201ca good portion\u201d of his time at the plant \u201ctrashing\u201d the late senator.

The comments came days after the president bashed McCain on Twitter and in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good portion of my time. It\u2019s a very small portion,\u201d Trump said before launching into his various criticisms of McCain. The president\u00a0seems to believe McCain should not have immediately given federal authorities a dossier of information tying Trump to Russia for further investigation; rather, he should have called Trump first. The president also appears to have not gotten over the fact that McCain voted against his health care package in 2017. \u201cBut Mr. President, he\u2019s dead,\u201d Bartiromo responded. \u201cHe can\u2019t punch back, I know you punch back, but he\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople ask me the question.\u201d There we have it, maybe: Trump only attacks McCain because reporters ask him why he\u2019s attacking McCain.",

None were known to support Trump, and all have faced, at best, indifference and, at worst, attacks and neglect. \u201cOne can\u2019t be surprised,\u201d said Rice University presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. \u201cHe divides the world into two classes of people: Donald Trump diehards and everybody else. If you\u2019re in that second group, you\u2019re given second-class or derogatory treatment.\u201d It\u2019s a criticism that former Vice President Joe Biden touched on in his speech Monday announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. He called Trump \u201cthe only president who\u2019s decided not to represent the whole country.\u201d On Saturday, Trump\u00a0chose to congratulate the NFL\u2019s No. 2 draft pick \u2015 who is white and had publicly supported the president \u2015 while ignoring Murray \u2015 who won the Heisman Trophy, whose baseball skills gave him the option of playing in that sport\u2019s major leagues, and who is black. Trump has repeatedly insulted McCain even in the months since the senator\u2019s death last year, citing his low ranking in his U.S. Naval Academy class and his vote against a bill that would have repealed Obamacare. The president has attacked elected leaders in Puerto Rico and vowed not to give the hurricane-ravaged U.S. territory any more disaster aid. Yet he has heaped praise on and promised unlimited help to disaster victims in Texas and Alabama, states that voted for him in 2016. With Lugar, according to a former senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity, it was his public criticism of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and his failure to endorse Trump that put him on the no-praise list. \u201cHe is a never-Trumper,\u201d the ex-official said. Vice President Mike Pence, who was previously governor of Indiana, put out a statement within two hours of Sunday morning\u2019s news that Lugar had died. But there was nothing from the White House at all \u2015 even as Republican and Democratic lawmakers, former President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton all praised Lugar\u2019s work in the Senate, particularly in the area of arms control. It was not until Monday evening \u2015 after HuffPost made multiple inquiries regarding the lack of a statement \u2015 that the White House finally released one. \u201cThe First Lady and I extend our deepest condolences to the citizens of Indiana and the entire Lugar family following the loss of a great American and public servant,\u00a0Senator Richard Lugar. Richard Lugar, former mayor of Indianapolis and longtime United States senator,\u00a0was a proud Hoosier and patriot,\u201d the statement read. There was no accompanying tweet from Trump personally. In stark contrast, Trump \u2015 who has never evinced much interest in religion or spirituality and rarely goes to church \u2015 posted a tweet calling Billy Graham \u201ca very special man\u201d\u00a0within an hour of the news of the evangelist\u2019s death a year ago. \u201cThere was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions,\u201d the president wrote. Graham, however, was revered by white evangelical Christians, who are Trump\u2019s only real base of political support, according to numerous polls. Trump has long defended his own transactional nature. During the 2016 campaign, he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin because, he said, Putin had praised him. \u201cIt is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,\u201d Trump said in December 2015. Similarly, Trump frequently tells his supporters that he looks out for them because they voted for him, while he attacks those groups that he believes oppose him, including the news media and the investigators who conducted special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. \u201cYou joined our movement, the greatest movement in the history of our country, because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of the past. You were betrayed. You were betrayed by dishonest people. You were betrayed by stupid people,\u201d he told his audience at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday. \u201cYou have always been loyal to this nation. Now you finally have a president who is loyal to you.\u201d Norman Ornstein, a longtime scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has in recent years become a vocal critic of Republicans generally and Trump in particular, called the president\u2019s divisive brand of leadership unprecedented. \u201cTrump is unlike any president ever,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cMore like Jefferson Davis than Thomas Jefferson. No wonder he admires Robert E. Lee.\u201d",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Voters care more about electability than anything else.\u201d That statement sums up what appears to be the dominant feeling among Democratic primary voters this cycle. Except that quote, spoken by then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to Newsweek, is from 2004. Electability has been front and center since former Vice President Joe Biden officially entered the presidential race last week, pitching himself as the person best able to defeat President Donald Trump. He quickly jumped to a wide lead in polls of the Democratic race. But candidates should beware: History is littered with men (and a woman) who campaigned on electability and eventually lost out. And electability is a measurement that often seems to benefit male candidates. Few presidential nominating campaigns were as devoted to the electability premise as the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries. Those who had already cast ballots in Iowa and New Hampshire \u201ctold us that electability was a big issue, so we\u2019re going to take just a few moments at the beginning to talk about how the race has changed,\u201d NBC\u2019s Tom Brokaw said at the beginning of a debate ahead of the South Carolina primary. The race ultimately winnowed down to two candidates: \u201cMr. Electable\u201d (Sen. John Kerry of Massachusets) and \u201cMr. Likable\u201d (Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina), according to The New York Times. A decorated Vietnam War veteran and an experienced lawmaker with foreign policy expertise and a record of bipartisan work on veteran\u2019s issues with the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Kerry appeared to many frightened Democratic voters to be the perfect challenger for President George W. Bush in the post-9/11 period of belligerent nationalism. Mr. Electable won the primary \u2015 but lost the general election. Kerry\u2019s selection may have the most explicit moment in contemporary times where primary voters chose the \u201cmost electable\u201d candidate \u2015 over other considerations \u2015 who then went on to lose. But it wasn\u2019t the first or the last. Former Vice President Walter Mondale wrapped up major endorsements from Democratic Party interest groups early in the 1984 election cycle because they believed he could beat President Ronald Reagan. \u201c\u2019They believe that Mondale is electable,\u201d Donna Brazile, then an adviser to Rev. Jesse Jackson, said after the National Organization for Women endorsed Mondale in 1983. Mondale won Minnesota, his home state, and Washington, D.C., in the 1984 election \u2015 and lost everywhere else in the Reagan landslide. In the 2016 Democratic race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made electability the issue as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rose in the polls ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cWho\u2019s the one candidate who can stop\u201d the Republicans? one Clinton campaign ad asked. The answer: Clinton. In the general election, she won the popular vote, but, of course, lost the White House to Trump. The thing is, Kerry, Mondale and Clinton were electable. (Okay, maybe Mondale had no shot.) So were GOP presidential nominees Mitt Romney, Bob Dole and McCain, and Democratic nominees Michael Dukakis and Al Gore. Clinton and Gore even won the popular vote! But they still didn\u2019t become president. And their closest contenders in the primary contests all made electability arguments to promote their own candidacies, as well. Gore, running against Dukakis in 1988, said that only a Southern Democrat could win the White House. Edwards made the same pitch in 2004 against Kerry with a little bit of his personal background thrown in: \u201cI am more electable because I know what it\u2019s like to grow up in a working-class family.\u201d In that same Democratic campaign, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut also pitched his electability.\u00a0\u201cI have the capacity not only to unite Democrats, but to get independents and disgruntled Republicans to come together so I can actually get elected and defeat George Bush,\u201d he said at a candidate debate. \u201cI have demonstrated that I am more electable than Walter Mondale,\u201d Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who almost snatched the 1984 nomination from Mondale, said near the end of his campaign. In the 1992 Democratic race, California Gov. Jerry Brown depicted himself as the party\u2019s best choice by attacking then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton as having an \u201celectability problem.\u201d In the same race, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey claimed he was the most electable because of his Vietnam War service. Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin similarly offered himself as the candidate with the best chance of unseating President George H.W. Bush. It is extremely rare for the two major political parties to nominate an unelectable candidate. The most recent examples occurred when Republicans chose Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Democrats picked George McGovern in 1972 \u2015 both too extreme in their views for vast swaths of voters. Goldwater may have been overwhelmed by President Lyndon Johnson, but he was a harbinger of the coming conservative era; McGovern\u2019s thumping by President Richard Nixon helped create a generational chasm among Democrats that plagued the party for several more political cycles. It is an almost impossible task to determine who is electable when most of the options are. Indeed, some of those labeled as unelectable turn out to be winners. Bill Clinton withstood attacks from Brown about his electability, won the Democratic primary in fairly easy fashion and then withstood a barrage of attacks over his infidelity and business deals to win the White House. Barack Obama\u2019s full name \u2015 Barack Hussein Obama \u2015 and race were raised as reasons why he would be unelectable. So were his connections to ex-Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers and Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi. Reagan was deemed too conservative to win the 1980 election by both the media and Republican Party bigwigs. Reagan \u201cis perceived as a most conservative Republican,\u201d former President Gerald Ford said in 1979. \u201cA very conservative Republican can\u2019t win in a national election.\u201d \u201cMr. Reagan would be a sure-loser in November,\u201d Ford added. And, of course, there\u2019s the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. No one thought Donald Trump was electable at first. A thrice-married adulterer famous for playing a rich person on television who called Mexicans rapists and murderers; called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering\u201d the U.S.; talked about how sexually attractive his daughter is; and boasted on tape of using his fame to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d couldn\u2019t be elected! Right? But there he is. The 45th president of the United States. Maybe electability isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.",

Klobuchar, speaking to a crowd of more than 200 at Jasper\u2019s Winery, said she sat next to McCain, one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken Republican critics, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the inaugural address, which became known for its blunt expression of Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism and invocations of \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d \u201cI sat on that stage between Bernie and John McCain, and John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cHe understood it. He knew because he knew this man more than any of us did.\u201d McCain and Trump feuded frequently during the president\u2019s first 18 months in office, and the president has continued to attack McCain since the senator\u2019s death last August. McCain refused to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign, and later attacked his approach to politics as a \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\u201d Trump, for his part, attacked McCain for his vote to kill an Obamacare repeal bill in the Senate and famously criticized him for being captured while serving as a pilot in Vietnam. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d he said in the early stages of his presidential bid. McCain faced criticism from Democrats for not doing more to oppose the policies and appointments of a president he frequently lambasted, but Klobuchar and other Democratic senators frequently praise him as a Republican they were able to work with during increasingly partisan times. Klobuchar regularly mentions her friendship with McCain during her stump speech. CORRECTION: This article previously misidentified McCain as a fighter pilot. McCain flew attack aircraft on bombing missions.",

McCain \u201cout of sight\u201d during President Donald Trump\u2019s recent visit to Japan, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and The New York Times reported Wednesday. The Journal, which first reported the story, obtained a copy of an email from an official with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. In the note, the unnamed official said he had coordinated with the White House before Trump\u2019s visit and asked other officials working with the Navy and Air Force to comply with instructions for the president\u2019s trip. \u201cUSS John McCain needs to be out of sight,\u201d the email read, listing the request as the third provision in the note. \u201cPlease confirm #3 will be satisfied.\u201d The Navy gave all sailors aboard the ship the day off on Tuesday as Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base, the Journal and the Times reported. The ship is named in honor of three generations of McCains, who all share the name and served in the Navy. McCain sailors were not invited to see Trump speak that day, unlike sailors from other American warships at the base, the Times reported, citing several unnamed Navy service members. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Amid the reports, Trump wrote a message on Twitter saying he was \u201cnot informed\u201d of the request but \u201cloved being with our great Military Men and Women\u201d during his visit. White House aides confirmed to the Times that the request was made, but insisted the president did not know about it. Trump told reporters Thursday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know a thing about\u201d McCain sailors being turned away from seeing him speak. \u201cI would never have done that,\u201d the president said. He added, however, that the request to bar them was \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d The Washington Post reported Thursday that the White House asked Navy officials to keep the McCain out of pictures during Trump\u2019s visit, citing unnamed Pentagon and White House officials. McCain died last August, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from constantly lobbing attacks at the career politician. The president\u00a0regularly lambastes McCain over his \u201cno\u201d vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan McCain commented on the Journal\u2019s report later on Wednesday, saying the president\u2019s antipathy toward her father made her \u201cgrief unbearable.\u201d \u201cTrump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,\u201d McCain tweeted. \u201cThere is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won\u2019t let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him.\u201d The USS John McCain is being repaired in Japan after a collision in 2017, and the Journal notes that moving the warship would have been difficult. The outlet reviewed photos from just before Trump\u2019s visit and found that tarps hung over the ship\u2019s name at times and that a barge was later moved to obscure it so it wouldn\u2019t be instantly recognizable. The Navy\u2019s chief of information contradicted those claims, however, saying the ship\u2019s name was never obscured and that the military was proud of its \u201cnamesake and heritage.\u201d\u00a0A spokesman for acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan also said the secretary was not aware of the effort, \u201cnor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive.\u201d Trump visited Japan this week on an official state visit\u00a0and was met with great fanfare by the country\u2019s government. He also became the first foreign leader to meet with Japanese Emperor Naruhito, who was enthroned earlier this month.

      "content": " President Donald Trump never turns down an opportunity to insult the late Republican Sen. John McCain. On Thursday morning, Trump was asked about his latest insult on the military: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that White House and U.S. Navy officials coordinated to relocate the USS John McCain \u2015 a warship named in honor of three generations of McCains, all of whom share the name and served in the Navy \u2015 so that the president wouldn\u2019t have to see it during his recent visit to Japan. Trump told reporters Thursday that he wasn\u2019t personally involved in that decision, but he made sure to note that he doesn\u2019t like McCain, a war hero with whom he constantly squabbled while the senator was alive. \u201cJohn McCain, I wasn\u2019t a fan, but I would never do a thing like that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him. OK? And, they were well-meaning, I will say.

The New York Times, meanwhile, confirmed that the White House was involved in the complicated process of moving it during his visit. The comments are par for the course for a president who consistently smears McCain and insults the military. McCain died in August 2018, but Trump so regularly lobs insults at him that his daughter, Meghan McCain, has said that the insults made her \u201cgrief unbearable.\u201d Previously, Trump has lambasted a Navy SEAL commander who headed the raid on Osama bin Laden, insulted Gold Star families and prisoners of war, neglected to visit combat zones and, most recently, moved to pardon war criminals, which military veterans are not pleased about.",

      "content": " Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), seized a few minutes at the start of \u201cThe View\u201d on Thursday to address President Donald Trump\u2019s latest reported slight against her father, who died of cancer in August. Reports by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times state that the White House asked the Navy to hide the USS John S. McCain during Trump\u2019s visit to Japan this week so that the ship\u2019s name would not appear in photos with the president. The warship is named after the late Arizona senator, his father and his grandfather. Trump\u2019s antagonistic relationship with John McCain was well-documented. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to go through the grief process when my father who has been dead for 10 months is constantly in the news cycle because the president is so obsessed with the fact that he\u2019s never going to be a great man like he was,\u201d said Meghan McCain,\u00a0who co-hosts the ABC daytime show. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre way to grieve and say goodbye to my dad,\u201d she continued, saying that Trump has made her father \u201comnipresent in politics\u201d but \u201cnot like in a way we\u2019re honoring him.\u201d \u201cPlease have more compassion. This is very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI try and put on a game face every day and try to be as stoic as possible. Grief is tricky.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if nine months isn\u2019t enough for me to move on.\u201d McCain said Wednesday\u00a0in a tweet that Trump\u2019s attacks on her deceased father have made her grief \u201cunbearable,\u201d but she continues to defend him because \u201cTrump won\u2019t let him RIP.\u201d She reiterated that point Thursday, saying the allegations are also \u201cbad for Americans\u201d and \u201cput[s] people in the Navy in horrific situations\u201d where they fear retribution if they do not follow orders. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions have consequences. When you are repeatedly attacking my father and war heroes, it creates a culture in the military where people are fearful to show my father\u2019s name in one way or another,\u201d McCain said. Still, she noted that she does not blame service members for allegedly attempting to cover up the ship\u2019s name \u2015 which the Navy denies doing. Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal noted that sailors on the McCain, who typically wear caps bearing the ship\u2019s name, were given the day off. The Times said the sailors were also not invited to hear Trump speak aboard the amphibious ship Wasp, while other military service members were present. Trump has said he \u201cwas not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John. S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan.\u201d Yet the president said whoever made the request was likely \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d",

In a statement to NBC News published Saturday, Chief of Information Rear Adm. Charlie Brown noted that despite the request, the ship stayed put. \u201cA request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President\u2019s visit,\u201d he said. Furthermore, Brown assured that there were \u201cno intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain.\u201d The ship is the namesake of the late Arizona senator, who had a contentious relationship with Trump, as well as McCain\u2019s father and grandfather. On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that sailors from the McCain were not invited to hear Trump\u2019s speech aboard another ship; however, other sailors were. Also on Wednesday, a Wall Street Journal report cited an email from a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official who asked the Navy and Air Force to comply with a request to hide the McCain. \u201cUSS John McCain needs to be out of sight,\u201d the email stated, listing the item as one of three in the note. \u201cPlease confirm #3 will be satisfied.\u201d After the reports surfaced, Brown tweeted that the ship \u201cwas not obscured\u201d during Trump\u2019s Memorial Day visit to Yokosuka. \u201cThe Navy is proud of that ship, its crew, its namesake and its heritage,\u201d the tweet read. Reacting to news of the request, Trump tweeted that he knew nothing about the message: On Thursday, Trump doubled down on his previous remarks while speaking to reporters outside the White House. Asked whether he felt it was fair to the ship\u2019s sailors that they were barred from listening to the president speak during his visit \u2015 something Brown stated did not occur intentionally \u2015 Trump said he was unaware of what happened. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not have done that.\u201d Trump then took several shots at McCain, reiterating his criticisms of the late senator. \u201cI was very angry with John McCain because he killed health care,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was not a big fan of John McCain in any way, shape or form. I think John McCain had a lot to getting President Bush \u2014 a lot to do with it \u2014 to go into the Middle East, which was a catastrophe.\u201d Circling back on his self-defense, Trump again stressed that he was not to blame. \u201cTo me, John McCain \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a fan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would never do a thing like that. Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him, OK? And they were well-meaning, I will say. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I would never have done that.\u201d",

McCain warship so President Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t have to see it during his visit to a naval base in Japan. Mulvaney told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes someone from the White House\u2019s advance team made the ask knowing Trump had a contentious relationship with the late Sen. John McCain\u00a0(R-Ariz.), a decorated Navy veteran. \u201cAn advance team is hundreds of people,\u201d Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd. \u201cThe fact that some 23- or 24-year-old person on the advance team went to that site and said, \u2018Oh my goodness, there\u2019s the John McCain. We all know how the president feels about the former senator. Maybe that\u2019s not the best backdrop. Could somebody look into moving it?\u2019 That\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to ask.\u201d \u201cSeriously?\u201d Todd asked. Mulvaney doubled down: \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s certainly not.\u201d The U.S. Navy confirmed Saturday that it was asked to \u201cminimize\u201d the presence of the USS John S. McCain ahead of Trump\u2019s visit to Japan. The 505-foot destroyer was originally named after McCain\u2019s father and grandfather, John S. McCain Jr. and John S. McCain Sr. The Arizona senator was\u00a0added\u00a0as a third namesake shortly before his death in 2018. \u201cA request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S.

      "content": " The Pentagon has delivered a stark warning directly to the White House that the military \u201cwill not be politicized\u201d following the administration\u2019s efforts to hide the USS John McCain during President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Japan. The Pentagon\u2019s message contradicts claims Sunday by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that attempts to hide the USS McCain to assuage Trump\u2019s feelings were \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Friday ordered his chief of staff, Eric Chewning, to speak with the White House military office to \u201creaffirm his mandate that the Department of Defense will not be politicized,\u201d Shanahan spokesman Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino told The Associated Press Sunday. The message was delivered. Shanahan revealed to journalists that the White House request was made directly to officials of the Navy\u2019s Seventh Fleet, CNN reported. Shanahan, who spoke to reporters as he flew to South Korea Sunday, said he had not talked to the president about the controversial issue. The U.S. Navy confirmed Friday that the White House Military Office wanted to \u201cminimize the visibility\u201d of the USS John McCain when Trump was in Japan because of the contentious relationship between the president and the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. The ship is named for McCain, a decorated Navy veteran, as well as for his father and his grandfather, who were both admirals. Shanahan also told reporters that he had a private phone conversation with McCain\u2019 wife, Cindy McCain, about the situation, but did not reveal details. The effort to hide or move the Navy ship was first reported by The Wall Street Journal last week. Trump said he knew \u201cnothing\u201d about the efforts, but said whoever was responsible\u00a0for the effort was \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d Shanahan told reporters he won\u2019t call for an investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s internal watchdog \u201cright now\u201d because \u201cnothing was carried out\u201d to hide the USS McCain, despite White House requests. But Shanahan is still looking into what happened. He plans to talk to Navy officials again when he returns to Washington. \u201cHow did the people receiving the information \u2014 how did they treat it?\u201d Shanahan intends to determine, he told reporters. \u201cThat would give me an understanding on the next steps\u201d to take, he added, the AP reported. Shanahan said nothing was done to hide or move the ship. A tarp over the name (a photo of which appeared in the Journal) was removed before Trump\u2019s visit, according to Shanahan. He said the tarp was initially erected for \u201chull preservation\u201d during ship repairs. Ship personnel \u2014 whose uniform hats carry the name of the USS McCain \u2014 were given a 96-hour shore leave during Trump\u2019s visit. But Shanahan has said that was not connected to the White House request. Mulvaney shrugged off concerns about the extraordinary incident on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday and said it would be \u201csilly\u201d to think anyone would be fired for trying to hide a Navy ship and its personnel because of a political rift and a miffed president. He speculated that some young member of the advance team took it upon himself to arrange moving the ship to make the president happy, which was \u201cnot an unreasonable thing to do,\u201d he said. Shanahan said publicly on Friday: \u201cOur business is to run military operations and not to become politicized.\u201d A defense official told the AP that Shanahan is considering sending out formal guidelines to military units to avoid similar problems in the future.",

      "content": " A group of British protesters is projecting its feelings that President\u00a0Donald Trump is not especially loved in the U.K. On Monday, an anti-Brexit campaign called Led By Donkeys announced on Twitter that it was protesting Trump\u2019s visit with a series of large, public projections onto major London attractions. The group has set up three of these temporary displays so far, with more planned. The one most likely to get Trump\u2019s goat takes advantage of the president\u2019s known hatred of John McCain and references the effort by White House staff to\u00a0keep a ship named for the late senator (and his father and grandfather) out of Trump\u2019s sight\u00a0during the president\u2019s recent trip to Japan. A giant red cap emblazoned with the words \u201cUSS John S. McCain\u201d was shone on the dome of Madame Tussauds wax museum. The group kept up its offense-generating offensive by displaying poll results that show how unfavorably the president compares with his predecessor, Barack Obama, among the British public. The background for this was the Tower of London. Led By Donkeys also trolled Trump by projecting less-than-flattering comments\u00a0about him on Big Ben. The remarks came from former London mayor, current Brexit supporter and possible next U.K. prime minister\u00a0Boris Johnson. Trump and Johnson support each other publicly these days, but protesters wanted the president to remember what Johnson said in 2015: Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed comments are complete and utter nonsense. I think he\u2019s betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of President of the United States. Led By Donkeys hopes Trump gets the message that he\u2019s not particularly popular in Britain, according to a statement released to HuffPost: We want [the president] to realize that behind the choreographed pomp and ceremony of this visit, Donald Trump is a deeply unpopular man. The vast majority of people in this country don\u2019t like him.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \u201cHe has no ethics of any kind,\u201d said Mark Salter, a former speechwriter to McCain, the longtime Republican senator from Arizona who died last year of brain cancer. \u201cNothing is too outlandish or dishonest.\u201d On the Senate floor on June 5, 2014, Sanders praised McCain for sticking by his principles and pushing the private doctor \u201cchoice\u201d element even though Sanders disagreed with it. McCain responded: \u201cWe were able to come together I believe in a way that will help relieve this terrible tragedy that seems to have befallen our nation\u2019s veterans.\u201d Following the compromise struck by McCain and Sanders, the legislation passed both chambers and on Aug. 7, 2014, was signed into law by then-President Barack Obama \u2014 notwithstanding Trump\u2019s repeated false claims that the \u201cVA choice\u201d law was something that he himself achieved. \u201cThey have trying to get it passed for 44 years. We got it passed,\u201d he told a rally audience in Panama City, Florida, last month. \u201cWe passed VA choice,\u201d he repeated to an Orlando audience on Tuesday. \u201cYou go out now, you get a doctor, you fix yourself up, the doctor sends us the bill, we pay for it and you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter because the life and the veteran is more important.\u201d The White House declined to comment on Trump\u2019s falsehoods on this topic, and would not say whether Trump was knowingly lying or simply did not know the facts. \u201cFor him the truth is no better than a lie, and if it doesn\u2019t serve his ego when a lie will, then the lie is preferable to the truth,\u201d Salter said. \u201cThat\u2019s his only value: Does it serve his ego or not.\u201d Trump did sign into law the \u201cVA Mission Act\u201d last year, which extended the 2014 law and eased the eligibility requirements. But Trump has never made that claim. Instead, in speech after speech, interview after interview, he has falsely taken credit for the original law, telling his audience that prior to him, veterans who faced extended delays at their Veterans Affairs clinic or hospital simply had to suffer. Trump allies in Congress acknowledged that McCain was instrumental in passing the 2014 law but pointed out that it was due to \u201csunset\u201d last year. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership we were able to create a permanent program to give veterans greater choice last year,\u201d a Republican aide in the House Veterans Affairs Committee said on condition of anonymity. Trump, while he has been falsely taking credit for having created the \u201cchoice\u201d program since last summer, did not explicitly make the equally false claim that McCain failed to pass such a law until last week\u2019s ABC News interview. His animosity toward McCain, though, began at least four years ago after McCain said Trump was \u201cfiring up the crazies\u201d in his outreach to an \u201cextreme element within our Republican party.\u201d Trump, a few days later at a campaign event in Iowa with religious conservatives, disparaged McCain\u2019s status as a Vietnam War hero. \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t like losers.\u201d McCain was a Navy pilot who was shot down and held captive and tortured for five and a half years in Hanoi as a prisoner of war. Trump, in contrast, claimed he had \u201cbone spurs\u201d in his heels and received a medical deferment. Years later, he told a radio host that he considered avoiding sexually transmitted diseases in those years his own \u201cpersonal Vietnam\u201d because of all the different women he was sleeping with. After the Oct. 7, 2016, release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Trump is heard describing how his celebrity allowed him to grab women by the genitals, McCain was among a sizable number of Republican office holders who withdrew their endorsement of his presidential candidacy. And in 2017, McCain cast the deciding \u201cno\u201d vote in the Senate blocking repeal of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 a vote Trump has been attacking McCain for even after his death. In a speech at an Ohio tank factory this March, Trump told the audience that he was also angry with McCain for his role in passing along to the FBI a \u201cdossier\u201d of information compiled by a former British intelligence officer regarding Trump and his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia in late 2016. \u201cJohn McCain received a fake and phony dossier.\u00a0Did you hear about the dossier?\u00a0It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Right?\u201d Trump said as the audience booed McCain. \u201cAnd John McCain got it.\u00a0He got it.\u00a0And what did he do?\u00a0He didn\u2019t call me.\u00a0He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy.\u00a0And that\u2019s not the nicest thing to do.\u201d Trump, his White House staff and his allies in and out of Congress have been actively trying to discredit the former British officer, Christopher Steele, as well as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report that detailed Russia\u2019s efforts to help Trump win the election as well as numerous instances where Trump tried to shut down Mueller\u2019s probe. Steele had previously helped the FBI break open the FIFA bribery scandal. His Trump work was for an opposition research firm originally hired by an anti-Trump GOP donor, but which found a new client in Democratic nominee Clinton\u2019s campaign after Trump secured the GOP nomination.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Irked by President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to hold his own July Fourth event on the National Mall, veterans plan to give out thousands of USS John S. McCain T-shirts to make the president face a crowd of people honoring the McCain family\u2019s legacy and the idea of putting one\u2019s country before oneself. VoteVets, a left-leaning nonprofit group founded in 2006 by Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, is organizing the effort in response to\u00a0Trump\u2019s unprecedented \u201cSalute to America\u201d celebration.\u00a0While Americans will still be able to catch the annual fireworks display on the National Mall, Trump is hosting his own event at the Lincoln Memorial, where he will give remarks and has set up a ticketed area for VIPs, friends, family and members of the military. Trump\u2019s event will include military flyovers and possibly\u00a0tanks. \u201cToday, we learned the news that Donald Trump is turning the national 4th of July celebration into a 2020 campaign event, complete with a ticketed VIP section for friends and supporters,\u201d reads a Sunday email from VoteVets. \u201cThat\u2019s not what America is about.\u201d VoteVets has already raised enough money to make more than 5,000 T-shirts, which veterans will hand out to people on the National Mall and, before that, deliver to members of Congress. All of the shirts, which feature an image of the Navy destroyer named after three generations of John S. McCains \u2014 including the late Arizona senator and Trump critic \u2014 are being made by Rags of Honor, a company that employs homeless veterans. Here\u2019s what the shirt looks like, via Rags of Honor\u2019s website: \u201cBig Bad John\u201d is the nickname of the ship, which the White House absurdly asked to have\u00a0moved out of sight during Trump\u2019s visit to Japan in May because of his contentious relationship with McCain. \u201cIt\u2019s really a way to honor a family that, through multiple generations, has shown that the country is bigger than any one individual,\u201d said Peter Kauffmann, vice chair of VoteVets and a Navy veteran. \u201cJuly 4 has never been about who is president. The idea that Donald Trump can come in and sell VIP tickets so you can get good seats while the regular old people have to stay back from the area is antithetical to the whole idea of America.\u201d The VIP tickets are actually free, but it\u2019s not clear how they are being allocated. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about veterans giving out McCain T-shirts for the president\u2019s event.",

John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, believes he would be\u00a0\u201cvery disappointed\u201d and \u201csaddened\u201d with the state of politics if alive today. \u201cI think he\u2019d be very disappointed, in fact, I know he would be,\u201d she said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe would be saddened by the digression that these conversations and these debates have taken and also saddened that we are so disoriented within the world right now,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe had time to talk before he died and he was very frustrated with what was going on then and I think now he\u2019d be even more frustrated.\u201d The Republican senator from Arizona and Vietnam prisoner of war was a conservative known to make and keep friends on both sides of the political aisle. Before his death last August from brain cancer at the age of 81, McCain clashed with President Donald Trump, who has publicly disparaged him multiple times \u2014 including after the senator\u2019s death. Trump was not invited to McCain\u2019s funeral, at which former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush gave speeches. In her late husband\u2019s memory, Cindy McCain asked that Americans perform \u201cacts of civility\u201d and share them on social media. \u201cWe\u2019ve all witnessed some troubling times with regards to genuine civility towards each other and towards mankind,\u201d she said, \u201cand our family together ... felt this was a very important message that if we can convey anything that John McCain stood for on this one year anniversary, it would be acts of civility.\u201d",

      "content": " Cindy McCain, wife of late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said that her husband would have been deeply troubled by the current state of American politics as Republicans continue to defend President Donald Trump against a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. \u201cI think he would be disgusted with some of the stuff that\u2019s going on,\u201d she\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Axelrod in an interview that aired Saturday. \u201cI really do. I think he\u2019d be, he\u2019d be railing against what\u2019s going on.\u201d When the senator was alive, she argued, he made it possible for other GOP lawmakers to stand up to Trump rather than having to stay in line for fear of losing support back home. \u201cI think John provided a lot of cover for other members, and when he would do it, they could get behind him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing a real rudder in the Senate right now in all this.\u201d John McCain died at age 81 in 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Though a staunch critic of Trump, the so-called maverick was known for his friendships on both sides of the aisle, and was often able to overcome partisanship in an effort to get things done. At times, that included breaking with his own party, a seemingly unthinkable act for today\u2019s GOP hardliners. In August \u2015 weeks before Democrats launched their impeachment probe \u2015 Cindy McCain told CNN that before her husband died, he expressed that \u201che was very frustrated with what was going on,\u201d regarding the overall division in Washington. In her latest interview, she took issue with Trump\u2019s effort to push unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son, calling the former vice president a \u201clovely man\u201d and saying that it\u2019s unnecessary \u201cto disparage anyone that\u2019s running just because you disagree with them.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to malign Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has become central to impeachment proceedings as Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to launch an investigation into the Bidens. Meanwhile, American military aid to the country was being withheld, raising concerns of a quid pro quo. However, Trump and his Republican allies have vehemently denied any shady dealings. While Cindy McCain sympathized with politicians\u2019 concerns about getting reelected if they go against Trump, \u201cat some point, you have to do what you were elected to do and that is represent the country as well as your local people,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he would be terribly upset by this whole thing,\u201d she added, referring to her husband. \u201cHe was upset before he died, he saw what was going on. ...\u00a0Like all of us, I wish he were here. We need him more than ever.\u201d",
