      "content": " California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 attack on former Vice President Joe Biden for decades ago opposing forced school busing as a way to combat segregation understandably dominated coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate among 10 of the Democratic presidential candidates. But another moment revealed a different source of tension inside the Democratic Party, one that may play a significant role as the top contenders for its 2020 nomination seek to distinguish themselves from Biden: the legacy of the president he served as a loyal lieutenant, Barack Obama. NBC News moderator Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart prefaced a question about whether Biden would deport immigrants whose only offense was arriving in the U.S. without papers by noting that the \u201cObama-Biden administration deported more than 3 million Americans.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama I think did a heck of a job,\u201d Biden shot back. \u201cTo compare him to what [President Donald Trump] is doing is absolutely ... immoral.\u201d Biden went on to say that undocumented immigrants who have not committed a crime would not be \u201cthe focus of deportation.\u201d Unlike Biden, Harris unequivocally committed to ruling out the deportation of individuals whose sole violation was entering the U.S. without documentation. And she did so by giving her version of how she broke with the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policies during her tenure as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cOn this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by [the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s] own definition were non-criminals,\u201d she said. Harris\u2019 comments were an exaggeration, at best. During a tumultuous fight over a \u201csanctuary state\u201d law in California designed specifically to circumvent the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive immigration policies, Harris was, to the lasting frustration of immigrants rights activists, unwilling to publicly advocate for the law. Still, the divergent responses reflect one of the defining cleavages in the Democratic primary field between candidates like Harris willing to take on Obama\u2019s policies, those like Biden who plan to restore them, and variations in between. To be sure, candidates eager to break with Obama\u2019s legacy must contend with his sky-high popularity among Democratic voters. A whopping 71% of Democrats said he was the best president of their lifetime in a July 2018 Pew poll. Obama had a 97% approval rating among Democrats in January 2018. And in a survey released in March of this year, the percentage of party members identifying themselves as \u201cObama Democrats\u201d\u00a0edged out those preferring the labels of liberal, moderate or conservative Democrat. \u201cWe are so scared to criticize Obama because he is a beloved figure,\u201d said Irene Lin, who served in his Obama administration\u2019s Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development and worked for his 2012 re-election effort. But Lin, who is not a fan of what she sees as Obama\u2019s light-touch approach to corporate monopolies and big banks, suggested an alternative path: \u201cYou can separate the person from the policy. I love Barack Obama.\u201d Broadly speaking, the Democratic presidential hopefuls\u2019 approach to Obama and his legacy can be broken into three camps. On one side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been the most vocal and persistent critic of the former president \u2015 including while Obama was in office. In 2011, as Obama pursued a fiscal \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans that would cut Social Security benefits, Sanders went on the warpath against him. In comments to progressive radio talk show host Thom Hartmann\u2019s radio show, Sanders said millions of Americans were \u201cdeeply disappointed in the president\u201d and could not \u201cbelieve how weak he has been,\u201d before suggesting that Obama merited a primary challenge\u00a0in 2012 (that didn\u2019t happen). Sanders also has assailed Obama for his neglect of the Democratic Party at its grassroots levels. During an April 2018 event in Mississippi commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination, Sanders said that \u201cthe business model ... of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure.\u201d \u201cPeople sometimes don\u2019t see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama,\u201d Sanders said to notable silence. \u201cBut behind that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country.\u201d Sanders\u2019 divergence with Obama, however, is clearest not when he specifically mentions the former president but in framing his candidacy as a movement to overturn the \u201cestablishment politics and establishment economics\u201d of both parties. The premise of his presidential campaigns, in 2016 and now again, is that money has corrupted politicians of all stripes, preventing the adoption of policies like Medicare for All and free college that a majority of the public supports. Where Obama saw transcending partisanship as the key to progress, Sanders focuses on replacing corporate influence with an empowered electorate. \u201cMake no mistake about it, this struggle is not just about defeating Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders declared at his campaign launch rally in Brooklyn in March. \u201cThis struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country.\u201d Sanders has undeniably pushed the boundaries of discourse with the Democratic Party to the left. The clearest example of this is on health care. Harris and three other senators in the 2020 race \u2015 Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kristen Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2015 are all co-sponsors of Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill. And in a sign of the issue\u2019s growing resonance, the percentage of voters who support a single-payer health care system rose from 40% in 2000 to 56% today, according to a survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. A narrow majority of Democratic voters \u2015 54% \u2015 want the next president to continue Obama\u2019s policies, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll released in May. Nearly one-third of these voters \u2015 31% \u2015 want a president who is more liberal than Obama; among those 35 or younger, that figure jumps to 45%. Sanders and other progressive contenders will try to tap into this rising demographic \u2015 while also seeking to persuade the large swath of voters fond of Obama that policies that go well beyond what he tried to achieve aren\u2019t necessarily a ding on his legacy. On the other side of the spectrum is Biden, who has cast himself\u00a0as the next best thing to an Obama third term. Some of his biggest applause lines on the stump are when he waxes sentimental about \u201cmy friend Barack,\u201d celebrating his partnership with an \u201cincredible president.\u201d Unlike most of his rivals in the primary field, Biden insists that if Trump is denied re-election, history will regard his presidency as an \u201caberration,\u201d rather than the culmination of structural forces roiling U.S. politics for decades beforehand. Indeed, Biden is running on a return to the normalcy of the Obama era, which he casts as a period of moderate policies and bipartisanship. In a speech in Hampton, New Hampshire, in mid-May, Biden said he wanted to \u201crestore the soul of the nation.\u201d Later on, he suggested that the country didn\u2019t need to look that far back for inspiration. \u201cSpeaking of Barack, I think he didn\u2019t get nearly the kind of credit \u2015 he was one heck of a president, a man of integrity, honor, decency,\u201d Biden said, drawing sustained applause. \u201cThere\u2019s a yearning that we can get past this intense partisan polarization and warfare that has intensified under Trump,\u201d said Jim Kessler, policy chief of the business-friendly Democratic think tank Third Way and a former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cNot that the Obama time was not polarized \u2015 it certainly was \u2015 but there was an attempt to not be.\u201d But even Biden has made his peace with some more popular elements of the party\u2019s leftward shift since Obama\u2019s departure from the White House. He now supports a federal minimum wage of $15, which Obama never endorsed, and the creation of an option to buy into Medicare, a version of which Obama supported as a candidate before jettisoning it as president. Biden was skeptical of pursuing what became one of the hallmarks of Obama\u2019s tenure \u2015 the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2015 but he now claims it as one of the proudest moments of his service in the Obama administration. In proposing ways to improve the ACA, including the creation of a Medicare buy-in, Biden nonetheless admits that the law failed to provide universal coverage or provide affordable care for millions of people who have insurance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to finish the job on health care,\u201d Biden said in a speech to Democrats in Manchester in mid-May. That kind of incremental vision is in keeping with Obama\u2019s approach, in Kessler\u2019s view. \u201cThe Obama legacy was never meant to be a static thing,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats are always moving forward and trying to be right for the particular time we\u2019re in.\u201d In the space between the two, other candidates like Harris, Booker, Warren and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas have found ways to question the outcomes of the Obama era \u2015 without being seen to attack Obama or his legacy. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has perhaps been the most direct among them when he told The New York Times podcast \u201cThe Argument\u201d that \u201cbeing to the left of Obama doesn\u2019t make you extremely progressive. Remember he was the last Democratic president of the Reagan era,\u201d constrained by political dynamics that no longer apply. Warren also has not shied away from drawing policy differences with Obama, while refraining from criticizing him explicitly. Her positioning is striking, however, since it offers a stark contrast with much of her political career. From the moment she was appointed as Congress\u2019 overseer of the bank bailout funds in 2009, Warren made clear she thought the Obama administration was too cozy with Wall Street. As a senator during Obama\u2019s second term, she adhered to that stance as she sank the nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury job and joined with Sanders in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But when HuffPost asked Warren which of Obama\u2019s policy decisions she blamed for contributing to the Democrats\u2019 historic losses of federal and state legislative seats under his watch, she\u00a0declined to directly answer. Without naming Obama or any of his policies though, she managed to issue a broad indictment of Democratic messaging in recent years. \u201cFor far too long, we have not gotten out and made the case for investing not in the top, but investing in the rest of America. We make that case, I believe we\u2019re going to win in 2020, and that\u2019s up and down\u201d the ballot, she said. Warren\u2019s approach has won her praise from unexpected quarters. Asked whether criticism he directs at Sanders for veering too way to the left of Obama extended to Warren, Third Way\u2019s Kessler, who blasted her in the pages of The Wall Street Journal in December 2013, replied, \u201cShe\u2019s running an excellent campaign.\u201d Other candidates have laid out ambitious environmental plans that go well beyond anything Obama proposed. O\u2019Rourke would place a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands \u2015 drilling that Obama encouraged. And Washington Gov. Jay Inslee wants to launch a massive green infrastructure program, far more ambitious than the carbon pricing and regulatory approach Obama favored. Some candidates have already tacitly acknowledged that shaking Biden free from his lead in the polls might require gently taking on the Obama legacy that helps buoy him. Without mentioning either Obama or Biden, Booker has added a section to his stump speech that asks voters to look beyond a restoration of the pre-Trump status quo. \u201cIf you want somebody to run for president and the only thing you want is to beat Donald Trump \u2014 well, I can beat Donald Trump, but I\u2019m telling you that that\u2019s the wrong measure,\u201d he told a crowd in Berlin, New Hampshire, earlier this month. \u201cWe all should be demanding so much more, because the problems of the (state\u2019s rural) north country, the problems of Newark, New Jersey \u2015 so many of our challenges were going on well before Donald Trump was president of the United States,\u201d he said. But Third Way\u2019s Kessler argues that creating distance from Obama is a failed political strategy. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat running for president and you\u2019re running from the Obama legacy, you\u2019re doomed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no space for it in the Democratic primary.\u201d He may have a point. In conversations with over two dozen New Hampshire voters in mid-May, all but a few Democrats were effusive in their praise for the former face of the party. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect. He was great,\u201d said Dick Farrell, a retired teacher attending a town hall Booker conducted in Berlin. Obama \u201cknew how to listen to people and truly listen and formulate his ideas off some common sense that he heard.\u201d Even those who conceded that they wished for more progress on some issues during his presidency largely attributed the disappointments to Republican obstruction. \u201cHe had a tough row to hoe because he had no cooperation from the Senate,\u201d said George Embley, a retired engineer attending a recent town hall Gillibrand conducted in Warner, New Hampshire. \u201cMitch McConnell!\u201d interjected Sally, his wife, referring to the Senate GOP leader from Kentucky who from Day One made clear his objective was to thwart Obama. Vivian Dolkart, a retired psychiatric nurse also at the Gillibrand event, mentioned the Senate\u2019s refusal to even grant Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing. Obama \u201cwas damned no matter what he did,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he had not extended an olive branch, he would have been criticized for that.\u201d So for Biden\u2019s rivals, a safer way to take on the \u201cObama-Biden\u201d juggernaut may be to divorce the former vice president from his more popular former boss. And Biden\u2019s decades-long record as a lawmaker is replete with controversial votes and stances that Obama had no part in. Even before Harris challenged Biden on the busing issue at last week\u2019s debate, Democratic contenders had signaled that his pre-White House record is fair game. Over the Memorial Day weekend, Booker called the Biden-authored 1994 crime bill \u201cshameful.\u201d\u00a0Sanders has repeatedly sought to contrast his opposition to the Iraq War and various international trade agreements with Biden\u2019s support for them. Warren is likely to reignite a debate over a 2005 bill Biden backed that made it harder for households to declare bankruptcy. She and Biden clashed bitterly over the legislation, with Warren \u2015 then an activist law professor \u2015 arguing vehemently against it. Shortly after Biden announced his presidential candidacy in April, Warren told reporters who asked about the dispute, \u201cJoe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.\u201d By contrast, Obama, who had arrived in the Senate just a few months earlier, was one of only 25 senators to vote against the legislation.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "NEW ORLEANS, July 9 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court panel grilled Democratic attorneys general on Tuesday about whether Obamacare violates the U.S. Constitution, as it weighs whether to uphold a Texas judge\u2019s ruling striking down the landmark healthcare reform law. The judges focused on whether the 2010 Affordable Care Act lost its justification after Republican President Donald Trump in 2017 signed a law that eliminated a tax penalty used to enforce the ACA\u2019s mandate that all Americans buy health insurance. Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal Obamacare since its 2010 passage. The Justice Department would normally defend a federal law, but the Trump administration has declined to take that position against a challenge by 18 Republican-led states. \u201cIf you no longer have a tax, why isn\u2019t it unconstitutional?\u201d Judge Jennifer Elrod, who was appointed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals by Republican President GeorgeW. Bush, asked attorneys for the Democratic officials defending the law during a hearing in New Orleans. A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general led by California\u2019s Xavier Becerra stepped up to defend the law. The U.S. House of Representatives intervened after Democrats won control in November\u2019s elections during which many focused their campaigns on defending Obamacare. A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, is not expected to decide on Tuesday whether to overturn or uphold the ruling by a federal judge in Texas last year that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. An appellate ruling declaring Obamacare unconstitutional could prompt an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, opening the door for the top court to take up the issue in the midst of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Obamacare, the signature domestic achievement of Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, has been a political flashpoint since its passage. Republican opponents call the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets, while supporters say striking it down would threaten the healthcare of 20 million people who have gained insurance since its enactment. In 2012, a divided U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of its provisions, including the individual mandate, which requires people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate compelled healthy people to buy insurance to offset sicker patients\u2019 costs after Obamacare barred insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority argued that Congress could not constitutionally order people to buy insurance. But Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberal members to hold the mandate was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 tax power. After Trump signed a tax bill passed by a Republican-led Congress that reduced the tax penalty to zero dollars, a coalition of Republican-led states headed by Texas sued, alleging the tax penalty\u2019s elimination rendered Obamacare unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, agreed in December 2018, saying the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it no longer triggered a tax. O\u2019Connor, who was also nominated by George W. Bush, said that because Obamacare called the mandate \u201cessential,\u201d the entire law must be struck down.

      "content": " Say this about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: He\u2019s consistent, especially when he has a chance to sneak in a dig at former President Barack Obama. That\u2019s what the Kentucky senator did on Tuesday when he was asked for his reaction to an NBC News report\u00a0that showed two of his great-great-grandfathers owned slaves, according to U.S. census records. All told, the two men,\u00a0James McConnell and Richard Daley, owned at least 14 slaves in Limestone County, Alabama. McConnell snidely used the report to declare common ground with Obama. \u201cYou know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,\u201d McConnell said at a press conference. \u201cWe both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.\u201d McConnell is correct about Obama\u2019s position on reparations:\u00a0During the 2008 presidential campaign Obama did speak out against offering them to the descendants of slaves. Instead, he said that the government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools, health care and the economy for all, according to The Associated Press. And while many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have openly called for reparations, Obama stuck by his stance in a 2016 interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates.\u00a0Of course, Obama\u2019s stated reasons for opposing reparations have been practical and political considerations, whereas McConnell has simply argued that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d As for Obama\u2019s ancestors owning slaves, that\u2019s also correct with a little more nuance. Back in 2007, an amateur genealogical researcher named William Reitwiesner published a history of Obama\u2019s mother\u2019s family suggesting the future president\u2019s great-great-great-great grandfather George Washington Overall owned two slaves in Kentucky,\u00a0The Guardian reported. In addition, Obama\u2019s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother also owned two slaves. However, in 2012, Ancestry.com released a report linking the president to John Punch, America\u2019s first documented African slave for life. CNN reported that the connection came not from Obama\u2019s African-born father, but from his white mother. McConnell has used Obama to shut down any serious discussion of reparations in Congress. Last month, he said that civil rights legislation \u2015 and\u00a0Obama\u2019s presidency\u00a0\u2015 prove reparations are unnecessary.",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " Britain\u2019s now former ambassador to the U.S. was convinced last year that President Donald Trump scrapped the Iran nuclear pact in part simply because it was forged by his White House predecessor,\u00a0Barack Obama, according to another leaked diplomatic memo. Sir Kim Darroch declared that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to \u201cdiplomatic vandalism,\u201d\u00a0the Daily Mail reported on Saturday, quoting the cable. The newspaper\u00a0obtained an earlier set of leaked cables from Darroch blasting Trump as a man who \u201cradiates insecurity\u201d and his administration as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201cinept.\u201d The leaks resulted in a vicious attack on Darroch by Trump and the envoy\u2019s resignation on Wednesday. In the latest leaked cables to his government, Darroch said the Trump administration was \u201cset upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons \u2014 it was Obama\u2019s deal,\u201d the newspaper reported, referring to the Iranian pact. \u201cMoreover, they can\u2019t articulate any \u2018day-after\u2019 strategy; and contacts with State Department this morning suggest no sort of plan for reaching out to partners and allies, whether in Europe or the region,\u201d Darroch wrote, according to the Mail. Darroch also referred to disagreements within the administration, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0distancing himself from Trump\u2019s decision. Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton were unable to \u201carticulate why the president was determined to withdraw, beyond his campaign promises,\u201d Darroch reportedly wrote. He said in a second cable that Trump signed a memo to withdraw from the pact \u201cfollowing a typically hyperbolic statement on the nature of the \u2018murderous\u2019 Iranian regime,\u201d according to the newspaper. Darroch wrote the memos in May of last year after a failed trip to the U.S. by then-British foreign secretary Boris Johnson,\u00a0who attempted to talk Trump into sticking with the nuclear agreement. The latest bombshell erupted just as reports emerged that investigators had identified a suspect who they believed leaked the cables to the Mail. Both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt \u2014 Tory rivals in a bid to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister \u2014 criticized a Scotland Yard official for warning journalists that they could face prison for publishing government documents. Hunt said he would \u201cdefend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them and judge them to be in the public interest,\u201d The Guardian reported. Johnson said that prosecuting journalists in such a situation\u00a0\u201cwould amount to an infringement on press freedom.\u201d There was no immediate word about the new cable revelations from the White House.",

The statue, which was unveiled at the Elks Theatre in Rapid City on Saturday, depicts the former president waving one hand while holding hands with his younger daughter, who is also waving her other hand. The design was inspired by a photo of the former president with Sasha Obama at his first inauguration, the Rapid City Journal reported. Barack Obama joins other past U.S. presidents who were memorialized in the downtown area as part of the City of Presidents project that was launched in 2000 under the Rapid City Historic District Tour. The project aims to \u201chonor the legacy of the American presidency\u201d with sculptures positioned along the city\u2019s streets and sidewalks, its website states. Painter and sculptor James Van Nuys, who created the Barack Obama statue, told the Journal he was happy the board chose the design with Barack Obama and Sasha Obama. Dallerie Davis, the project\u2019s co-founder, said the group previously considered depicting Barack Obama waving by himself, before deciding on the final design. \u201cOne of us said, \u2018This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,\u2019\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cA man waving is not a showstopper.\u201d All of the sculptures are privately funded, the project\u2019s website states. The Barack Obama sculpture has been designated to sit at the corner of Saint Joseph and 4th Streets in Rapid City, according to the project\u2019s website. Van Nuys told the crowd at the unveiling ceremony on Saturday that he felt a connection to the inauguration image of Barack Obama and Sasha Obama as a father himself, according to a live taping\u00a0by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting radio station. He shared that his daughter was his best friend when she was growing up, so seeing Barack Obama as a \u201cdad with his daughter\u201d held a special meaning for him.",

      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " President Barack Obama\u00a0on Wednesday mourned the death of former Supreme Court Justice\u00a0John Paul Stevens, who died the day before at age 99. Stevens retired from the high court in 2010 after serving on the bench for almost 35 years. He was the third-longest-serving justice of the Supreme Court. He died in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a stroke. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known Justice John Paul Stevens for all of his 99 years, but I\u2019m lucky enough to have known him for some of them,\u201d\u00a0Obama, who was president when Stevens retired, said in a statement. \u201cHe was a good man, a decent man. And our country is better because of his leadership and his example.\u201d \u201cFor more than 34 years on the bench at the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens heard cases with a level of grace, humility, and fidelity to our highest ideals that we should hope all our public servants strive for,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHis balancing of legal precedent with the Constitution\u2019s call for equal justice and an understanding of Americans\u2019 daily lives helped the court \u2014 and the country \u2014 navigate controversial and defining questions of who we are and who we can be. And in doing so with his signature pragmatism and modesty, he played a pivotal role in carrying forward our founding promise into today.\u201d Republican President Gerald Ford nominated Stevens, also a Republican, to the Supreme Court in 1975. Although he told The New York Times Magazine in 2007 that he thought of himself as \u201cpretty darn conservative,\u201d Stevens is often considered a liberal champion of the court. The justice wrote majority opinions on a wide range of issues, including abortion rights, capital punishment, school prayer and campaign-finance reform. Stevens led the high court\u2019s efforts to uphold legal protections for Guantanamo Bay prisoners after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration argued after the 9/11 attacks that prisoners there were not entitled to access to U.S. courts because they were not U.S. citizens and were being held on American soil. In retirement, Stevens remained an outspoken critic of the U.S. policy of detaining enemy combatants in Guantanamo without charges. In May 2012, Obama awarded Stevens a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, for his decadeslong career upholding the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \u201cKnown for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Justice Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law, and the separation of powers,\u201d the White House said at the time.

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Friday sniped at Democrats over the investigations he\u2019s been threatened with and deflected the issue by saying former President Barack Obama should be investigated instead. Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that they should be concerned about Obama\u2019s book deal but didn\u2019t specify which one. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace what the Democrats are doing,\u201d Trump said of the calls for investigations into his 2016 campaign and possible obstruction of justice. \u201cLet\u2019s look into Obama the way they looked at me. They could look into the book deal that President Obama made,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cLet\u2019s subpoena all of his records.\u201d He also called for lawmakers to investigate his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, which he\u2019s been insisting on for years. In 2017, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama signed a joint book deal with Penguin Random House reportedly worth more than $65 million, according to the Financial Times. The former president is working on a memoir as part of that deal, which is expected to be released in 2020 as the presidential campaigns heat up. Michelle Obama published her popular memoir, \u201cBecoming,\u201d last year. There are two other books under Barack Obama\u2019s belt, both written before his presidency. \u201cDreams From my Father,\u201d a memoir, was published in 1995, and \u201cThe Audacity of Hope\u201d was released in 2006. This is the first time Trump has publicly claimed a conspiracy involving Obama\u2019s book deal, making the rant appear to be a distraction after former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony Wednesday. Before two House committees in back-to-back hearings, Mueller testified that Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice after he left office and said that the president had not been entirely truthful in his written answers for the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller also refuted Trump\u2019s claims of \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d on the allegations investigated, confirming that the report did not exonerate Trump from any crimes. Trump continues to claim that the special counsel probe yielded nothing incriminating and said as much again Friday. \u201cI watched Bob Mueller and they have nothing. There is no collusion, there is no obstruction, they have nothing. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said.",

Jarrett was notably the subject of a racist and Islamophobic tweet by disgraced comedian Roseanne Barr comparing Jarrett to the \u201cPlanet of the Apes.\u201d During a town hall discussion in May of last year, Jarrett addressed the comments by Barr, a vocal Trump supporter, by noting \u201ctone does start at the top.\u201d \u201cWe like to look up to our president, and feel as though he reflects the values of our country,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBut I also think every individual citizen has a responsibility too.\u201d The co-signers of the letter noted their support for the four freshman congresswoman often referred to as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d \u201cWe stand with congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, as well as all those currently under attack by President Trump, along with his supporters and his enablers, who feel deputized to decide who belongs here \u2014 and who does not,\u201d the letter read. It continued, \u201cThere is truly nothing more un-American than calling on fellow citizens to leave our country \u2014 by citing their immigrant roots, or ancestry, or their unwillingness to sit in quiet obedience while democracy is being undermined.\u201d Read the entire op-ed in The Washington Post here.",

I was not the president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI keep my recommendation to him private.\u201d Biden noted repeatedly that Obama enacted pro-immigrant policies \u2014 like legal protections for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children \u2014 and made a major push for comprehensive immigration reform. That reform push ultimately failed because congressional GOP leaders refused to take it up, in spite of the years of high deportation figures that were intended, in part, to convince Republicans that Democrats weren\u2019t soft on unauthorized immigration. Obama later shifted his policies and his deportation figures dropped. Now, with President Donald Trump in office, Democrats are unified in support of comprehensive immigration reform and in opposition to the current president\u2019s policies, including separating children from parents. But the particulars of the immigration policy debate have shifted. So far this cycle, one of the main issues at hand has been whether to repeal the law that makes it a criminal offense to cross the border without authorization. Decriminalizing that type of migration would mean that immigrants could still face deportation or civil penalties for crossing \u2015 but they couldn\u2019t be criminally prosecuted, which is how the Trump administration was able to split up immigrant families last year. Much like during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, the candidates were divided into two camps regarding immigration: those who insisted that nothing needs to be done beyond removing Trump and those who wanted to repeal the law. Biden opposes decriminalizing migration, and said that Trump is the reason the law is being abused. He also pointed out that opponent Juli\u00e1n Castro, the top booster of decriminalization, served in the Obama administration too, as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cMr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past,\u201d Castro responded, \u201cand one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "content": " Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J) says he wouldn\u2019t be running for president if former President Barack Obama could run for a third term in the White House. On Thursday, Booker appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d to talk about the second Democratic debate that took place on Wednesday. Host John Berman addressed the several mentions of Obama during the debate and told Booker that he heard critiques that Obama was too far right. In response, Booker said that he missed Obama and that while he wasn\u2019t \u201cperfect,\u201d he \u201cwould take him back. Heck, if [Obama] was running for president for a third term, I wouldn\u2019t be running.\u201d The presidential hopeful went on to say that Trump \u201cis a guy that my Republican colleagues can\u2019t even criticize when he\u2019s preaching racism.\u201d Booker later added: \u201cThe reality is we have a situation right now where the president is doing things to this country that are perverting our very values and ideals, and talking about what our plans would be, different than the previous president; different than the current president, is not a bad thing.\u201d On Wednesday, Booker went head to head with former Vice President Joe Biden over several issues, getting particularly heated on criminal justice. \u201cIf you want to compare records \u2015 and frankly, I\u2019m shocked that you do \u2015 I am happy to do that,\u201d said Booker at one point. Ahead of the debate, Booker called Biden\u2019s new criminal justice proposal \u201can inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country.\u201d In response, Biden\u2019s team said \u201cthe absurdity of this attack\u201d was \u201cobvious.\u201d Booker went on the offensive with Biden on the issue, calling out the 76-year-old\u2019s past positions. \u201cSince the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,\u201d said Booker. \u201cAnd those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can\u2019t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.\u201d When Biden responded, he defended himself by saying what he believes about the issue now and called out Booker for not doing enough to reform Newark, New Jersey, when he was mayor. Booker pushed back hard, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in my community that you\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don\u2019t even know the flavor. You are trying to shift the view from what you created.\u201d \u201cThere are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough-on-crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine. This isn\u2019t about the past. This is about the present right now,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " Following a contentious debate among Democratic White House contenders Wednesday, a number of party leaders aren\u2019t thrilled that some of the candidates focused on attacking former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as a way to challenge Joe Biden. In one of the debate\u2019s\u00a0hottest exchanges, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called out the former vice president \u2015 the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race \u2015 for repeatedly using Obama\u2019s name to shield himself from criticism directed his way on issues like criminal justice and immigration. \u201cMr. vice president, you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker said, referring to Biden\u2019s \u2015 and Obama\u2019s \u2015 record on immigration, which saw a record number of undocumented immigrants deported during their eight-year administration. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Biden defended himself by noting Obama\u2019s decision to select him as his running mate, saying, \u201cBarack Obama knew exactly who I was.\u201d Also taking Biden to task on the deportation figures was Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 a particularly striking moment, since the Texan served in Obama\u2019s administration as secretary of housing and urban development. Biden spotlighted that, responding to Castro,\u00a0\u201cThe secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. Castro retorted: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d Polls show Obama remains a popular figure among all voters, with approval ratings easily outstripping those for President Donald Trump.\u00a0And among Democrats, Obama remains by far the most admired politician. Booker, in comments to CNN\u00a0on Thursday, insisted it wasn\u2019t a negative to reconsider part of the record of the Obama administration as part of the process of choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are \u201chaving an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible,\u201d Booker said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure (if) Barack Obama was sitting here ... He will tell you, \u2018I made some mistakes.\u2019\u201d But several of Booker\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues expressed concern about the tactic, arguing it would needlessly expose divisions in the party and take the focus off of Trump and his administration. \u201cI think attacking President Obama is bad policy and bad politics,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Of Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president, Blumenthal added: \u201cHe owns it, for better or worse. But he should be proud of it.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also suggested the Democratic race should be marked by a more hands-off approach toward Obama. \u201cYou can disagree with him, and I have, but the bottom line is ... he did an extraordinary job, and he should be given that recognition by those that are running for the presidency.\u201d Others who watched the debate expressed similar sentiments, including longtime Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged his party\u2019s White House contenders to train their sights firmly on Trump. \u201cI think President Obama is a very popular figure in America to this day because he did a very good job. Did he accomplish everything? No,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Thursday, \u201cYou compare the Obama administration to this administration \u2015 it\u2019s night and day.\u201d Veteran Republican political consultant John Weaver \u2015 a fierce Trump critic \u2015was blunter:",

Castro has proposed to decriminalize illegal border crossings, making it a civil violation and preventing future administrations from separating families at the border. \u201cPresident Obama was trying and that administration made adjustments and improved on immigration,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cHowever, Trump has weaponized a certain section of the law to inflict cruelty on migrant children and their parents, so there are lessons we can learn from this.\u201d After his time was up, Castro told reporters backstage that he feels the news media was playing into the Biden campaign\u2019s hands by framing his criticism of the vice president as an attack on the Obama administration. The Democratic primary debate on Wednesday heated up when several candidates, including Castro, piled on Biden over the record number of deportations made under the Obama administration. Biden suggested that Castro\u2019s plan to decriminalize border crossings was unnecessary, to which Castro replied: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential golf costs have topped $110 million in his 2 1/2 years in office \u2013 more than $4 million more than a conservative group\u2019s estimate for predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s total travel costs over two full terms. Trump arrived at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Friday evening and is scheduled to remain there through Sunday afternoon. It is his 18th golf trip there since taking office. Sunday will mark his 67th day at that course and his 199th day at a golf course he owns. The White House on Saturday did not respond to queries about Trump\u2019s golf activities. Each of the president\u2019s trips to Bedminster costs taxpayers at least $1.1 million in travel and security expenses, according to a HuffPost analysis. Each trip to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida \u2013 of which Trump has made 24 \u2013 costs taxpayers $3.4 million. Since taking office, Trump also has visited his golf resorts in Los Angeles; Doral, Florida; Doonbeg, Ireland; and Turnberry, Scotland \u2015 all on the taxpayer dime. He also has made 64 day trips to his course in northern Virginia. Judicial Watch, a tax-exempt conservative group, in 2017 said that its tally of Obama\u2019s travel costs based on documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act lawsuits had hit $105.7 million. That total, though, appears to include official trips of Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, as well as some campaign-related travel that was partially reimbursed by the Democratic Party. Trump\u2019s $110.3 million total in HuffPost\u2019s analysis is for travel to and from golf vacations, and does not include official or campaign travel. It is based on cost elements derived from a Government Accountability Office report released in January that detailed four Mar-a-Lago trips Trump took just weeks after entering office. Judicial Watch did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. A review of its web site shows that it remains focused on attacking 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former FBI director James Comey and former special counsel Robert Mueller. During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump was a frequent critic of Obama\u2019s golf hobby. \u201cCan you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in 2014. During his campaign for president, Trump claimed that he would be too busy working to have time for any vacations at all. \u201cI love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Turnberry again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Doral again,\u201d he told a rally audience in February 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see anything. I just want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.\u201d Instead, Trump has been on the golf course two and a half times as much as Obama was at the same time in his presidency. And, because he insists on playing on his own courses in Florida and New Jersey so much, his golf-related costs to taxpayers are triple that of Obama\u2019s in the same time period. Most of Obama\u2019s golf rounds were played at military bases within motorcade range of the White House, which cost taxpayers relatively little. In contrast, 68% of Trump\u2019s golf days have been at his resorts that require the use of Air Force jets, Marine Corps helicopters, and Air Force transport planes to move his motorcade vehicles. His trips to Mar-a-Lago also require Coast Guard boats and ships to patrol the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. On his overseas golf outings, the travel footprint is even larger. Trump\u2019s recent trip to Doonbeg, Ireland, for example, cost taxpayers some $3.6 million, even though it involved relatively short flights to and from southern England and northern France.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0defended former President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration record on Saturday, even as he conceded that they both learned from the failure of their tough approach early on in which they tried to win over Republican lawmakers. Biden was one of 19 Democratic presidential candidates to speak at a candidate forum hosted by the public-sector labor union AFSCME in Las Vegas on Saturday. Jon Ralston of The Nevada Independent, who moderated the discussion alongside HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel, asked Biden to elaborate on how he feels about the Obama administration\u2019s record volume of deportations of undocumented immigrants in its first term. \u201cWe learned a lot in the process,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen the president got elected, everything landed on his desk but locusts. We were about to go into a depression.\u201d He went on to imply that the Obama administration employed a tough approach to border enforcement and unauthorized immigration partly in the misplaced hope that it would lay the groundwork for a bipartisan immigration reform bill. \u201cWe thought at the beginning we might be able to get a more rational approach to the way we dealt with, for example, immigration,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBy the middle of the term, it was clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen and things changed.\u201d The changes the administration implemented included executive orders aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants who arrived as children \u2015 those known as Dreamers \u2015 and their parents, the former vice president noted. Ralston pressed Biden to reveal any details about how he might have advocated against the deportations behind closed doors during Obama\u2019s first term. But Biden reiterated what he said during the presidential debate on Wednesday night \u2015 that he does not reveal his discussions with Obama behind closed doors. \u201cThe focus was on deporting felons,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cComparing what he did to what Trump did is just absolutely off the wall \u2015 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d (No Democratic candidate has actually compared Obama\u2019s policies to those of President Donald Trump.) In a subsequent exchange with Terkel, Biden confirmed that he does not support changing unauthorized border crossing from a crime to a civil penalty. Doing so \u201cwill be an invitation\u201d for more undocumented immigrants to take their chances by just showing up at the border, he argued. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is keep parents in difficult circumstances from giving their children to a coyote\u201d to transport them to the border. Since the candidate forum was hosted by AFSCME, which is celebrating the passage of a Nevada law granting state workers collective bargaining rights, much of Saturday\u2019s discussion focused on the priorities of union workers. Terkel asked Biden how he responded to criticism of the Obama administration for not pushing harder to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize by ratifying their majority through card check and thereby avoiding employer intimidation. \u201cWe pressed and pressed,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, there were other things happening as well.\u201d He went on to attribute it to the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, even though most of the criticism faults the Obama administration for failing to pass it in its first two years in power, when Democrats controlled both branches of government. \u201cWe did not have a Democratic Congress to be able to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would.\u201d",

He put out a statement Monday, after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, claimed at least 31 lives and injured dozens more over the weekend. During his presidency, Obama spoke after more than\u00a0a dozen mass shootings, and memorably wept as he gave a speech\u00a0in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cNo other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cEvery time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders. \u2026 But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings.\u201d In El Paso, the shooter reportedly penned an anti-immigrant manifesto and was motivated by racist, white supremacist ideology. In his statement, Obama called for both law enforcement and internet platforms to increase efforts to reduce the influence of hate groups in radicalizing troubled individuals. He called on the country to \u201csend a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy.\u201d Though he did not name anyone in particular, much of what Obama condemned was speech used by his presidential successor, Donald Trump. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\u201d the former president wrote. Trump\u00a0has faced heavy criticism for his own role in promoting the anti-immigrant rhetoric that the El Paso shooter espoused. In a statement Monday, Trump condemned white supremacy and racism, but did not acknowledge how his own comments had fueled such beliefs. \u201cSuch language isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cIt has no place in our politics and our public life.

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama commemorated the life and legacy of author Toni Morrison, who died Monday night\u00a0at the age of 88, honoring \u201cher masterful will\u201d and her \u201cfusion of the African American story within the American story.\u201d \u201cToni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful \u2014 a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy,\u201d he said in a statement. Time is no match for Toni Morrison. In her writing, she sometimes toyed with it, warping and creasing it, bending it to her masterful will. In her life\u2019s story, too, she treated time nontraditionally. A child of the Great Migration who\u2019d lifted up new, more diverse voices in American literature as an editor, Toni didn\u2019t publish her first novel until she was 39 years old. From there followed an ascendant career\u2014a Pulitzer, a Nobel, and so much more\u2014and with it, a fusion of the African American story within the American story. Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful\u2014a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories\u2014that our stories\u2014will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time. As president, Obama awarded the trailblazing author the Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 2012, honoring her career in centering the lives and histories of African Americans. \u201cAs a single mother working at a publishing company by day, she would carve out a little time in the evening to write, often with her two sons pulling on her hair and tugging at her earrings. Once, a baby spit up on her tablet so she wrote around it. Circumstances may not have been ideal, but the words that came out were magical,\u201d Obama said at the ceremony. \u201cToni Morrison\u2019s prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt.\u00a0 From \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 to \u2018Beloved,\u2019 Toni reaches us deeply, using a tone that is lyrical, precise, distinct, and inclusive,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe believes that language \u2018arcs toward the place where meaning might lie.\u2019 The rest of us are lucky to be following along for the ride.\u201d \u201cI remember reading \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write, but also how to be and how to think,\u201d he added later, referring to her 1977 novel. Obama also cited Morrison while reflecting on his favorite books during an interview with then-New York Times\u00a0book critic Michiko Kakutani, shortly before he left office in 2017. \u201cI think Toni Morrison\u2019s writings \u2014 particularly \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat it\u2019s not just pain, but there\u2019s joy and glory and mystery.\u201d Former first lady Michelle Obama has also mentioned the book as a source of inspiration. In 2018, she told The New York Times\u00a0that she has read the novel three times. \u201cI rarely have time to reread books, but \u2018Song of Solomon,\u2019 every time I pick it up, I\u2019m pulled into that story,\u201d she told\u00a0Today show host Jenna Bush Hager\u00a0earlier this year. Morrison, best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u201cBeloved,\u201d died Monday night\u00a0in New York City of unspecified causes, her publisher, Knopf, said Tuesday. In 1993, she became the first Black woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In a rare step for her, Morrison endorsed Obama in 2008,\u00a0writing in a letter\u00a0that she chose the then-Illinois senator over his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, for his \u201ccreative imagination,\u201d calling him \u201cthe man for this time.\u201d In thinking carefully about the strengths of the candidates, I stunned myself when I came to the following conclusion: that in addition to keen intelligence, integrity and a rare authenticity, you exhibit something that has nothing to do with age, experience, race or gender and something I don\u2019t see in other candidates. That something is a creative imagination which coupled with brilliance equals wisdom. It is too bad if we associate it only with gray hair and old age. Or if we call searing vision na\u00efvet\u00e9. Or if we believe cunning is insight. Or if we settle for finessing cures tailored for each ravaged tree in the forest while ignoring the poisonous landscape that feeds and surrounds it. Wisdom is a gift; you can\u2019t train for it, inherit it, learn it in a class, or earn it in the workplace\u2013that access can foster the acquisition of knowledge, but not wisdom. In 2012,\u00a0she told The Guardian\u00a0that attending Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009 was \u201cthe first time she felt truly American.\u201d \u201cI felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid. The marines and the flag, which I never look at \u2014 all of a sudden it looked \u2026 nice. Worthy,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt only lasted a couple of hours. But I was amazed, that music that I really don\u2019t like \u2014 God Bless America is a dumb song; I mean it\u2019s not beautiful. But I really felt that, for that little moment.\u201d",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " President Donald Trump is weighing his options for executive action on gun control following a pair of mass shootings that killed more than 30 people, according to the White House. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, actually did take executive action on gun control not long after a gunman slaughtered 26 children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012.\u00a0And one of Trump\u2019s first actions as president was to undo an Obama regulation that would have blocked some people with mental impairments from buying guns. The rule, which became effective just two days before Trump took office, required the Social Security Administration (SSA) to inform the FBI\u2019s criminal background check system about disabled adults receiving benefits through a representative because a mental impairment limited their ability to manage finances. The Department of Veterans Affairs has long followed a similar policy, which accounts for the bulk of mental incompetency referrals to the background check system from federal agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most of the 4.6 million records prohibiting gun sales due to mental incompetency in the database as of 2016 came from state and local authorities. The SSA\u00a0finalized the rule at the end of 2016, a year in which Obama touted several gun control reforms he\u2019d undertaken without help from Congress.\u00a0\u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can\u2019t hold America hostage,\u201d Obama said on Twitter that year. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this carnage in our communities.\u201d Because Obama pursued the policy involving the SSA through regulation, however, Congress had an easy time overturning it once Trump assumed the White House. Thanks to a special legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act, Republicans undid more than a dozen regulations that had been finalized late in Obama\u2019s second term. Gun control advocates such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence applauded the mental incapacity rule, but its critics included civil liberty and disability advocates. The rule would have restricted firearms sales for roughly 80,000 people, though the restrictions could be appealed. \u201cThe thousands of Americans whose disability benefits are managed by someone else range from young people with depression and financial inexperience to older adults with Down syndrome needing help with a limited budget,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union said in a February 2017 statement. \u201cBut no data \u2015 none \u2015 show that these individuals have a propensity for violence in general or gun violence in particular.\u201d Research shows\u00a0that most mass shooters don\u2019t have severe mental health problems. The man arrested in the killing of 22 people in El Paso on Saturday allegedly wrote that he was doing it to fight an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants, echoing the president\u2019s racist rhetoric. Trump said Wednesday that background checks and mental health policies, rather than restrictions on types of firearms, are his main focus. He told reporters that he\u2019s hoping Republicans and Democrats in Congress can agree on gun control legislation focused on those topics. Administration officials have said they\u2019re also looking at addressing the matters through executive action, though they haven\u2019t specified what they have in mind. Last year, the Trump administration used its executive authority to ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as illegal machine guns. Bump stocks helped a gunman massacre 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017. White House spokespeople did not reply to a request for comment on whether the president would favor bringing back the restriction on firearms for mentally impaired Social Security recipients. One complication looms for such a move \u2015 federal agencies are not supposed to be able to reissue regulations struck down by the Congressional Review Act. But the Trump administration has already shown it doesn\u2019t care about that restriction. One of the Obama rules Republicans nixed in 2017 had to do with drug testing the jobless; the Trump administration brought it back last year in a tougher form.",

If the petition is successful, Trump Tower, the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire and where he maintains a residence, will boast a new address: 725 President Barack H. Obama Ave. The petition on MoveOn.org\u00a0\u2015 which has attracted a number of famous supporters, including actors Patricia Arquette and Marg Helgenberger \u2015 asks New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city leaders to rename the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets after Obama in honor of his achievements as president. Los Angeles recently renamed a stretch of highway near downtown after Obama, the MoveOn.org petition page says. \u201cWe request the New York City Mayor and City Council do the same by renaming a block of Fifth Avenue after the former president whose many accomplishments include: saving our nation from the Great Recession; serving two completely scandal-free terms in office; and taking out Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind September 11th, which killed over 3,000 New Yorkers,\u201d the page reads. Elizabeth Rowin, the petition\u2019s organizer,\u00a0told Newsweek\u00a0that she\u2019d initially launched the campaign \u201cas a joke.\u201d But she\u2019s since reached out to the City Council, she said \u2015 \u201cseveral\u201d of whom responded with assurances that they would look into the request. As Newsweek noted, however, Rowin\u2019s petition fails to meet one important requirement for street renaming in New York. City rules dictate that the person being honored should be deceased. Rowin said she\u2019s confident that rules could be tweaked in this case. \u201cI am sure the conditions can be changed. There are two streets in L.A. named after former President Obama. These laws are arbitrary and can be worked around,\u201d she said.",

      "subtitle": "Under Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement highlighted stats that those arrested at the border were criminals. Most had broken only immigration laws.",
      "author": "Roque Planas",
      "content": " Throughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he justified the record number of deportations carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement by pointing to the high number of criminals deported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security,\u201d Obama said in a 2014 speech announcing executive action to shield parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. \u201cFelons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids.\u201d By Obama\u2019s last year in office, publicly released data showed that 58% of deportees had a criminal conviction. More than 99% of deportees met one of the agency\u2019s removal priorities. But data obtained this month by HuffPost through a Freedom of Information Act request reveals the most serious crime committed by more than half of the migrants arrested at the border and tagged as criminal deportees during Obama\u2019s second term was entering the country without authorization. In other words, the difference between those slapped with a criminal immigration offense and those with a clean record was that the Justice Department chose to prosecute them simply for crossing the border. Immigration violations were the most serious crimes committed by tens of thousands of others deported from within the United States and classified as priority removals over that period, despite the fact that their records differed little from non-criminals. Some 2020 Democratic candidates, including Juli\u00e1n Castro and Elizabeth Warren, are pledging to repeal the laws that make this possible. The data underscores the degree to which skyrocketing prosecutions for border-crossing violations over the last decade helped criminalize a vast swath of the deportee population, giving the impression that they posed a greater public security threat than their records indicate. \u201cThey\u2019ve been turning mere immigration law violators into criminal aliens for years in order to inflate the amount of individuals that have been removed under criminal grounds,\u201d immigration attorney Matthew Kolken told HuffPost. \u201cThese were freshly minted criminals. They weren\u2019t committing crimes in the United States.\u201d While convicts made up nearly half of those deported from the border region from 2013 to 2016, the data makes it clear that there weren\u2019t hordes of violent criminals. Traffic violations accounted for the second-highest number of criminal convictions for border deportees, making up 11% to 14% for those years. The data provided by ICE included only broad categories of crime, but previous reporting indicates that driving while intoxicated and driving without a license make up the vast majority of traffic violations on deportees\u2019 records. Only 15% of border deportees under Obama\u2019s second term had a conviction more serious than an immigration or traffic offense. A much smaller percentage committed more serious crimes. Far less than 1% of criminal migrants from the border and interior combined were convicted of a crime involving homicide, for example. Agency statistics include some deaths resulting from negligence or car crashes under that heading. \u201cI\u2019m seeing padding of the number of the people they consider to be criminals with a lot of low-level traffic violations and immigration violations,\u201d said Douglas Massey, a Princeton sociology professor and co-founder of the Mexico Migration Project, after reviewing the data. \u201cThe criminal categories are vastly inflated. The violent crimes are really small in number.\u201d Under Obama, ICE produced end-of-year reports that highlighted the number of criminals the agency deported, trumpeting the high percentage of convicted criminals. Those reports divided deportees removed from the interior from those expelled from the border region largely because the agency considered those arrested while trying to cross into the country a deportation priority regardless of whether they had criminal records. But the agency did not release detailed statistics over the Obama presidency detailing what convictions had marred individual migrants\u2019 records. Instead, ICE used a system of priority categories for those deported from the interior and recorded only whether border deportees had a criminal conviction or not. The sharp rise in prosecutions for border violations that began under George W. Bush\u2019s presidency explains the statistical sleight of hand. In the United States, deportation is handled under civil laws by immigration authorities such as the Border Patrol and ICE. But crossing the border without authorization is also a federal crime, punishable by up to six months in prison. Re-offenders can face felony charges. The law criminalizing illegal entry, authored\u00a0in 1929 by segregationist Sen. Coleman Blease of South Carolina\u00a0and now known as Section 1325, made up a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions by the 1990s. Instead, Border Patrol agents routinely walked unauthorized migrants back to the other side of the border or referred them for deportation proceedings in immigration court. But starting in 2005, the departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up to create Operation Streamline, a program to prosecute migrants en masse for jumping the border, in an effort to route Central American migrants into federal jails and create a new deterrent. By 2008, immigration prosecutions had swallowed up half the federal criminal docket \u2015 a statistical trend that held true through Obama\u2019s presidency. President Donald Trump ramped up the system further by enacting a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, mandating all five federal districts that touch the border to focus still more resources on immigration prosecutions. Last year, Trump used the laws criminalizing illegal entry and reentry to carry out his widely reviled experiment with systematic family separations at the border last year. By prosecuting migrant parents traveling with their children, Trump officials channeled them into federal jails, leaving their children in the custody of immigration agencies. Immigrant rights groups and criminal justice reformers have long argued that the laws needlessly criminalize migrants, drive the expansion of privatized prisons and slap a redundant punishment on people who will have to face deportation proceedings regardless of whether they get prosecuted for illegal entry. But advocates have also long suspected that the skyrocketing illegal entry prosecutions helped both the Obama and Trump administrations pad their stats to make the deportee population appear like more of a threat than it actually is. \u201cThey\u2019re creating this illusion that so many people removed have criminal histories, but they\u2019re manufacturing this criminal history by prosecuting them for illegal entry and illegal reentry,\u201d said Zen\u00e9n Jaimes P\u00e9rez, advocacy and communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cWe know that picture starts to fall apart once you start digging into it.\u201d The broad criminal categories identified in the documents released by ICE make it difficult to know with any certainty what convictions had led the agency to classify deportees expelled from inside the country as criminals. It identifies only broad headings like \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d \u201chomicide\u201d and \u201ctraffic tickets.\u201d Those categories encompass crimes ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license to drunk driving, drug trafficking and capital murder. But there\u2019s no doubt about what the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading means. Over those four years, illegal entry and reentry accounted for 95% of the most serious criminal convictions for deportees under the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading from 2013 to 2016, according to data previously released to HuffPost. The stats did not distinguish between interior and border removals. The most serious criminal conviction for 21,000 of the migrants deported from within the United States during Obama\u2019s second term was an immigration violation \u2015 about 6.5% of all interior removals. Those convicted of illegal reentry, a felony, would have been classified as a level one priority throughout the period \u2015 the same categorization applied to terrorists and murderers. Thousands of other deportees removed from inside the country during that period had no criminal convictions at all \u2015 ranging from 17.5% in 2013 to 7.6% in Obama\u2019s last year. The number of interior deportees whose most serious offense was an immigration crime dwindled over time. That trend mirrored a drop in deportations from within the country as a whole over Obama\u2019s second term in office as his administration used both prosecutorial discretion and executive action to shield more migrants from deportation. The trend accelerated after the collapse of comprehensive immigration reform talks in the summer of 2014. Former ICE officials defended the agency\u2019s statistical work, contending that they did not intend to mislead the public. They pointed to the series of memos beginning in 2011 that aimed at prioritizing serious criminals, which account for the steady decrease in deportations from inside the country overall. And they insisted that Obama\u2019s policy of focusing on criminal convicts made more efficient use of limited deportation resources than Trump\u2019s policy of casting priorities aside. But the former officials also noted that pushing those priorities down the chain of command took time. And the administration\u2019s focus on deporting people who had been removed in the past meant that people with immigration crimes would show up in agency deportation stats. \u201cWe never felt that the number of criminal removals was padded,\u201d said Peter Vincent, who headed ICE\u2019s legal branch during the Obama administration. \u201cWe were particularly sensitive to any skewing of any statistics that would suggest or imply that the number of criminal removals were higher than in actuality.\u201d The agency struggled with certain crimes that fell into a gray area, like driving under the influence. That traffic offense often remained a priority offense because it could result in death, though prosecutors might use discretion in some cases. But though Vincent remains a vocal supporter of Obama\u2019s prosecutorial discretion policies, he acknowledged that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d implied something more serious than immigration violations \u2015 often the same ones committed by deportees with clean criminal records. \u201cWe did target recent illegal entrants as a way to dissuade individuals from attempting to cross the border,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat is different from simply categorizing everyone who crosses the border without authorization as a criminal. \u2018Criminal\u2019 has a different meaning and should be used to refer to someone who is a danger to our community or who has been convicted of a serious offense.\u201d John Sandweg, who headed ICE as an acting director under Obama, defended the use of criminal prosecutions at the border, saying that internal reports showed it worked as a more effective deterrent than civil deportation proceedings. But both in the interior of the country and along the border, the agency prioritized deporting people who had been expelled before, whether or not they had been convicted of a crime. The fact that so many people deported from the border had criminal convictions in the United States, whether they were serious or not, showed how many had spent time here in the past. \u201cThe fact that they had been previously convicted for Streamline is interesting \u2015 it\u2019s a fair data point to be thinking of,\u201d Sandweg said. \u201cBut the fact is that they were not deported because they were convicted of a silly 1325. It\u2019s because they were arrested at the border.\u201d Others viewed a clear continuity between the way ICE categorized criminals in agency statistics under Obama and the way Trump vilifies unauthorized migrants by branding them as menacing lawbreakers. Kolken, the immigration lawyer, routinely defends migrants facing prosecution for illegal reentry and the prospect of deportation at his practice in Buffalo, New York, about 1,800 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. To secure a conviction, all the prosecutor needs to do is present evidence that the defendant was deported in the past. In those cases, immigration authorities often reinstate an old order of removal while the criminal immigration charge plays out, Kolken said. Were it not for the illegal reentry charge, he would have an opportunity to try to cancel the old order and win his client a hearing. But when the old removal order gets reinstated, his client loses the opportunity to go before an immigration judge. The vast majority of his clients have no convictions on their records aside from the illegal reentry. The scenario has played out repeatedly over the years, regardless of administration. \u201cThere is very little difference between Trump calling these people \u2018bad hombres\u2019 and Obama calling these people \u2018felons, not families,\u2019\u201d Kolken said. \u201cBoth were attempting to dehumanize this population. Obama was allowed to get away with it. Thankfully, Trump can\u2019t.\u201d",

Reichert and Bognar\u2019s documentary \u2014 winner of Sundance\u2019s directing award for best U.S. documentary \u2014 chronicles what happened in 2014 when Fuyao, a Chinese glass company, resurrected a former General Motors plant outside of Dayton, Ohio, near where the filmmakers live. As the co-directors later learned, the executives worked with former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s production company, created last May in conjunction with their Netflix deal. Since then, the Obamas have largely kept their work at Netflix under wraps. This spring, they announced their first slate of projects \u2014 a range of movies and series including a biopic about Frederick Douglass, a period drama series by the screenwriter of \u201cThelma & Louise,\u201d a documentary show based on The New York Times\u2019 \u201cOverlooked\u201d obituary series and a children\u2019s show about vegetables. \u201cAmerican Factory,\u201d premiering Wednesday on Netflix, is the first of their productions to be released. Unlike the Obamas\u2019 other still-gestating projects, \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d had already been finished when Netflix and Higher Ground acquired it, so the company did not have any involvement in the making of the documentary, according to Reichert and Bognar. However, they\u2019re grateful that the Obamas\u2019 stamp of approval likely means \u201cthe film will be heard about and talked about in a much wider world than otherwise,\u201d Bognar said. In July, the documentarians met the former president and first lady in Washington. It was the day before they spoke with HuffPost, and they still seemed a bit stunned by the distinction of being the Obamas\u2019 first Netflix production. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful people,\u201d Reichert said of meeting them. \u201cIt was amazing when we heard that the president and the first lady had seen our film, and wanted to embrace it and wanted to elevate us as filmmakers. I mean, they\u2019re very much into artists and writers.\u201d Produced by Participant Media (which also recently produced Netflix\u2019s \u201cRoma\u201d and \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d),\u00a0\u201cAmerican Factory\u201d illustrates how broad economic and political questions are often cultural issues too. The documentary excels at going beyond the daily headlines about trade and globalization, showing a Chinese company establishing itself in America and getting Chinese and American employees to work side by side, and how difficulties that arise come down to fundamentally different ideas about work. Reichert and Bognar previously covered the plant\u2019s closure during the Great Recession in the 2009 HBO documentary \u201cThe Last Truck.\u201d They said they hadn\u2019t intended to revisit the subject, but realized that chronicling the American plant\u2019s rebirth under a Chinese company would make for a compelling story. The film\u2019s fly-on-the-wall view and taut editing effectively convey a sense of shifting allegiances and brewing tensions. Initially, the community welcomes Fuyao\u2019s presence and the promise of economic opportunity for the region. (Though, as some of the workers note in the film, the new jobs pay much lower than the GM jobs did.) Publicly, company executives project an image of unity, striving to integrate the Chinese and American workers and their practices. But privately, the process quickly goes south. As the film shows, Fuyao, like many companies in China, tries to circumvent many safety procedures and worker protections in the name of efficiency. The Dayton plant is expected to reach the same levels of glass production as those of Fuyao\u2019s factories in China. The Chinese workers are driven by a collective sense of mission \u2014 heightened by the Chinese executives who are seen in the film rallying the Chinese workers by using nationalist appeals to sow animosity. One section of the film tracks a group of American supervisors from the Dayton plant who visit Fuyao\u2019s headquarters in Fuzhou, China. The trip exposes fundamental differences: Chinese workers focus on uniformity and efficiency, and work long hours, getting only one or two days off per month. As a result, they look down on the American workers \u2014 who work standard eight-hour days and get weekends off \u2014 as \u201clazy\u201d and too \u201cchatty\u201d at work. Reichert and Bognar said that visiting China helped them better understand the larger context informing the differences between the Chinese and American workers. Unlike the \u201cbeating down\u201d of the American middle class over the last few decades, workers in China are \u201ccoming out of rural poverty,\u201d Reichert said, which contributes to their greater sense of optimism and commitment. \u201cThat was something really, really striking for us when we were over there, and helped us understand, more, why the American workers are not as willing to work 12-hour days,\u201d Reichert said. \u201cThe Chinese, they may not like working 12-hour days, but they\u2019re willing to do it. It\u2019s their expectation.\u201d After a string of workplace injuries due to lax safety procedures, the American workers begin to organize with the United Auto Workers. In response, the company executives engage in union-busting \u2014 a maneuver that the filmmakers emphasize is, ironically, modeled on those used by their American counterparts. Fuyao hires a \u201cunion avoidance consultant\u201d to intimidate and dissuade workers from voting to unionize. In addition to dividing workers, the union-busting takes on an added cultural element. In the film, Fuyao\u2019s billionaire chairman says he views the union organizing as the American workers trying to be \u201chostile toward the Chinese.\u201d Much of \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d is a tense and at times frustrating saga. But the documentary also seeks to humanize everyone involved. There are moments when the American and Chinese workers do attempt to get to know each other. And with the help of Chinese producers and translators, Reichert and Bognar also tell the stories of individual Chinese workers, many of whom left their families behind in China to move to Dayton. While their film succeeds as a big-picture examination of labor, manufacturing and U.S.-China relations, Reichert and Bognar stressed that they don\u2019t approach their work with a bird\u2019s-eye view in mind. \u201cWe kind of just feel our way around for months and months,\u201d Bognar said of their filming process. \u201cWe\u2019re filming, but we\u2019re also learning, getting the feel of the rhythms of the place, the who\u2019s who, the interpersonal dynamics, all that stuff.\u201d That approach of focusing on the various players allows for the film\u2019s nuanced take, Bognar said. \u201cWe wanted to put you in the shoes of both the executives and the workers, the Chinese and the Americans. It\u2019s almost like, you remember that show \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019? So you\u2019re with the aristocracy, and you\u2019re with the butlers and the maids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to go for an upstairs-downstairs feel \u2014 without judgment, so you have empathy for everyone. Even the chairman gets that internal reflection at the end, because we want you to have empathy for what his journey is too.\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d premieres Wednesday on Netflix.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign event on Friday compared the political and social unrest of the late 1960s to the current political climate, asking audience members to imagine what might have happened if President Barack Obama had been assassinated. \u201cImagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America?\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said, according to The New York Times. Biden, 76, appeared to be engaging in a rhetorical exercise aimed at impressing upon younger voters the impact of the back-to-back assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Friday\u2019s event took place on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Several dozen high school and college students were in the audience, according to the Times. He also attempted a stale compliment to the women in the room, suggesting they wouldn\u2019t want to admit their age by recalling events from the late \u201960s. Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: I think of where we are at the moment. You know, none of you men are old enough, uh, women are old enough, but a couple of you guys are old enough to remember. I graduated in 1968. Everybody before me was: Drop out, go to Haight-Ashbury, don\u2019t trust anybody over 30, everybody not get involved. I\u2019m serious. I know no woman will shake their head and acknowledge it, but you guys know what I\u2019m talking about. Right? But then what happened? Dr. Ki\u2014 I only have two political heroes. I have one hero who was my dad, but I have two political heroes were Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. My senior semester, they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America? The comments came days after Biden, during a speech in Iowa, mistakenly said Kennedy and King were killed in the 1970s. On Friday, the former vice president said those assassinations sparked his own political awakening in his 20s. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,\u201d he said to the students in the audience. \u201cWhat they did was make you realize, my God, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d",

At a press conference in France on Monday, Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama was pure and simply outsmarted. They took Crimea during his term. That was not a good thing. It could have been stopped, with the right, whatever, it could have been stopped.\u201d He added that he\u2019d \u201cmost certainly\u201d invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the group\u2019s next summit. Trump did not describe how he thought Obama should have prevented the annexation of Crimea, but said that if it had happened under his watch, he would have admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized. Of course, Trump is known for being defiantly unapologetic.\u00a0He\u2019s also known to have a penchant for\u00a0insulting the intelligence of Black people and women. Prior to his trip to France,\u00a0Trump also said\u00a0Obama \u201cwanted Russia out\u201d of the G-8 because Putin \u201coutsmarted him,\u201d suggesting the decision was solely motivated by ego. In reality, a majority of G-8 member countries \u2014 not just the United States \u2014 decided to suspend Russia from the group in 2014 because it had violated international law barring the acquisition of another country\u2019s territory through coercion or force. \u201cTo do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built. We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\u2019s constitution,\u201d Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the U.S. said in a 2014 statement. \u201cWe also strongly condemn Russia\u2019s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations.\u201d At the time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u00a0dismissed Russia\u2019s departure from the G-8 as no big deal. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is hosting this year\u2019s summit, has expressed support for Russia\u2019s readmission to the multinational group, but only if it helps resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump said Monday that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Putin would accept an invitation to return to the group, suggesting the Russian leader also had a bruised ego. \u201cHe\u2019s a proud person. Would I invite him, I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come, psychologically, I think that\u2019s a tough thing for him to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a G-8, now it\u2019s a G-7, and you invite the person that was thrown out really by President Obama, and really because he got outsmarted.\u201d",

      "author": "Sam Levine",
      "content": " A group backed by President Barack Obama will send experts to train people across the country on the ins-and-outs of redistricting as part an effort to fight excessive partisan gerrymandering. The new effort, called Redistricting U, comes as states are gearing up for the next round of redistricting, which will take place in 2021. The program will launch with trainings in dozens of cities across 10 states this fall aimed at teaching people the basics of the redistricting process. Organizers also want to connect gerrymandering to \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and hope people will leave the trainings motivated to get involved in the redistricting process in their states, said Saumya Narechania, director of advocacy and campaign manager of All On The Line, the part of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) that will lead the effort. \u201cThe movement for fair maps will determine the course of progress on every issue we care about for the next decade. And we can\u2019t wait to begin organizing when the redistricting process starts in 2021. We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2014 right now,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Obama has been involved in efforts to limit excessive partisan gerrymandering since leaving office. Last year he folded his political group, Organizing for Action, into the NDRC, a redistricting-focused group led by Eric Holder, who served as attorney general for most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The redistricting process, which takes just once per decade, is expected to be a brutal brawl for partisan advantage. The United States Supreme Court ruled in June that there were no constitutional limits on how severely states could manipulate district lines to benefit political parties. For decades, redistricting in many places has been done behind closed doors, with lawmakers quietly negotiating deals to get the districts they want. Emails from lawmakers made public in litigation in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, among other places, have shed light on just how unsavory those negotiations are. In Michigan, for example, a Republican staffer wrote happily about cramming \u201cDem garbage\u201d into four districts. Advocates have long struggled to get the public interested in redistricting, seen as a wonky, boring and complicated issue. But Obama and NDRC\u2019s decision to focus on the issue is a signal in itself of how the issue has exploded in recent years. In 2011, Republicans recognized the potential to use the redistricting process to lock in their political advantage for a decade and successfully executed a targeted campaign to do just that. The National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT), a GOP group focused on redistricting led by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, mocked the new effort in a tweet. The group recently sued to block a new independent panel in Michigan from drawing district lines. The NDRC has dismissed the GOP-led criticism, noting that it has championed proposals with bipartisan support. \u201cI\u2019m not really that focused on what the NRRT is saying about us or our program,\u201d Narechania said. \u201cWe are hyperfocused on building a fair process and making sure that we are concentrating on places where redistricting reform gives power back to the people, not to politicians, not to the folks who are camped out in lobbyist offices who are drawing the lines in secret.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of All On The Line is to take this process and make it as transparent as possible. And if transparency is something that folks are afraid of, then I think the question is why is that?\u201d he said.",

      "content": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is revoking an Obama-era regulation that shielded many U.S. wetlands and streams from pollution but was opposed by developers and farmers who said it hurt economic development and infringed on property rights. Even before the official announcement, scheduled for later Thursday, environmental groups blasted the administration\u2019s action, the latest in a series of\u00a0moves to roll back environmental protections\u00a0put into place under former President Barack Obama. The Waters of the United States rule being revoked defines which waterways are subject to federal regulation. \u201cThis action officially ends an egregious power grab and sets the stage for a new rule that will provide much-needed regulatory certainty for farmers, home builders and property owners nationwide,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler and R.D. James, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, wrote in a column published Thursday by the Des Moines Register. Since enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the federal government has gone beyond protection of navigable waterways and their major tributaries to assert jurisdiction over \u201cisolated ponds and channels that flow only after it rains,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cAs the definition expanded, so too has Washington\u2019s power over private property and the states\u2019 traditional authority to regulate their land and water resources,\u201d they said. President Donald Trump had ordered the agencies to develop a replacement policy that has a more restrictive definition of protected wetlands and streams, leaving fewer subject to federal protection. Environmentalists say the move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and allow damage of wetlands that prevent flooding, filter pollutants and provide habitat for a multitude of fish, waterfowl and other wildlife. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the Trump administration\u2019s action would be challenged in court. \u201cThe Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWhere it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders.\u201d But Don Parrish, congressional relations director for the American Farm Bureau Federation, says the 2015 regulation that extended federal protection to many U.S. wetlands and waterways created uncertainty about where farmers could cultivate land. \u201cIt would be great if farmers didn\u2019t have to hire an army of consultants and lawyers just to be able to farm,\u201d he said. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota says the Obama rule was \u201can unconstitutional power grab that did nothing to advance good water management.\u201d The question of which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act has inspired decades of lawsuits and congressional debate. A sharply divided Supreme Court in 2006 produced three differing opinions, leading the Obama administration to craft its rule. It provided federal oversight to upstream tributaries and headwaters, including wetlands, ponds, lakes and streams that can affect the quality of navigable waters. The regulation drew quick legal challenges. Courts prevented it from taking effect in parts of the U.S. Betsy Southerland, who was director of science and technology in EPA\u2019s Office of Water during the Obama administration, said repealing its regulation would create further regulatory confusion. \u201cThis repeal is a victory for land developers, oil and gas drillers and miners who will exploit that ambiguity to dredge and fill small streams and wetlands that were protected from destruction by the 2015 rule because of their critical impact on national water quality,\u201d Southerland said.",

On Sunday he said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d waiting to \u201chear from the Kingdom\u201d about who was responsible for the attack Saturday on Saudi oil facilities. As it turns out, the U.S. didn\u2019t wait for \u201cthe Kingdom\u201d but instead informed the Saudis on Monday that Iran was responsible for the attack. But the Saudis said American officials\u00a0failed to provide enough proof that Iran was responsible, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iran has denied responsibility. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the attack was an act of self-defense by the Yemeni Houthi rebels in response to being bombed by the Saudis. Trump\u2019s supporters are backing his bristling war readiness, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggesting the U.S. consider bombing Iran\u2019s refineries, which would \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back.\u201d But Trump\u2019s posturing has also triggered a flood of criticism, with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0(D-Hawaii) accusing the president of turning America into Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cbitch.\u201d\u00a0She accused Trump of waiting for orders from his \u201cSaudi masters.\u201d Sen.

For decades before Trump was president, he blasted Saudi Arabia for taking advantage of its relationship with America and once mocked Obama for bowing at a meeting with the Saudi king. In office, Trump has been a constant supporter of the autocratic Saudi royal family, even after the CIA determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00a0was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in the assassination a year ago of Washington Post writer\u00a0Jamal Khashoggi.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In less than three years, President Donald Trump has named more former lobbyists to Cabinet-level posts than his most recent predecessors did in eight, putting a substantial amount of oversight in the hands of people with ties to the industries they\u2019re regulating. The Cabinet choices are another sign that Trump\u2019s populist pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d is a catchy campaign slogan but not a serious attempt to change the way Washington works. Instead of staring down \u201cthe unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests\u201d as Trump recently declared, the influence industry has flourished during his administration. The amount spent in 2019 on lobbying the U.S. government is on pace to match or exceed last year\u2019s total of $3.4 billion, the most since 2010, according to the political money website Open Secrets. Trump also has pulled in hefty contributions from industries with business before his administration, and his hotel near the White House has been a magnet for lobbyists and foreign interests since he was elected. \u201cAn administration staffed by former industry lobbyists will almost certainly favor industry over the general public, because that\u2019s the outlook they\u2019re bringing to the job,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at the think tank New America and author of the book \u201cThe Business of America is Lobbying.\u201d Former lobbyists run the Defense and Interior departments, Environmental Protection Agency and office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The acting Labor secretary, Pat Pizzella, is an ex-lobbyist and Trump\u2019s pick to run the department, Eugene Scalia, also is an ex-lobbyist. Scalia\u2019s confirmation hearing before a GOP-controlled Senate committee is scheduled for Thursday and Democrats are expected to grill him on his long record of opposing federal regulations . A seventh ex-lobbyist, Dan Coats, resigned as Trump\u2019s intelligence chief in August. President Barack Obama had five former lobbyists in his Cabinet during two terms in office and President George W. Bush had three, also during eight years in the White House, according to lobbying and foreign agent disclosure records. The review was limited to the Trump, Obama and Bush administrations because prior to 1995 there was no central database of federal lobbying registrations and the law was hazy about who was supposed to register. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that revoked an Obama directive prohibiting lobbyists from being appointed to a post at a federal agency they\u2019d lobbied within the last two years. While this \u201ccooling off\u201d period was cast aside, Trump\u2019s order continued to bar for two years lobbyists-turned-government-employees from participating in particular matters that they\u2019d lobbied on during the two preceding years. \u201cWithout the cooling off period, these Cabinet heads appear to be serving their former employers\u2019 and clients\u2019 special interests,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s Cabinet includes the heads of the 15 executive departments and seven other senior-level posts, such as EPA administrator and director of national intelligence. Obama\u2019s Cabinet had the same number of members and Bush\u2019s Cabinet had two fewer. Scalia, the Labor Department nominee, has spent much of his career as a partner in the Washington office of the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher firm, where he ran up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations. Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, served for a year as the Labor Department\u2019s top lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. His financial disclosure report lists 49 clients who paid him $5,000 or more for legal services, including e-cigarette giant Juul Labs, Facebook, Walmart and Bank of America. Disclosure records show Scalia was registered in 2010 and 2011 to lobby for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Pizzella has been the acting secretary since Alexander Acosta resigned the post in July amid renewed criticism of how, as a federal prosecutor, he handled a 2008 secret plea deal with wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Pizzella lobbied for clients that ranged from Microsoft Corp. to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. He also worked on several accounts with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, although Pizzella was never accused of any misconduct or wrongdoing. Obama chose Pizzella for a GOP seat on the Federal Labor Relations Authority and he was an assistant Labor secretary during the George W. Bush administration. Two Trump Cabinet officials, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, have been accused by congressional Democrats and public interest groups of failing to honor their ethics pledges. Both Bernhardt and Wheeler, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have played leading roles in the administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations. They also both worked at the agency they now lead during prior administrations. Interior\u2019s inspector general launched an investigation of Bernhardt earlier this year after receiving seven separate ethics allegations against him. A complaint filed by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center alleged that shortly after joining the department in August 2017 Bernhardt became involved in matters that were the focus of his lobbying for California\u2019s Westlands Water District that lasted until mid-November 2016. Westlands has federal contracts to provide irrigation water to 700 family-owned farms in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. The complaint said Bernhardt had \u201clobbied on discrete provisions of a law directing Interior to maximize water supplies to his clients, and to minimize Endangered Species Act protections in that region.\u201d Then, after joining Interior, Bernhardt breached his ethics pledge by directing government officials under him \u201cto advance the particular matters he had previously lobbied on,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cIt is very hard to tell where Bernhardt\u2019s lobbying career ended and where his public service begins,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, director of the Campaign Legal Center\u2019s federal reform program. An Interior spokesman said in a statement, \u201cSecretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he has fully complied with those obligations.\u201d Thomas Birmingham, Westlands\u2019 general manager, said the agency is actually disadvantaged with Bernhardt as secretary because he\u2019s not been able to engage with him as he did past Interior secretaries, like Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Mr. Bernhardt has done or has not done at Interior,\u201d Birmingham said. Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for eight years and his more than 20 different clients included coal magnate Bob Murray, who pushed hard on the Trump administration to grant a series of breaks for the sagging domestic coal industry. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Betsy Monseu, CEO of the American Coal Council, said of Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the regulatory reform agenda moving forward.\u201d But Canter\u2019s organization, known as CREW, urged the EPA inspector general earlier this year to investigate whether Wheeler broke his ethics pledge. Among the allegations, CREW said Wheeler had participated in the easing of standards for storing coal ash in 2018 even though he had lobbied on those regulations the year before for Murray Energy. The inspector general\u2019s office declined to say if it had open an investigation, directing a reporter to file a Freedom of Information Act request. An EPA statement called CREW\u2019s complaint \u201cbaseless and just flat out false.\u201d It said Wheeler works closely with career EPA ethics officials and abides by all ethics requirements. The Pentagon\u2019s top official, Mark Esper, spent seven years lobbying for defense industry juggernaut Raytheon, a company that stands to gain handsomely from Trump\u2019s push to boost military spending by billions of dollars. The company closed out 2018 by hitting a record $27.1 billion in net sales, up nearly seven percent from the $25.3 billion the year before. Esper, who was secretary of the Army when Trump chose him to be defense secretary, faced opposition from only a handful of Democrats and he was confirmed in July by a 90-8 margin. As Army secretary, Esper hasn\u2019t participated in Raytheon-related matters under the terms of an ethics agreement that runs through this November. After that, Esper told Pentagon ethics officials that he will continue to avoid Raytheon issues unless his participation as defense secretary is determined to be essential. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, lobbied primarily for steel companies between 1999 and 2003. Beginning in 2004, he represented just one company, U.S. Steel, which paid his firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, $3.2 million over a seven-year period. ___ Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.",

Obama said at a tech conference that when he was president, he relied on a diversity of opinions before making decisions, according to Axios. \u201cThe other thing that is helpful is not watching TV or reading social media,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThose are two things I would advise, if you\u2019re our president, not to do,\u201d he added, per The Washington Post. \u201cIt creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, and at least one former Obama insider insisted that this wasn\u2019t a shot at the current POTUS.\u00a0Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted: While that may be the case, Obama would certainly be aware of how the comments could be taken in light of the Trump presidency. Obama made another statement that could also be interpreted as a swipe at his successor. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact we didn\u2019t have indictments,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that before, but that is pretty rare in modern-day.\u201d The \u201cmodern-day\u201d occupant of the White House has surrounded himself with aides and associates who are now in legal trouble.\u00a0Former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former personal attorney Michael Cohen are currently serving prison time. Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos served a 12-day sentence. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is awaiting sentencing.

      "author": "Lydia O\u2019Connor",
      "content": " In his first solo press conference since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment probe\u00a0into his interactions with Ukraine,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0on Wednesday attempted to turn the tables on his political opponents with a baseless accusation. When asked by a reporter why it\u2019s OK for a U.S. president to ask a foreign country to investigate his political opponent, Trump falsely retorted that former President Barack Obama had done that to him. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what he did, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0Trump said in reference to Obama. \u201cReally, when you think about it, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully that will all come out,\u201d he said before trailing off with a list of books he said would back him up. He put forth another conspiracy theory that the timing of the whistleblower media coverage was only to distract from his meetings at the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cThat was all planned,\u201d he said. \u201cLike everything, that was all planned.\u201d Trump leaned on his regular talking points throughout the speech, scolding the media for not giving enough coverage to his United Nations General Assembly meetings and accusing the Democrats of sowing division. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dividing, they\u2019re belittling, they\u2019re demeaning our country.\u201d After speaking for around 20 minutes, he took only a few questions from reporters. Trump\u2019s remarks come hours after the White House released a summary of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the details of which were first uncovered last week in a series of bombshell media reports about a related whistleblower complaint. That summary, which is not a full transcript, reveals that Trump implored Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d immediately after the Ukrainian leader told Trump he was grateful for the military aid the U.S. had provided to his country. Trump had two favors in mind, the summary revealed. First, he wanted Ukraine to investigate the baseless theory that Russia did not actually hack Democratic National Committee servers in 2016 in order to aid Trump\u2019s campaign. Secondly, Trump asked Zelensky to open an investigation into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, whom Trump might face in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThe other thing,\u201d Trump said, per the summary, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d Trump went on: \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you could look into it ... it sounds horrible to me.\u201d Trump was referring to Hunter Biden, who began working with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, while his father was serving in the Obama administration. The prosecution he referenced was a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma, which ended without any convictions. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, the Bidens have\u00a0not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to the company. Trump also asked Zelensky to meet with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor now serving as Trump\u2019s private attorney, and to speak with Attorney General William Barr to discuss the investigation. Trump insisted at his Wednesday press conference that the phone call was \u201cperfect\u201d and that anything the Democrats have to say about is \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d \u201cWhen they look at the information, it\u2019s a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cImpeachment for that?\u201d He also cast doubt on the trustworthiness of the whistleblower. \u201cThe so-called whistleblower, the one that didn\u2019t have any first class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand, you\u2019ll have to figure that out\u00a0 for yourself,\u201d he said.",

Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former \u201cSuits\u201d actress guest-edited. In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it\u2019s changed her. \u201cBeing a mother has been a masterclass in letting go,\u201d Obama said in the interview. \u201cMotherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside.\u201d Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping. \u201cLike me, Meghan probably never dreamt that she\u2019d have a life like this,\u201d Obama, author of the bestselling 2018 autobiography \u201cBecoming,\u201d told the magazine in its January issue. \u201cThe pressure you feel \u2015 from yourself and from others \u2015 can sometimes feel like a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don\u2019t be in a hurry to do anything.\u201d She continued: I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it\u2019s okay \u2014 it\u2019s good, even \u2014 to do that. Subscribe to HuffPost\u2019s\u00a0Watching the Royals newsletter\u00a0for all things Windsor (and beyond).",

On Hannity\u2019s prime time\u00a0Fox News show, the cable news personality and the president\u2019s son resurrected long-debunked speculation that then-Vice President Biden urged the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016 to push the business interests of his son there. And they blamed then-President Obama, saying he lacked oversight at the time and has failed to speak about it since. \u201cI think there is a very big reason that Obama is being quiet, because all of this abuse of power, all of this corruption, all happened on his watch,\u201d Hannity said in the exchange, shared by Media Matters above.

The probe was launched after a whistleblower red-flagged President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressuring the foreign leader to investigate Biden and his son Hunter while military aid to Ukraine was being withheld. Eric Trump and Hannity were all too eager to help the beleaguered president by bringing up his predecessor. \u201cHe\u2019s the only guy who\u2019s hiding,\u201d Eric Trump said of Obama, railing about the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the situation (per Fox News). \u201cI mean, Joe Biden was his vice president.

      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " Former President Barack Obama endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for reelection on Wednesday, days before the Canadians go to the polls in an election shaped by Trudeau\u2019s black- and brownface scandal. Obama praised Trudeau in a tweet celebrating the Liberal Party prime minister as a \u201chard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\u201d \u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term,\u201d Obama said. While the former U.S. president celebrated Trudeau, 47, as a progressive leader, Obama didn\u2019t note the prime minister\u2019s history of wearing blackface and brownface, which came to light in September. The revelation that Trudeau has worn racist makeup has led to his sinking approval ratings, scuffing his persona as a liberal star. Canada\u2019s federal election day is next Monday on Oct. 21. Last month, Time magazine published a photo of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup at a party for a private school where he taught in 2001. The party\u2019s theme was \u201cArabian Nights\u201d and Trudeau, 29 at the time, wore a turban and robe with his skin darkened to brown. After the photo was made public, Trudeau admitted to wearing blackface in another instance \u2015 when he was in high school to perform the song \u201cDay-O\u201d by Jamaican-American singer Harry Belafonte. \u201cI made a mistake when I was younger and I wish I hadn\u2019t,\u201d Trudeau told reporters the day the Time report was published. \u201cI should have known better then, but I didn\u2019t. And I did it. And I am deeply sorry for it.\u201d One day later, yet another instance of Trudeau wearing racist makeup surfaced, further clouding his reelection campaign. This time, Trudeau was wearing blackface in a grainy video dating back to the early 1990s uncovered by Global News. Trudeau apologized again during a press conference after the video was released. \u201cWhat I did hurt people who shouldn\u2019t have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity. This is something that I deeply, deeply regret,\u201d he said after a campaign event. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that because of the layers of privilege that I have, and for that I am deeply sorry.\u201d",

      "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
      "content": " President Donald Trump railed against \u201cvicious\u201d Democrats and the \u201ccrazy\u201d impeachment inquiry they\u2019ve launched against him during a rambling conversation with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that aired Monday. Urging the GOP to \u201cget tougher,\u201d Trump told Hannity that Republicans \u201cwould never do anything like this,\u201d referring to the impeachment probe. Republicans could have impeached former President Barack Obama \u201cfor many different things,\u201d Trump said \u2014 but \u201cthey never even thought of impeaching him.\u201d \u201cThey could\u2019ve impeached Obama for the IRS scandal. They could impeach him for the guns for whatever where guns went all over the place and people got killed, Fast and Furious,\u201d Trump told Hannity. \u201cThey could\u2019ve killed him \u2015 they could\u2019ve impeached him for many different things.\u201d The \u201ckilled him\u201d remark appears to have been a slip of the tongue. During Obama\u2019s tenure, the Internal Revenue Service was accused of singling out tea party organizations and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status and subjecting them to extra scrutiny. It later emerged, however, that the IRS had also targeted dozens of apparently left-leaning organizations. Neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice, which launched investigations into the IRS controversy, found any evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Trump\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d comment was an apparent reference to a bungled gunrunning operation conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that had sought to stanch the flow of smuggled weapons along the U.S.-Mexico border. President Obama later invoked executive privilege in order to withhold documents related to the operation, triggering a yearslong legal battle between the House and the Justice Department. The two sides finally reached a settlement earlier this year. Speaking to Hannity, Trump said that while Republicans hadn\u2019t impeached Obama during his time in office, Democrats \u2014 who Trump described as \u201cnot good politicians\u201d with \u201clousy policy\u201d \u2014 had discussed impeaching him \u201con Russia, on Mueller, all this stuff.\u201d \u201cAnd then they come up with this crazy concept of a perfect conversation,\u201d Trump continued, referring to his controversial July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to initiate an impeachment inquiry. Trump has faced allegations that he withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, his potential rival in 2020. Trump has repeatedly insisted there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d in his exchanges with Zelensky even as the White House has issued\u00a0conflicting messages on this topic. Though no official impeachment inquiry was ever launched against Obama, some Republicans did suggest during his presidential tenure that he was guilty of impeachable offences. In the wake of IRS controversy, former Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-Mich.) said in 2013 it \u201cwould be a dream come true\u201d to impeach Obama. That same year, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) said the House \u201ccould probably get the votes\u201d to impeach Obama over questions about the authenticity of his birth certificate, which the White House had made public in 2011. Farenthold resigned last year after\u00a0sexual misconduct allegations\u00a0were levelled against him. During his conversation with Hannity, Trump also touted a conspiracy theory involving\u00a0Hillary Clinton and Ukraine and railed against another favorite target of his, the \u201cfake news media.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even want [The New York Times] in the White House anymore. We\u2019re going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They\u2019re fake,\u201d he told Hannity, adding that he\u2019s received worse press than Abraham Lincoln.",

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " A California campaign fundraiser and lobbyist who gave to President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration committee has been charged with failing to register as a foreign agent, evading taxes, and making nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions.\u00a0Imaad Shah Zuberi, 49,\u00a0agreed to plead guilty\u00a0to three counts, according to federal prosecutors. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles said that Zuberi convinced foreign nationals and governments that he had access to high-level officials in the U.S., in part by showing them photos of him with elected officials. While his lobbying efforts for his clients often failed, Zuberi got rich, prosecutors said. Among a range of misdeeds laid out by prosecutors, Zuberi, though his venture capital firm Avenue Ventures, allegedly lobbied members of Congress to place political pressure on Bahrain while failing to register that he was doing this for a citizen of Bahrain. He entered into a contract with Sri Lanka in an effort to rehabilitate that country\u2019s image in the United States but similarly failed to register his direction of that lobbying effort as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Zuberi also didn\u2019t report to the Internal Revenue Service more than $5 million in income that he allegedly diverted to himself under the Sri Lanka deal. His guilty pleas to FARA violations and tax evasion related to the Sri Lanka work. The Daily Beast reported\u00a0previously on Zuberi\u2019s connection to Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer now serving time in federal prison. Zuberi, the outlet reported, donated more than $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. The fundraiser had some prior experience with inaugurations.\u00a0The day after President Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration, prosecutors say, Zuberi falsely told three individuals that their photos with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had been placed on hold because they hadn\u2019t donated the proper amounts.\u00a0Court documents note that Zuberi had donated $257,500 to Obama\u2019s 2013 inaugural committee, but then pocketed refunds from the committee for $160,000 of that total. Zuberi agreed to plead guilty to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act in 2015 by, among other things, making contributions in other people\u2019s names. Read the criminal information below:",

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama delivered powerful remarks on Friday to honor Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who died last week after serving in Congress for decades. Obama spoke during the funeral service for Cummings held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. He recognized the congressman and civil rights champion for his dedication as a public servant, and for his genuine kindness. The former president said that after listening to the eulogies delivered by Cummings\u2019 daughters earlier in the service, he reflected that he would want his own daughters to know that \u201cbeing a strong man includes being kind.\u201d \u201cThat there is nothing weak about kindness and compassion,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere is nothing weak about looking out for others. There is nothing weak about being honorable. You are not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.\u201d \u201cI was sitting here and I was just noticing the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings and you know, this is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to introduce them as honorable.\u00a0But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There\u2019s a difference. There is a difference if you are honorable and treated others honorably outside the limelight.\u201d Obama was joined by other prominent politicians who delivered remarks at the funeral service, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. Cummings, who was the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died on Oct. 17 at age 68 \u201cdue to complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said. On Thursday, the representative, who was a son of sharecroppers, became the first Black elected official to lie in state in the Capitol, The New York Times reported. Elsewhere in his remarks on Friday, Obama said, \u201cas president, I knew I could always count on Elijah being honorable and doing the right thing.\u201d He later added, \u201cElijah Cummings was a man of noble and good heart.\u00a0His parents and his faith planted the seeds of hope, and love, and compassion, and righteousness in that good soil of his.\u201d \u201cHe has harvested all the crops that he could, for the Lord has now called Elijah home, to give his humble, faithful servant rest,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it now falls on us to continue his work, so that other young boys and girls in Baltimore, across Maryland, across the United States, and around the world might too have a chance to grow and to flourish. That\u2019s how we will honor him.\u201d Watch Obama\u2019s entire speech below:",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " SOMEWHERE ON U.S. ROUTE 18 BETWEEN CHARLES CITY AND MASON CITY, Iowa \u2015 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg would not commit to rethinking the way the federal government prosecutes people who disclose classified information, instead distinguishing between politically motivated leaks during the Obama administration and the federal official who has sought formal \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protections to raise the alarm about President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct. At two campaign town halls in Iowa on Sunday, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor singled out the federal official who has come forward as a whistleblower to report on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, in which Trump appeared to suggest that U.S. security aid was contingent on Ukraine\u2019s investigation of the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Speaking at a high school in the northeast Iowa town of Waverly, Buttigieg said: \u201cWhen somebody blows the whistle on official misconduct, that is an act of loyalty to the republic for which it stands.\u201d During a discussion aboard his campaign bus as it headed to a town hall in Mason City, Iowa, later in the day, HuffPost asked whether, given Buttigieg\u2019s sympathy for the whistleblower at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry, he would still pursue criminal charges against politically motivated leakers of the kind prosecuted by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice drew condemnation from civil libertarians for aggressively pressing criminal charges against eight people accused of leaking classified information to the media. \u201cNot everybody who discloses classified information is a whistleblower,\u201d replied Buttigieg, whose service as a U.S. Navy Intelligence reservist included a stint in Afghanistan. \u201cOne thing I was very much aware of when I was responsible for handling classified information would be the consequences of, especially willfully, mishandling or divulging.\u201d Instead, Buttigieg said he supports strengthening the channels through which national security and other federal officials can report and expose what they believe is misconduct, as well as the legal protections for those individuals once they have submitted their reports. \u201cOne of the things I think we\u2019ve learned is the importance of having a whistleblower function, so that if somebody sees wrongdoing, there is a way to have an accountability for that that doesn\u2019t leave somebody a choice between committing a national security violation by divulging classified information, or being silent about abuses,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the right framework to move forward in \u2015 not one where we\u2019re just deciding on a case-by-case basis, based on public opinion, what abuses of classified information we\u2019re going to tolerate.\u201d HuffPost followed up to ask Buttigieg\u2019s opinion on the case of Edward Snowden, the most famous Obama-era leaker. Snowden, a former analyst for the National Security Agency, shared with journalists a trove of classified documents in June 2013 that, among other things, revealed that the NSA was collecting the phone records of millions of Americans. He successfully sought asylum in Russia to avoid U.S. prosecution under the Espionage Act, a World War I-era law that the Obama administration revived to stamp out leaks, and which limits the tools with which people who are charged can defend themselves. Buttigieg replied that Snowden\u2019s conduct was \u201cproblematic, but also something that if we had a better framework and as we are moving toward with the whistleblower function would not create that same kind of problem, because to the extent that there was activity that was contrary to law or contrary to policy, there was no way to raise that besides just sending classified information out into the world.\u201d Asked by a Fox News reporter whether he would consider cutting a deal with Snowden to get him to return to the United States in exchange for some time of prosecutorial leniency, Buttigieg did not answer directly. \u201cThat\u2019s for the Department of Justice to evaluate whether there are convincing grounds for any kind of exceptions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, there\u2019s got to be a better way than just broadcasting highly classified information and putting lives at risk.\u201d Instead of leaks, he added, \u201cwhistleblower systems and laws \u2015 and, by the way, vigorous [inspector general] systems\u201d are the appropriate channels for reporting abuses. (The Ukraine whistleblower reported his concerns to the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community.) Few of Buttigieg\u2019s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have diverged from the consensus view of the U.S. national security establishment that unauthorized leakers who decline to take advantage of official whistleblower protections should be prosecuted. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has called for the federal government to grant Snowden clemency, saying the former NSA analyst \u201cdid this country a great service.\u201d In an October interview with The Intercept, Sanders also vowed not to prosecute any leakers under the Espionage Act. In a follow-up interview on Monday, Buttigieg declined to rule out prosecuting leakers under the Espionage Act specifically. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can prejudge a future scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also again, the less prosecution has to do with anything that an elected official would like in the Oval Office, is going to be better.\u201d The story has been updated with further comment from Buttigieg.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " DECORAH, Iowa \u2015 When Pete Buttigieg begins his stump speeches to the throngs of voters who gather to hear him at town halls across Iowa, he doesn\u2019t start with his plan for a particular policy or elucidate a specific critique of President Donald Trump. Instead, with a pastoral touch drawn from his liberal Episcopalian faith, the 37-year-old Democratic presidential contender, who\u2019s also the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asks his audience to imagine the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cI want to ask you to really visualize the first day when the sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told a flock of about 1,000 voters on Saturday night in the college town of Decorah, about 15 miles south of the Minnesota border. Unlike rivals to his left, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg does not ask voters to recognize the supremacy of corporate power and political corruption as much as he wants them to confront the difficulty of healing a country polarized along partisan lines. Uniting the country, he argues, is a prerequisite to expanding health care coverage, tackling climate change, boosting wages and narrowing the racial wealth gap. But for such a monumental challenge, the request Buttigieg issues to his audience is relatively modest. He wants people to summon the patience and courage that they bring to discussions with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table. The day after the election, he wants them to call their friends and relatives who voted for a different presidential candidate and discuss something non-political. And most of all, he wants them to put their trust in him as the person most capable of leading Americans toward these solutions while easing the rancor of the current political moment. \u201cI believe that the right president, the president that I seek to be, can gather together an American majority to get these things done,\u201d he said in Decorah on Saturday. \u201cThe good news is the American people are ready \u2015 you can feel it. Not everybody. But most of us are ready for solutions to these problems.\u201d If the pitch sounds familiar, that\u2019s because like virtually every element of the latest iteration of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s designed to emulate the rhetoric, tactics and spirit of former President Barack Obama. During Obama\u2019s first run, he paired a progressive policy platform with soaring descriptions of the United States\u2019 common fabric and appeals to overcome the partisan divisions that separated \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states.\u201d He preached an optimistic faith in the power of the country to renew itself that was just vague enough for moderates and progressives alike to see their values in his platform. And he too was a young, relative political newcomer and would-be barrier-breaking minority, who took his articulate stump speech to the rural-most corners of the first-in-the-nation caucus state. (Where Obama was the country\u2019s first Black president, Buttigieg would be the country\u2019s first openly gay president.) Where Obama preached \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d Buttigieg is calling for \u201chope\u201d and \u201cbelonging.\u201d Where Obama joked about an end to \u201cScooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence and Karl Rove politics,\u201d Buttigieg relishes an \u201cend to this chaos and corruption and the tweets.\u201d In his barnburner speech at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s massive Liberty and Justice rally and dinner in the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday night, Buttigieg made the comparison explicit to an audience of 13,000, at least a few thousand of whom were his most dedicated supporters. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock doors for a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said, referencing Obama. \u201cAnd we knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d he continued, prompting roars of approval from his blue-and-yellow-clad fans. But the differences between Buttigieg and Obama are just as obvious. Buttigieg has only served as mayor of a city of just over 100,000 people, and he lost both times he sought higher office. (He ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017). And though over one-quarter of the population of South Bend is Black, Buttigieg\u2019s tenure has been rocked by\u00a0race-related scandals, including the July police killing of a Black man accused of trying to steal cars, which sparked heated protests. His support among non-white Democratic primary voters is in the low single digits, according to public polls. He\u2019s also more popular with older voters, despite being the only candidate who is a millennial. Obama, of course, had a strong base of young people who fueled the excitement and energy of his run. What\u2019s more, while Obama courted voters on the activist left, Buttigieg has by turns confused them and spurned them outright.\u00a0Early on, he called for the aggressive measure of adding more justices to the Supreme Court, but more recently, he said that his vision of an expanded bench would encourage the confirmation of \u201cswing\u201d justices like Anthony Kennedy or David Souter \u2015 two men who were chosen by Republican presidents. The comments were widely interpreted as endorsements of Kennedy and Souter, though that did not appear to be his intention. He\u2019s also been especially hard on Warren and Sanders\u00a0for backing a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan that would effectively end the vast majority of private health care coverage. In September and October when Warren declined to say how she would finance Medicare for All \u2014 and whether it would require tax increases \u2014 Buttigieg effectively called her a hypocrite. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d he said in a CNN interview in September.\u00a0(Warren subsequently released a detailed financing plan that did not raise middle-class taxes.) When HuffPost asked him in Iowa last weekend whether his pugnacious rhetoric marked a break with his previous comments, Buttigieg insisted that he has been consistent. \u201cI continue to believe that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what. I think I\u2019ll be better at fending that off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I hold my views on health care policy is because I think it\u2019s the right answer.\u201d In another discussion with reporters in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg also reiterated that his comments about Kennedy and Souter were in reference to a hypothetical scenario in which the Supreme Court is expanded.\u00a0He believes that a larger court could be capable of accommodating swing justices and could transcend the \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d of the present bench. \u201cI was not saying that in the current Supreme Court structure, I would appoint people with the judicial philosophy like Kennedy or Souter,\u201d he said. \u201cA better example would probably be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of a justice whose judicial philosophy largely matches my own.\u201d Notwithstanding Buttigieg\u2019s glaring differences with Obama, he is trying to cultivate the kinds of voters who remain enamored of the former president\u2019s eloquence and sunny disposition. Call it the \u201cWest Wing\u201d lane. He is the kind of candidate that Democrats of varied ideological leanings can see as the personification of their ideal of politics \u2015 a place where intelligence, uplifting rhetoric and an inspiring personal story are enough to vanquish the demons of division that plague the country. Many attendees of Buttigieg\u2019s town halls volunteered comparisons to Obama unprompted, while some cited other iconic Democratic presidents. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of his charisma,\u201d said Barb Neal, a retired banker from Mount Vernon, who attended the Decorah town hall, by way of explaining the Obama comparison. \u201cHe just gives me hope. He\u2019s so positive. So many of them are so negative \u2015 just bashing the other side, and he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Mary Thomsen, Neal\u2019s sister, who still works as a banker, chimed into agree. \u201cHe reminds me of Obama. For some reason he also reminds me of John F. Kennedy,\u201d she said. Of course, former Vice President Joe Biden has, more than any other candidate, sought to capitalize on his direct ties to Obama. He frequently references \u201cmy friend Barack\u201d in his stump speeches. And his strong support among Black voters in the early primary state of South Carolina is widely attributed to positive memories of his partnership with the country\u2019s first Black president. In trying to channel Obama \u2014 rather than generate good will by association with him \u2014 Buttigieg appears to be having success with many of the Iowa voters who are looking for a more moderate contender, but may be underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s performance on the trail. Buttigieg trounced the former vice president in third quarter fundraising (though the mayor\u2019s haul still fell short of Warren and Sanders\u2019 totals). And he has been rising in Iowa\u2019s polls even as Biden has continued to drop. Several Iowa Democrats at Buttigieg\u2019s events in small towns across the northern part of the state over the weekend described concerns about either the effect of Biden\u2019s age on his public speaking abilities, or the negative publicity surrounding his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine. Laura Swalve, a former school psychologist from Swea City who came to see Buttigieg at the VFW hall in Algona on Monday, described herself as a \u201cfan\u201d of Biden\u2019s. But while clarifying that she does not think he is senile, Swalve worries that he\u2019s \u201cjust not as quick\u201d as he used to be. \u201cI honestly think his age sometimes comes through, like in the debates, when he kind of didn\u2019t know how to say things,\u201d she said. For Bill Paup, a retired schoolteacher from Cedar Falls who came to a Buttigieg town hall in Waverly on Sunday, the appearance of wrongdoing related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine was enough to push him toward other options. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not valid concerns, but just like in 2016, it doesn\u2019t take a valid concern to bury somebody,\u201d Paup said. \u201cIt just takes a lot of noise. And he\u2019s got that.\u201d The Liberty and Justice Celebration is the last of several Iowa political confabs that punctuate the six-month period of campaigning leading up to the Iowa caucuses, which are due to take place this year on Feb. 3. Only candidates who purchase the state party\u2019s voter file or have field offices in the state are permitted to speak. They are also welcome to purchase tickets for their supporters to attend and cheer them on in the stands. (In other words, raucous applause is often less spontaneous, and more sponsored.) In November 2007, Obama\u2019s memorable speech at the fundraiser \u2015 then known as the Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2015 set the tone for the homestretch of Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign, which culminated in his historic victory on caucus day. Buttigieg sought to make his speech \u2015 and delegation \u2015 at Friday\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration a similarly impressive turning point. Festivities began with a rally in downtown Des Moines and a march to the dinner that the Buttigieg campaign said included 2,300 people. Although the campaign \u2015 like other campaigns \u2015 coordinated the participation of many Iowa activists, there was also a delegation of some 1,000 members of the ad hoc, internet-based, grassroots group, \u201cBarnstomers 4 Pete,\u201d who attended the event on their own dime. Ariana Wyndham, an undocumented immigrant who can remain in the country thanks to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and who lives in Warren, Ohio, is a leader of the group. She drove to Des Moines with her husband Peter, a crane operator, for the dinner festivities and a few days of canvassing and bonding with fellow activists. Speaking to HuffPost on the concourse of the Wells Fargo arena, Wyndham, covered in Buttigieg swag, described suffering from anxiety and depression after Trump\u2019s election. Without the right to vote, she felt powerless to get involved in politics until she found out about Buttigieg. She was particularly drawn to the account Buttigieg gives in his book, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d of reviving South Bend, a struggling post-industrial city that reminded her of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it can be done everywhere and it should be done everywhere.\u201d The following days were a show of force from Buttigieg designed to capitalize on his strong reception at the Liberty and Justice Celebration. On Saturday, after answering the questions of building trades union leaders at a multi-candidate fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg embarked on a three-day bus tour across rural northern Iowa, welcoming reporters onto his bus for extended group interviews in between campaign stops. Over the course of six town halls, Buttigieg spoke to crowds ranging from 275 people on the low end to upwards of 1,000, according to estimates provided to the campaign by building managers. The turnout was significant considering that all but one of the events took place in towns with a few thousand people. (His fourth stop was in Mason City, which has a population just under 28,000.) The campaign has one of the most extensive field presences in Iowa with over 100 staff on the ground and some 20 offices. Buttigieg has ramped up his investment in digital advertisements in the state as well, spending over $48,000 on Facebook ads targeting Iowans in the past week alone \u2014 more than any other Democrat running for president \u201cIn a lot of the towns that not just campaigns but a lot of economists have written off, Mayor Pete\u2019s team has shown up,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat running to represent several of the towns Buttigieg visited in the U.S. House and who has not endorsed in the presidential primary. \u201cFor months it was Warren. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve switched strategy or something. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m now seeing Pete more.\u201d For Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who tagged along with Buttigieg for a tour of an ethanol plant in Mason City, Buttigieg\u2019s itinerary was still more evidence that he was walking in the footsteps of Obama, who won Iowa twice. All but one of Buttigieg\u2019s bus tour stops was in a county that Obama won at least once and then went for Trump in 2016. \u201cObama was the model. He was everywhere,\u201d Judge said. Buttigieg has not shied away from the obvious differences between himself and Obama. At a town hall in Mason City on Sunday night that was attended by about 500 people, nearly all of whom were white, a voter asked Buttigieg how he planned to increase his support with Black voters. \u201cThe way to win any vote is to deserve to win it. My job is to make sure there is no confusion about where we stand,\u201d he said. To that end, he has unveiled a multi-pronged plan, named after the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, tailored to address the particular challenges facing Black communities \u2015 from difficulty obtaining credit to start a business or buy a home to encountering racial bias in the job market or the health care system. He also devoted a segment of his stump speech each stop in rural Iowa to confronting the country\u2019s legacy of anti-Black racism. The impact of racism \u201cis as important to discuss with mostly white audiences as it was with the NAACP gathering I was at early today,\u201d he told another predominantly white audience in Decorah on Saturday night. \u201cThis could wreck the entire American project \u2026 as long as we allow it to be the case that this is two different countries in your health and your access to housing or ability to get a job,\u201d depending on whether you are white or Black. And when Buttigieg lists mayoral peers to whom he looks for inspiration and guidance, two of the first names to come up are Michael Tubbs and Randall Woodfin, the young Black leaders of Stockton, California, and Birmingham, Alabama, respectively. For the most progressive voters in the Democratic primary, however, Obama\u2019s presidency is a cautionary tale, rather than a model. For example, they see a president whose embrace of corporate-friendly international trade agreements was wrongheaded and politically damaging, and whose Wall Street-cozy cabinet prevented him from adequately addressing the post-2008 housing crisis. But when asked to make the case that he would deliver on his progressive economic promises despite the support he enjoys from corporate America, Buttigieg again turns to Obama. \u201cThese same criticisms were leveled against President Obama,\u201d said Buttigieg, noting that Obama received campaign contributions from corporate leaders, including many Wall Street executives. \u201cIf you think about with respect to Wall Street, he delivered the strongest regulations and accountability that there had been there in a generation.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, Buttigieg\u2019s embrace of conciliatory politics of the kind Obama employed in his first term risks turning off voters disappointed in the Republican-driven gridlock of the Obama era. HuffPost asked Buttigieg on Monday how he would navigate shepherding policy priorities through Congress even in an optimistic scenario where Democrats control the Senate thanks to conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u201cThis is the interesting thing \u2015 you look at a Joe Manchin, some of these kind of swing-state senators, their orientation may be moderate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pro-corporate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have trouble with a lot of moderate senators on the idea of paid family leave, for example, or making sure that the tax code is more beneficial to the working- and middle-class versus the very wealthy.\u201d Later that day, Buttigieg fielded a similar question from a voter at a town hall in Algona about how he would defend his policies from Republican attacks. He addressed the less favorable \u2015 and arguably more likely \u2015 scenario of a Congress that is at least partly controlled by Republicans. Buttigieg\u2019s proposed solution: Holding political rallies in the states and districts of lawmakers obstructing the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right? And when we\u2019re talking about a measure, that\u2019s not just a new policy and something that people support, even in a conservative area, I believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures \u2015 it would be good for their constituents and reminding their constituents what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. Perhaps fittingly, it was a tactic that Obama also tried. And notably, it didn\u2019t work.",

      "content": " South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg praised former President\u00a0Barack Obama after a reporter misquoted him as criticizing Obama\u2019s presidency in a statement that went viral. A Los Angeles Times article published Sunday quoted the Democratic 2020 hopeful as saying that \u201cthe failures of the Obama era help explain how we got Trump.\u201d Evan Halper, the journalist who wrote the story, issued a correction on Monday noting that Buttigieg had actually said \u201cthe failures of the old normal.\u201d In a tweet, Halper called the mistake \u201cthe result of transcribing a noisy recording at a loud rally.\u201d Responding to the fix, Buttigieg offered admiration for Obama\u2019s tenure. \u201cI appreciate this reporter\u2019s swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFrom health care to [Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell] repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s senior communications adviser Lis Smith applauded the candidate in a subsequent tweet as \u201cunfailingly gracious- even to those who misquote and attack him in bad faith.\u201d \u201cThis is what a President looks like,\u201d she said. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served in the Obama administration and is also seeking the Democratic nomination, at first used the quote to bash Buttigieg on social media. He has since announced that he deleted his tweet and regrets that the original quote \u201cwas spread widely.\u201d In an interview with NBC News while on the campaign trail Monday, Buttigieg emphasized his support for both the press and Obama. \u201cThe reality is, despite what this president says, journalists take their obligation very seriously to make sure everything they print is accurate, and you saw that in how quickly that correction took place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe achievements of the Obama administration affected me personally in many ways, including the ability to serve openly,\u201d Buttigieg, the nation\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate, added, referring to his time in the military. \u201cAnd I\u2019m an admirer of President Obama.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on Friday warned the Democratic field of White House hopefuls not to veer too far to the left, a move he said would alienate many who would otherwise be open to voting for the party\u2019s nominee next year. Though Obama did not mention anyone by name, the message delivered before a room of Democratic donors in Washington was a clear word of caution about the candidacies of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The two have called for massive structural changes \u2014 and in Sanders\u2019 case \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 that would dramatically alter the role of government in people\u2019s lives. The centrist wing of the party has warned for months that a far-left nominee could alienate moderate Republicans and independent voters needed to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it\u2019s important for us not to lose sight of that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff. They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.\u201d Obama has largely refrained from publicly opining on the Democratic primary, which has exposed a growing rift between an ascendant progressive wing of the party and old-guard centrists like his former vice president, Joe Biden. But on Friday he said he felt compelled to weigh in because some of the loudest and most strident voices, particularly on social media, aren\u2019t representative of where most in the party are at. Immigration and health care are two issues he cited as cases where Democratic candidates are out of sync with public sentiment. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. Obama delivered his remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democrats who raise large sums for the party. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the party who narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race last year. He also sought also to ease jittery Democrats who have been wringing their hands over the size of the sprawling field, which some worry will lead to a prolonged contest that will leave the eventual nominee with limited time to prepare for the general election. \u201cI just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNot only did I win ultimately a remarkably tough and lengthy primary process with Hillary Clinton, but people forget that even before that we had a big field of really serious, accomplished people.\u201d",

I don\u2019t care. The choice is so stark and the stakes are so high you cannot afford to be ambivalent,\u201d Obama told about 100 people at a private home in Los Altos Hills, CNN reported.

Obama seemed pleased about the diversity of the Democratic field but acknowledged the challenges some candidates may face. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates, and we have one gay candidate, and those candidates will have barriers if they win the nomination, just like I did,\u201d he said.
