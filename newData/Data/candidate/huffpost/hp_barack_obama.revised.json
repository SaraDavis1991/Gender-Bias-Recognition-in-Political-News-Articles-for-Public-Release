      "content": " California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 attack on former Vice President Joe Biden for decades ago opposing forced school busing as a way to combat segregation understandably dominated coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate among 10 of the Democratic presidential candidates. But another moment revealed a different source of tension inside the Democratic Party, one that may play a significant role as the top contenders for its 2020 nomination seek to distinguish themselves from Biden: the legacy of the president he served as a loyal lieutenant, Barack Obama. NBC News moderator Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart prefaced a question about whether Biden would deport immigrants whose only offense was arriving in the U.S. without papers by noting that the \u201cObama-Biden administration deported more than 3 million Americans.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama I think did a heck of a job,\u201d Biden shot back. \u201cTo compare him to what [President Donald Trump] is doing is absolutely ... immoral.\u201d Biden went on to say that undocumented immigrants who have not committed a crime would not be \u201cthe focus of deportation.\u201d Unlike Biden, Harris unequivocally committed to ruling out the deportation of individuals whose sole violation was entering the U.S. without documentation. And she did so by giving her version of how she broke with the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policies during her tenure as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cOn this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by [the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s] own definition were non-criminals,\u201d she said. Harris\u2019 comments were an exaggeration, at best. During a tumultuous fight over a \u201csanctuary state\u201d law in California designed specifically to circumvent the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive immigration policies, Harris was, to the lasting frustration of immigrants rights activists, unwilling to publicly advocate for the law. Still, the divergent responses reflect one of the defining cleavages in the Democratic primary field between candidates like Harris willing to take on Obama\u2019s policies, those like Biden who plan to restore them, and variations in between. To be sure, candidates eager to break with Obama\u2019s legacy must contend with his sky-high popularity among Democratic voters. A whopping 71% of Democrats said he was the best president of their lifetime in a July 2018 Pew poll. Obama had a 97% approval rating among Democrats in January 2018. And in a survey released in March of this year, the percentage of party members identifying themselves as \u201cObama Democrats\u201d\u00a0edged out those preferring the labels of liberal, moderate or conservative Democrat. \u201cWe are so scared to criticize Obama because he is a beloved figure,\u201d said Irene Lin, who served in his Obama administration\u2019s Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development and worked for his 2012 re-election effort. But Lin, who is not a fan of what she sees as Obama\u2019s light-touch approach to corporate monopolies and big banks, suggested an alternative path: \u201cYou can separate the person from the policy. I love Barack Obama.\u201d Broadly speaking, the Democratic presidential hopefuls\u2019 approach to Obama and his legacy can be broken into three camps. On one side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been the most vocal and persistent critic of the former president \u2015 including while Obama was in office. In 2011, as Obama pursued a fiscal \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans that would cut Social Security benefits, Sanders went on the warpath against him. In comments to progressive radio talk show host Thom Hartmann\u2019s radio show, Sanders said millions of Americans were \u201cdeeply disappointed in the president\u201d and could not \u201cbelieve how weak he has been,\u201d before suggesting that Obama merited a primary challenge\u00a0in 2012 (that didn\u2019t happen). Sanders also has assailed Obama for his neglect of the Democratic Party at its grassroots levels. During an April 2018 event in Mississippi commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination, Sanders said that \u201cthe business model ... of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure.\u201d \u201cPeople sometimes don\u2019t see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama,\u201d Sanders said to notable silence. \u201cBut behind that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country.\u201d Sanders\u2019 divergence with Obama, however, is clearest not when he specifically mentions the former president but in framing his candidacy as a movement to overturn the \u201cestablishment politics and establishment economics\u201d of both parties. The premise of his presidential campaigns, in 2016 and now again, is that money has corrupted politicians of all stripes, preventing the adoption of policies like Medicare for All and free college that a majority of the public supports. Where Obama saw transcending partisanship as the key to progress, Sanders focuses on replacing corporate influence with an empowered electorate. \u201cMake no mistake about it, this struggle is not just about defeating Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders declared at his campaign launch rally in Brooklyn in March. \u201cThis struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country.\u201d Sanders has undeniably pushed the boundaries of discourse with the Democratic Party to the left. The clearest example of this is on health care. Harris and three other senators in the 2020 race \u2015 Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kristen Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2015 are all co-sponsors of Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill. And in a sign of the issue\u2019s growing resonance, the percentage of voters who support a single-payer health care system rose from 40% in 2000 to 56% today, according to a survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. A narrow majority of Democratic voters \u2015 54% \u2015 want the next president to continue Obama\u2019s policies, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll released in May. Nearly one-third of these voters \u2015 31% \u2015 want a president who is more liberal than Obama; among those 35 or younger, that figure jumps to 45%. Sanders and other progressive contenders will try to tap into this rising demographic \u2015 while also seeking to persuade the large swath of voters fond of Obama that policies that go well beyond what he tried to achieve aren\u2019t necessarily a ding on his legacy. On the other side of the spectrum is Biden, who has cast himself\u00a0as the next best thing to an Obama third term. Some of his biggest applause lines on the stump are when he waxes sentimental about \u201cmy friend Barack,\u201d celebrating his partnership with an \u201cincredible president.\u201d Unlike most of his rivals in the primary field, Biden insists that if Trump is denied re-election, history will regard his presidency as an \u201caberration,\u201d rather than the culmination of structural forces roiling U.S. politics for decades beforehand. Indeed, Biden is running on a return to the normalcy of the Obama era, which he casts as a period of moderate policies and bipartisanship. In a speech in Hampton, New Hampshire, in mid-May, Biden said he wanted to \u201crestore the soul of the nation.\u201d Later on, he suggested that the country didn\u2019t need to look that far back for inspiration. \u201cSpeaking of Barack, I think he didn\u2019t get nearly the kind of credit \u2015 he was one heck of a president, a man of integrity, honor, decency,\u201d Biden said, drawing sustained applause. \u201cThere\u2019s a yearning that we can get past this intense partisan polarization and warfare that has intensified under Trump,\u201d said Jim Kessler, policy chief of the business-friendly Democratic think tank Third Way and a former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cNot that the Obama time was not polarized \u2015 it certainly was \u2015 but there was an attempt to not be.\u201d But even Biden has made his peace with some more popular elements of the party\u2019s leftward shift since Obama\u2019s departure from the White House. He now supports a federal minimum wage of $15, which Obama never endorsed, and the creation of an option to buy into Medicare, a version of which Obama supported as a candidate before jettisoning it as president. Biden was skeptical of pursuing what became one of the hallmarks of Obama\u2019s tenure \u2015 the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2015 but he now claims it as one of the proudest moments of his service in the Obama administration. In proposing ways to improve the ACA, including the creation of a Medicare buy-in, Biden nonetheless admits that the law failed to provide universal coverage or provide affordable care for millions of people who have insurance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to finish the job on health care,\u201d Biden said in a speech to Democrats in Manchester in mid-May. That kind of incremental vision is in keeping with Obama\u2019s approach, in Kessler\u2019s view. \u201cThe Obama legacy was never meant to be a static thing,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats are always moving forward and trying to be right for the particular time we\u2019re in.\u201d In the space between the two, other candidates like Harris, Booker, Warren and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas have found ways to question the outcomes of the Obama era \u2015 without being seen to attack Obama or his legacy. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has perhaps been the most direct among them when he told The New York Times podcast \u201cThe Argument\u201d that \u201cbeing to the left of Obama doesn\u2019t make you extremely progressive. Remember he was the last Democratic president of the Reagan era,\u201d constrained by political dynamics that no longer apply. Warren also has not shied away from drawing policy differences with Obama, while refraining from criticizing him explicitly. Her positioning is striking, however, since it offers a stark contrast with much of her political career. From the moment she was appointed as Congress\u2019 overseer of the bank bailout funds in 2009, Warren made clear she thought the Obama administration was too cozy with Wall Street. As a senator during Obama\u2019s second term, she adhered to that stance as she sank the nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury job and joined with Sanders in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But when HuffPost asked Warren which of Obama\u2019s policy decisions she blamed for contributing to the Democrats\u2019 historic losses of federal and state legislative seats under his watch, she\u00a0declined to directly answer. Without naming Obama or any of his policies though, she managed to issue a broad indictment of Democratic messaging in recent years. \u201cFor far too long, we have not gotten out and made the case for investing not in the top, but investing in the rest of America. We make that case, I believe we\u2019re going to win in 2020, and that\u2019s up and down\u201d the ballot, she said. Warren\u2019s approach has won her praise from unexpected quarters. Asked whether criticism he directs at Sanders for veering too way to the left of Obama extended to Warren, Third Way\u2019s Kessler, who blasted her in the pages of The Wall Street Journal in December 2013, replied, \u201cShe\u2019s running an excellent campaign.\u201d Other candidates have laid out ambitious environmental plans that go well beyond anything Obama proposed. O\u2019Rourke would place a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands \u2015 drilling that Obama encouraged. And Washington Gov. Jay Inslee wants to launch a massive green infrastructure program, far more ambitious than the carbon pricing and regulatory approach Obama favored. Some candidates have already tacitly acknowledged that shaking Biden free from his lead in the polls might require gently taking on the Obama legacy that helps buoy him. Without mentioning either Obama or Biden, Booker has added a section to his stump speech that asks voters to look beyond a restoration of the pre-Trump status quo. \u201cIf you want somebody to run for president and the only thing you want is to beat Donald Trump \u2014 well, I can beat Donald Trump, but I\u2019m telling you that that\u2019s the wrong measure,\u201d he told a crowd in Berlin, New Hampshire, earlier this month. \u201cWe all should be demanding so much more, because the problems of the (state\u2019s rural) north country, the problems of Newark, New Jersey \u2015 so many of our challenges were going on well before Donald Trump was president of the United States,\u201d he said. But Third Way\u2019s Kessler argues that creating distance from Obama is a failed political strategy. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat running for president and you\u2019re running from the Obama legacy, you\u2019re doomed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no space for it in the Democratic primary.\u201d He may have a point. In conversations with over two dozen New Hampshire voters in mid-May, all but a few Democrats were effusive in their praise for the former face of the party. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect. He was great,\u201d said Dick Farrell, a retired teacher attending a town hall Booker conducted in Berlin. Obama \u201cknew how to listen to people and truly listen and formulate his ideas off some common sense that he heard.\u201d Even those who conceded that they wished for more progress on some issues during his presidency largely attributed the disappointments to Republican obstruction. \u201cHe had a tough row to hoe because he had no cooperation from the Senate,\u201d said George Embley, a retired engineer attending a recent town hall Gillibrand conducted in Warner, New Hampshire. \u201cMitch McConnell!\u201d interjected Sally, his wife, referring to the Senate GOP leader from Kentucky who from Day One made clear his objective was to thwart Obama. Vivian Dolkart, a retired psychiatric nurse also at the Gillibrand event, mentioned the Senate\u2019s refusal to even grant Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing. Obama \u201cwas damned no matter what he did,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he had not extended an olive branch, he would have been criticized for that.\u201d So for Biden\u2019s rivals, a safer way to take on the \u201cObama-Biden\u201d juggernaut may be to divorce the former vice president from his more popular former boss. And Biden\u2019s decades-long record as a lawmaker is replete with controversial votes and stances that Obama had no part in. Even before Harris challenged Biden on the busing issue at last week\u2019s debate, Democratic contenders had signaled that his pre-White House record is fair game. Over the Memorial Day weekend, Booker called the Biden-authored 1994 crime bill \u201cshameful.\u201d\u00a0Sanders has repeatedly sought to contrast his opposition to the Iraq War and various international trade agreements with Biden\u2019s support for them. Warren is likely to reignite a debate over a 2005 bill Biden backed that made it harder for households to declare bankruptcy. She and Biden clashed bitterly over the legislation, with Warren \u2015 then an activist law professor \u2015 arguing vehemently against it. Shortly after Biden announced his presidential candidacy in April, Warren told reporters who asked about the dispute, \u201cJoe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.\u201d By contrast, Obama, who had arrived in the Senate just a few months earlier, was one of only 25 senators to vote against the legislation.",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " President Donald Trump began a three-day golf weekend Friday, making his 16th visit to his New Jersey golf club since entering office and pushing his total travel and security costs for his hobby to $108.1 million. The president\u2019s Marine One helicopter touched down at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster around 12:45 p.m. Trump is not scheduled to return to the White House until Sunday, giving him three more golf days at his resort 45 miles west of New York City. Heading into Friday, Trump had spent 60 days at his course in Northern Virginia, 59 days at Bedminster and 57 days at his resort in West Palm Beach. He has also visited his courses in Los Angeles; Doral, Florida; Jupiter, Florida; Scotland and Ireland \u2015 all on the taxpayer dime. Trump\u2019s use of Air Force One, even the smaller version he used Friday, and Marine Corps helicopters both in Washington and New Jersey drive up costs to taxpayers, and the long weekend will add at least $1.1 million to his grand total, according to a HuffPost analysis. While he was a reality TV host and then as a presidential candidate, Trump frequently pounded President Barack Obama for spending too much time on the golf course. Trump often told audiences he would be too busy to take any vacations, let alone play golf. But since taking office, Trump has spent 187 days, counting Friday, on a course that he owns. (He has spent two additional days on courses in Japan at the invitation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during visits there.) That is two and a half times the number of days Obama had visited golf courses at the same point in his first term. And because Trump insists on playing at his own courses in Florida and New Jersey so much, his golf-associated costs to taxpayers are more than triple Obama\u2019s figure through the same time period. Obama played the vast majority of his rounds at military bases within a short drive of the White House. As is typical for Trump\u2019s White House, his staff refused to confirm whether Trump is playing golf Friday at his golf resort. Indeed, the only times the White House has acknowledged that he played golf is when he played with a head of state, a celebrity or South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. In contrast, the staffs of Obama and former President George W. Bush routinely disclosed the presidents\u2019 golf partners.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "NEW ORLEANS, July 9 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court panel grilled Democratic attorneys general on Tuesday about whether Obamacare violates the U.S. Constitution, as it weighs whether to uphold a Texas judge\u2019s ruling striking down the landmark healthcare reform law. The judges focused on whether the 2010 Affordable Care Act lost its justification after Republican President Donald Trump in 2017 signed a law that eliminated a tax penalty used to enforce the ACA\u2019s mandate that all Americans buy health insurance. Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal Obamacare since its 2010 passage. The Justice Department would normally defend a federal law, but the Trump administration has declined to take that position against a challenge by 18 Republican-led states. \u201cIf you no longer have a tax, why isn\u2019t it unconstitutional?\u201d Judge Jennifer Elrod, who was appointed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals by Republican President GeorgeW. Bush, asked attorneys for the Democratic officials defending the law during a hearing in New Orleans. A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general led by California\u2019s Xavier Becerra stepped up to defend the law. The U.S. House of Representatives intervened after Democrats won control in November\u2019s elections during which many focused their campaigns on defending Obamacare. A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, is not expected to decide on Tuesday whether to overturn or uphold the ruling by a federal judge in Texas last year that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. An appellate ruling declaring Obamacare unconstitutional could prompt an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, opening the door for the top court to take up the issue in the midst of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Obamacare, the signature domestic achievement of Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, has been a political flashpoint since its passage. Republican opponents call the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets, while supporters say striking it down would threaten the healthcare of 20 million people who have gained insurance since its enactment. In 2012, a divided U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of its provisions, including the individual mandate, which requires people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate compelled healthy people to buy insurance to offset sicker patients\u2019 costs after Obamacare barred insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority argued that Congress could not constitutionally order people to buy insurance. But Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberal members to hold the mandate was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 tax power. After Trump signed a tax bill passed by a Republican-led Congress that reduced the tax penalty to zero dollars, a coalition of Republican-led states headed by Texas sued, alleging the tax penalty\u2019s elimination rendered Obamacare unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, agreed in December 2018, saying the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it no longer triggered a tax. O\u2019Connor, who was also nominated by George W. Bush, said that because Obamacare called the mandate \u201cessential,\u201d the entire law must be struck down.

      "content": " Say this about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: He\u2019s consistent, especially when he has a chance to sneak in a dig at former President Barack Obama. That\u2019s what the Kentucky senator did on Tuesday when he was asked for his reaction to an NBC News report\u00a0that showed two of his great-great-grandfathers owned slaves, according to U.S. census records. All told, the two men,\u00a0James McConnell and Richard Daley, owned at least 14 slaves in Limestone County, Alabama. McConnell snidely used the report to declare common ground with Obama. \u201cYou know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,\u201d McConnell said at a press conference. \u201cWe both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.\u201d McConnell is correct about Obama\u2019s position on reparations:\u00a0During the 2008 presidential campaign Obama did speak out against offering them to the descendants of slaves. Instead, he said that the government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools, health care and the economy for all, according to The Associated Press. And while many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have openly called for reparations, Obama stuck by his stance in a 2016 interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates.\u00a0Of course, Obama\u2019s stated reasons for opposing reparations have been practical and political considerations, whereas McConnell has simply argued that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d As for Obama\u2019s ancestors owning slaves, that\u2019s also correct with a little more nuance. Back in 2007, an amateur genealogical researcher named William Reitwiesner published a history of Obama\u2019s mother\u2019s family suggesting the future president\u2019s great-great-great-great grandfather George Washington Overall owned two slaves in Kentucky,\u00a0The Guardian reported. In addition, Obama\u2019s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother also owned two slaves. However, in 2012, Ancestry.com released a report linking the president to John Punch, America\u2019s first documented African slave for life. CNN reported that the connection came not from Obama\u2019s African-born father, but from his white mother. McConnell has used Obama to shut down any serious discussion of reparations in Congress. Last month, he said that civil rights legislation \u2015 and\u00a0Obama\u2019s presidency\u00a0\u2015 prove reparations are unnecessary.",

      "author": "Angelina Chapin",
      "content": " UPDATE: 3:15 p.m. \u2014 After protesters demonstrated for hour and a half in the building\u2019s lobby using megaphones and signs, Philadelphia police arrested six activists from the group. When police arrived, undocumented families left the building to avoid being arrested and potentially sent into ICE custody. The protest continues in front of the building, but so far, no one from Biden\u2019s campaign has responded to the group. PREVIOUSLY: A group of families whose loved ones were among the roughly 3 million people deported under the Obama administration will hold a sit-in at Joe Biden\u2019s campaign headquarters in Philadelphia on Wednesday, saying they\u2019ll refuse to leave until they receive an apology from the former vice president. The group of roughly 40 families and activists, organized by New Jersey-based immigrant rights group Movimiento Cosecha, plan to ask Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign to commit to a progressive immigration platform and acknowledge the pain caused by deportations under President Barack Obama. Obama set a record for deportations, although he narrowed his focus later in his presidency to removing convicted criminals, recent border-crossers and people previously removed from the country. (A change in how removals were counted also accounts for some of the record.) Although Obama also pressed for immigration reform and took steps to broaden protections for some immigrants, activists have criticized his administration for its deportation figures and expansion of detention, including for families. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the fact he was complacent to Obama\u2019s vicious deportation machine,\u201d said Catalina Santiago, the media coordinator at Movimiento Cosecha. \u201cHe is shamelessly ignoring the countless families he destroyed.\u201d This event is the first in a campaign the organization has launched to push Democratic candidates toward progressive immigration platforms. Santiago says that Biden can\u2019t criticize President Donald Trump in good faith or be considered an advocate for immigrant communities until he owns up to the destructive policies he supported. Biden has so far defended Obama on deportations. \u201cPresident Obama, I think, did a heck of a job,\u201d he said in the first Democratic presidential debate when asked about deportation numbers. \u201cTo compare him to what [Trump] is doing is ... close to immoral.\u201d The families say they will share their stories in the lobby of the campaign\u2019s building, and if they aren\u2019t arrested or kicked out, will ask that the Democratic presidential candidate pledge to end the detention and deportation of immigrants, and to reunite separated families. Biden himself is unlikely to make an appearance, since he is scheduled for an event in Iowa on Wednesday evening. \u201cIt was the love of my life who was deported,\u201d said Nelly, a 42-year-old immigrant living in Kalamazoo, Michigan, who is participating in the protests and asked that her last name be withheld. \u201cIt was the father of my children and now our lives are completely destroyed.\u201d Norma Morales, another participant, says her 18-year-old son was arrested in 2010 at a birthday party that was broken up by police. Morales remembers the cops telling her that every child who wasn\u2019t a citizen would be released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After a 1 1/2-year court battle, he was deported back to Mexico, and Morales hasn\u2019t seen her only son for the past eight years.\u00a0He was also forced to leave his wife and two daughters, now 8 and 9. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful not to have him here,\u201d she said before the protest. \u201cOn important dates like New Year\u2019s and Christmas I miss him the most.\u201d While Trump threatens to deport millions of undocumented families, his administration has yet to surpass Obama\u2019s deportation levels for any fiscal year, and in some cases those totals are less than half. In 2012, the government deported 419,384 immigrants \u2015 a record for any year, and numbers that have earned Obama the title of \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d among activists. Trump officials are building on the infrastructure of enforcement and detention laid out by the previous administration, says Julie Mao an immigration attorney at Just Futures Law. While it\u2019s true Trump has increased funding for ICE raids and uses anti-immigrant rhetoric, she says, he was given the keys to a car and now has \u201call the fuel he needs to go hog-wild using a system Obama built.\u201d \u201cThey are very much the same policies,\u201d Mao said, comparing the Trump and Obama administrations. \u201cWe need a change in policy, not just a change in identity politics or dog whistle politics.\u201d Morales says she and her family, including her 11- and 12-year-old daughters, are constantly worried that any minor incident could get them deported as well. \u201cI always think about what would happen to my two daughters if the police arrested me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have other siblings who leave work every day with that same fear.\u201d Morales says that while she wants an apology from Biden for her family being ripped apart, she cares more about future action. \u201cI want him to find a way to bring home the families that were separated and repair the damage.\u201d",

      "content": " Britain\u2019s now former ambassador to the U.S. was convinced last year that President Donald Trump scrapped the Iran nuclear pact in part simply because it was forged by his White House predecessor,\u00a0Barack Obama, according to another leaked diplomatic memo. Sir Kim Darroch declared that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to \u201cdiplomatic vandalism,\u201d\u00a0the Daily Mail reported on Saturday, quoting the cable. The newspaper\u00a0obtained an earlier set of leaked cables from Darroch blasting Trump as a man who \u201cradiates insecurity\u201d and his administration as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201cinept.\u201d The leaks resulted in a vicious attack on Darroch by Trump and the envoy\u2019s resignation on Wednesday. In the latest leaked cables to his government, Darroch said the Trump administration was \u201cset upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons \u2014 it was Obama\u2019s deal,\u201d the newspaper reported, referring to the Iranian pact. \u201cMoreover, they can\u2019t articulate any \u2018day-after\u2019 strategy; and contacts with State Department this morning suggest no sort of plan for reaching out to partners and allies, whether in Europe or the region,\u201d Darroch wrote, according to the Mail. Darroch also referred to disagreements within the administration, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0distancing himself from Trump\u2019s decision. Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton were unable to \u201carticulate why the president was determined to withdraw, beyond his campaign promises,\u201d Darroch reportedly wrote. He said in a second cable that Trump signed a memo to withdraw from the pact \u201cfollowing a typically hyperbolic statement on the nature of the \u2018murderous\u2019 Iranian regime,\u201d according to the newspaper. Darroch wrote the memos in May of last year after a failed trip to the U.S. by then-British foreign secretary Boris Johnson,\u00a0who attempted to talk Trump into sticking with the nuclear agreement. The latest bombshell erupted just as reports emerged that investigators had identified a suspect who they believed leaked the cables to the Mail. Both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt \u2014 Tory rivals in a bid to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister \u2014 criticized a Scotland Yard official for warning journalists that they could face prison for publishing government documents. Hunt said he would \u201cdefend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them and judge them to be in the public interest,\u201d The Guardian reported. Johnson said that prosecuting journalists in such a situation\u00a0\u201cwould amount to an infringement on press freedom.\u201d There was no immediate word about the new cable revelations from the White House.",

Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, is an American of both Jamaican and Indian descent. \u201cIt just feels like your blackness is always being put on trial,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI have said to my team, I\u2019m like, \u2019Look, I am not running for black history professor. I am running for president of the United States,\u201d Harris responded. \u201cThese people need to know black history. And it cannot be, as it always ends up being, that the couple of chocolate chips on the stage have to be the ones teaching everybody else about America\u2019s history. It\u2019s America\u2019s history.\u201d Former president Barack Obama\u00a0experienced similar attacks when\u00a0Donald Trump and others questioned where Obama, the first black president, was born. The so-called \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy was developed in the late 2000s to cast doubt his legitimacy as president. Harris told Hill that she\u2019s figuring out where to focus her energy during the presidential race, but that answering questions about her ethnicity is not something she needs to do. \u201cFor other people who can\u2019t figure out am I \u2018black enough,\u2019 I kinda feel like that\u2019s their problem, not mine,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe they need to go back to school to figure it out. And maybe they need to learn about the African diaspora and maybe they need to learn about a number of other things.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Harris has been forced to respond to attacks on her blackness. Earlier this year, she addressed critics who pointed to her record as a prosecutor\u00a0\u2015 which contributed to\u00a0high rates of incarceration\u00a0in California \u2015 as a reason why she wasn\u2019t \u201cblack enough\u201d to represent black Americans. \u201cLook, this is the same thing they did to Barack. This is not new to us,\u201d Harris responded at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to ...\u00a0sow hate and division among us.

The statue, which was unveiled at the Elks Theatre in Rapid City on Saturday, depicts the former president waving one hand while holding hands with his younger daughter, who is also waving her other hand. The design was inspired by a photo of the former president with Sasha Obama at his first inauguration, the Rapid City Journal reported. Barack Obama joins other past U.S. presidents who were memorialized in the downtown area as part of the City of Presidents project that was launched in 2000 under the Rapid City Historic District Tour. The project aims to \u201chonor the legacy of the American presidency\u201d with sculptures positioned along the city\u2019s streets and sidewalks, its website states.

Van Nuys told the crowd at the unveiling ceremony on Saturday that he felt a connection to the inauguration image of Barack Obama and Sasha Obama as a father himself, according to a live taping\u00a0by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting radio station.

He died in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a stroke. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known Justice John Paul Stevens for all of his 99 years, but I\u2019m lucky enough to have known him for some of them,\u201d\u00a0Obama, who was president when Stevens retired, said in a statement. \u201cHe was a good man, a decent man. And our country is better because of his leadership and his example.\u201d \u201cFor more than 34 years on the bench at the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens heard cases with a level of grace, humility, and fidelity to our highest ideals that we should hope all our public servants strive for,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHis balancing of legal precedent with the Constitution\u2019s call for equal justice and an understanding of Americans\u2019 daily lives helped the court \u2014 and the country \u2014 navigate controversial and defining questions of who we are and who we can be. And in doing so with his signature pragmatism and modesty, he played a pivotal role in carrying forward our founding promise into today.\u201d Republican President Gerald Ford nominated Stevens, also a Republican, to the Supreme Court in 1975. Although he told The New York Times Magazine in 2007 that he thought of himself as \u201cpretty darn conservative,\u201d Stevens is often considered a liberal champion of the court. The justice wrote majority opinions on a wide range of issues, including abortion rights, capital punishment, school prayer and campaign-finance reform. Stevens led the high court\u2019s efforts to uphold legal protections for Guantanamo Bay prisoners after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration argued after the 9/11 attacks that prisoners there were not entitled to access to U.S. courts because they were not U.S. citizens and were being held on American soil. In retirement, Stevens remained an outspoken critic of the U.S. policy of detaining enemy combatants in Guantanamo without charges. In May 2012, Obama awarded Stevens a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, for his decadeslong career upholding the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \u201cKnown for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Justice Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law, and the separation of powers,\u201d the White House said at the time.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Long before President Donald Trump turned up the heat on four Democratic congresswomen of color, saying they should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, hateful rhetoric and disinformation about the self-described squad was lurking online. Racist, inflammatory and inaccurate content has circulated on far right blogs, news sites and social media accounts about Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and her three freshman colleagues since they ran for public office. With his tweets and harsh comments, Trump has elevated that rhetoric, playing into a conspiratorial feedback loop that reared its head repeatedly during his campaign and presidency. Trump rose to conservative prominence by falsely claiming former President Barack Obama, the first black president, wasn\u2019t born in the country. Since then, he has promoted claims and memes that originated in the darkest corners of the internet while fueling new ones of his own. His latest targets are Omar and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. In his Sunday tweets , Trump claimed, without identifying the women by name, that the minority legislators \u201coriginally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.\u201d He suggested they should \u201cgo back\u201d to those \u201ctotally broken and crime infested places,\u201d even though three of the four were born in the U.S. and all are U.S. citizens. He has since questioned the women\u2019s allegiance to their country, accusing them of hating America and promoting terrorism while suggesting they should leave America if they\u2019re unhappy here. For some, the Republican president\u2019s tweets were shocking. But for others, they were just an average day on Facebook or Twitter, where allegations that Omar was not legitimately elected, is not a U.S. citizen and committed immigration fraud have festered in far right chatrooms, blogs and social media sites since she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016. \u201cThis is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms or it\u2019s happening on national TV,\u201d Omar said this week. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s reached the White House garden.\u201d Omar was born in Somalia and immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in 1995 when she was a child. She became a U.S. citizen in 2000 at age 17. The rumors about her have been spread by dozens of conservative social media figures and bloggers, including Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer, the latter now banned from Facebook. In February, self-described far right social media influencers Jacob Wohl and Loomer flew to Minneapolis, where they provided live updates on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook of their trip to \u201cinvestigate\u201d Omar\u2019s past and immigration status. Even seemingly everyday citizens have taken to social media to upload their own theories on Omar\u2019s background, with one Minnesota woman posting a video months ago on Facebook sharing \u201cproof\u201d Omar is not a U.S. citizen. The video has been watched more than 50,000 times. Trump also repeated a contested claim, characterizing as \u201cfact\u201d that Omar had married her brother, before acknowledging that he really didn\u2019t know. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother,\u201d Trump said this week in response to a question posed by a conservative news outlet. \u201cI know nothing about it. I hear she was married to her brother. You\u2019re asking me a question about it. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure that somebody will be looking at that.\u201d Omar has described such allegations as \u201cdisgusting lies.\u201d She has declined to provide access to immigration records, birth certificates or other documents that could verify her family history. Omar, the biggest target of online vitriol among the four legislators, has made comments that raise eyebrows, including a remark this spring in which she referenced the Sept. 11 attacks by saying that \u201csome people did something.\u201d She was also criticizing for asking a judge in 2016 to show leniency toward a man accused of trying to join the Islamic State. But other allegations have been provably false. Before they took office, for instance, Omar and Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to Congress , were dogged by false online allegations that they were so anti-American they did not intend to take the oath of office. Others tried to delegitimize Omar in memes that falsely claim Obama resettled 70,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota in an effort to ensure her election. In fact, the state received 6,320 Somali refugees during the Obama administration. A similar inaccurate claim was later floated online about Iraqi refugees in Tlaib\u2019s home state of Michigan. Other comments by the women have been taken widely out of context. Around February, social media users and fringe sites began circulating an edited 2013 clip that they said showed Omar \u201claughing\u201d at al-Qaida and admitting to taking a \u201cterrorism\u201d class. The full context of the 28-minute interview, originally broadcast on a local Minneapolis TV station, shows she was talking about a U.S. college course and was making a point about how the Arabic language had been hijacked by extremist groups to mean something negative. In the 2016 presidential election, Russians relied on a similar online playbook, deploying anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in an effort to boost Trump\u2019s prospects. Racially divisive content was the biggest component of the Russian disinformation campaign, according to Ian Vandewalker, counsel for the Democracy Program at the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice. One Facebook post linked to a Russian agent, for instance, featured a group of women walking in headdresses and asked: \u201cWhat are they hiding?\u201d \u201cA lot of it was fearmongering that was intended to mobilize right-leaning voters,\u201d Vandewalker said. \u201cSome of it was similar to or echoed themes in Trump\u2019s own campaign.\u201d He predicted Russians would revive racially fraught social media content in 2020. Negative sentiment about the four congresswomen has migrated into more mainstream outlets recently. Last week, just days before Trump\u2019s incendiary tweets, Fox News host Tucker Carlson described Omar on his show as having \u201cundisguised contempt for the United States.\u201d The president\u2019s comments, in turn, appear to have inspired even more negative online rhetoric, including a new batch of Facebook and Twitter posts that describe Omar as a \u201cterrorist.\u201d Memes also have emerged calling the women \u201canti-American\u201d and \u201cenemies within.\u201d One mock movie poster labels the women \u201cThe Jihad Squad\u201d and includes the tagline: \u201cPolitical Jihad is their game.\u201d The attacks are part of a pattern for Trump, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a recent book about how Russian hackers and trolls influenced Trump\u2019s election. She pointed to Trump\u2019s birther claims against Obama, which she said suggested \u201che doesn\u2019t belong here, he belongs somewhere else,\u201d as well as Trump\u2019s unfounded claims in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and Obama were co-founders of the Islamic State group. Chants at the president\u2019s rallies \u2014 such as \u201cLock her up!\u201d in reference to Clinton or the newly minted \u201cSend her back!\u201d refrain for Omar \u2014 emerge because Trump has cast the women as enemies of the nation, Jamieson said. The result, she said, is to discredit \u201cthe loyalty, patriotism and ability to act on behalf of the U.S. of an elected official.\u201d ___ Seitz reported from Chicago.

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " For nearly a decade, Republicans crusaded against former President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental regulations. In lawsuit after lawsuit, GOP attorneys general claimed states had a constitutional right to set weaker standards, if that\u2019s what they wanted, and that it superseded the public health benefits of federal rules cutting pollution. The inverse, apparently, isn\u2019t true. On Wednesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler defended the Trump administration\u2019s effort to limit states\u2019 ability to enact stricter rules to curb pollution, particularly planet-heating emissions. \u201cStates don\u2019t always do the appropriate thing,\u201d Wheeler said at a conference at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Those states, he said, just happen to be deep-blue California and New York. Last August, the Trump administration proposed revoking the Golden State\u2019s right to set stricter limits on tailpipe emissions.\u00a0It challenged, for the first time, a provision of the Clean Air Act that gives special autonomy to smog-choked California. The move is part of an effort to reverse Obama-era fuel economy rules at the behest of oil companies and to prevent automakers from having to manufacture vehicles with different standards depending on the state. In June, the EPA issued a new legal guidance that seeks to restrain states that want to deny gas and oil pipeline permits under a specific provision of the Clean Water Act. The guidance came a month after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D)\u00a0rejected a water quality permit and temporarily halted construction of the controversial Williams Pipeline, a conduit to carry natural gas from Pennsylvania to the New York City area. Wheeler called the denial \u201cthe worst environmental decision by an elected official over the last year.\u201d \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is he\u2019s saying he\u2019s vetoing these projects,\u201d\u00a0Wheeler said, adding that Cuomo\u2019s action \u201cis because of climate change and [because] he doesn\u2019t want the fossil fuels to be used.\u201d Blocking the project does little to curb fossil fuel use, he said, and instead forces utilities in the region to import natural gas from Russia. Wheeler added that federalism \u201cdoes not mean that one state can dictate national standards or decisions.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t allow states like California on [fuel economy standards], or New York on vetoing these pipelines, to continue at the expense of the other states in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will step in when we need to.\u201d Wheeler made the remarks just days after The New York Times reported the EPA plans to eliminate a rule that allows individuals or community groups to contest agency-issued pollution permits to a panel of judges. Early in his tenure, during a meeting with governors,\u00a0President Donald Trump asserted that \u201cwe need to make states the laboratories of democracy once again.\u201d \u201cI call it fickle federalism,\u201d said Elizabeth Klein, deputy director at NYU School of Law\u2019s State Energy & Environmental Impact Center. She accused the administration of \u201ctrying to control what states are doing, yanking the floor for environmental protections out from under the states.\u201d \u201cWhatever it is,\u201d Klein, a former associate deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior, said, \u201cit\u2019s not federalism.\u201d Where Klein sees \u201chypocrisy,\u201d some conservatives see nuance. In a HuffPost interview last year, Heritage Foundation fellow Nick Loris called California\u2019s Clean Air Act waiver \u201ca mangled form of federalism,\u201d making the libertarian case for a system where all states set their own standards and competed for the best economic outcomes. \u201cWhat makes this so complicated is that California is the only state that gets to set its own standard, and they can only go higher,\u201d Loris said at the time, referring to emissions restrictions. This means \u201cstates like Texas can\u2019t go lower if they believe the federal standard is too stringent,\u201d he added. \u201cThis form of federalism is not a real true definition of what federalism should look like.\u201d But there\u2019s more to modern conservatism\u2019s dogmatic approach to states\u2019 rights than an absolutist belief in markets\u2019 hallowed wisdom. As explicit racism became increasingly taboo in the U.S.\u00a0throughout the 20th century, segregationists championed \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d as a proxy. The problem, the argument went, wasn\u2019t policies to racially integrate schools and communities \u2015 it was the way the federal government forced states to enact those policies. The same logic allowed a generation of revisionist historians to recast the Civil War as a conflict over states\u2019 rights rather than slavery, despite records showing Confederate states unambiguously declared independence to preserve white supremacy. In 1970, when former President Richard Nixon sought to revive the Republican Party\u2019s electoral fortunes in the South by appealing to racist white voters who felt spurned by Democrats\u2019 embrace of civil rights, he did so under the guise of states\u2019 rights. A decade later, when former President Ronald Reagan gave a presidential campaign speech at the Neshoba County Fair, in an infamous Ku Klux Klan stronghold in Mississippi, he famously told the cheering crowd: \u201cI believe in states\u2019 rights.\u201d The argument isn\u2019t the purview of Republicans alone. During the first round of Democratic presidential debates last month, former Vice President Joe Biden defended his past opposition to integrating public schools by busing students from black communities to schools in mostly-white areas and vice versa by claiming he simply opposing busing as a federal mandate. \u201cI did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed was busing ordered by the Department of Education \u2015 that\u2019s what I opposed,\u201d Biden said. States\u2019 rights arguments are once again being used to scale back voting protections, amounting to what Dissent magazine dubbed \u201claundering racism.\u201d But if states\u2019 rights were once a thin euphemism for segregation, the two-word phrase now also serves as a stand-in for industrial deregulation. But disturbing parallels remain between the two. A\u00a0landmark EPA study published last year found that black Americans, on average, are exposed to 1.54 times more PM2.5 than the general population. The particulate matter, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller,\u00a0is among the most harmful air pollution.\u00a0The fine-grained particles wedge themselves into the lungs and increase the likelihood of cancer.\u00a0Black people breathe air that is 38% more polluted than the air their white compatriots are exposed to, an NAACP\u00a0report found last year, and they are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2015 A federal judge said Wednesday that the Trump administration can enforce its\u00a0new restrictions on asylum\u00a0for people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border while lawsuits challenging the policy play out. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly denied a request for a temporary restraining order, saying the immigrant advocate groups behind the suit did not show that their work would be irreparably harmed if\u00a0the policy\u00a0moved forward. Kelly is an appointee of President Donald Trump. The groups sued on behalf of themselves as nonprofit groups that offer services to immigrants who would be unable to seek asylum under the new restrictions. A separate hearing on a similar suit was scheduled later Wednesday in San Francisco. U.S. District Jon Tigar, overseeing that case, has already barred less restrictive policies on asylum from taking effect and could act to block the new asylum policy. Tigar was appointed by President Barack Obama. It was an unusual victory for the administration, even if a temporary one. Federal courts have repeatedly stopped the administration from enforcing many of its proposals cracking down on people crossing the border. The latest proposal prevents most migrants at the southern border from seeking asylum in the U.S. if they passed through another country first. It targets the tens of thousands of Central American adults and children who cross Mexico every month to try to enter the U.S. It also would affect asylum-seekers from Africa, Asia, and South America. Legal groups argued the administration\u2019s proposal was barred by federal law establishing how people can seek asylum. \u201cWe are disappointed in the court\u2019s decision today,\u201d said Claudia Cubas, litigation direction for the Capital Area Immigrants\u2019 Rights Coalition. U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive, regardless of how they did so. There is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be \u201csafe.\u201d At the northern border, the U.S. and Canada have a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement that limits people who arrive in one country from seeking asylum in the other. The U.S. has sought to reach the same agreement with Mexico and Guatemala, but Guatemala\u2019s high court blocked a possibly agreement. Mexico has said no agreement has been decided. Top U.S. officials say their latest plan would discourage migrants from leaving their countries, which is necessary to reduce the numbers of people that U.S. border agents are detaining. Reports of squalid conditions at some U.S. border detention facilities have sparked mass outrage, and advocates accuse the administration of unnecessarily detaining people seeking asylum and mistreating people in custody. The plan has exceptions. If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied, then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum. The policy went into effect Tuesday, one day after it was announced, though some officials said it was only being put in place in one location. Hundreds of immigrants still showed up at U.S. border crossings trying to request asylum but with their prospects uncertain. ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Long in Washington and Nomaan Merchant in Houston contributed to this report.",

Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that they should be concerned about Obama\u2019s book deal but didn\u2019t specify which one. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace what the Democrats are doing,\u201d Trump said of the calls for investigations into his 2016 campaign and possible obstruction of justice. \u201cLet\u2019s look into Obama the way they looked at me. They could look into the book deal that President Obama made,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cLet\u2019s subpoena all of his records.\u201d He also called for lawmakers to investigate his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, which he\u2019s been insisting on for years. In 2017, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama signed a joint book deal with Penguin Random House reportedly worth more than $65 million, according to the Financial Times. The former president is working on a memoir as part of that deal, which is expected to be released in 2020 as the presidential campaigns heat up. Michelle Obama published her popular memoir, \u201cBecoming,\u201d last year. There are two other books under Barack Obama\u2019s belt, both written before his presidency. \u201cDreams From my Father,\u201d a memoir, was published in 1995, and \u201cThe Audacity of Hope\u201d was released in 2006. This is the first time Trump has publicly claimed a conspiracy involving Obama\u2019s book deal, making the rant appear to be a distraction after former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony Wednesday. Before two House committees in back-to-back hearings, Mueller testified that Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice after he left office and said that the president had not been entirely truthful in his written answers for the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller also refuted Trump\u2019s claims of \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d on the allegations investigated, confirming that the report did not exonerate Trump from any crimes. Trump continues to claim that the special counsel probe yielded nothing incriminating and said as much again Friday. \u201cI watched Bob Mueller and they have nothing. There is no collusion, there is no obstruction, they have nothing. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said.",

Jarrett was notably the subject of a racist and Islamophobic tweet by disgraced comedian Roseanne Barr comparing Jarrett to the \u201cPlanet of the Apes.\u201d During a town hall discussion in May of last year, Jarrett addressed the comments by Barr, a vocal Trump supporter, by noting \u201ctone does start at the top.\u201d \u201cWe like to look up to our president, and feel as though he reflects the values of our country,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBut I also think every individual citizen has a responsibility too.\u201d The co-signers of the letter noted their support for the four freshman congresswoman often referred to as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d \u201cWe stand with congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, as well as all those currently under attack by President Trump, along with his supporters and his enablers, who feel deputized to decide who belongs here \u2014 and who does not,\u201d the letter read. It continued, \u201cThere is truly nothing more un-American than calling on fellow citizens to leave our country \u2014 by citing their immigrant roots, or ancestry, or their unwillingness to sit in quiet obedience while democracy is being undermined.\u201d Read the entire op-ed in The Washington Post here.",

      "author": "Elise Foley",
      "content": " In one of the hottest moments of the Democratic primary debate on Wednesday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) turned to face former Vice President Joe Biden and said, \u201cMr. Vice President, you can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d Booker was referring to Biden\u2019s (and President Barack Obama\u2019s) record on immigration: During their two terms, a record number of immigrants were deported, earning Obama the title of \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d from some immigrants\u2019 rights advocates. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,\u201d Booker said during the CNN-hosted debate. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d For his part, Biden defended Obama, while refusing to say whether he\u2019d done anything to stop deportations. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) repeatedly pressed him on the matter but never got an answer. \u201cDid you say those deportations were a good idea?\u201d de Blasio asked. \u201cOr did you go to the president and say, \u2018This is a mistake. We shouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019 Which one?\u201d Biden both distanced himself from Obama\u2019s record and refused to answer the question. \u201cI was vice president. I was not the president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI keep my recommendation to him private.\u201d Biden noted repeatedly that Obama enacted pro-immigrant policies \u2014 like legal protections for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children \u2014 and made a major push for comprehensive immigration reform. That reform push ultimately failed because congressional GOP leaders refused to take it up, in spite of the years of high deportation figures that were intended, in part, to convince Republicans that Democrats weren\u2019t soft on unauthorized immigration. Obama later shifted his policies and his deportation figures dropped. Now, with President Donald Trump in office, Democrats are unified in support of comprehensive immigration reform and in opposition to the current president\u2019s policies, including separating children from parents. But the particulars of the immigration policy debate have shifted. So far this cycle, one of the main issues at hand has been whether to repeal the law that makes it a criminal offense to cross the border without authorization. Decriminalizing that type of migration would mean that immigrants could still face deportation or civil penalties for crossing \u2015 but they couldn\u2019t be criminally prosecuted, which is how the Trump administration was able to split up immigrant families last year. Much like during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, the candidates were divided into two camps regarding immigration: those who insisted that nothing needs to be done beyond removing Trump and those who wanted to repeal the law. Biden opposes decriminalizing migration, and said that Trump is the reason the law is being abused. He also pointed out that opponent Juli\u00e1n Castro, the top booster of decriminalization, served in the Obama administration too, as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cMr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past,\u201d Castro responded, \u201cand one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

Heck, if [Obama] was running for president for a third term, I wouldn\u2019t be running.\u201d The presidential hopeful went on to say that Trump \u201cis a guy that my Republican colleagues can\u2019t even criticize when he\u2019s preaching racism.\u201d Booker later added: \u201cThe reality is we have a situation right now where the president is doing things to this country that are perverting our very values and ideals, and talking about what our plans would be, different than the previous president; different than the current president, is not a bad thing.\u201d On Wednesday, Booker went head to head with former Vice President Joe Biden over several issues, getting particularly heated on criminal justice. \u201cIf you want to compare records \u2015 and frankly, I\u2019m shocked that you do \u2015 I am happy to do that,\u201d said Booker at one point. Ahead of the debate, Booker called Biden\u2019s new criminal justice proposal \u201can inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country.\u201d In response, Biden\u2019s team said \u201cthe absurdity of this attack\u201d was \u201cobvious.\u201d Booker went on the offensive with Biden on the issue, calling out the 76-year-old\u2019s past positions. \u201cSince the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,\u201d said Booker. \u201cAnd those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can\u2019t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.\u201d When Biden responded, he defended himself by saying what he believes about the issue now and called out Booker for not doing enough to reform Newark, New Jersey, when he was mayor. Booker pushed back hard, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in my community that you\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don\u2019t even know the flavor. You are trying to shift the view from what you created.\u201d \u201cThere are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough-on-crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine. This isn\u2019t about the past. This is about the present right now,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " Following a contentious debate among Democratic White House contenders Wednesday, a number of party leaders aren\u2019t thrilled that some of the candidates focused on attacking former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as a way to challenge Joe Biden. In one of the debate\u2019s\u00a0hottest exchanges, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called out the former vice president \u2015 the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race \u2015 for repeatedly using Obama\u2019s name to shield himself from criticism directed his way on issues like criminal justice and immigration. \u201cMr. vice president, you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker said, referring to Biden\u2019s \u2015 and Obama\u2019s \u2015 record on immigration, which saw a record number of undocumented immigrants deported during their eight-year administration. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Biden defended himself by noting Obama\u2019s decision to select him as his running mate, saying, \u201cBarack Obama knew exactly who I was.\u201d Also taking Biden to task on the deportation figures was Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 a particularly striking moment, since the Texan served in Obama\u2019s administration as secretary of housing and urban development. Biden spotlighted that, responding to Castro,\u00a0\u201cThe secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. Castro retorted: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d Polls show Obama remains a popular figure among all voters, with approval ratings easily outstripping those for President Donald Trump.\u00a0And among Democrats, Obama remains by far the most admired politician. Booker, in comments to CNN\u00a0on Thursday, insisted it wasn\u2019t a negative to reconsider part of the record of the Obama administration as part of the process of choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are \u201chaving an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible,\u201d Booker said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure (if) Barack Obama was sitting here ... He will tell you, \u2018I made some mistakes.\u2019\u201d But several of Booker\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues expressed concern about the tactic, arguing it would needlessly expose divisions in the party and take the focus off of Trump and his administration. \u201cI think attacking President Obama is bad policy and bad politics,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Of Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president, Blumenthal added: \u201cHe owns it, for better or worse. But he should be proud of it.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also suggested the Democratic race should be marked by a more hands-off approach toward Obama. \u201cYou can disagree with him, and I have, but the bottom line is ... he did an extraordinary job, and he should be given that recognition by those that are running for the presidency.\u201d Others who watched the debate expressed similar sentiments, including longtime Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged his party\u2019s White House contenders to train their sights firmly on Trump. \u201cI think President Obama is a very popular figure in America to this day because he did a very good job. Did he accomplish everything? No,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Thursday, \u201cYou compare the Obama administration to this administration \u2015 it\u2019s night and day.\u201d Veteran Republican political consultant John Weaver \u2015 a fierce Trump critic \u2015was blunter:",

Castro has proposed to decriminalize illegal border crossings, making it a civil violation and preventing future administrations from separating families at the border. \u201cPresident Obama was trying and that administration made adjustments and improved on immigration,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cHowever, Trump has weaponized a certain section of the law to inflict cruelty on migrant children and their parents, so there are lessons we can learn from this.\u201d After his time was up, Castro told reporters backstage that he feels the news media was playing into the Biden campaign\u2019s hands by framing his criticism of the vice president as an attack on the Obama administration. The Democratic primary debate on Wednesday heated up when several candidates, including Castro, piled on Biden over the record number of deportations made under the Obama administration. Biden suggested that Castro\u2019s plan to decriminalize border crossings was unnecessary, to which Castro replied: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential golf costs have topped $110 million in his 2 1/2 years in office \u2013 more than $4 million more than a conservative group\u2019s estimate for predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s total travel costs over two full terms. Trump arrived at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Friday evening and is scheduled to remain there through Sunday afternoon. It is his 18th golf trip there since taking office. Sunday will mark his 67th day at that course and his 199th day at a golf course he owns. The White House on Saturday did not respond to queries about Trump\u2019s golf activities. Each of the president\u2019s trips to Bedminster costs taxpayers at least $1.1 million in travel and security expenses, according to a HuffPost analysis. Each trip to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida \u2013 of which Trump has made 24 \u2013 costs taxpayers $3.4 million. Since taking office, Trump also has visited his golf resorts in Los Angeles; Doral, Florida; Doonbeg, Ireland; and Turnberry, Scotland \u2015 all on the taxpayer dime. He also has made 64 day trips to his course in northern Virginia. Judicial Watch, a tax-exempt conservative group, in 2017 said that its tally of Obama\u2019s travel costs based on documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act lawsuits had hit $105.7 million. That total, though, appears to include official trips of Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, as well as some campaign-related travel that was partially reimbursed by the Democratic Party. Trump\u2019s $110.3 million total in HuffPost\u2019s analysis is for travel to and from golf vacations, and does not include official or campaign travel. It is based on cost elements derived from a Government Accountability Office report released in January that detailed four Mar-a-Lago trips Trump took just weeks after entering office. Judicial Watch did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. A review of its web site shows that it remains focused on attacking 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former FBI director James Comey and former special counsel Robert Mueller. During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump was a frequent critic of Obama\u2019s golf hobby. \u201cCan you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in 2014. During his campaign for president, Trump claimed that he would be too busy working to have time for any vacations at all. \u201cI love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Turnberry again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Doral again,\u201d he told a rally audience in February 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see anything. I just want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.\u201d Instead, Trump has been on the golf course two and a half times as much as Obama was at the same time in his presidency. And, because he insists on playing on his own courses in Florida and New Jersey so much, his golf-related costs to taxpayers are triple that of Obama\u2019s in the same time period. Most of Obama\u2019s golf rounds were played at military bases within motorcade range of the White House, which cost taxpayers relatively little. In contrast, 68% of Trump\u2019s golf days have been at his resorts that require the use of Air Force jets, Marine Corps helicopters, and Air Force transport planes to move his motorcade vehicles. His trips to Mar-a-Lago also require Coast Guard boats and ships to patrol the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. On his overseas golf outings, the travel footprint is even larger. Trump\u2019s recent trip to Doonbeg, Ireland, for example, cost taxpayers some $3.6 million, even though it involved relatively short flights to and from southern England and northern France.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0defended former President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration record on Saturday, even as he conceded that they both learned from the failure of their tough approach early on in which they tried to win over Republican lawmakers. Biden was one of 19 Democratic presidential candidates to speak at a candidate forum hosted by the public-sector labor union AFSCME in Las Vegas on Saturday. Jon Ralston of The Nevada Independent, who moderated the discussion alongside HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel, asked Biden to elaborate on how he feels about the Obama administration\u2019s record volume of deportations of undocumented immigrants in its first term. \u201cWe learned a lot in the process,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen the president got elected, everything landed on his desk but locusts. We were about to go into a depression.\u201d He went on to imply that the Obama administration employed a tough approach to border enforcement and unauthorized immigration partly in the misplaced hope that it would lay the groundwork for a bipartisan immigration reform bill. \u201cWe thought at the beginning we might be able to get a more rational approach to the way we dealt with, for example, immigration,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBy the middle of the term, it was clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen and things changed.\u201d The changes the administration implemented included executive orders aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants who arrived as children \u2015 those known as Dreamers \u2015 and their parents, the former vice president noted. Ralston pressed Biden to reveal any details about how he might have advocated against the deportations behind closed doors during Obama\u2019s first term. But Biden reiterated what he said during the presidential debate on Wednesday night \u2015 that he does not reveal his discussions with Obama behind closed doors. \u201cThe focus was on deporting felons,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cComparing what he did to what Trump did is just absolutely off the wall \u2015 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d (No Democratic candidate has actually compared Obama\u2019s policies to those of President Donald Trump.) In a subsequent exchange with Terkel, Biden confirmed that he does not support changing unauthorized border crossing from a crime to a civil penalty. Doing so \u201cwill be an invitation\u201d for more undocumented immigrants to take their chances by just showing up at the border, he argued. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is keep parents in difficult circumstances from giving their children to a coyote\u201d to transport them to the border. Since the candidate forum was hosted by AFSCME, which is celebrating the passage of a Nevada law granting state workers collective bargaining rights, much of Saturday\u2019s discussion focused on the priorities of union workers. Terkel asked Biden how he responded to criticism of the Obama administration for not pushing harder to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize by ratifying their majority through card check and thereby avoiding employer intimidation. \u201cWe pressed and pressed,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, there were other things happening as well.\u201d He went on to attribute it to the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, even though most of the criticism faults the Obama administration for failing to pass it in its first two years in power, when Democrats controlled both branches of government. \u201cWe did not have a Democratic Congress to be able to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would.\u201d",

He put out a statement Monday, after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, claimed at least 31 lives and injured dozens more over the weekend. During his presidency, Obama spoke after more than\u00a0a dozen mass shootings, and memorably wept as he gave a speech\u00a0in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cNo other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cEvery time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders. \u2026 But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings.\u201d In El Paso, the shooter reportedly penned an anti-immigrant manifesto and was motivated by racist, white supremacist ideology. In his statement, Obama called for both law enforcement and internet platforms to increase efforts to reduce the influence of hate groups in radicalizing troubled individuals. He called on the country to \u201csend a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy.\u201d Though he did not name anyone in particular, much of what Obama condemned was speech used by his presidential successor, Donald Trump. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\u201d the former president wrote. Trump\u00a0has faced heavy criticism for his own role in promoting the anti-immigrant rhetoric that the El Paso shooter espoused. In a statement Monday, Trump condemned white supremacy and racism, but did not acknowledge how his own comments had fueled such beliefs. \u201cSuch language isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cIt has no place in our politics and our public life.

      "content": " Former President Barack Obama commemorated the life and legacy of author Toni Morrison, who died Monday night\u00a0at the age of 88, honoring \u201cher masterful will\u201d and her \u201cfusion of the African American story within the American story.\u201d \u201cToni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful \u2014 a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy,\u201d he said in a statement. Time is no match for Toni Morrison. In her writing, she sometimes toyed with it, warping and creasing it, bending it to her masterful will. In her life\u2019s story, too, she treated time nontraditionally. A child of the Great Migration who\u2019d lifted up new, more diverse voices in American literature as an editor, Toni didn\u2019t publish her first novel until she was 39 years old. From there followed an ascendant career\u2014a Pulitzer, a Nobel, and so much more\u2014and with it, a fusion of the African American story within the American story. Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful\u2014a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories\u2014that our stories\u2014will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time. As president, Obama awarded the trailblazing author the Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 2012, honoring her career in centering the lives and histories of African Americans. \u201cAs a single mother working at a publishing company by day, she would carve out a little time in the evening to write, often with her two sons pulling on her hair and tugging at her earrings. Once, a baby spit up on her tablet so she wrote around it. Circumstances may not have been ideal, but the words that came out were magical,\u201d Obama said at the ceremony. \u201cToni Morrison\u2019s prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt.\u00a0 From \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 to \u2018Beloved,\u2019 Toni reaches us deeply, using a tone that is lyrical, precise, distinct, and inclusive,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe believes that language \u2018arcs toward the place where meaning might lie.\u2019 The rest of us are lucky to be following along for the ride.\u201d \u201cI remember reading \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write, but also how to be and how to think,\u201d he added later, referring to her 1977 novel. Obama also cited Morrison while reflecting on his favorite books during an interview with then-New York Times\u00a0book critic Michiko Kakutani, shortly before he left office in 2017. \u201cI think Toni Morrison\u2019s writings \u2014 particularly \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat it\u2019s not just pain, but there\u2019s joy and glory and mystery.\u201d Former first lady Michelle Obama has also mentioned the book as a source of inspiration. In 2018, she told The New York Times\u00a0that she has read the novel three times. \u201cI rarely have time to reread books, but \u2018Song of Solomon,\u2019 every time I pick it up, I\u2019m pulled into that story,\u201d she told\u00a0Today show host Jenna Bush Hager\u00a0earlier this year. Morrison, best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u201cBeloved,\u201d died Monday night\u00a0in New York City of unspecified causes, her publisher, Knopf, said Tuesday. In 1993, she became the first Black woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In a rare step for her, Morrison endorsed Obama in 2008,\u00a0writing in a letter\u00a0that she chose the then-Illinois senator over his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, for his \u201ccreative imagination,\u201d calling him \u201cthe man for this time.\u201d In thinking carefully about the strengths of the candidates, I stunned myself when I came to the following conclusion: that in addition to keen intelligence, integrity and a rare authenticity, you exhibit something that has nothing to do with age, experience, race or gender and something I don\u2019t see in other candidates. That something is a creative imagination which coupled with brilliance equals wisdom. It is too bad if we associate it only with gray hair and old age. Or if we call searing vision na\u00efvet\u00e9. Or if we believe cunning is insight. Or if we settle for finessing cures tailored for each ravaged tree in the forest while ignoring the poisonous landscape that feeds and surrounds it. Wisdom is a gift; you can\u2019t train for it, inherit it, learn it in a class, or earn it in the workplace\u2013that access can foster the acquisition of knowledge, but not wisdom. In 2012,\u00a0she told The Guardian\u00a0that attending Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009 was \u201cthe first time she felt truly American.\u201d \u201cI felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid. The marines and the flag, which I never look at \u2014 all of a sudden it looked \u2026 nice. Worthy,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt only lasted a couple of hours. But I was amazed, that music that I really don\u2019t like \u2014 God Bless America is a dumb song; I mean it\u2019s not beautiful. But I really felt that, for that little moment.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DAYTON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump defended his rhetoric Wednesday as he headed out to offer a message of healing and unity in El Paso and Dayton, where he was to be met by unusual hostility from people who fault his own incendiary words as contributing to last weekend\u2019s mass shootings. The mayors of both cities were calling for Trump to change the way he talks about immigrants.Multiple protests were planned. And Democratic presidential candidates continued to criticize him, including former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who will address a counter-rally in his hometown of El Paso during the president\u2019s visit. As he left the White House, Trump defended his rhetoric while strongly criticizing those who say he bears some responsibility for the nation\u2019s divisions, returning to political arguing even as he called for unity. \u201cMy critics are political people,\u201d Trump said, noting the apparent political leanings of the shooter in the Dayton killings and suggesting the man was supportive of Democrats. \u201cHad nothing to do with President Trump,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo these are people that are looking for political gain.\u201d He also denied his rhetoric had anything to do with the violence, claiming instead that he \u201cbrings people together. Our country is doing incredibly well.\u201d It is a highly unusual predicament for an American president to at once try to unite a community and a nation at the same time he is being criticized as contributing to a combustible climate that can spawn violence. Some 85% of U.S. adults believe the tone and nature of political debate has become more negative, with a majority saying Trump has changed things for the worse, according to recent Pew Research Center polling. And more than three quarters, 78%, say that elected officials who use heated or aggressive language to talk about certain people or groups make violence against those people more likely. Trump traveled to Ohio, before heading to Texas. White House officials have said the visits would be similar to those he\u2019s paid to grieving communities in the past, with the Republican president and the first lady saluting first responders and spending time with mourning families and survivors. \u201cWe\u2019ll be meeting with first responders, law enforcement and some of the victims and paying my respects and regards,\u201d Trump said Wednesday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific opportunity, really, to congratulate some of the police and law enforcement. The job they\u2019ve done was incredible. Really incredible\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that Trump also wants \u201cto have a conversation\u201d about ways to head off future deadly episodes. \u201cWe can do something impactful to prevent this from ever happening again, if we come together,\u201d the spokesman said. That\u2019s a tough assignment for a president who\u00a0thrives on division\u00a0and whose aides say he views stoking discord and unease about cultural, economic and demographic changes as key to his reelection. Trump insisted that Congress was making progress on possible new gun legislation. He said he has had \u201cplenty of talks\u201d with lawmakers in recent days and that there is \u201ca great appetite, and I mean a very strong appetite, for background checks.\u201d But passage of a pending background check bill in the Senate remains unlikely Support for a bipartisan measure reached a high-point with a 2013 vote after the Sandy Hook shooting but it fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Trump, who often seems most comfortable on rally stages with deeply partisan crowds, has not excelled at projecting empathy in public, often mixing what can sound like perfunctory expressions of grief with awkward offhand remarks. While he has offered hugs to tornado victims and spent time at the bedsides of shooting victims, he has yet to project the kind of emotion and vulnerability of his recent predecessors. Barack Obama grew visibly shaken as he addressed the nation in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre and teared up while delivering a 2016 speech on new gun control efforts. George W. Bush helped bring the country together following the Sept. 11 attacks, notably standing atop the smoking rubble of the World Trade Center, his arm draped over the shoulder of a firefighter, as he shouted through a bullhorn. Trump, too, has been able to summon soothing words. But then he often quickly lapses into divisive tweets and statements \u2014 just recently painting immigrants as \u201cinvaders,\u201d suggesting four Democratic congresswoman of color should\u00a0\u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries\u00a0even though they\u2019re U.S. citizens and\u00a0deriding majority-black Baltimore\u00a0as a rat-infested hell-hole. In the Texas border city of El Paso, some residents and local Democratic lawmakers said Trump was not welcome and urged him to stay away. \u201cThis president, who helped create the hatred that made Saturday\u2019s tragedy possible, should not come to El Paso,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted. \u201cWe do not need more division. We need to heal. He has no place here.\u201d Trump, on the eve of his El Paso trip, snapped back on Twitter that O\u2019Rourke \u201cshould respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!\u201d In Dayton, Mayor Nan Whaley said she would be meeting with Trump on Wednesday, but she told reporters she was disappointed with his scripted remarks Monday responding to the shootings. His speech included a denunciation of \u201cracism, bigotry and white supremacy\u201d and a declaration that \u201chate has no place in America.\u201d But he didn\u2019t mention any new efforts to limit sales of certain guns or the anti-immigration rhetoric found in an online screed posted just before the El Paso attack. The hateful manifesto\u2019s author \u2014 police believe it was the shooter but investigation continues \u2014 insisted the opinions \u201cpredate Trump and his campaign for president.\u201d But the words echoed some of the views Trump has expressed on immigration, Democrats and the media. Whaley said simply, \u201cEveryone has it in their power to be a force to bring people together, and everybody has it in their power to be a force to bring people apart \u2014 that\u2019s up to the president of the United States.\u201d Democrats vying to challenge Trump in the 2020 election will also have their say. Former Vice President Joe Biden,\u00a0the front-runner\u00a0in the 2020 Democratic primary, is slated to speak on white nationalism later Wednesday in Iowa. According to excerpts from his campaign, Biden will declare Trump \u201clacks the moral authority to lead\u201d because he has \u201caligned himself with the darkest forces in our nation\u201d and \u201cin both clear language and in code ... has fanned the flames of white supremacy.\u201d O\u2019Rourke will be addressing an #ElPasoStrong rally Wednesday afternoon that will serve as counterprogramming to Trump\u2019s visit, in addition to attending a morning remembrance and making an evening visit to a makeshift memorial outside the Walmart where a gunman killed 22 people. And New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will deliver a speech on gun violence and white nationalism at the Charleston, South Carolina, church where nine black parishioners were killed in 2015. White House and Trump campaign officials have denounced suggestions that Trump\u2019s rhetoric was in any way responsible for the Texas shooting.",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " President Donald Trump is weighing his options for executive action on gun control following a pair of mass shootings that killed more than 30 people, according to the White House. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, actually did take executive action on gun control not long after a gunman slaughtered 26 children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012.\u00a0And one of Trump\u2019s first actions as president was to undo an Obama regulation that would have blocked some people with mental impairments from buying guns. The rule, which became effective just two days before Trump took office, required the Social Security Administration (SSA) to inform the FBI\u2019s criminal background check system about disabled adults receiving benefits through a representative because a mental impairment limited their ability to manage finances. The Department of Veterans Affairs has long followed a similar policy, which accounts for the bulk of mental incompetency referrals to the background check system from federal agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most of the 4.6 million records prohibiting gun sales due to mental incompetency in the database as of 2016 came from state and local authorities. The SSA\u00a0finalized the rule at the end of 2016, a year in which Obama touted several gun control reforms he\u2019d undertaken without help from Congress.\u00a0\u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can\u2019t hold America hostage,\u201d Obama said on Twitter that year. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this carnage in our communities.\u201d Because Obama pursued the policy involving the SSA through regulation, however, Congress had an easy time overturning it once Trump assumed the White House. Thanks to a special legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act, Republicans undid more than a dozen regulations that had been finalized late in Obama\u2019s second term. Gun control advocates such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence applauded the mental incapacity rule, but its critics included civil liberty and disability advocates. The rule would have restricted firearms sales for roughly 80,000 people, though the restrictions could be appealed. \u201cThe thousands of Americans whose disability benefits are managed by someone else range from young people with depression and financial inexperience to older adults with Down syndrome needing help with a limited budget,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union said in a February 2017 statement. \u201cBut no data \u2015 none \u2015 show that these individuals have a propensity for violence in general or gun violence in particular.\u201d Research shows\u00a0that most mass shooters don\u2019t have severe mental health problems. The man arrested in the killing of 22 people in El Paso on Saturday allegedly wrote that he was doing it to fight an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants, echoing the president\u2019s racist rhetoric. Trump said Wednesday that background checks and mental health policies, rather than restrictions on types of firearms, are his main focus. He told reporters that he\u2019s hoping Republicans and Democrats in Congress can agree on gun control legislation focused on those topics. Administration officials have said they\u2019re also looking at addressing the matters through executive action, though they haven\u2019t specified what they have in mind. Last year, the Trump administration used its executive authority to ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as illegal machine guns. Bump stocks helped a gunman massacre 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017. White House spokespeople did not reply to a request for comment on whether the president would favor bringing back the restriction on firearms for mentally impaired Social Security recipients. One complication looms for such a move \u2015 federal agencies are not supposed to be able to reissue regulations struck down by the Congressional Review Act. But the Trump administration has already shown it doesn\u2019t care about that restriction. One of the Obama rules Republicans nixed in 2017 had to do with drug testing the jobless; the Trump administration brought it back last year in a tougher form.",

      "content": "MORTON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 U.S. immigration officials raided several Mississippi food processing plants on Wednesday, part of a large-scale operation carried out by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration that targeted both owners and employees. The raids came hours before Trump was to visit El Paso, Texas, to offer sympathy to the majority-Latino city where a man linked to an online screed about a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d was charged in a shooting that left 22 people dead in the border city. Workers filled three buses \u2014 two for men and one for women \u2014 at a Koch Foods Inc. plant in tiny Morton, 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Jackson. They were taken to a military hangar to be processed for immigration violations. About 70 family, friends and residents waved goodbye and shouted, \u201cLet them go! Let them go!\u201d Later, two more buses arrived. A tearful 13-year-old boy whose parents are from Guatemala waved goodbye to his mother, a Koch worker, as he stood beside his father. Some employees tried to flee on foot but were captured in the parking lot. Workers who were confirmed to have legal status were allowed to leave the plant after having their trunks searched. \u201cIt was a sad situation inside,\u201d said Domingo Candelaria, a legal resident and Koch worker who said authorities checked employees\u2019 identification documents. The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Bryan Cox, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said search warrants were executed at seven locations across Mississippi, targeting several companies. He did not have additional details, including a preliminary estimate of arrests. The sting was another demonstration of Trump\u2019s signature domestic priority to crack down illegal immigration. Such large shows of force were common under President George W. Bush, most notably at a kosher meatpacking plant in tiny Postville, Iowa, in 2008. President Barack Obama avoided them, limiting his workplace immigration efforts to low-profile audits that were done outside of public view. Trump resumed workplace raids, but the months of preparation and hefty resources they require make them rare. Last year, the administration hit a landscaping company near Toledo, Ohio, and a meatpacking plant in eastern Tennessee. The former owner of the Tennessee plant was sentenced to 18 months in prison last month. A hangar at the Mississippi National Guard in Flowood, near Jackson, was set up with 2,000 meals to process employees for immigration violations on Wednesday. There were seven lines, one for each location that was hit. Buses had been lined up since early in the day to be dispatched to the plants. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this,\u201d Chris Heck, resident agent in charge of ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations unit in Jackson, told The Associated Press inside the hangar. \u201cThis is a very large worksite operation.\u201d Koch Foods, based in Park Ridge, Illinois, is one of the largest poultry producers in the U.S. and employs about 13,000 people, with operations in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and Tennessee. Forbes ranks it as the 135th largest privately held company in the U.S., with an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue. The Morton plant produces more than 700,000 tons of poultry feed a year, company officials said in February. The company has no relation to prominent conservative political donors and activists Charles and David Koch. Agents arrived at the Morton plant, passing a chain-link fence with barbed wire on top, with a sign that said the company was hiring. Mike Hurst, the U.S. attorney for Mississippi, was at the scene. Workers had their wrists tied with plastic bands and were told to deposit personal belongings in clear plastic bags. Agents collected the bags before they boarded buses. \u201cThis will affect the economy,\u201d Maria Isabel Ayala, a child care worker for plant employees, said as the buses left. \u201cWithout them here, how will you get your chicken?\u201d Immigration agents also hit a Peco Foods Inc. plant in Canton, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Jackson. The company, based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, says it is the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S. A company representative did not immediately respond to a telephone call or email seeking comment. ___ Amy reported from Pearl, Mississippi.

If the petition is successful, Trump Tower, the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire and where he maintains a residence, will boast a new address: 725 President Barack H. Obama Ave. The petition on MoveOn.org\u00a0\u2015 which has attracted a number of famous supporters, including actors Patricia Arquette and Marg Helgenberger \u2015 asks New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city leaders to rename the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets after Obama in honor of his achievements as president. Los Angeles recently renamed a stretch of highway near downtown after Obama, the MoveOn.org petition page says. \u201cWe request the New York City Mayor and City Council do the same by renaming a block of Fifth Avenue after the former president whose many accomplishments include: saving our nation from the Great Recession; serving two completely scandal-free terms in office; and taking out Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind September 11th, which killed over 3,000 New Yorkers,\u201d the page reads.

As Newsweek noted, however, Rowin\u2019s petition fails to meet one important requirement for street renaming in New York. City rules dictate that the person being honored should be deceased. Rowin said she\u2019s confident that rules could be tweaked in this case. \u201cI am sure the conditions can be changed. There are two streets in L.A. named after former President Obama.

      "author": "Roque Planas",
      "content": " Throughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he justified the record number of deportations carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement by pointing to the high number of criminals deported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security,\u201d Obama said in a 2014 speech announcing executive action to shield parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. \u201cFelons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids.\u201d By Obama\u2019s last year in office, publicly released data showed that 58% of deportees had a criminal conviction. More than 99% of deportees met one of the agency\u2019s removal priorities. But data obtained this month by HuffPost through a Freedom of Information Act request reveals the most serious crime committed by more than half of the migrants arrested at the border and tagged as criminal deportees during Obama\u2019s second term was entering the country without authorization. In other words, the difference between those slapped with a criminal immigration offense and those with a clean record was that the Justice Department chose to prosecute them simply for crossing the border. Immigration violations were the most serious crimes committed by tens of thousands of others deported from within the United States and classified as priority removals over that period, despite the fact that their records differed little from non-criminals. Some 2020 Democratic candidates, including Juli\u00e1n Castro and Elizabeth Warren, are pledging to repeal the laws that make this possible. The data underscores the degree to which skyrocketing prosecutions for border-crossing violations over the last decade helped criminalize a vast swath of the deportee population, giving the impression that they posed a greater public security threat than their records indicate. \u201cThey\u2019ve been turning mere immigration law violators into criminal aliens for years in order to inflate the amount of individuals that have been removed under criminal grounds,\u201d immigration attorney Matthew Kolken told HuffPost. \u201cThese were freshly minted criminals. They weren\u2019t committing crimes in the United States.\u201d While convicts made up nearly half of those deported from the border region from 2013 to 2016, the data makes it clear that there weren\u2019t hordes of violent criminals. Traffic violations accounted for the second-highest number of criminal convictions for border deportees, making up 11% to 14% for those years. The data provided by ICE included only broad categories of crime, but previous reporting indicates that driving while intoxicated and driving without a license make up the vast majority of traffic violations on deportees\u2019 records. Only 15% of border deportees under Obama\u2019s second term had a conviction more serious than an immigration or traffic offense. A much smaller percentage committed more serious crimes. Far less than 1% of criminal migrants from the border and interior combined were convicted of a crime involving homicide, for example. Agency statistics include some deaths resulting from negligence or car crashes under that heading. \u201cI\u2019m seeing padding of the number of the people they consider to be criminals with a lot of low-level traffic violations and immigration violations,\u201d said Douglas Massey, a Princeton sociology professor and co-founder of the Mexico Migration Project, after reviewing the data. \u201cThe criminal categories are vastly inflated. The violent crimes are really small in number.\u201d Under Obama, ICE produced end-of-year reports that highlighted the number of criminals the agency deported, trumpeting the high percentage of convicted criminals. Those reports divided deportees removed from the interior from those expelled from the border region largely because the agency considered those arrested while trying to cross into the country a deportation priority regardless of whether they had criminal records. But the agency did not release detailed statistics over the Obama presidency detailing what convictions had marred individual migrants\u2019 records. Instead, ICE used a system of priority categories for those deported from the interior and recorded only whether border deportees had a criminal conviction or not. The sharp rise in prosecutions for border violations that began under George W. Bush\u2019s presidency explains the statistical sleight of hand. In the United States, deportation is handled under civil laws by immigration authorities such as the Border Patrol and ICE. But crossing the border without authorization is also a federal crime, punishable by up to six months in prison. Re-offenders can face felony charges. The law criminalizing illegal entry, authored\u00a0in 1929 by segregationist Sen. Coleman Blease of South Carolina\u00a0and now known as Section 1325, made up a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions by the 1990s. Instead, Border Patrol agents routinely walked unauthorized migrants back to the other side of the border or referred them for deportation proceedings in immigration court. But starting in 2005, the departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up to create Operation Streamline, a program to prosecute migrants en masse for jumping the border, in an effort to route Central American migrants into federal jails and create a new deterrent. By 2008, immigration prosecutions had swallowed up half the federal criminal docket \u2015 a statistical trend that held true through Obama\u2019s presidency. President Donald Trump ramped up the system further by enacting a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, mandating all five federal districts that touch the border to focus still more resources on immigration prosecutions. Last year, Trump used the laws criminalizing illegal entry and reentry to carry out his widely reviled experiment with systematic family separations at the border last year. By prosecuting migrant parents traveling with their children, Trump officials channeled them into federal jails, leaving their children in the custody of immigration agencies. Immigrant rights groups and criminal justice reformers have long argued that the laws needlessly criminalize migrants, drive the expansion of privatized prisons and slap a redundant punishment on people who will have to face deportation proceedings regardless of whether they get prosecuted for illegal entry. But advocates have also long suspected that the skyrocketing illegal entry prosecutions helped both the Obama and Trump administrations pad their stats to make the deportee population appear like more of a threat than it actually is. \u201cThey\u2019re creating this illusion that so many people removed have criminal histories, but they\u2019re manufacturing this criminal history by prosecuting them for illegal entry and illegal reentry,\u201d said Zen\u00e9n Jaimes P\u00e9rez, advocacy and communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cWe know that picture starts to fall apart once you start digging into it.\u201d The broad criminal categories identified in the documents released by ICE make it difficult to know with any certainty what convictions had led the agency to classify deportees expelled from inside the country as criminals. It identifies only broad headings like \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d \u201chomicide\u201d and \u201ctraffic tickets.\u201d Those categories encompass crimes ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license to drunk driving, drug trafficking and capital murder. But there\u2019s no doubt about what the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading means. Over those four years, illegal entry and reentry accounted for 95% of the most serious criminal convictions for deportees under the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading from 2013 to 2016, according to data previously released to HuffPost. The stats did not distinguish between interior and border removals. The most serious criminal conviction for 21,000 of the migrants deported from within the United States during Obama\u2019s second term was an immigration violation \u2015 about 6.5% of all interior removals. Those convicted of illegal reentry, a felony, would have been classified as a level one priority throughout the period \u2015 the same categorization applied to terrorists and murderers. Thousands of other deportees removed from inside the country during that period had no criminal convictions at all \u2015 ranging from 17.5% in 2013 to 7.6% in Obama\u2019s last year. The number of interior deportees whose most serious offense was an immigration crime dwindled over time. That trend mirrored a drop in deportations from within the country as a whole over Obama\u2019s second term in office as his administration used both prosecutorial discretion and executive action to shield more migrants from deportation. The trend accelerated after the collapse of comprehensive immigration reform talks in the summer of 2014. Former ICE officials defended the agency\u2019s statistical work, contending that they did not intend to mislead the public. They pointed to the series of memos beginning in 2011 that aimed at prioritizing serious criminals, which account for the steady decrease in deportations from inside the country overall. And they insisted that Obama\u2019s policy of focusing on criminal convicts made more efficient use of limited deportation resources than Trump\u2019s policy of casting priorities aside. But the former officials also noted that pushing those priorities down the chain of command took time. And the administration\u2019s focus on deporting people who had been removed in the past meant that people with immigration crimes would show up in agency deportation stats. \u201cWe never felt that the number of criminal removals was padded,\u201d said Peter Vincent, who headed ICE\u2019s legal branch during the Obama administration. \u201cWe were particularly sensitive to any skewing of any statistics that would suggest or imply that the number of criminal removals were higher than in actuality.\u201d The agency struggled with certain crimes that fell into a gray area, like driving under the influence. That traffic offense often remained a priority offense because it could result in death, though prosecutors might use discretion in some cases. But though Vincent remains a vocal supporter of Obama\u2019s prosecutorial discretion policies, he acknowledged that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d implied something more serious than immigration violations \u2015 often the same ones committed by deportees with clean criminal records. \u201cWe did target recent illegal entrants as a way to dissuade individuals from attempting to cross the border,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat is different from simply categorizing everyone who crosses the border without authorization as a criminal. \u2018Criminal\u2019 has a different meaning and should be used to refer to someone who is a danger to our community or who has been convicted of a serious offense.\u201d John Sandweg, who headed ICE as an acting director under Obama, defended the use of criminal prosecutions at the border, saying that internal reports showed it worked as a more effective deterrent than civil deportation proceedings. But both in the interior of the country and along the border, the agency prioritized deporting people who had been expelled before, whether or not they had been convicted of a crime. The fact that so many people deported from the border had criminal convictions in the United States, whether they were serious or not, showed how many had spent time here in the past. \u201cThe fact that they had been previously convicted for Streamline is interesting \u2015 it\u2019s a fair data point to be thinking of,\u201d Sandweg said. \u201cBut the fact is that they were not deported because they were convicted of a silly 1325. It\u2019s because they were arrested at the border.\u201d Others viewed a clear continuity between the way ICE categorized criminals in agency statistics under Obama and the way Trump vilifies unauthorized migrants by branding them as menacing lawbreakers. Kolken, the immigration lawyer, routinely defends migrants facing prosecution for illegal reentry and the prospect of deportation at his practice in Buffalo, New York, about 1,800 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. To secure a conviction, all the prosecutor needs to do is present evidence that the defendant was deported in the past. In those cases, immigration authorities often reinstate an old order of removal while the criminal immigration charge plays out, Kolken said. Were it not for the illegal reentry charge, he would have an opportunity to try to cancel the old order and win his client a hearing.

      "author": "Marina Fang",
      "content": " When Netflix met with veteran documentarians Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar to acquire their new film \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d in January, fresh off the film\u2019s acclaimed premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, there were also executives from Higher Ground Productions in the room. \u201cThey told us who they were, and we had never heard of it,\u201d Reichert recalled in an interview. Reichert and Bognar\u2019s documentary \u2014 winner of Sundance\u2019s directing award for best U.S. documentary \u2014 chronicles what happened in 2014 when Fuyao, a Chinese glass company, resurrected a former General Motors plant outside of Dayton, Ohio, near where the filmmakers live. As the co-directors later learned, the executives worked with former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s production company, created last May in conjunction with their Netflix deal. Since then, the Obamas have largely kept their work at Netflix under wraps. This spring, they announced their first slate of projects \u2014 a range of movies and series including a biopic about Frederick Douglass, a period drama series by the screenwriter of \u201cThelma & Louise,\u201d a documentary show based on The New York Times\u2019 \u201cOverlooked\u201d obituary series and a children\u2019s show about vegetables. \u201cAmerican Factory,\u201d premiering Wednesday on Netflix, is the first of their productions to be released. Unlike the Obamas\u2019 other still-gestating projects, \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d had already been finished when Netflix and Higher Ground acquired it, so the company did not have any involvement in the making of the documentary, according to Reichert and Bognar. However, they\u2019re grateful that the Obamas\u2019 stamp of approval likely means \u201cthe film will be heard about and talked about in a much wider world than otherwise,\u201d Bognar said. In July, the documentarians met the former president and first lady in Washington. It was the day before they spoke with HuffPost, and they still seemed a bit stunned by the distinction of being the Obamas\u2019 first Netflix production. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful people,\u201d Reichert said of meeting them. \u201cIt was amazing when we heard that the president and the first lady had seen our film, and wanted to embrace it and wanted to elevate us as filmmakers. I mean, they\u2019re very much into artists and writers.\u201d Produced by Participant Media (which also recently produced Netflix\u2019s \u201cRoma\u201d and \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d),\u00a0\u201cAmerican Factory\u201d illustrates how broad economic and political questions are often cultural issues too. The documentary excels at going beyond the daily headlines about trade and globalization, showing a Chinese company establishing itself in America and getting Chinese and American employees to work side by side, and how difficulties that arise come down to fundamentally different ideas about work. Reichert and Bognar previously covered the plant\u2019s closure during the Great Recession in the 2009 HBO documentary \u201cThe Last Truck.\u201d They said they hadn\u2019t intended to revisit the subject, but realized that chronicling the American plant\u2019s rebirth under a Chinese company would make for a compelling story. The film\u2019s fly-on-the-wall view and taut editing effectively convey a sense of shifting allegiances and brewing tensions. Initially, the community welcomes Fuyao\u2019s presence and the promise of economic opportunity for the region. (Though, as some of the workers note in the film, the new jobs pay much lower than the GM jobs did.) Publicly, company executives project an image of unity, striving to integrate the Chinese and American workers and their practices. But privately, the process quickly goes south. As the film shows, Fuyao, like many companies in China, tries to circumvent many safety procedures and worker protections in the name of efficiency. The Dayton plant is expected to reach the same levels of glass production as those of Fuyao\u2019s factories in China. The Chinese workers are driven by a collective sense of mission \u2014 heightened by the Chinese executives who are seen in the film rallying the Chinese workers by using nationalist appeals to sow animosity. One section of the film tracks a group of American supervisors from the Dayton plant who visit Fuyao\u2019s headquarters in Fuzhou, China. The trip exposes fundamental differences: Chinese workers focus on uniformity and efficiency, and work long hours, getting only one or two days off per month. As a result, they look down on the American workers \u2014 who work standard eight-hour days and get weekends off \u2014 as \u201clazy\u201d and too \u201cchatty\u201d at work. Reichert and Bognar said that visiting China helped them better understand the larger context informing the differences between the Chinese and American workers. Unlike the \u201cbeating down\u201d of the American middle class over the last few decades, workers in China are \u201ccoming out of rural poverty,\u201d Reichert said, which contributes to their greater sense of optimism and commitment. \u201cThat was something really, really striking for us when we were over there, and helped us understand, more, why the American workers are not as willing to work 12-hour days,\u201d Reichert said. \u201cThe Chinese, they may not like working 12-hour days, but they\u2019re willing to do it. It\u2019s their expectation.\u201d After a string of workplace injuries due to lax safety procedures, the American workers begin to organize with the United Auto Workers. In response, the company executives engage in union-busting \u2014 a maneuver that the filmmakers emphasize is, ironically, modeled on those used by their American counterparts. Fuyao hires a \u201cunion avoidance consultant\u201d to intimidate and dissuade workers from voting to unionize. In addition to dividing workers, the union-busting takes on an added cultural element. In the film, Fuyao\u2019s billionaire chairman says he views the union organizing as the American workers trying to be \u201chostile toward the Chinese.\u201d Much of \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d is a tense and at times frustrating saga. But the documentary also seeks to humanize everyone involved. There are moments when the American and Chinese workers do attempt to get to know each other. And with the help of Chinese producers and translators, Reichert and Bognar also tell the stories of individual Chinese workers, many of whom left their families behind in China to move to Dayton. While their film succeeds as a big-picture examination of labor, manufacturing and U.S.-China relations, Reichert and Bognar stressed that they don\u2019t approach their work with a bird\u2019s-eye view in mind. \u201cWe kind of just feel our way around for months and months,\u201d Bognar said of their filming process. \u201cWe\u2019re filming, but we\u2019re also learning, getting the feel of the rhythms of the place, the who\u2019s who, the interpersonal dynamics, all that stuff.\u201d That approach of focusing on the various players allows for the film\u2019s nuanced take, Bognar said. \u201cWe wanted to put you in the shoes of both the executives and the workers, the Chinese and the Americans. It\u2019s almost like, you remember that show \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019? So you\u2019re with the aristocracy, and you\u2019re with the butlers and the maids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to go for an upstairs-downstairs feel \u2014 without judgment, so you have empathy for everyone. Even the chairman gets that internal reflection at the end, because we want you to have empathy for what his journey is too.\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d premieres Wednesday on Netflix.",

What would have happened in America?\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said, according to The New York Times. Biden, 76, appeared to be engaging in a rhetorical exercise aimed at impressing upon younger voters the impact of the back-to-back assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Friday\u2019s event took place on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Several dozen high school and college students were in the audience, according to the Times. He also attempted a stale compliment to the women in the room, suggesting they wouldn\u2019t want to admit their age by recalling events from the late \u201960s. Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: I think of where we are at the moment. You know, none of you men are old enough, uh, women are old enough, but a couple of you guys are old enough to remember. I graduated in 1968. Everybody before me was: Drop out, go to Haight-Ashbury, don\u2019t trust anybody over 30, everybody not get involved. I\u2019m serious. I know no woman will shake their head and acknowledge it, but you guys know what I\u2019m talking about. Right? But then what happened? Dr. Ki\u2014 I only have two political heroes. I have one hero who was my dad, but I have two political heroes were Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. My senior semester, they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America? The comments came days after Biden, during a speech in Iowa, mistakenly said Kennedy and King were killed in the 1970s. On Friday, the former vice president said those assassinations sparked his own political awakening in his 20s. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,\u201d he said to the students in the audience. \u201cWhat they did was make you realize, my God, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d",

At a press conference in France on Monday, Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama was pure and simply outsmarted. They took Crimea during his term. That was not a good thing. It could have been stopped, with the right, whatever, it could have been stopped.\u201d He added that he\u2019d \u201cmost certainly\u201d invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the group\u2019s next summit. Trump did not describe how he thought Obama should have prevented the annexation of Crimea, but said that if it had happened under his watch, he would have admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized. Of course, Trump is known for being defiantly unapologetic.\u00a0He\u2019s also known to have a penchant for\u00a0insulting the intelligence of Black people and women. Prior to his trip to France,\u00a0Trump also said\u00a0Obama \u201cwanted Russia out\u201d of the G-8 because Putin \u201coutsmarted him,\u201d suggesting the decision was solely motivated by ego. In reality, a majority of G-8 member countries \u2014 not just the United States \u2014 decided to suspend Russia from the group in 2014 because it had violated international law barring the acquisition of another country\u2019s territory through coercion or force. \u201cTo do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built. We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\u2019s constitution,\u201d Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the U.S. said in a 2014 statement. \u201cWe also strongly condemn Russia\u2019s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations.\u201d At the time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u00a0dismissed Russia\u2019s departure from the G-8 as no big deal. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is hosting this year\u2019s summit, has expressed support for Russia\u2019s readmission to the multinational group, but only if it helps resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump said Monday that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Putin would accept an invitation to return to the group, suggesting the Russian leader also had a bruised ego. \u201cHe\u2019s a proud person. Would I invite him, I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come, psychologically, I think that\u2019s a tough thing for him to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a G-8, now it\u2019s a G-7, and you invite the person that was thrown out really by President Obama, and really because he got outsmarted.\u201d",

      "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman",
      "content": " Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), who is challenging President Donald Trump in 2020, doesn\u2019t appear to know what being \u201cracist\u201d means. In an interview with MSNBC on Monday, host John Heilemann called the former tea party congressman \u201cracist,\u201d reminding Walsh he had used the n-word in tweets and had falsely called former President Barack Obama a Muslim. He asked how Walsh could have any \u201cmoral standing\u201d to challenge Trump, whom Heilemann had earlier called a \u201cstone-cold racist.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I\u2019ve said racist things on Twitter,\u201d Walsh responded. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it \u2015 and apology is not enough.\u201d Walsh then defended some of his racist statements, saying that, though falsely stating that Obama was Muslim was \u201ca horrible thing to say,\u201d he did so \u201cbecause I was so disgusted with Obama\u2019s policy toward Israel that I went a bad, ugly step.\u201d He then tried to justify using the \u201cn-word\u201d in a tweet, saying he \u201cdid it to make a point\u201d about the Washington Redskins football team name. \u201cBecause they wanted to change the name of the Washington Redskins, so they said \u2018redskins\u2019 is the new n-word. That\u2019s BS. The n-word has a unique, ugly history in this country,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cTo make that point, I wrote down the n-word in a tweet, to make a point that that\u2019s not nearly what the word \u2018redskins\u2019 is.\u201d Walsh has a long history of racist, Islamophobic and controversial comments. HuffPost reached out to Walsh\u2019s campaign to clarify what he thinks it means for someone to be racist if it\u2019s not making racist statements but did not immediately receive a response. \u201cI think that we all, if we\u2019re honest \u2015 white, black and brown \u2015 we\u2019ve all got a little bit of racism in us,\u201d Walsh told a Washington Post reporter of his comments on MSNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there are times where I\u2019ve pushed the envelope and\u2026 said things that could certainly be interpreted as racist.\u201d Later on Monday, Walsh, a conservative radio show host, told CNN he had lost his national radio show\u00a0but did not yet know why. He speculated it could be related to his running against Trump, who is popular with his listeners. Walsh is the second Republican to announce a long-shot bid to challenge Trump, following former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. While Walsh once threatened to take up arms if Trump were not elected, in recent months he\u2019s appeared to try to distance himself from Trump\u2019s rhetoric, calling out the president\u2019s racism on Twitter and writing in a New York Times op-ed this month: \u201cTrump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base.\u201d However, Walsh\u2019s ongoing history of racist comments belies those attempts at distancing. On Monday, he doubled down on his 2018 comments calling Haiti a \u201cshithole,\u201d telling the same Washington Post reporter: \u201cThere\u2019s an example of where I\u2019m trying to be provocative. I hardly agree with anything Trump said \u2015 look, Haiti is a shithole. You could describe it as other things, too.\u201d Just last year, Walsh again called Obama a Muslim and said he was elected \u201cbecause he\u2019s black.\u201d In his Monday appearance on MSNBC, he said, \u201cI never did get into birther stuff,\u201d but several of Walsh\u2019s tweets from 2014 and 2015 at least show him promoting the racist, birther theory that Obama was born in Kenya. Walsh also waffled Monday on whether to call Trump a racist, first saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s a racist. All Trump cares about is himself. I mean, he\u2019ll throw out racist stuff.\u201d Then one of the hosts challenged him: \u201cYou don\u2019t know that Trump\u2019s a racist?\u201d \u201cWell, then, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s a bigot, he\u2019s a xenophobe,\u201d Walsh responded. \u201cBecause he\u2019ll use everything to just simply advance his interests.\u2019\u201d This article has been updated with Walsh\u2019s statement that he lost his radio show.",

      "author": "Sam Levine",
      "content": " A group backed by President Barack Obama will send experts to train people across the country on the ins-and-outs of redistricting as part an effort to fight excessive partisan gerrymandering. The new effort, called Redistricting U, comes as states are gearing up for the next round of redistricting, which will take place in 2021. The program will launch with trainings in dozens of cities across 10 states this fall aimed at teaching people the basics of the redistricting process. Organizers also want to connect gerrymandering to \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and hope people will leave the trainings motivated to get involved in the redistricting process in their states, said Saumya Narechania, director of advocacy and campaign manager of All On The Line, the part of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) that will lead the effort. \u201cThe movement for fair maps will determine the course of progress on every issue we care about for the next decade. And we can\u2019t wait to begin organizing when the redistricting process starts in 2021. We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2014 right now,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Obama has been involved in efforts to limit excessive partisan gerrymandering since leaving office. Last year he folded his political group, Organizing for Action, into the NDRC, a redistricting-focused group led by Eric Holder, who served as attorney general for most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The redistricting process, which takes just once per decade, is expected to be a brutal brawl for partisan advantage. The United States Supreme Court ruled in June that there were no constitutional limits on how severely states could manipulate district lines to benefit political parties. For decades, redistricting in many places has been done behind closed doors, with lawmakers quietly negotiating deals to get the districts they want. Emails from lawmakers made public in litigation in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, among other places, have shed light on just how unsavory those negotiations are. In Michigan, for example, a Republican staffer wrote happily about cramming \u201cDem garbage\u201d into four districts. Advocates have long struggled to get the public interested in redistricting, seen as a wonky, boring and complicated issue. But Obama and NDRC\u2019s decision to focus on the issue is a signal in itself of how the issue has exploded in recent years. In 2011, Republicans recognized the potential to use the redistricting process to lock in their political advantage for a decade and successfully executed a targeted campaign to do just that. The National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT), a GOP group focused on redistricting led by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, mocked the new effort in a tweet. The group recently sued to block a new independent panel in Michigan from drawing district lines. The NDRC has dismissed the GOP-led criticism, noting that it has championed proposals with bipartisan support. \u201cI\u2019m not really that focused on what the NRRT is saying about us or our program,\u201d Narechania said. \u201cWe are hyperfocused on building a fair process and making sure that we are concentrating on places where redistricting reform gives power back to the people, not to politicians, not to the folks who are camped out in lobbyist offices who are drawing the lines in secret.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of All On The Line is to take this process and make it as transparent as possible. And if transparency is something that folks are afraid of, then I think the question is why is that?\u201d he said.",

Flynn\u2019s lawyers, who were hired earlier this year, said that they have not had enough time to review the case, and that the government has refused to hand over information they need for his defense, including transcripts and recordings of phone calls supposedly underlying the charges against their client. Government lawyers, in contrast, said Flynn is ready for sentencing, and proposed that he be sentenced between Oct. 21and 23 or between Nov. 1 and 15. Both sides agreed that Flynn\u2019s cooperation with various government probes is finished. They made their assessments in a status report filed with the federal court in Washington, D.C. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations the prior December with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, about U.S.sanctions imposed on Moscow by President Barack Obama. That plea came in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s since-completed probe into Russian interference in the2016 U.S. election. Lawyers for Flynn asked for 90 days before the next status report. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York. Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Howard Goller)",

The letter will be sent to thousands of supporters later in the day, Axios reported. Schultz, a self-described \u201clifelong Democrat,\u201d had discussed a potential run\u00a0as an independent in January, suggesting that he was driven by the \u201creckless failure\u201d of constitutional responsibility among both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cThe American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken and they are looking for a better choice,\u201d he said in a CBS interview\u00a0that month. In a\u00a0video later posted to Twitter, Schultz said he would be traveling around the country in the following weeks to speak with members of the public about his political aspirations. He ended up cutting his travels short, however, after experiencing acute back pain that led to three back surgeries, he said in an email to his supporters in mid-June. \u201cI am feeling much better, and my doctors foresee a full recovery so long as I rest and rehabilitate,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI have decided to take the summer to do just that.\u201d In his letter Friday, Schultz cited his lengthy recovery from the injury as a reason why he couldn\u2019t engage with people at the level necessary to run for president. In the end, he didn\u2019t have to go far to get feedback about his political aspirations.\u00a0The news in January that Schultz was considering a presidential run as an independent ignited a wave of Democratic concern\u00a0that such a bid could help President Donald Trump get reelected. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also considered a 2020 run, quickly spoke out against the idea of a third-party candidate, arguing that person \u201cwould just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama, offered the same warning, telling CNN\u00a0that an independent run by Schultz \u201cwould provide Trump with his best hope for getting reelected.\u201d Former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod voiced similar concerns on Twitter, calling Schultz\u2019s idea \u201cthe only good news\u201d Trump received that week. Schultz seemed to have considered that criticism in his letter exiting the race, saying not enough people will consider backing an independent candidate out of fear that it will help Trump be reelected. Trump appeared to try to goad Schultz into running, tweeting that the businessman \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the \u2018guts\u2019 to be president.\u201d Schultz stepped down as CEO of Starbucks in June 2018 and was immediately asked by reporters about any White House ambitions, which he then declined to rule out. \u201cI intend to think about a range of options, and that could include public service,\u201d\u00a0he told The New York Times\u00a0at the time. \u201cBut I\u2019m a long way from making any decisions about the future.\u201d Schultz said Friday the money he had raised for the campaign will be used to \u201cinvest in people, organizations and ideas that promote honesty, civility and results in our politics.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "NOAA attacked its own scientists over their correction of President Trump\u2019s false claims about Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former top officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are assailing the agency for undermining its weather forecasters as it defends President Donald Trump\u2019s statement from days ago that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama. They say NOAA\u2019s action risks the credibility of the nation\u2019s weather and science agency and may even risk lives. Dismay came those who served under Republican and Democratic presidents alike as leaders in meteorology and disaster response sized up a sustained effort by Trump and his aides to justify his warning that Alabama, among other states, was \u201cmost likely\u201d to be hit hard by Dorian, contrary to forecasts showing Alabama was clear. That effort led NOAA to repudiate a tweet from the National Weather Service the previous weekend assuring Alabamans \u2014 accurately \u2014 that they had nothing to fear from the hurricane. The weather service is part of NOAA and the tweet came from its Birmingham, Alabama, office. \u201cThis rewriting history to satisfy an ego diminishes NOAA,\u201d Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday, former Republican-appointed director of the National Weather Service, said on Facebook. He told The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get the point where science is determined by politics rather than science and facts. And I\u2019m afraid this is an example where this is beginning to occur.\u201d Alabama had never been included in hurricane advisories and Trump\u2019s information, based on less authoritative graphics than an official forecast, was outdated even at the time. In the tempestuous aftermath, some meteorologists spoke on social media of protesting when the acting NOAA chief, Neil Jacobs , is scheduled to speak at a National Weather Association meeting Tuesday \u2014 in Huntsville, Alabama. Former officials saw a political hand at work in NOAA\u2019s statement disavowing the Birmingham tweet. The statement was issued by an anonymous \u201cspokesperson,\u201d a departure from the norm for federal agencies that employ people to speak for them by name. \u201cThis falls into such uncharted territory,\u201d said W. Craig Fugate, who was Florida emergency management chief under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cYou have science organizations putting out statements against their own offices. For the life of me I don\u2019t think I would have ever faced this under President Obama or Governor Bush.\u201d Jane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator during the Obama administration said: \u201cIt is truly sad to see political appointees undermining the superb, life-saving work of NOAA\u2019s talented and dedicated career servants. Scientific integrity at a science agency matters.\u201d The White House declined to comment Saturday when asked if it had directed NOAA to release the statement. The president spent the morning at his Virginia golf club. NOAA officials also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Retired Adm. David Titley, former NOAA operations chief during the Obama administration and a former meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University said NOAA\u2019s leadership is showing \u201cmoral cowardice\u201d and officials should have resigned instead of issuing the statement chastising the Birmingham office. Joe Friday said he would have quit had he been in top officials\u2019 shoes. Titley said the episode might feed distrust of forecasts that help people make life-or-death decisions whether to evacuate. \u201cFor people who look for excuses not to take action when their lives or property are threatened ... I think this can potentially feed that,\u201d Titley said. Former NOAA deputy administration Monica Medina, who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said \u201cit will make us less safe as a country.\u201d And Justin Kenney, who headed the agency\u2019s communications in the Obama administration, said \u201cby politicizing weather forecasts, the president ... puts more people \u2014 including first responders \u2014 in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Bill Read, who became director of the National Hurricane Center director during the Republican George W. Bush administration, said on Facebook the NOAA statement showed either an embarrassing lack of understanding of forecasting or \u201ca lack of courage on their part by not supporting the people in the field who are actually doing the work. Heartbreaking.\u201d A retired chief of the center\u2019s hurricane forecasting desk, James Franklin, said on Twitter that the NOAA statement had thrown the Birmingham office \u201cunder the bus\u201d \u2014 a phrase several ex-officials used. He said the Birmingham office\u2019s tweet was \u201cspot-on and an appropriate response to the President\u2019s misleading tweet that morning.\u201d Last Sunday, Trump tweeted : \u201cIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5.\u201d At the time, the hurricane center\u2019s forecast path \u2014 including a large cone of uncertainty \u2014 did not go farther west than the eastern third of Georgia. The weather service in Birmingham quickly followed up with its tweet, which one meteorologist there said was prompted by residents\u2019 concerns about what to do. It said: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d NOAA verified that day that the \u201ccurrent forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama\u201d and an agency spokesman, Christopher Vaccaro, put his name to that. NOAA\u2019s disavowal of the Birmingham tweet came late Friday. It said its forecasters \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d The highest percentage that tropical force storm winds \u2014 not stronger hurricane-force winds \u2014 would hit somewhere in Alabama was 11%, according to hurricane center charts, and the chances were briefly between 20% and 30% according to a graphic that was not a forecast and that was outdated by the time of Trump\u2019s warning. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Big tech companies have long rebuffed attempts by the U.S. federal government to scrutinize or scale back their market power. Now they face a scrappy new coalition as well: prosecutors from nearly all 50 states. In a rare show of bipartisan force, attorneys general from 48 states along with Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are investigating whether Google\u2019s huge online search and advertising business is engaging in monopolistic behavior. The Texas-led antitrust investigation of Google, announced Monday, follows a separate multistate investigation of Facebook\u2019s market dominance that was revealed Friday. The state moves follow similar sweeping antitrust tech investigations launched by the Federal Trade Commission and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice; the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee is conducting a similar probe. But should federal officials tire of their work, the state-led efforts could keep them on their toes. States have worked closely together on other matters, such as the fight to curb opioid abuse. But the sheer number participating in this kind of antitrust effort is unprecedented and gives it more weight, said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s just an accumulation of public frustration, whether it\u2019s from consumers, other players in the market, regulators, lawmakers,\u201d Reyes said in an interview Monday. Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor and former antitrust official at the Justice Department under the Obama administration, said it\u2019s important that states are taking the lead because the Trump administration is \u201cnot really enforcing antitrust law except against companies the president is upset with.\u201d She noted the Trump administration\u2019s unsuccessful push to use antitrust law to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s criticism; and Friday\u2019s announcement that federal antitrust enforcers would investigate automakers that worked with California on tougher emissions limits. \u201cThat\u2019s not what consumers want,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers want to be protected from anticompetitive conduct.\u201d States haven\u2019t seriously taken up antitrust enforcement \u2014 using laws originally crafted to combat railroad and oil barons in the 19th century \u2014 since a major antitrust case against Microsoft about two decades ago. Then, state leadership helped propel federal action. Back in 2016, Reyes and a Democratic counterpart, Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, tried unsuccessfully to get the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an earlier investigation into Google for allegedly favoring its own products in search results. The FTC declined, leaving European regulators to take the lead in similar probes overseas, Reyes said. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it\u2019s almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google\u2019s dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. The company \u2014 and peers such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2014 have long argued that although their businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. Influenced by the popularity of the companies\u2019 ubiquitous tech products and their significant lobbying power, most American political leaders didn\u2019t challenge that view. But the public debate over the tech industry has changed dramatically since Reyes and Racine sent their letter to the FTC at the end of the Obama administration three years ago. Culprits in that shift include Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, in which a political data mining firm affiliated with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign improperly accessed the personal data of as many as 87 million users. On Monday, Reyes and Racine joined forces again \u2014 this time flanked by nearly a dozen mostly Republican state attorneys general on the steps of the Supreme Court and dozens more from both parties who signed onto the formal investigation. \u201cIgnoring 50 AGs is a lot more difficult than ignoring two AGs,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cDC and Utah had raised these issues but didn\u2019t feel we had enough firepower or resources on our own.\u201d Scott Morton, the Yale professor, said most states have laws that mimic federal antitrust laws, but it can be harder for state attorneys general to enforce those laws because they don\u2019t usually have in-house antitrust experts. They can get around that, she added, by working together with other states and hiring shared experts. Reyes emphasized that the state-led effort is not \u201canti-tech,\u201d and argued it is \u201cactually for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field.\u201d He said there\u2019s nothing wrong with Google being the dominant search player if it\u2019s done fairly, but the investigation will look into whether Google crosses the line \u201cbetween aggressive business practices and illegal ones.\u201d A tech trade association that has supported some antitrust measures expressed wariness about how states are proceeding. \u201cWe hope the investigations will be law and evidence-based and will restrain from overly politicizing these inquiries, and that both companies and authorities will work together in good faith,\u201d said Ed Black, president and CEO of the Communications Computer and Communications Industry Association. __ Associated Press writers Rachel Lerman in San Francisco and Marcy Gordon in Washington contributed to this report.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The proportion of Americans without health insurance edged up in 2018 \u2014 the first evidence from the government that coverage gains under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law might be eroding under President Donald Trump. The Census Bureau also said in an annual report Tuesday that household income rose last year at its slowest pace in four years and finally matched its previous peak set in 1999. Median household income increased 0.9% in 2018 to an inflation-adjusted $63,179, from $62,626 in 2017. The data suggest that the current economic expansion, now the longest on record at more than 10 years, is still struggling to provide widespread benefits to the U.S. population. Solid gains in household incomes over the past four years have returned the median only to where it was two decades ago. And despite strong growth last year in the number of Americans working full time and year-round, the number of people with private health insurance remained flat. The Census report found that 27.5 million people, 8.5% of the population, lacked health insurance coverage in 2018. That was an increase of 1.9 million uninsured, or 0.5 percentage point. One bright spot in the report was that the poverty rate fell for a fourth straight year to 11.8%, its lowest point since 2001. The proportion of households led by women that were poor reached a record low. \u201cWhile any reduction in poverty or increase in income is a step in the right direction, most families have just barely made up the ground lost over the past decade,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Though income inequality narrowed last year, it remains near record levels reached in 2017. Last year, the richest 5% of the U.S. population captured 23% of household income. Still, steady hiring and an unemployment rate at 3.7%, near a five-decade low, have helped raise earnings for lower-paid workers employed by restaurants, warehouses, shipping firms and other sectors of the economy. This trend has contributed to a decline in poverty. On health insurance, more people were covered by Medicare, reflecting the aging of baby boomers. But Medicaid coverage declined. The number of uninsured children also rose. And there were more uninsured adults ages 35-64. Though the increase in the number of uninsured Americans was modest, it could be a turning point, the first real sign that coverage gains under Obama could be at least partly reversed. This year, the number of uninsured could rise again. That\u2019s because a previous Republican-led Congress repealed fines under the Affordable Care Act that had been intended to prod people to sign up for coverage. The Census report is sure to play into 2020 presidential politics. Health care is the leading issue for Democrats, with proposals including Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 call for a government-run system to cover everyone and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s idea for expanding Obama\u2019s law and adding a government plan open to virtually anyone. Democrats are laying the blame on Trump, long accusing his administration of deliberately undermining Obama\u2019s health care law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday blamed Trump\u2019s \u201ccruel health care sabotage\u201d for the rising number of uninsured. In a statement, the California Democrat asserted that Trump\u2019s ongoing efforts to erode Obama\u2019s law have forced Americans to \u201clive in constant fear of an accident or injury that could spell financial ruin for their families.\u201d Trump spent most of his first year in office trying unsuccessfully to get a Republican Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He is now asking a federal appeals court to overturn it as unconstitutional. The president also slashed the program\u2019s sign-up season ad budget and scaled back funding to help people navigate the enrollment process. Trump also removed a subsidy for insurers, thereby triggering a jump in premiums. Yet ACA enrollment has held fairly steady, with about 20 million people covered by its mix of subsidized private plans and a Medicaid expansion for low-income individuals. The Census report found that Medicaid coverage declined by 0.7 percent from 2017. The Trump administration has also rolled out some regulatory changes of its own intended to expand coverage. These include \u201cassociation health plans\u201d for small businesses, short-term plans for individuals and new options for employers to help finance workers\u2019 coverage. These changes are fairly recent, though, and it\u2019s unclear what impact they might eventually have. Changes in how Census conducts its income survey have made historical comparisons difficult. Still, household incomes largely declined for the first five years after the recession ended, before taking a sharp turn up in 2015, when they rose 5.1%. Incomes jumped 3.1% the next year but then slowed to 1.8% in 2017 and barely rose last year. The economic expansion hasn\u2019t noticeably narrowed the income gap between white and African-American households. The median income for black households is $41,700; for whites, it\u2019s $70,600. Women earned nearly 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, a figure little changed from the previous year and up just 4 cents from 2007, when the Great Recession began. (That figure compares both men and women with full-time, year-round jobs.) Many economists consider the poverty rate an antiquated measure that is based mostly on food costs and that doesn\u2019t reflect all government benefit programs. A second calculation, known as the \u201csupplemental poverty measure,\u201d includes health care expenses and shows that 13.1% of Americans are in poverty, essentially unchanged from 2017. This measure also includes the effects of government benefit programs like Social Security and food stamps. The EPI estimates that Social Security kept 27.3 million people out of poverty in 2018, while food stamps kept 3.1 million above the supplemental poverty line.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is revoking an Obama-era regulation that shielded many U.S. wetlands and streams from pollution but was opposed by developers and farmers who said it hurt economic development and infringed on property rights. Even before the official announcement, scheduled for later Thursday, environmental groups blasted the administration\u2019s action, the latest in a series of\u00a0moves to roll back environmental protections\u00a0put into place under former President Barack Obama. The Waters of the United States rule being revoked defines which waterways are subject to federal regulation. \u201cThis action officially ends an egregious power grab and sets the stage for a new rule that will provide much-needed regulatory certainty for farmers, home builders and property owners nationwide,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler and R.D. James, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, wrote in a column published Thursday by the Des Moines Register. Since enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the federal government has gone beyond protection of navigable waterways and their major tributaries to assert jurisdiction over \u201cisolated ponds and channels that flow only after it rains,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cAs the definition expanded, so too has Washington\u2019s power over private property and the states\u2019 traditional authority to regulate their land and water resources,\u201d they said. President Donald Trump had ordered the agencies to develop a replacement policy that has a more restrictive definition of protected wetlands and streams, leaving fewer subject to federal protection. Environmentalists say the move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and allow damage of wetlands that prevent flooding, filter pollutants and provide habitat for a multitude of fish, waterfowl and other wildlife. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the Trump administration\u2019s action would be challenged in court. \u201cThe Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWhere it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders.\u201d But Don Parrish, congressional relations director for the American Farm Bureau Federation, says the 2015 regulation that extended federal protection to many U.S. wetlands and waterways created uncertainty about where farmers could cultivate land. \u201cIt would be great if farmers didn\u2019t have to hire an army of consultants and lawyers just to be able to farm,\u201d he said. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota says the Obama rule was \u201can unconstitutional power grab that did nothing to advance good water management.\u201d The question of which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act has inspired decades of lawsuits and congressional debate. A sharply divided Supreme Court in 2006 produced three differing opinions, leading the Obama administration to craft its rule. It provided federal oversight to upstream tributaries and headwaters, including wetlands, ponds, lakes and streams that can affect the quality of navigable waters. The regulation drew quick legal challenges. Courts prevented it from taking effect in parts of the U.S. Betsy Southerland, who was director of science and technology in EPA\u2019s Office of Water during the Obama administration, said repealing its regulation would create further regulatory confusion. \u201cThis repeal is a victory for land developers, oil and gas drillers and miners who will exploit that ambiguity to dredge and fill small streams and wetlands that were protected from destruction by the 2015 rule because of their critical impact on national water quality,\u201d Southerland said.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner. And there were moments in Thursday night\u2019s debate when he looked the part. Standing between a pair of liberal senators offering radical change, he unabashedly embraced his more moderate position on health care, forcefully pressuring Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to level with Americans about the steep cost of implementing a fully government-run system. He was more polished and practiced than in previous contests. And he repeatedly leaned on the legacy of former President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular Democrat in the nation. \u201cI\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked,\u201d he declared. But the debate was punctuated by moments that highlighted why Biden can\u2019t shake questions about his consistency and whispers about his fitness for office, despite his lead in most national polls and early state surveys. Most glaringly: a meandering answer near the end of the debate about his past statements on racial inequality. Biden said poor parents should play the \u201crecord player\u201d for their children before veering off into comments about Venezuela. Biden\u2019s standing in the Democratic contest is the source of much debate within the party. Is he an experienced elder statesman who can calm an anxious nation and peel back some of the white working class voters who helped send President Donald Trump to the White House? Or is the 76-year-old past his prime and out of step with a party that is growing younger, more diverse and more liberal? Thursday night\u2019s contest provided fresh fodder for each of those theories. Biden was at his best in his lengthy exchange with Sanders and Warren over the future of health care in America. He confidently pressed them over the cost of their sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposals, exposing Warren\u2019s unwillingness to say whether middle class Americans would see a tax increase under her plan (Sanders says they would, but argues the rise would be offset by lower health care costs). In a retort to Sanders, who has said he expects employers would pass on health care savings to their workers, Biden exclaimed: \u201cFor a socialist you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d Biden was the focus of fierce criticism from his rivals in both of the previous Democratic debates. But those attacks did little to diminish Biden\u2019s standing atop polls, nor has a series of verbal flubs and misstatements throughout the summer. The other reality: The candidates who have launched the sharpest attacks on Biden have gained little ground or already dropped out of the race. Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, bested Biden in the opening debate with a highly personal critique over his decades-old position on federally mandated school busing, but any boost for her candidacy was short-lived. Perhaps mindful of that reality, most candidates sidestepped overt criticism of the vice president in Thursday\u2019s debate. The one notable exception was Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing secretary and is in need of a jolt to break out of the lower tier of candidates. In a highly charged moment, Castro challenged Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a barely veiled reference to questions about the former vice president\u2019s age. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care. In a post-debate interview, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker laid into Biden as well, saying there were many people concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball \u201cacross the end line without fumbling.\u201d Castro and Booker were zeroing in on real questions that are being asked about Biden. Is he too old to serve as president? If he were the nominee, would he make a mistake at a critical moment that could clear the way for Trump? Biden\u2019s stumbles later in the debate magnified those questions. He struggled through an answer about the war in Iraq and gave a grab-bag answer to a question about how to repair the legacy of slavery in America. He appeared to suggest that poorer families needed help learning how to raise their children. Biden\u2019s supporters argue that ultimately, those answers \u2014 and the questions they raise \u2014 matter less to voters than their overall impressions of the former vice president. Indeed, there is a deep reservoir of goodwill for Biden in the Democratic Party, shaped in large part by the eight years he served as Obama\u2019s No. 2. Which leaves little doubt as to why Biden spent much of the debate reminding Americans about those years, urging them to see him as the rightful heir to legacy of the last Democrat to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2014 good, bad, indifferent,\u201d Biden said.",

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " President Donald Trump\u2019s acting national security adviser, former Reagan administration official Charles Kupperman, made an extraordinary and controversial claim in the early 1980s: nuclear conflict with the USSR was winnable and that \u201cnuclear war is a destructive thing but still in large part a physics problem.\u201d Kupperman\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. could triumph in a nuclear war went against dominant theories of mutually assured destruction and ignored the long-term destabilizing effects that such hostilities would have on the planet\u2019s health and global politics. Kupperman,\u00a0appointed to his new post on Tuesday after Trump fired his John Bolton from the job, argued it was possible to win a nuclear war \u201cin the classical sense,\u201d and that the notion of total destruction stemming from such a superpower conflict was inaccurate. He said that in a scenario in which 20 million people died in the U.S. as opposed to 150 million, the nation could then emerge as the stronger side and prevail in its objectives. His argument was that with enough planning and civil defense measures, such as \u201ca certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials,\u201d the effects of a nuclear war could be limited and that U.S. would be able to fairly quickly rebuild itself after an all-out conflict with the then-Soviet Union. \u201cIt may take 15 years, but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War,\u201d Kupperman said. Referring to the Japanese city on which the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in 1945, he also claimed that \u201cHiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later.\u201d At the time, Kupperman was executive director of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament. He made the comments during an interview with Robert Scheer for the journalist\u2019s 1982 book, \u201cWith Enough Shovels: Reagan, Bush, and Nuclear War.\u201d The National Security Council did not immediately respond to questions on whether Kupperman, 68, still holds the same views of nuclear conflict as he did in the early 1980s. Kupperman\u2019s seemingly cavalier attitude toward the potential death of millions of people was criticized at the time both by Democratic politicians and arms control experts. \u201cIt seems reasonable to suggest the crazies are in charge of the nukes,\u201d Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, wrote about Kupperman and his colleagues in 1984. Contemporary nuclear experts similarly criticize Kupperman\u2019s beliefs as wrongheaded and dangerous. \u201cKupperman\u2019s comments might as well have come straight from the script of (the film) \u2018Dr. Strangelove.\u2019 He was part of a group of defense analysts at the time who weren\u2019t shy about sharing such views,\u201d said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, who first noted Kupperman\u2019s views in a Twitter post in January when Kupperman was hired as the deputy national security adviser. \u201cThe simple fact is that a nuclear war can\u2019t be won and must never be fought,\u201d Reif said. But rather than being sidelined as a relic of Cold War hubris, Kupperman now holds one of the most powerful positions in the White House. Although his role is temporary, civil rights groups have also already called on him resign over his extensive ties to the Center for Security Policy, an anti-Muslim think tank founded by conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney. Gaffney is a prominent anti-Muslim activist who repeatedly promoted the conspiracy theories that members of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration were working to enforce Islamic law in the U.S., that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated top levels of government and that Obama was secretly Muslim himself. Kupperman served on the board of directors for Gaffney\u2019s Center for Security Policy between 2001-2010. \u201cCSP has continuously promoted Islamophobic conspiracy theories, and anyone, like Mr. Kupperman, who has so closely associated with them for so long is \u2015 at the very least \u2015 complicit in their brand of anti-Muslim bigotry and should not be entrusted with one of the highest-ranking security roles in the United States,\u201d Council on American-Islamic Relations Executive Director Nihad Awad said Tuesday. Before becoming the national security adviser, Kupperman served as an informal adviser to Bolton and worked as a defense industry executive at Boeing and Lockheed Martin. He was a critic of the Iranian nuclear deal and in 2017 co-signed a letter to Trump backing Bolton\u2019s plan to withdraw from the agreement. Here are excerpts of Kupperman\u2019s comments from his interview with Scheer: On what kind of life we could visualize after a nuclear attack: It means that, you know, it would be tough. It would be a struggle to reconstitute the society that we have. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the same society [as] prior to an exchange, there is no question about that. But in terms of having an organized nation, and having enough means left after the war to reconstitute itself, I think that is entirely possible. It may take 15 years, but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War. On disagreeing with the Physicians for Social Responsibility organization\u2019s view of nuclear war: Scheer: But in terms of nuclear war, do you factor in what those doctors were saying? Kupperman: Yes, that is why I want to have a civil defense system, because it can be very effective in reducing casualties. That is my point. If doctors are so concerned about it, the answer isn\u2019t necessarily disarming the United States or cutting our weapons programs. \u2026 it might be having a civil defense program. You can make a very good case that is exactly what those doctors ought to be shouting for. Scheer: But they say that it is impossible to protect the population from nuclear attack. Kupperman: Yes, but the thing is, nuclear weapons have certain effects and if you take steps to deny those effects, you save a lot of people. And unless you are right in the middle of ground zero, you are not going to have a lot of burn victims if you take those steps. And if you evacuate these people out of the targeted areas, or what you think are targeted areas, they are not going to get burned or destroyed. On society surviving nuclear war: Scheer: Is it possible to survive it with your civilization intact? Kupperman: Well, it is possible to survive it with a certain amount of society intact, it depends on what steps we take to ensure that survivability. It certainly won\u2019t be the same as before the war. But generally societies have been intact \u2015 like Germany and Japan and Western Europe in the Second World War weren\u2019t the same after the war as they were before. But generally societies have been intact. The question really gets down to political credibility in the conduct of your foriegn policy. If you look like you are serious about defending yourself and your allies with real civil defense programs and other measures, I think that has political credibility with the adversary. An adversary isn\u2019t going to take somebody seriously if they don\u2019t take steps to protect themselves. Nuclear war is a destructive thing, but it is still in large part a physics problem. Scheer: What do you mean? Kupperman: Well, sheltering yourself against nuclear effects can be done, it just depends on how much effort and money one wants to spend on it, but a certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials can assure the survivability of somebody, assuming they aren\u2019t at ground zero of a detonation. Hiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later. So it is certainly a destructive weapon, and nobody wants a nuclear war, but I don\u2019t think the United States in the past has been serious enough about planning for its survival in the event of a nuclear war... On winning nuclear war \u201cin a classical sense\u201d: Kupperman: It depends on what one considers all-out. If the objective in a war is to try to destroy as many Soviet civilians and as many American civilians as is feasible, and the casualty levels approached 150 million on each side, then it\u2019s going to be tough to say you have a surviving nation after that. But depending on how the nuclear war is fought, it could mean the difference between 150 casualties and 20 million casualties. I think that is a significant difference, and if the country loses 20 million people, you may have a chance of surviving after that. Scheer: Would that mean the other nation would survive as well? You\u2019re not talking about winning a nuclear war, you\u2019re talking about a stalemate of some kind. Kupperman: It may or may not be a stalemate, depending on who had more surviving national power and military power. Scheer: So you think it is possible to win? Kupperman: I think it is possible to win, in the classical sense. Scheer: What does that mean, \u201cin the classical sense\u201d? Kupperman: It means that it is clear after the war that one side is stronger than the other side, the weaker side is going to accede to the demands of the stronger side. Clarification: An earlier version of this article implied Kupperman joined the National Security Agency, but was instead referring to him becoming the national security adviser.",

      "content": " The former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics used a lengthy Twitter thread to explain what he believes should be the real concern about U.S. military personnel staying at President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. Walter Shaub wrote Friday that the focus should not be on whether Trump had ordered anyone to stay there, which he doubted, or even on when anyone first stayed there. Instead, he said, it was to do with \u201cthe questions raised by these trips.\u201d \u201cHas [Trump] created a culture where officials believe he wants people to stay at his properties?\u201d asked Shaub, who served under former President Barack Obama and then Trump for six months until he resigned in July 2017. \u201cWe can see how many of his appointees perceive an expectation to socialize after hours at Trump hotel (an activity that was not traditionally common at that level of the exec branch),\u201d he noted. \u201cHe dispatches his VP and appointees to speak to his paying customers. He tweeted that officials who stayed at Turnberry showed \u2018good taste,\u2019\u201d Shaub continued. \u201cHe takes his appointees on his frequent trips to his luxury resorts. He touts those resorts frequently. He\u2019s bidding on the G7 Summit.\u201d Shaub claimed it was \u201cimplausible\u201d to say it was a coincidence that military personnel stays at Turnberry had risen since Trump took office, a development that is being investigated by both the Air Force and the\u00a0House Oversight Committee. It \u201cdegrades the ethical culture of government\u201d and \u201cdamages our standing in the world and our effort to preach anticorruption efforts to developing countries,\u201d he added. \u201cBottom line: Turnberry is a big deal because it\u2019s a symptom of a problem in an administration that is anything but transparent,\u201d Shaub concluded. Check out Shaub\u2019s full thread here: The concern with Turnberry isn\u2019t whether Trump ordered anyone to stay there. (I doubt he did.) Nor is it when anyone first stayed there. (Any place costing less than the per diem amount was permissible before he was President.) It\u2019s the questions raised by these trips: /1 1. Has he created a culture where officials believe he wants people to stay at his properties? We can see how many of his appointees perceive an expectation to socialize after hours at Trump hotel (an activity that was not traditionally common at that level of the exec branch)./2 He dispatches his VP and appointees to speak to his paying customers. He tweeted that officials who stayed at Turnberry showed \u201cgood taste.\u201d He takes his appointees on his frequent trips to his luxury resorts. He touts those resorts frequently. He\u2019s bidding on the G7 Summit./3 Diplomats, lobbyists, business officials, and politicians perceive a need to court him by funneling money to him through his resort. Given these circumstances, yes, it certainly seems he has created a culture where officials believe he wants them to stay at his resort. /4 2. Stays at Turnberry have dramatically increased during his presidency. Given the number of hotels in the region, the significant distance to his resort, and the cost of meals & incidentals there, any claim that this is a coincidence seems implausible. /5 3. It\u2019s not just Turnberry, it\u2019s Prestwick airport. The airport is lagging, and Turnberry is dependent on its success. Routing flights through Prestwick boosts his property. It\u2019s not relevant that DOD had a deal in place before \u2014 it\u2019s smart to have deals in place all over. /6 The relevant question is whether the trips increased and whether refueling costs at other locations would be less. Again, we have an ethical culture problem. Trump made a gratuitous detour to Turnberry last year that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to tout the resort. /7 State Dept paid $13,000 this summer and won\u2019t tell us who stayed there or why. Pence traveled gratuitously to one of Trump\u2019s resorts far from the site of his meetings. Trump tweeted years ago that he\u2019d boost Prestwick and partnered with them, but now denies any connection. /8 4. Prestwick is foreign govt-owned. It\u2019s a defense contractor affected by the performance of air crews\u2019 duties, i.e., a prohibited source for gifts. So the gifts these officials took may raise foreign emoluments or gift rule questions that can be avoided by staying elsewhere. /9 5. Now that Trump is President, our government officials staying at Turnberry raise a Domestic Emoluments Clause concern that could be easily avoided by staying elsewhere.\n\n6. USAF\u2019s claim that it\u2019s the best value ignores all of these issues and seems factually implausible. /10 7. The message sent by USAF staying at the Trump\u2019s resort degrades the ethical culture of govt\u2014rules ban creating even the appearance of impropriety for a reason. It also damages our standing in the world and our effort to preach anticorruption efforts to developing countries./11 Ignoring these concerns, Trump\u2019s defenders think they\u2019ve found an airtight defense, highlighting the timing of the original deal for refueling services\u2014but that was noted in the original reporting\u2014and the fact that Trump likely didn\u2019t order it\u2014but there\u2019s no claim he did. /12 Bottom line: Turnberry is a big deal because it\u2019s a symptom of a problem in an administration that is anything but transparent. /13",

On Sunday he said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d waiting to \u201chear from the Kingdom\u201d about who was responsible for the attack Saturday on Saudi oil facilities. As it turns out, the U.S. didn\u2019t wait for \u201cthe Kingdom\u201d but instead informed the Saudis on Monday that Iran was responsible for the attack. But the Saudis said American officials\u00a0failed to provide enough proof that Iran was responsible, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iran has denied responsibility. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the attack was an act of self-defense by the Yemeni Houthi rebels in response to being bombed by the Saudis. Trump\u2019s supporters are backing his bristling war readiness, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggesting the U.S. consider bombing Iran\u2019s refineries, which would \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back.\u201d But Trump\u2019s posturing has also triggered a flood of criticism, with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0(D-Hawaii) accusing the president of turning America into Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cbitch.\u201d\u00a0She accused Trump of waiting for orders from his \u201cSaudi masters.\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said U.S. military action on behalf of the Saudis against Iran would be \u201ca grave mistake.\u201d And Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted that there is \u201cno imminent threat and the U.S. military is not authorized to retaliate on behalf of another country.\u201d Lawmakers reminded Trump that it\u2019s the job of Congress whether or not to declare war.\u00a0\u201cOnly Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 can declare war,\u201d Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a 2020 presidential candidate, tweeted Sunday. \u201cAnd Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to.\u201d Trump appeared to back off Monday from his locked-and-loaded pose.\u00a0\u201cDo I want war?\u201d he said to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody.\u201d But the president added: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d He also said that the Saudis are \u201cgoing to have a lot of involvement in this if we decide to do something ... that includes payment.\u201d The attacks early Saturday on a massive oil field and refinery disrupted about\u00a050% of Saudi oil output \u2014 5% of the entire global supply. For decades before Trump was president, he blasted Saudi Arabia for taking advantage of its relationship with America and once mocked Obama for bowing at a meeting with the Saudi king. In office, Trump has been a constant supporter of the autocratic Saudi royal family, even after the CIA determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00a0was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in the assassination a year ago of Washington Post writer\u00a0Jamal Khashoggi.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In less than three years, President Donald Trump has named more former lobbyists to Cabinet-level posts than his most recent predecessors did in eight, putting a substantial amount of oversight in the hands of people with ties to the industries they\u2019re regulating. The Cabinet choices are another sign that Trump\u2019s populist pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d is a catchy campaign slogan but not a serious attempt to change the way Washington works. Instead of staring down \u201cthe unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests\u201d as Trump recently declared, the influence industry has flourished during his administration. The amount spent in 2019 on lobbying the U.S. government is on pace to match or exceed last year\u2019s total of $3.4 billion, the most since 2010, according to the political money website Open Secrets. Trump also has pulled in hefty contributions from industries with business before his administration, and his hotel near the White House has been a magnet for lobbyists and foreign interests since he was elected. \u201cAn administration staffed by former industry lobbyists will almost certainly favor industry over the general public, because that\u2019s the outlook they\u2019re bringing to the job,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at the think tank New America and author of the book \u201cThe Business of America is Lobbying.\u201d Former lobbyists run the Defense and Interior departments, Environmental Protection Agency and office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The acting Labor secretary, Pat Pizzella, is an ex-lobbyist and Trump\u2019s pick to run the department, Eugene Scalia, also is an ex-lobbyist. Scalia\u2019s confirmation hearing before a GOP-controlled Senate committee is scheduled for Thursday and Democrats are expected to grill him on his long record of opposing federal regulations . A seventh ex-lobbyist, Dan Coats, resigned as Trump\u2019s intelligence chief in August. President Barack Obama had five former lobbyists in his Cabinet during two terms in office and President George W. Bush had three, also during eight years in the White House, according to lobbying and foreign agent disclosure records. The review was limited to the Trump, Obama and Bush administrations because prior to 1995 there was no central database of federal lobbying registrations and the law was hazy about who was supposed to register. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that revoked an Obama directive prohibiting lobbyists from being appointed to a post at a federal agency they\u2019d lobbied within the last two years. While this \u201ccooling off\u201d period was cast aside, Trump\u2019s order continued to bar for two years lobbyists-turned-government-employees from participating in particular matters that they\u2019d lobbied on during the two preceding years. \u201cWithout the cooling off period, these Cabinet heads appear to be serving their former employers\u2019 and clients\u2019 special interests,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s Cabinet includes the heads of the 15 executive departments and seven other senior-level posts, such as EPA administrator and director of national intelligence. Obama\u2019s Cabinet had the same number of members and Bush\u2019s Cabinet had two fewer. Scalia, the Labor Department nominee, has spent much of his career as a partner in the Washington office of the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher firm, where he ran up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations. Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, served for a year as the Labor Department\u2019s top lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. His financial disclosure report lists 49 clients who paid him $5,000 or more for legal services, including e-cigarette giant Juul Labs, Facebook, Walmart and Bank of America. Disclosure records show Scalia was registered in 2010 and 2011 to lobby for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Pizzella has been the acting secretary since Alexander Acosta resigned the post in July amid renewed criticism of how, as a federal prosecutor, he handled a 2008 secret plea deal with wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Pizzella lobbied for clients that ranged from Microsoft Corp. to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. He also worked on several accounts with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, although Pizzella was never accused of any misconduct or wrongdoing. Obama chose Pizzella for a GOP seat on the Federal Labor Relations Authority and he was an assistant Labor secretary during the George W. Bush administration. Two Trump Cabinet officials, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, have been accused by congressional Democrats and public interest groups of failing to honor their ethics pledges. Both Bernhardt and Wheeler, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have played leading roles in the administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations. They also both worked at the agency they now lead during prior administrations. Interior\u2019s inspector general launched an investigation of Bernhardt earlier this year after receiving seven separate ethics allegations against him. A complaint filed by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center alleged that shortly after joining the department in August 2017 Bernhardt became involved in matters that were the focus of his lobbying for California\u2019s Westlands Water District that lasted until mid-November 2016. Westlands has federal contracts to provide irrigation water to 700 family-owned farms in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. The complaint said Bernhardt had \u201clobbied on discrete provisions of a law directing Interior to maximize water supplies to his clients, and to minimize Endangered Species Act protections in that region.\u201d Then, after joining Interior, Bernhardt breached his ethics pledge by directing government officials under him \u201cto advance the particular matters he had previously lobbied on,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cIt is very hard to tell where Bernhardt\u2019s lobbying career ended and where his public service begins,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, director of the Campaign Legal Center\u2019s federal reform program. An Interior spokesman said in a statement, \u201cSecretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he has fully complied with those obligations.\u201d Thomas Birmingham, Westlands\u2019 general manager, said the agency is actually disadvantaged with Bernhardt as secretary because he\u2019s not been able to engage with him as he did past Interior secretaries, like Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Mr. Bernhardt has done or has not done at Interior,\u201d Birmingham said. Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for eight years and his more than 20 different clients included coal magnate Bob Murray, who pushed hard on the Trump administration to grant a series of breaks for the sagging domestic coal industry. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Betsy Monseu, CEO of the American Coal Council, said of Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the regulatory reform agenda moving forward.\u201d But Canter\u2019s organization, known as CREW, urged the EPA inspector general earlier this year to investigate whether Wheeler broke his ethics pledge. Among the allegations, CREW said Wheeler had participated in the easing of standards for storing coal ash in 2018 even though he had lobbied on those regulations the year before for Murray Energy. The inspector general\u2019s office declined to say if it had open an investigation, directing a reporter to file a Freedom of Information Act request. An EPA statement called CREW\u2019s complaint \u201cbaseless and just flat out false.\u201d It said Wheeler works closely with career EPA ethics officials and abides by all ethics requirements. The Pentagon\u2019s top official, Mark Esper, spent seven years lobbying for defense industry juggernaut Raytheon, a company that stands to gain handsomely from Trump\u2019s push to boost military spending by billions of dollars. The company closed out 2018 by hitting a record $27.1 billion in net sales, up nearly seven percent from the $25.3 billion the year before. Esper, who was secretary of the Army when Trump chose him to be defense secretary, faced opposition from only a handful of Democrats and he was confirmed in July by a 90-8 margin. As Army secretary, Esper hasn\u2019t participated in Raytheon-related matters under the terms of an ethics agreement that runs through this November. After that, Esper told Pentagon ethics officials that he will continue to avoid Raytheon issues unless his participation as defense secretary is determined to be essential. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, lobbied primarily for steel companies between 1999 and 2003. Beginning in 2004, he represented just one company, U.S. Steel, which paid his firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, $3.2 million over a seven-year period. ___ Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " HOUSTON \u2015 Wading through throngs of students during a surprise visit at a historically Black university here on Friday, Joe Biden felt the love from a contingent of voters he doesn\u2019t see often at his campaign events: young people. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Joe!\u201d one teenager shouted to a friend as the 76-year-old former vice president made his way around the student center at Texas Southern University, which was established in 1946 when Texas was still a segregated state. Biden was the only candidate who met with students there after last week\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate, which took place on the campus a day prior. He spent approximately 45 minutes shaking hands, posing for selfies, and giving hugs to star-struck students. Judging the reaction from among some in the crowd, one would have guessed it was actually former President Barack Obama making the rounds. \u201cI think if there\u2019s a Democrat that has a chance of winning, it\u2019s definitely Biden. Everybody wants another Obama and he\u2019s the closest thing we can get,\u201d said Chynna Barcass, a junior at TSU who is studying political science. Obama\u2019s political rise, though, was fueled in large part by young people. So far, polls have consistently shown Biden supporters to be older \u2015 a trend one can\u2019t help but notice at his rallies and town halls, which have tended to be predominantly filled by voters over the age of 60. Biden is particularly popular among older, more conservative African Americans, a source of his political strength in early primary states like South Carolina. But young Black students at TSU said they liked the former vice president, too, citing his association with Obama, who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate. Biden has leaned heavily into his relationship with the former president during the campaign, invoking his name repeatedly and using his legacy as a shield when faced with criticism by rivals for the Democratic nomination. Just hours before the debate last week, he released a video touting Obama administration achievements and showing him and the former president exchanging high-fives. \u201cBarack Obama was a great president. We don\u2019t say that enough\u200b,\u201d Biden wrote in a tweet accompanying the video. It\u2019s clear why Biden\u2019s campaign is doing this \u2015 it\u2019s one of his best tools in winning over not just older Black voters, but younger ones too. However, there is evidence young minority voters are more open to considering other candidates in the race, especially those who have proposed significantly more liberal policies dealing with health care and education. \u201cMy mom likes [Biden], but I don\u2019t know. I feel like I want somebody different, somebody new,\u201d said Ardis Thomas, a music and entertainment major who is leaning toward backing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) because of his plan to cancel all $1.6 trillion of U.S. student loan debt. Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, like his unsuccessful 2016 bid, is made up of more younger voters in general. A third of Sanders\u2019 coalition is currently composed of voters under the age of 29, compared to just 9 percent of Biden\u2019s, according to a survey conducted by Morning Consult last month. \u201cA lot of people in the minority groups ... hear some of the things\u00a0[Bernie is]\u00a0saying and just completely get excited. I think that\u2019s how he\u2019s getting our vote,\u201d argued Barcass. She added that while the idea of canceling all student debt in the U.S. sounded nice, it was nevertheless \u201cunrealistic.\u201d Other candidates named by students at TSU as someone they are considering supporting in the primary included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost his bid to oust Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the 2018 midterm election. \u201cI like Beto. He\u2019s just really for the people,\u201d said Aisha Lewis, a TSU freshman who is studying psychology. Texas is home to one of the largest African American populations in the country. Houston, in particular, has one of the most rapidly growing and diverse communities in the nation. The recent wave of Republican retirements in the House from Texas has ignited Democratic hopes about turning the state blue in the coming years. Getting young voters, who are a key segment of the Democratic electorate, enthused and out to the polls was a successful strategy for Obama in 2008 and 2012. It\u2019s not clear yet if Biden will be able to replicate his success on that front. The former vice president\u2019s campaign recently launched a \u201cStudents for Biden\u201d group focused on training and recruiting organizers at college campuses, including HBCUs, but they\u2019ve lagged behind the efforts of other candidates when it comes to drawing young voters. Biden\u2019s campaign has acknowledged that he has to do to better at appealing to the demographic.\u00a0One Biden adviser, however, argued during a press briefing last week that it is other candidates who are actually at a disadvantage in the primary due to their difficulties attracting older voters, who \u201ctend to show up in slightly greater numbers sometimes and are regarded often as more dependable voters.\u201d It\u2019s true that Democratic primary voters tend to be older. Turning out voters under the age of 30 has historically been key to Democrats in winning the general election, however. In one of the most notable moments in Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro targeted Biden with a sharp attack, suggesting that Biden\u2019s memory was failing him. The broadside echoed concerns by other candidates in the race about the former vice president\u2019s age and mental acuity,\u00a0especially after highly publicized verbal slip-ups. (Warren and Sanders are also both in their 70s.)\u00a0Biden\u2019s campaign dismissed it as a \u201ccheap shot,\u201d and that characterization has been echoed by others in the media. But it was not an issue brought up by students at TSU, who said they were looking for a presidential candidate with their interests at heart first and foremost. \u201cA lot of candidates think that age matters, but if you\u2019re capable of getting things done, I don\u2019t think it does,\u201d said TSU College Democrats President Tyler Smith. Isaiah Thornton, who is studying journalism, agreed. \u201cI feel like a lot of young kids like older people who know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.",

Nearly two months ago, the Swedish teenager sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in a zero-emissions boat to participate in two United Nations climate summits.

Thunberg has become a figurehead in\u00a0an emerging youth movement that\u2019s reacting\u00a0to political inaction on climate change. Last week, Thunberg and hundreds of other young protesters held a climate rally outside the White House\u00a0carrying signs that read \u201cI want you to panic!\u201d and \u201cWhy are we studying for a future we won\u2019t have?\u201d They chanted, \u201cThis is a crisis, act like it!\u201d and \u201cNo more coal, no more oil, keep that carbon in the soil.\u201d Asked if she would make her case personally to President Donald Trump, Thunberg told CBS in August she had no interest in wasting her time. (Trump has a long history of denying the threat posed by climate change.) \u201cWhy should I waste time talking to him when he, of course, is not going to listen to me?\u201d she said at the time.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t say anything that he hasn\u2019t already heard.\u201d In 2018, ahead of a general election in Sweden, the then-15-year-old went on strike outside the parliament building in Stockholm, handing out leaflets reading \u201cI am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.\u201d",

And Trump does both. A lot. Obama said at a tech conference that when he was president, he relied on a diversity of opinions before making decisions, according to Axios. \u201cThe other thing that is helpful is not watching TV or reading social media,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThose are two things I would advise, if you\u2019re our president, not to do,\u201d he added, per The Washington Post. \u201cIt creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, and at least one former Obama insider insisted that this wasn\u2019t a shot at the current POTUS.\u00a0Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted: While that may be the case, Obama would certainly be aware of how the comments could be taken in light of the Trump presidency. Obama made another statement that could also be interpreted as a swipe at his successor. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact we didn\u2019t have indictments,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that before, but that is pretty rare in modern-day.\u201d The \u201cmodern-day\u201d occupant of the White House has surrounded himself with aides and associates who are now in legal trouble.\u00a0Former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former personal attorney Michael Cohen are currently serving prison time.

      "author": "Lydia O\u2019Connor",
      "content": " In his first solo press conference since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment probe\u00a0into his interactions with Ukraine,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0on Wednesday attempted to turn the tables on his political opponents with a baseless accusation. When asked by a reporter why it\u2019s OK for a U.S. president to ask a foreign country to investigate his political opponent, Trump falsely retorted that former President Barack Obama had done that to him. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what he did, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0Trump said in reference to Obama. \u201cReally, when you think about it, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully that will all come out,\u201d he said before trailing off with a list of books he said would back him up. He put forth another conspiracy theory that the timing of the whistleblower media coverage was only to distract from his meetings at the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cThat was all planned,\u201d he said. \u201cLike everything, that was all planned.\u201d Trump leaned on his regular talking points throughout the speech, scolding the media for not giving enough coverage to his United Nations General Assembly meetings and accusing the Democrats of sowing division. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dividing, they\u2019re belittling, they\u2019re demeaning our country.\u201d After speaking for around 20 minutes, he took only a few questions from reporters. Trump\u2019s remarks come hours after the White House released a summary of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the details of which were first uncovered last week in a series of bombshell media reports about a related whistleblower complaint. That summary, which is not a full transcript, reveals that Trump implored Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d immediately after the Ukrainian leader told Trump he was grateful for the military aid the U.S. had provided to his country. Trump had two favors in mind, the summary revealed. First, he wanted Ukraine to investigate the baseless theory that Russia did not actually hack Democratic National Committee servers in 2016 in order to aid Trump\u2019s campaign. Secondly, Trump asked Zelensky to open an investigation into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, whom Trump might face in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThe other thing,\u201d Trump said, per the summary, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d Trump went on: \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you could look into it ... it sounds horrible to me.\u201d Trump was referring to Hunter Biden, who began working with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, while his father was serving in the Obama administration. The prosecution he referenced was a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma, which ended without any convictions. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, the Bidens have\u00a0not been accused of legal wrongdoing related to the company. Trump also asked Zelensky to meet with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor now serving as Trump\u2019s private attorney, and to speak with Attorney General William Barr to discuss the investigation. Trump insisted at his Wednesday press conference that the phone call was \u201cperfect\u201d and that anything the Democrats have to say about is \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d \u201cWhen they look at the information, it\u2019s a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cImpeachment for that?\u201d He also cast doubt on the trustworthiness of the whistleblower. \u201cThe so-called whistleblower, the one that didn\u2019t have any first class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand, you\u2019ll have to figure that out\u00a0 for yourself,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump releases a \u201ctranscript\u201d clearly showing him asking a foreign leader to investigate one of Trump\u2019s political opponents. Trump\u2019s Republican Party largely in unison claims, somehow, that the document proves Trump did nothing wrong. Leaving the party\u2019s exiles to wonder on what planet they are living. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of trite at this point to say, \u2018Imagine if Obama had did this,\u2019\u201d said GOP consultant Rory Cooper about Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. \u201cBut if Obama had done this, the \u2018right\u2019 would have lost their minds.\u201d Cooper, once a top aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said he was mystified by Republicans\u2019 apparent belief that they could spin the memo on the call as helping Trump. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how anybody can read that as a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear in this summary the president asked the leader of a foreign nation to investigate a political foe,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party and a prominent Trump critic. \u201cTo hear Republican leaders that I previously had deep respect for to come out and give that knee-jerk response is stunning.\u201d Trump, who as late as Wednesday morning had claimed the \u201ctranscript\u201d would show \u201ca perfect call,\u201d quickly changed tack to argue that it showed no explicit \u201cquid-pro-quo.\u201d Even that claim, though, is belied by the \u201ctranscript,\u201d which in reality is a reconstruction of the conversation by National Security Council staff and not a verbatim transcription. Relatively early in the call, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky says: \u201cI would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense,\u201d and proceeds to detail the sort of missile system he would like to buy. Trump\u2019s response starts: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d after which he explains he wants Attorney General William Barr to speak to Ukrainian officials and \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of issues including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son\u2019s involvement in a Ukrainian energy company. Nevertheless, Republicans in both chambers of Congress and party leaders across the country adopted the \u201ctranscript clearly shows there was no quid pro quo\u201d argument that was recommended in talking points distributed by the White House. \u201cReveals no quid pro quo,\u201d Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey told reporters. \u201cDemocrats overstepped with their \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 accusation,\u201d Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter. These and other Republicans are \u201cnever going to let go of Trump\u2019s ankles. They\u2019ll go down with him,\u201d said former Illinois GOP Rep. Joe Walsh, who is challenging the president for the 2020 Republican nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely disappointing.\u201d Trump not only continued arguing Wednesday that he had done nothing wrong in his conversation with Zelensky, but went ahead with a joint photo opportunity with him following their first face-to-face meeting at the United Nations in New York. Zelensky at first declined to get involved in U.S. politics but, sitting beside the man who controls the flow of military aid to his country, then told reporters: \u201cNobody pushed \u2015 pushed me.\u201d Trump then added: \u201cIn other words, no pressure,\u201d before going on to agree with an internet conspiracy theory that his 2016 Democratic opponent\u2019s deleted emails have been cached somewhere in Ukraine. \u201cAnd then she said, as I remember it, that, \u2018Oh, well, they had to do with the wedding and yoga.\u2019 She does a lot of yoga, right?\u201d Trump said of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the deleted messages. \u201cSo they had 33,000 emails about the wedding of her daughter and yoga. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He also told Zelensky, in response to the Ukrainian\u2019s plea for help getting Russia to leave the Crimean peninsula that it has occupied since 2014, that \u201cyou lost Crimea\u201d under Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d Trump said in response to Zelensky\u2019s repeated request for help in getting the territory back. Last month, Trump appeared to excuse Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s desire to hang onto the region. \u201cNow it\u2019s a very big area \u2015 a very important area. Russia has its submarine. That is where they do their submarine work and that is where they dock large and powerful submarines,\u201d he said at a news conference following the G-7 summit in France. Walsh said he knows that congressional Republicans are tired of defending Trump\u2019s continuing misdeeds, from the merely absurd to the potentially impeachable, but are too afraid to cross him and are betting that they can survive and retake control of the party after Trump leaves the presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad bet. And they\u2019re going to get burned,\u201d Walsh said.",

In the statement released by the group National Security Action\u00a0on Thursday night, the officials called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201can unconscionable abuse of power\u201d and commended the House of Representatives for opening an official impeachment inquiry into the matter. They wrote that if the reports are true, Trump\u2019s misconduct represents \u201can effort to subordinate America\u2019s national interests\u2015and those of our closest allies and partners\u2015to the President\u2019s personal interest.\u201d You can read the full statement below.

With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s formal announcement of an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, the Trump White House is facing its gravest political threat yet. On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released the anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the inspector general, and heard\u00a0testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence\u00a0Joseph Maguire. The\u00a0whistleblower alleges\u00a0that several people, including the president, Attorney General Bill Barr, and the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, engaged in an expansive campaign to extort Ukraine for political gain and cover up the evidence.

For the outlet\u2019s co-founder, John Harris, it was\u00a0\u201cJust another day in Fucknutsville.\u201d The eye-popping phrase was splashed atop an analysis by Harris published Friday, which took stock of the president\u2019s beleaguered administration. The piece noted that fallout from Trump\u2019s controversial July phone call with the Ukraine president made it \u201ca big week in the news business for visual devices,\u201d like homepage takeovers and jumbo font headlines. For the original version of Harris\u2019 article, the headline drew from the famously profane Rahm Emanuel, who used the explicit term to refer to Washington during his time as chief of staff to President\u00a0Barack Obama. The headline was eventually replaced with a sanitized, more prosaic one: \u201cTrump Killed the Seriousness of Impeachment.\u201d Politico spokesperson Brad Dayspring didn\u2019t offer HuffPost a specific explanation for the change, saying, \u201cHeadlines are routinely changed by our editors, for a variety of different reasons.\u201d He added, \u201cIf I had to explain the rationale each time a headline changed I wouldn\u2019t have time for anything else!\u201d The initial wording \u201cwas up for several hours\u201d and it was not a placeholder, Dayspring said.

      "content": " The Trump administration is reportedly amping up its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails \u2014 reviving a controversial topic that dominated headlines during the 2016 presidential election and one that President Donald Trump continues to mention. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the State Department is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former officials who sent messages to Clinton\u2019s private email account when she was secretary of state. The New York Times confirmed the continuation of the investigation on Sunday. State Department investigators began contacting officials about the emails some 18 months ago, the Post reported. But the effort was apparently dropped before being revived in August. \u201cAs many as 130\u201d officials have been contacted by the Trump administration since then, the paper said, adding that\u00a0\u201cthose targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations.\u201d The emails were largely sent between 2009 and 2013, when Clinton was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. State Department officials denied to the Post that the probe was politically motivated. But one former senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation described it as a way for Republicans \u201cto keep the Clinton email issue alive.\u201d Trump, for one, has not dropped the matter. Just Wednesday, Trump \u2015 who\u2019s facing an impeachment inquiry following a series of troubling revelations related to a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015\u00a0touted a baseless conspiracy theory about Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cI think one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena,\u201d Trump told reporters\u00a0in New York while sitting alongside Zelensky\u00a0ahead of a bilateral meeting, referring to a cache of emails that was deleted by a Clinton aide in 2014. Trump suggested those emails \u201ccould very well\u201d be in Ukraine. Clinton came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election for her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business \u2015 and her choice to delete emails that she\u2019d deemed personal rather than turning them over to investigators. Then-FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but ultimately recommended the case be closed with no charges. Comey also said the FBI had found no evidence that the 33,000 deleted emails had been \u201cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d Some of the emails were recovered by intelligence officials, NBC News noted. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, has said she believes Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the email controversy mere days before the presidential election was a major factor contributing to her loss. \u201cAbsent that, I believe the evidence shows I would have won,\u201d Clinton said in 2017.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission cannot bar states from passing their own net neutrality laws, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said on Tuesday, adding that the agency must review some key aspects of its 2017 repeal of rules set by the Obama administration. The court, which upheld much of the FCC\u2019s December 2017 order, said the agency \u201cfailed to examine the implications of its decisions for public safety\u201d and must also review how its decision will impact a government subsidy program for low-income users. The decision was a setback to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reverse rules adopted under President Barack Obama in 2015 which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the decision affirmed the FCC\u2019s \u201cdecision to repeal 1930s utility-style regulation of the Internet. A free and open Internet is what we have today. A free and open Internet is what we\u2019ll continue to have going forward.\u201d Enthusiastically supported by large tech companies and consumer groups, net neutrality was formally adopted by the FCC in 2015. Major telecommunications companies argued it limited their ability to offer new services to content providers, and under the Trump Administration, the FCC overturned the policy. An attempt to legislate its reinstatement failed last year, although tech trade groups are still trying in court. California passed sweeping state net neutrality protections but agreed not to enforce the measure pending the court challenge. The Trump administration rules were a win for internet providers like AT&T Inc <T.N>, Comcast Corp <CMCSA.O> and Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N> but opposed by companies such as Facebook Inc <FB.O>, Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O>.

      "content": " President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter of 2019, a figure described by The Associated Press as a presidential fundraising record. Trump\u2019s fundraising success should serve as a \u201cgiant wake-up call\u201d to Democrats whose fundraising efforts have paled in comparison, warned Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama. Trump\u2019s campaign and the RNC said Tuesday that they had raised more than $308 million since the beginning of the year. That\u2019s double the amount that Obama and the Democratic National Committee had raised at this point in 2011 during Obama\u2019s reelection bid. Trump\u2019s fundraising also has far eclipsed that of his potential 2020 Democratic rivals. Not all Democratic candidates have released their third-quarter fundraising numbers, but Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said this week that his campaign had raised $25.3 million over the past three months. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raked in more than $19 million, and California Sen. Kamala Harris said her campaign raised $11.6 million. The third quarter ended Monday, and all 2020 candidates will need to report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. GOP officials have claimed that the impeachment inquiry into Trump \u201csupercharged\u201d the president\u2019s fundraising efforts, NPR reported. \u201cIn the 24 hours since news of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement, [Trump\u2019s] campaign and GOP have BLOWN OUT fundraising,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale declared on Twitter\u00a0last week. Parscale on Tuesday to celebrate the president\u2019s fundraising figures. The RNC has said that it will spend millions of dollars on TV ads and other campaigns to challenge the impeachment inquiry, as well as Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals like former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cWe are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and re-elect President Trump in 2020,\u201d GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. Pfeiffer said Democrats should be concerned about the very deep pockets of Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis should be a giant wake up call,\u201d Pfeiffer said on Twitter. \u201cTrump is going to have more resources to deploy earlier and more aggressively than any candidate in history.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s former president says he discussed investments with President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in 2017, but that he never discussed Ukrainian companies with any U.S. official. Like many Ukrainians, former President Petro Poroshenko is trying to distance himself from the U.S. impeachment inquiry into Trump, triggered by a phone call between the American leader and Poroshenko\u2019s successor, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cWe definitely do not want to be involved in the political process inside the United States,\u201d Poroshenko, now a Ukrainian lawmaker, told reporters in parliament Wednesday. Poroshenko said he met Giuliani in 2017 as a \u201cfriend of Ukraine\u201d and they discussed \u201cpolitical support and investment\u201d but nothing else. He wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cWe never ever spoke about commercial companies\u201d with Trump, former President Barack Obama, current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, or \u201cany U.S. officials,\u201d said Poroshenko, Ukraine\u2019s leader from 2014 to 2019. Giuliani wants Ukraine to investigate Biden, whose son Hunter served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump asked Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens in a July phone call that is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry. Poroshenko said he was not aware that Giuliani had met with then-Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. Like Poroshenko, many Ukrainians are shrugging off U.S. efforts to impeach Trump as someone else\u2019s problem. But they are worried about one thing: that Ukraine\u2019s role in the Trump affair strengthens Russia\u2019s hand, and hobbles the politically inexperienced Zelenskiy just as he\u2019s trying to tackle the problems that matter to them most: corruption and an armed conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east that has divided their nation. Zelenskiy announced an agreement Tuesday with Ukrainian separatists that paves the way for peace talks to end five years of fighting, but Ukrainian nationalists denounced it as capitulation to Russia. The U.S. scandal \u201cis weakening Zelenskiy\u2019s standing inside the country,\u201d said Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the R.Politik political analysis firm. A rough transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy shows the Ukrainian leader flattering Trump, criticizing the U.S. ambassador and European leaders, and saying Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor is \u201cmy guy.\u201d \u201cHe gave a reason to doubt his ability to be an honest president,\u201d Stanovaya said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big blow for him\u201d since he overwhelmingly beat Poroshenko in Ukraine\u2019s April election. Zelenskiy\u2019s comments on the call will fuel the Kremlin\u2019s view that Ukrainian leaders are beholden to U.S. interests. As the impeachment process heats up, the U.S. State Department gave initial approval to a $39 million sale of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to help the country battle Russia-backed separatists. The proposed aid is in addition to some $400 million in U.S. military aid released last month. ___ Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed.",

Obama praised Trudeau in a tweet celebrating the Liberal Party prime minister as a \u201chard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\u201d \u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term,\u201d Obama said. While the former U.S. president celebrated Trudeau, 47, as a progressive leader, Obama didn\u2019t note the prime minister\u2019s history of wearing blackface and brownface, which came to light in September. The revelation that Trudeau has worn racist makeup has led to his sinking approval ratings, scuffing his persona as a liberal star. Canada\u2019s federal election day is next Monday on Oct. 21. Last month, Time magazine published a photo of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup at a party for a private school where he taught in 2001. The party\u2019s theme was \u201cArabian Nights\u201d and Trudeau, 29 at the time, wore a turban and robe with his skin darkened to brown. After the photo was made public, Trudeau admitted to wearing blackface in another instance \u2015 when he was in high school to perform the song \u201cDay-O\u201d by Jamaican-American singer Harry Belafonte. \u201cI made a mistake when I was younger and I wish I hadn\u2019t,\u201d Trudeau told reporters the day the Time report was published. \u201cI should have known better then, but I didn\u2019t. And I did it. And I am deeply sorry for it.\u201d One day later, yet another instance of Trudeau wearing racist makeup surfaced, further clouding his reelection campaign. This time, Trudeau was wearing blackface in a grainy video dating back to the early 1990s uncovered by Global News. Trudeau apologized again during a press conference after the video was released. \u201cWhat I did hurt people who shouldn\u2019t have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity. This is something that I deeply, deeply regret,\u201d he said after a campaign event. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that because of the layers of privilege that I have, and for that I am deeply sorry.\u201d",

The ceremony, held in the department\u2019s Great Hall, marked the 10th anniversary of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was signed by President Barack Obama in October 2009. The act expanded the 1969 federal hate-crime law to include crimes based on a victim\u2019s sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Judy and Dennis Shepard, unable to attend due to a prior commitment, prepared a statement that was read at the ceremony by Cynthia Deitle, a former FBI agent who is now programs and operations director for the Denver-based Matthew Shepard Foundation. The Shepards praised Justice Department employees who over the years have worked to implement and enforce the act, but they blasted Barr \u2014 and by extension President Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 because the department argued last week before the Supreme Court that employers should be able to fire employees because they are transgender. The administration also has taken other steps to roll back protections for LGBTQ people. \u201cMr. Barr, you cannot have it both ways,\u201d the Shepards\u2019 statement said. \u201cEither you believe in equality for all or you don\u2019t. We do not honor our son by kowtowing to hypocrisy.\u201d The attorney general \u201cmust lead and demonstrate his refusal to accept hate in all its manifestations,\u201d the Shepards said. \u201cHe must demonstrate courage, even if it means disagreeing with the administration. So far, he has done none of these deeds.\u201d Many of the guests at the ceremony rose for a standing ovation after Deitle finished reading the statement. There was no immediate response from the Justice Department. Matthew Shepard\u2019s murder was a galvanizing event for LGBTQ Americans, epitomizing the pain and discrimination that many had experienced personally. Shepard was found badly beaten and barely breathing on Oct. 6, 1998, after being tied to a split-rail fence on a dirt road near Laramie, Wyoming. He had spent 18 hours there in the near-freezing cold before a cyclist discovered him, at first mistaking him for a scarecrow. He died five days later. Police said his two attackers targeted him because he was gay. Both were sentenced to life in prison. James Byrd Jr., a black man from East Texas, was also killed in 1998. He was chained to the back of a truck and then dragged along a secluded road. Two of the white men convicted of his murder have been executed. Wednesday\u2019s ceremony included opening remarks by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who outlined some new initiatives aimed at increasing the reporting of hate crimes and improving law enforcement\u2019s response to them. The event also featured a panel discussion about the first hate-crimes murder prosecution brought under the Shepard-Byrd act. That case involved a group of young white people in Mississippi who drove into the majority-black city of Jackson in 2011 to harass black people. A 49-year-old black man, James Craig Anderson, was run over and killed by a truck driven by one of the white youths.",

      "content": " Two former government ethics experts have strongly condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to host the 2020 G-7 summit of world leaders at his\u00a0own golf resort in Miami. Richard Painter, the former chief ethics attorney for President George W. Bush,\u00a0described Thursday\u2019s announcement by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u00a0as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\u00a0Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, called it \u201cthe most overt corruption to date.\u201d \u201cThis is not only self-dealing, this is a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which specifically provides that a person holding a position of trust with the U.S. government cannot accept any profits or benefits from foreign governments,\u201d Painter told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Thursday night. \u201cWe have had him violating the emoluments clause since day one and now he\u2019s going out and openly asking foreign governments to subsidize his resorts in connection with the G-7,\u201d Painter continued. \u201cHe\u2019s got his hand out to foreign governments and if this Congress puts up with that, they are to blame as well.\u201d Check out the clip here: Shaub, who served under President Barack Obama and resigned from his position six months into the Trump administration, vented his anger on Twitter via multiple posts. \u201cHow any Senator could fail to object to this is beyond me,\u201d Shaub wrote in one tweet. \u201cThere\u2019s no universe in which anyone could believe that, in a country as big as ours, the selection of Trump\u2019s resort was anything but a product of the worst kind of corruption.\u201d \u201cThis is so overtly corrupt that it can\u2019t be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators,\u201d Shaub said in another. \u201cIf they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything. In that case, he will do everything.\u201d Shaub also said it was \u201ca red line crossed\u201d and that \u201cwe have reached the bottom.\u201d \u201cIf the Senate will not act to stop this, there is no government ethics program,\u201d he posted. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Read Shaub\u2019s tweets in full below: Correct! It\u2019s also a very serious violation of federal procurement laws. https://t.co/coLZgSaKh3 Somebody please ask the White House what agency ran this procurement. The White House does not have a procurement team that could run this, and it definitely does not have an appropriation to use for the event. https://t.co/LCovrV2dJU If you work in a domed building in the nation\u2019s capital, you will either call this G-7 deal corrupt or your silence will scream out your own corruption. pic.twitter.com/kJp08HPLEe If Trump were covered by the criminal conflict of interest law, this would be an open and shut case. https://t.co/S7Sa5eJQhh Mulvaney is subject to @OfficeGovEthics regs that say \u201cEmployees shall not use public office for private gain\u201d and \u201cact impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.\u201d What is left of the executive branch ethics program if this is ok? https://t.co/HcEqjc5Pxx In addition to @MickMulvaneyOMB, every White House official who participated in this sham procurement violated @OfficeGovEthics regulations barring misuse of position. If they can do this with impunity, how can lower level employees be held to a higher standard? I\u2019d like you to imagine a conflict of interest prosecution in which a defense attorney\u2019s closing argument is based on the things Mick Mulvaney said in defense of awarding the G7 contract to Doral. That attorney would be disbarred. The arguments are ridiculous. .@ChuckGrassley: Oversight, enforcement and transparency are vital tools to fight fraud & wasteful govt spending.@MickMulvaneyOMB: I don\u2019t talk about how this place runs on the inside. So if you want to see our paper on how we did [the G7 award], the answer is absolutely not. ahem Federal Acquisition Reg. \u00a7 1.102-2(c)(1) An essential consideration in every aspect of the [Acquisition] System is maintaining the public\u2019s trust.

On Friday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d Shaub said acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s dismissal of fears that Trump could personally profit from the event were \u201ca ridiculous thing\u201d to say. Trump has been accused of violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officeholders from accepting gifts or profits from foreign states, with the decision. \u201cEssentially, it boils down to this, the president in the United States participated in a contract awarded to his own business,\u201d said Shaub, who served under former President Barack Obama and the first six months of Trump\u2019s administration until he resigned. \u201cThis is the figurative equivalent of he reaches into the treasury, grabs a chunk of money and says \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not taking more than I\u2019m spending,\u2019\u201d Shaub continued. \u201cThat\u2019s no defense at all and certainly, if it had been Mick Mulvaney who owned this property, he\u2019d be prosecuted and convicted of a felony and wouldn\u2019t be able to say \u2018don\u2019t worry, I broke even.\u2019\u201d Shaub later summed up the \u201cthe bottom line.\u201d \u201cThere is no definition of corruption that would not cover the president participating in a contract awarded to himself.\u00a0So, if this is not corrupt, nothing is corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what he wants and it seems to be exactly what the United States Senate is determined to have be the case.\u201d Shaub on Thursday claimed the decision to host the event at the resort\u00a0was \u201cso overtly corrupt that it can\u2019t be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators.\u201d \u201cIf they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything.

      "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
      "content": " President Donald Trump railed against \u201cvicious\u201d Democrats and the \u201ccrazy\u201d impeachment inquiry they\u2019ve launched against him during a rambling conversation with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that aired Monday. Urging the GOP to \u201cget tougher,\u201d Trump told Hannity that Republicans \u201cwould never do anything like this,\u201d referring to the impeachment probe. Republicans could have impeached former President Barack Obama \u201cfor many different things,\u201d Trump said \u2014 but \u201cthey never even thought of impeaching him.\u201d \u201cThey could\u2019ve impeached Obama for the IRS scandal. They could impeach him for the guns for whatever where guns went all over the place and people got killed, Fast and Furious,\u201d Trump told Hannity. \u201cThey could\u2019ve killed him \u2015 they could\u2019ve impeached him for many different things.\u201d The \u201ckilled him\u201d remark appears to have been a slip of the tongue. During Obama\u2019s tenure, the Internal Revenue Service was accused of singling out tea party organizations and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status and subjecting them to extra scrutiny. It later emerged, however, that the IRS had also targeted dozens of apparently left-leaning organizations. Neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice, which launched investigations into the IRS controversy, found any evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Trump\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d comment was an apparent reference to a bungled gunrunning operation conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that had sought to stanch the flow of smuggled weapons along the U.S.-Mexico border. President Obama later invoked executive privilege in order to withhold documents related to the operation, triggering a yearslong legal battle between the House and the Justice Department. The two sides finally reached a settlement earlier this year. Speaking to Hannity, Trump said that while Republicans hadn\u2019t impeached Obama during his time in office, Democrats \u2014 who Trump described as \u201cnot good politicians\u201d with \u201clousy policy\u201d \u2014 had discussed impeaching him \u201con Russia, on Mueller, all this stuff.\u201d \u201cAnd then they come up with this crazy concept of a perfect conversation,\u201d Trump continued, referring to his controversial July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to initiate an impeachment inquiry. Trump has faced allegations that he withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, his potential rival in 2020. Trump has repeatedly insisted there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d in his exchanges with Zelensky even as the White House has issued\u00a0conflicting messages on this topic. Though no official impeachment inquiry was ever launched against Obama, some Republicans did suggest during his presidential tenure that he was guilty of impeachable offences. In the wake of IRS controversy, former Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-Mich.) said in 2013 it \u201cwould be a dream come true\u201d to impeach Obama. That same year, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) said the House \u201ccould probably get the votes\u201d to impeach Obama over questions about the authenticity of his birth certificate, which the White House had made public in 2011. Farenthold resigned last year after\u00a0sexual misconduct allegations\u00a0were levelled against him. During his conversation with Hannity, Trump also touted a conspiracy theory involving\u00a0Hillary Clinton and Ukraine and railed against another favorite target of his, the \u201cfake news media.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even want [The New York Times] in the White House anymore. We\u2019re going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They\u2019re fake,\u201d he told Hannity, adding that he\u2019s received worse press than Abraham Lincoln.",

      "content": " A California campaign fundraiser and lobbyist who gave to President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration committee has been charged with failing to register as a foreign agent, evading taxes, and making nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions.\u00a0Imaad Shah Zuberi, 49,\u00a0agreed to plead guilty\u00a0to three counts, according to federal prosecutors. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles said that Zuberi convinced foreign nationals and governments that he had access to high-level officials in the U.S., in part by showing them photos of him with elected officials. While his lobbying efforts for his clients often failed, Zuberi got rich, prosecutors said. Among a range of misdeeds laid out by prosecutors, Zuberi, though his venture capital firm Avenue Ventures, allegedly lobbied members of Congress to place political pressure on Bahrain while failing to register that he was doing this for a citizen of Bahrain. He entered into a contract with Sri Lanka in an effort to rehabilitate that country\u2019s image in the United States but similarly failed to register his direction of that lobbying effort as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Zuberi also didn\u2019t report to the Internal Revenue Service more than $5 million in income that he allegedly diverted to himself under the Sri Lanka deal. His guilty pleas to FARA violations and tax evasion related to the Sri Lanka work. The Daily Beast reported\u00a0previously on Zuberi\u2019s connection to Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer now serving time in federal prison. Zuberi, the outlet reported, donated more than $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. The fundraiser had some prior experience with inaugurations.\u00a0The day after President Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration, prosecutors say, Zuberi falsely told three individuals that their photos with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had been placed on hold because they hadn\u2019t donated the proper amounts.\u00a0Court documents note that Zuberi had donated $257,500 to Obama\u2019s 2013 inaugural committee, but then pocketed refunds from the committee for $160,000 of that total. Zuberi agreed to plead guilty to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act in 2015 by, among other things, making contributions in other people\u2019s names. Read the criminal information below:",

      "subtitle": "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says more salaried workers deserve time-and-a-half pay when they work long hours.",
      "author": "Dave Jamieson",
      "content": " The state of Michigan plans to expand by a significant margin the number of workers who are eligible for overtime pay, following through on a landmark reform by former President Barack Obama that was stymied by Republicans and the courts. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced Thursday that she is directing the state\u2019s labor department to develop a new rule raising the overtime \u201cthreshold\u201d for salaried employees \u2015 the salary below which pretty much all workers are entitled to extra pay when they work long hours. \u201cThis is certainly something that\u2019s going to help people in the middle class,\u201d Whitmer told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s something that will help more people get into the middle class. It\u2019s an acknowledgment that these are hardworking people who are working more than 40 hours a week. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Under the current rules, salaried workers earning less than $23,660 have a clear right to time-and-a-half pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a week. Obama tried to roughly double that threshold to include millions more workers, but was blocked by a federal judge.\u00a0The Trump administration is moving forward with a watered-down version of the Obama rule, raising the level to $35,568 in January. But worker advocates say that new threshold is too low by historic norms, allowing employers to work employees into the ground without an overtime premium. Whitmer has not proposed a number yet, but under her direction the Michigan labor department would now begin figuring one out. Obama put forth a threshold that today would be roughly $51,000, a figure that will serve as a starting point for Michigan. Were Obama\u2019s proposal law instead of Trump\u2019s, Whitmer\u2019s office estimates that an additional 200,000 Michigan workers would be eligible for overtime pay. Whitmer said Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cisn\u2019t good enough.\u201d \u201cWe need to show leadership as governors and move forward,\u201d she said. What\u2019s happening in Michigan is another example of Democratic-led states making worker-friendly reforms and pushing back against the Trump agenda. Several other states with Democratic governors have made a similar push on overtime, with California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington all developing more generous salary thresholds. The federal rules would prevail in any state without their own. Qualifying more workers for overtime pay was one of the most ambitious economic efforts of the Obama era. Over the course of several decades, the share of salaried workers automatically eligible for time-and-a-half pay has fallen steadily, from around 60% in 1975 to just 7% in 2016, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. That drop is due to the rules not being updated to cover more workers. David Cooper, an economic analyst at EPI, called it \u201ca political no-brainer\u201d for states like Michigan to pursue their own thresholds. The benefits of such a reform, Cooper said, tend to hit middle-class workers \u2015 specifically, folks earning salaries in the low-to-mid five figures. He said states like Michigan that have higher costs of living relative to the South should try to hike their thresholds higher than Obama wanted to. \u201cI think every state that\u2019s willing to do something is going to help a lot of workers in those states,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWorkers are desperate for higher pay. This is an easy way for governments to raise pay for a substantial portion of the workforce.\u201d Michigan\u2019s labor department will develop a draft proposal for the rule and hold hearings with workers and employers to find a number \u201cthat\u2019s right for Michigan,\u201d Whitmer said.\u00a0She acknowledged that the final number could end up higher than what Obama proposed. Once a proposal has been developed, it could take up to a year before it goes into effect. Whitmer, now in her first term, defeated Republican Bill Schuette in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Republicans still control both chambers of the Michigan statehouse, but because the overtime reforms are done through the executive branch, Whitmer can pursue them without Republican support. The retail industry provides a stark example of what\u2019s at stake. Store managers who earn above the salary threshold can be required to work unlimited hours for just their base pay. Not having to pay overtime gives employers an incentive to pile work on managers, as opposed to hourly employees, who are eligible for time-and-a-half pay. As HuffPost has reported, many managers at dollar stores end up working 60- or 70-hour weeks for what ultimately equates to the minimum wage. Expanding the overtime rules leaves employers with a choice to make regarding newly covered workers: either keep their hours in check, or be ready to pay a premium when they go beyond 40. Republicans and employer lobbies have strongly opposed efforts to significantly expand overtime coverage. Business groups joined 21 states in suing to block the Obama reforms from going into effect. A federal judge in Texas ruled in 2016 that the Labor Department didn\u2019t have the authority to pursue the reforms, blocking them from going into effect. The Obama proposal ultimately died when a newly elected Trump declined to defend it in court. Trump\u2019s Labor Department still felt compelled to put forth some kind of overtime plan, probably because polling shows voters love the idea. In fact, nearly 4 in 10 respondents in a 2016 Morning Consult poll said Obama\u2019s plan should have been even more aggressive.",

Cummings and you know, this is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to introduce them as honorable.\u00a0But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There\u2019s a difference. There is a difference if you are honorable and treated others honorably outside the limelight.\u201d Obama was joined by other prominent politicians who delivered remarks at the funeral service, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. Cummings, who was the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died on Oct. 17 at age 68 \u201cdue to complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said. On Thursday, the representative, who was a son of sharecroppers, became the first Black elected official to lie in state in the Capitol, The New York Times reported. Elsewhere in his remarks on Friday, Obama said, \u201cas president, I knew I could always count on Elijah being honorable and doing the right thing.\u201d He later added, \u201cElijah Cummings was a man of noble and good heart.\u00a0His parents and his faith planted the seeds of hope, and love, and compassion, and righteousness in that good soil of his.\u201d \u201cHe has harvested all the crops that he could, for the Lord has now called Elijah home, to give his humble, faithful servant rest,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it now falls on us to continue his work, so that other young boys and girls in Baltimore, across Maryland, across the United States, and around the world might too have a chance to grow and to flourish. That\u2019s how we will honor him.\u201d Watch Obama\u2019s entire speech below:",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0once again defended his son, Hunter Biden, during an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, saying he didn\u2019t do a \u201csingle thing wrong\u201d and pledging that should he be elected none of his children would serve in his administration. \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ve never discussed my business or their business, I\u2019ve never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job.\u201d Biden made the comments to host Norah O\u2019Donnell, who asked about the ongoing House impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s behavior. The former vice president has been at the center of the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged demand for a quid pro quo from the leader of Ukraine. Critics have accused the president of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from the country unless it opened an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing, although they have been subject to false political ads claiming as much. Biden said Sunday once more that he hadn\u2019t discussed Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. But he said that should he be elected in 2020, none of his children would have an office in the White House or \u201csit in on Cabinet meetings.\u201d The comments directly targeted Trump\u2019s children, including Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who hold senior roles in the administration. \u201cTheir actions speak for themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat you should make it clear to the American public is the idea that everything you\u2019re doing is for them.\u201d The Trump campaign defended Ivanka Trump and Kushner last week after Biden\u2019s remarks were first made public, saying the pair were \u201cinstrumental\u201d in major administration decisions. Despite the unfolding scandal over Ukraine, Biden said he was still on top of the 2020 Democratic field, saying the country needed \u201csomebody who on day one knows exactly what to do, can command the world stage.\u201d \u201cNo one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues in foreign policy and domestic policy. They\u2019re things I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cI know I\u2019m the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable couple exceptions. This is a marathon.\u201d Biden also levied harsh criticism at Trump, calling the president an \u201cidiot\u201d for refusing to admit that the Russian government was attempting to, once again, influence American elections. \u201cEverybody knows this, nobody doubts it,\u201d Biden said. O\u2019Donnell noted that Biden\u2019s campaign had just under $9 million cash on hand while some of his rivals were sitting on much bigger war chests, including Sen. Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million). But the former veep said he wasn\u2019t troubled by those figures, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re on course to do extremely well. I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign.\u201d Biden also noted that he has asked former President Barack Obama not to endorse him in the 2020 presidential race, saying he wanted to win the Democratic nomination on his own merits. \u201cI want to earn this on my own,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI asked him not to, he said okay. I think it\u2019s better, I think he thinks it\u2019s better for me.\u201d He continued: \u201cI have no doubt that when I\u2019m the nominee he\u2019ll be out on the campaign trail for me.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The reality show president treats somber moments like cheap action movies.",
      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " President Barack Obama told the nation that the U.S. military had killed Osama bin Laden in\u00a0a somber address, invoking the memory of 9/11, unity and the nation\u2019s founding ideals. \u201cLet us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,\u201d said Obama, ending his speech on May 2, 2011. In contrast, President Donald Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi with a score-settling speech on Sunday morning, gloating and mocking the former ISIS leader. \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place,\u201d Trump said in his final line (also once again demonstrating that he knows nothing about dogs). Trump\u2019s giddiness at taking down \u201cbad guys\u201d stands in stark contrast to the tone taken by other presidents. A reality show leader who focuses on us vs. them, winning and losing, he has presented other key events in much the same way \u2015 no matter how tasteless it may seem to revel in death. Trump has fully bought into traditional displays of masculinity and machismo and consistently tried to compensate for the fact that he never served in the military and dodged service in Vietnam. He\u00a0surrounded himself with military generals\u00a0for a time, claimed that he would have been \u201ca good general\u201d and threw himself a giant military parade to demonstrate strength and might. On Sunday, Trump recounted watching the al-Baghdadi operation the previous day like it was a video game or a movie, talking about how the terrorist leader had been \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d \u201cI got to watch much of it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cNo personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed.\u201d So far, there is no evidence that al-Baghdadi was whimpering and crying. It\u2019s a cinematic detail that Trump seems to have made up. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was sitting next to the president as they watched the operation, told ABC News that he couldn\u2019t back up the president\u2019s description, although he said perhaps Trump\u00a0\u201chad the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.\u201d But there were reportedly no soldiers on the ground who followed al-Baghdadi into the final tunnel \u2015 just military dogs. Trump\u2019s love of violence came out Monday afternoon as well, during a speech in Chicago to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. He paid homage to the officers who took out a mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 4. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the scene. They showed four of them going down the street. There were six altogether. But it was on tape. And those guns \u2015 this is, \u2018Boom boom boom!\u2019 \u2015 and they were out there perfect,\u201d Trump said, using his hands to pretend he was shooting. The president also likes to dramatize the fate of undocumented immigrants, often referring to female trafficking victims who have their mouths taped up. \u201cHuman trafficking \u2014 grabbing women, in particular \u2014 and children, but women \u2014 taping them up, wrapping tape around their mouths so they can\u2019t shout or scream, tying up their hands behind their back and even their legs and putting them in a back seat of a car or a van \u2014 three, four, five, six, seven at a time,\u201d he said on Jan. 11. Trafficking experts say they haven\u2019t seen such taping and they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. But Trump seems fascinated with what happens to female victims. Beyond the gruesome rhetoric itself, there\u2019s the question of how effective Trump\u2019s comments are. They may spark some jingoistic fervor, but they could also potentially backfire internationally. \u201c[It] bothered me a little bit some of what the president did in providing detail about taking back to the United States pieces of Baghdadi\u2019s body,\u201d Mike Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, said on CBS Sunday. \u201cIt bothered me a little bit hearing the president talk about that some of that Syrian oil being ours, right. Because that\u2019s what inspires some extremists.\u201d",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Despite promising growth as high as 6%, President Donald Trump presided over an economy that grew at just 1.9% in the third quarter \u2014 a figure that Trump said signaled\u00a0an economy \u201cin deep trouble\u201d when it happened under his predecessor. The Commerce Department report released Wednesday was the second of the past four indicating a growth rate below 2%. That will likely result in an overall growth rate of under 2% for all of 2019, the year before Trump runs for reelection. As it stands, Trump\u2019s growth rate in 2019 has averaged 2.33%, which is slightly lower than former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2.37% average during the four years of his second term, according to a HuffPost analysis of Commerce Department data. \u201cThe king gets more naked every day,\u201d said Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois who is now running against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s sadly revealing that Donald Trump is now touting the same quarterly growth number he attacked our administration for experiencing during the recovery,\u201d said Andrew Bates, spokesman for the Democratic presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cDonald Trump, on the other hand, inherited a strong economy from us, the same way he\u2019s obtained everything in his life, and is now squandering it.\u201d The announcement of the slowing economy on Wednesday led the Federal Reserve Board to cut a key interest rate by another quarter percentage point, its third such reduction this year. While chairman Jerome Powell said the economy can continue to expand with low unemployment and low inflation, \u201cour views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.\u201d Most economists put much of the blame for the slowdown on Trump\u2019s trade war with the rest of the world, which has increased costs to American consumers, who have paid billions of dollars in import taxes, while reducing U.S. exports to other nations because of retaliatory tariffs. American manufacturers and farmers have been particularly hard hit. White House spokesman Judd Deere, though, stuck to Trump\u2019s pattern of blaming Powell and the Federal Reserve Board. \u201cDespite seven interest rate increases since President Trump took office and a global recession, this president\u2019s policies of lower taxes, deregulation, and fair and reciprocal trade have supported the longest economic recovery in U.S. history with record low unemployment and rising wages,\u201d Deere said. But for a president who has been counting on a strong economy to overcome his personal unpopularity with wide swaths of the electorate, the numbers beneath Wednesday\u2019s top-line summary are even more ominous. Business investment, an indicator of how those closest to hiring and purchasing are feeling about the future, was down for the second straight quarter: 3% less in the July through September period than April through June, which itself saw a 1% reduction compared to January through March. \u201cNo matter how you calculate, it\u2019s definitely a slowdown,\u201d said Ben Herzon, director of U.S. economics at IHS Markit. He said while the 1.9% growth figure was slightly higher than expected, he believes some of the underlying factors that caused that bump last quarter \u2014 higher than expected federal government spending and businesses increasing inventory \u2014 will fall and therefore reduce growth in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe lowered our forecast of fourth-quarter GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7% based on these developments,\u201d he said. Trump did not speak to the news media on Wednesday, but did proclaim, via Twitter, \u201cThe Greatest Economy in American History!\u201d\u00a0about an hour before the public release of the gross domestic product numbers. That assertion is not true. There have been multiple periods of time when the economy grew faster: during the terms of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, as well as after World War II. Reagan saw an average growth rate of 3.5% over his two terms, while Clinton had 3.9%. The eight years spanning the terms of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s had an average GDP growth rate of 4.95%. George W. Bush had an average growth rate of 2.5% in his first term, but only 1.3% his second term, after the economy collapsed into a deep recession that lasted through Obama\u2019s first year in office. Unlike Obama, Trump began with a relatively strong economy, notwithstanding his frequent but unfounded statements that it was \u201cheaded the wrong way\u201d and about to collapse. Trump\u2019s first year in office saw an average growth rate of 2.8%. That fell to 2.5% in 2018, despite a large tax cut that left corporations flush with cash. Over the past four quarters, the rate has been an average of just 2.03%. Those figures are in stark contrast to what Trump promised, both as a candidate and then as the sitting president. \u201cWe will have in my opinion a minimum 4% growth,\u201d Trump told Fox News in October 2015. \u201cAnd I think we could even have a 6% growth.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a tremendous GDP. It\u2019s going to be maybe 4% and it could even be higher than that,\u201d he told an Ohio television station a year later. And Trump returned to the 6% claim in December 2017, during a Cabinet meeting. \u201cThis is far beyond what anybody thought it would be at,\u201d he said about recently released figures that showed a 3.2% quarterly growth rate. \u201cI see no reason why we don\u2019t go to 4, 5 and even 6%.\u201d Jared Bernstein, once the top economist for Biden, said the 6% boast was never remotely possible. \u201cThat was meaningless, Trumpian nonsense. More germane is his administration\u2019s official economic projections of 3% real GDP growth as far as the eye can see,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThat was also unfounded, as it was partly based on fantasies of their tax cuts stimulating investment. In other words, trickle-down fairy dust that once again has failed to deliver.\u201d",

      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The leading Democrats vying for their party\u2019s presidential nomination clashed over the critical issue of health care while offering starkly contrasting visions for the nation\u2019s ideological direction before thousands of cheering Iowa activists at a raucous event kicking off the three-month sprint to the first-in-the-nation caucuses. Former Vice President Joe Biden opened the state Democratic Party\u2019s marquee annual fundraiser, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, by swiping at the candidate who has largely caught him atop the Democratic primary polls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledged generational change, trying to take up the mantle of another young, upstart candidate, Barack Obama, who pulled off a 2008 upset in Iowa on his way to the presidency. The jabs were relatively gentle but previewed arguments that are likely to increasingly dominate the race. Biden said he would overhaul health care nationwide without \u201cincreases in taxes for the middle class. None. None. None.\u201d While not mentioning Warren by name, his pronouncement came hours after she unveiled a much-anticipated proposal to spend $20-plus trillion over the next decade on a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d universal health care plan that she vowed wouldn\u2019t require a middle-class tax increase. Biden\u2019s campaign had already panned that as requiring \u201cmathematic gymnastics\u201d to cover its huge costs. The former vice president has promised not to \u201cabandon\u201d Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The issue has created a stark policy divide between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom back Medicare for All, and more moderate candidates like Biden and Buttigieg, who say the country isn\u2019t ready to do away with private insurance. Biden also called for party unity and tried to cast himself as immediately able to rise to international challenges: \u201cThe next president is going to be commander in chief of a world in disarray. There\u2019s going to be no time for on-the-job training.\u201d Taking the stage a short time later, Warren made an unwavering appeal for sweeping change, saying, \u201cIf the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then we will lose.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on a big idea, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by that big idea,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory.\u201d In all, more than a dozen presidential candidates addressed 13,000-plus Democratic activists, party volunteers and campaign supporters at a basketball arena in downtown Des Moines. The event amounts to the largest gathering of Democrats in an early voting state \u2014 and was something of a dress rehearsal for the Feb. 3 caucuses. Candidates must now move beyond simply introducing themselves to voters and activists and focus on perfecting a grassroots strategy to ensure they mobilize strong support. For White House hopefuls in the top tier, the event was a key test of momentum, while lagging contenders will face further questions about why they\u2019re staying in the race. That was on full display even before Friday\u2019s festivities began, with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke abruptly announcing he was abandoning his campaign. Like Biden, Buttigieg didn\u2019t mention Warren by name but said he supported \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d and promised to honor the decisions of those who aren\u2019t willing to sign up for fully government-sponsored health care. The 37-year-old also offered a veiled swipe at Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 by chiding candidates for being content to \u201cwait for action.\u201d \u201cI am running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us to real action to do right by Americans who have waited far too long,\u201d Buttigieg said. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Friday found Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden bunched together at the top of the field in Iowa, though Biden and Warren have generally been co-front-runners elsewhere. Sanders struck his familiar, defiant tone Friday night, telling the crowd, \u201cWe will pass, whether the insurance companies like it or not, Medicare for All.\u201d The event really started hours before the formal program. The damp, chilly streets outside the arena buzzed all afternoon with campaigns hoping to exhibit strong organization and enthusiasm. Supporters and campaign volunteers waved signs at busy street corners and congregated in chanting droves. Sanders led a pre-event march that his campaign said drew 1,500 people. Warren supporters erected a giant likeness of Bailey, the senator\u2019s golden retriever. Inside the arena, Biden bought tickets for members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed him, while Buttigieg had the largest presence, snapping up thousands of seats for supporters that included an overflow room. Candidates who have traditionally wowed at the gathering have seen it pay big dividends. In 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore effectively blocked former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley\u2019s advance with the chant during his speech \u201cStay and fight,\u201d a nudge at Bradley for leaving the Senate. Four years later, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used it to hold off a dire challenge from Howard Dean. \u201cWe need answers, not just anger,\u201d Kerry said in a hit at the anti-war Vermont governor who had stirred passions on the left but worried others for challenging President George W. Bush during wartime. \u201cIowa, don\u2019t just send them a message. Send them a president.\u201d More recently, Obama, then an Illinois senator, threw down the gauntlet against national Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in 2007, declaring, \u201cTriangulating and poll-driven positions, because we\u2019re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us, just won\u2019t do.\u201d",

      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren threw Larry Summers out of the Democratic Party establishment six years ago. He hasn\u2019t forgotten. It was 2013, and President Barack Obama had nominated Summers to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. For the controversial economist, then 58 years old, the job would have been the capstone to a remarkable political comeback. Seven years earlier, he\u2019d been forced out as president of Harvard for giving a speech arguing that women were genetically predisposed to mediocrity in the sciences. Shortly after, his reputation as a financial genius was sullied by the 2008 banking crisis. But Summers\u2019 work putting together the 2009 economic stimulus package had thrilled Obama, who believed he was ready to assume the most powerful position in the global economy. Progressive activists were furious with the nomination. The National Organization for Women and other feminist groups launched a public relations campaign against Summers. And a freshman senator from Massachusetts began piecing together opposition on the Senate Banking Committee, which would have to approve Summers\u2019 appointment prior to a full Senate confirmation vote. The reaction stunned Obama. In a private meeting of Capitol Hill Democrats, he told lawmakers that an unreasonable left wing was making Summers into a \u201cwhipping boy.\u201d After\u00a0months of bitter conflict, four Senate Democrats joined Warren in opposition to Summers, leaving him one vote short on the committee. He withdrew his name from consideration and retreated to the op-ed pages, where he remains a popular figure among the dying breed of very wealthy Democrats. But the 2020 presidential primary has given Summers an opportunity to audition for relevance at the top of the Democratic Party once again. And he\u2019s made his case by reopening his feud with Warren. For most of the past year, Summers has been the antagonist-in-chief against one of Warren\u2019s signature Big Ideas \u2015 her call for a 2% wealth tax on fortunes larger than $50 million. Through op-eds, CNBC interviews, conference appearances and Twitter screeds, Summers has mustered every bit of ridicule he can for the wealth tax and the economic experts the senator has relied on to develop it. He\u2019s bad-mouthed the underlying data on wealth inequality, emphasized the sophistication with which the rich avoid paying taxes, and declared the entire project a hopeless political dead end. Speaking to an audience at the Peterson Institute for International Economics last week, Summers was frank about his overarching rationale: \u201cI do not think a focus on wealth inequality as a basis for being concerned about a more just society is terribly well-designed. ... I don\u2019t think wealth is a particularly sensible way for judging or assigning taxes.\u201d So far, the public doesn\u2019t seem to be buying what Summers is selling. According to a New York Times poll from July, 66% of American adults support Warren\u2019s wealth tax, up from 61% in February. Even most millionaires support the idea, according to one CNBC survey. The fight over the wealth tax is much more than an academic dispute over deficit projections and growth estimates. It\u2019s the latest round in an ongoing power struggle at the highest echelons of the Democratic party about how Democrats understand justice itself \u2015 and whether economic inequality really matters. It is an ideological battle in which Summers and Warren have long been the most important players \u2015 first as intellectuals engaged in academic research, and later as powerful figures in Washington. It\u2019s a contest not only over who will control the Democratic Party for the next few years, but what it means to be a Democrat. Though Warren has rolled out at least half a dozen ambitious plans to reshape the American economy \u2015 universal childcare, student debt cancellation, worker representation on corporate boards and more \u2015 the wealth tax is the intellectual keystone in her policy arch. Warren knows it; she even dressed up her dog Bailey as \u201c2 cents\u201d for Halloween \u2015 the amount her wealth tax would take from every dollar over $50 million stashed away in personal fortunes. The wealth tax isn\u2019t just about raising money. It\u2019s the policy that connects Warren\u2019s 21st century agenda to what she likes about America\u2019s 20th century inheritance. In Warren\u2019s telling, the Democratic Party cracked the code for shared prosperity in the 1930s with three basic principles: accountability for powerful corporate interests, high taxes on the rich, and major investments in what we now call public goods \u2015 education, the environment, scientific research and infrastructure. \u201cIt worked for half a century,\u201d Warren told an audience in 2014. \u201cYou take a look at the numbers, and GDP just keeps going up year over year over year. But here\u2019s the key. At the same time, median family income \u2015 that family right in the middle \u2014 income just kept going up the same. In other words, as our country got richer, our families got richer. And as our families got richer, our country got richer.\u201d But starting in the 1980s, everything changed. The government deregulated Wall Street, cut taxes on the rich and retreated from public investments, making way for the magic of financial markets. The results for the economy as a whole were uneven \u2015 the heady Bill Clinton boom years were followed by the destruction of the 2008 financial crisis. But through it all, most families were on a steady downward trajectory. For everyone outside of the top 10% of incomes, real wages actually declined between 1980 and 2016. \u201cWe tried it for 30 years, and it didn\u2019t work. In fact, the consequences were nearly catastrophic,\u201d Warren said. Warren has been drilling her history lesson into Democratic audiences for a decade. In 2015, she started supplementing her narrative with data demonstrating that much of this shared postwar prosperity was systematically denied to Black Americans. Though the incomes of the typical Black family increased from the 1940s to the 1970s, they were substantially lower than the incomes for the typical white family, and the gap between black and white families only began to narrow in the 1960s.\u00a0When income inequality began to diverge once again in the 1980s, the racial wealth gap exploded \u2015 tripling between 1984 and 2009. The key for reviving the ideas of the New Deal and the Great Society, Warren suggests, is to ensure that everyone will actually be included in the 21st century revival. The wealth tax is essential to that vision. As designed by economists Emanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealth tax is not merely intended to raise revenue \u2015 it\u2019s a direct attack on the fortunes of the super-rich. Where most economists and politicians have focused on levying taxes to maximize the amount of money governments can put to use on social projects, Saez and Zucman are forthright about using the tax code to reduce both the size of major personal fortunes and the political influence of the super-rich. Easing inequality through the tax code is a social priority in its own right. What governments actually do with the money is up to them; Saez and Zucman want to use the taxes to take the rich down a peg. \u201cAn extreme concentration of wealth means an extreme concentration of power,\u201d\u00a0they write in their new book \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice.\u201d \u201cThe power to influence government policy. The power to stifle competition. The power to shape ideology.\u201d Advocates of a carbon tax, they note, do not seek merely to raise revenue, but to reduce carbon emissions. The same goes for high taxes on the rich. \u201cThey are not aimed at funding government programs in the long run ... Quasi-confiscatory tax rates redistribute economic power.\u201d Enormous disparities of wealth \u2014 whatever their effect on growth, productivity or innovation \u2014 are inherently anti-democratic and harmful to the social fabric. Warren often downplays the radicalism of her proposal \u2015 it\u2019s just 2 cents! \u2015 as she emphasizes its historical antecedents. But while Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to establish a maximum income by taxing the highest annual earners at rates of over 90%, this wealth tax is really something new. The United States has a lot of taxes that hit rich people as they increase their fortunes. There\u2019s a progressive income tax, an estate tax on inheritances, the capital gains tax on financial investments, and corporate taxes, which disproportionately hit the wealthy. But America has never gone straight to the source and taxed wealth itself \u2015 the total fortune squirreled away in bank accounts and investment vehicles. If either Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has rolled out a similar proposal, can make it happen, adding wealth to the list of taxable items could prove as socially transformative as the introduction of the income tax in 1913. For Summers, Warren\u2019s historical narrative is intensely personal. Though she typically blames Republicans for the era of \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d the governing disaster was bipartisan. Summers\u2019 uncle, Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson, advised the Kennedy administration to move away from FDR\u2019s 90% tax rates in the 1960s. From the mid-1980s onward, the dominant economic policy voice in the Democratic Party belonged to Summers. Nobody disputes the force of Summers\u2019 intellect. By the time he entered the Clinton administration in 1993, Summers had already authored over 100 peer-reviewed papers \u2015 an extraordinary figure for an economist of any age, much less for a man who was then under the age of 40. A typical Summers paper was concerned with a Big Idea, and his early research reshaped the way economists understood unemployment, corporate investment and the stock market, just to name three. Where economists had generally believed the unemployed to be between jobs for a few weeks at a time, Summers discovered that an enormous proportion of people looking for a job had been searching for years \u2015 people stuck in a long-term, life-altering rut. Where economists believed that the economy carried a fundamental, healthy \u201cnatural\u201d load of unemployed people, Summers published research detonating the empirical case for any natural level of unemployment whatsoever. Summers imagined himself to be making progressive breakthroughs. There were, according to his work, far more people being left behind by the economy than policymakers had realized. And there was paltry evidence that the economy as a whole operated according to the logic of business cycles independent of government policy. The length and depth of recessions \u2015 even their very existence \u2015 were things that public officials could ameliorate. Things would not automatically get better on their own. The government had a responsibility to act. But Summers also shared a host of basic assumptions with conservative ideologues. He believed sophisticated financial markets could reliably direct the world\u2019s resources where they were needed most. And he believed that poverty and inequality were very different problems. Often, Summers concluded, the public as a whole was made better off by policy changes and business innovations that left small numbers of people reaping enormous rewards. And so throughout the Clinton administration, Summers supported financial deregulation in the name of progress. Policy changes that allowed private financial barons to generate greater wealth were good. Growing the pie created a bigger body of economic activity that could be taxed to fund social safety net programs. Well-designed taxes were intended to maximize the money available for government programs while incentivizing socially productive business innovation. Their effect on inequality \u2015 something better addressed through anti-poverty programs, if at all \u2014\u00a0was an afterthought. To Summers, there was no need to worry about financial institutions abusing the privileges they received from deregulation. Testifying before Congress in 1998 on the need to deregulate derivatives, Summers maintained: \u201cThe parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves.\u201d It seems almost laughable from this side of the AIG collapse, but at the time, most members of Congress were eager to agree with Summers. But not everyone. And certainly not everyone in academia. Some of the most important economic research from the 1980s and 1990s was taking place not in economics departments, but in law schools \u2015 specifically, the law schools where Elizabeth Warren was working. Combing through decades of consumer bankruptcy filings, Warren discovered something that surprised her. Most people who filed for bankruptcy weren\u2019t just thoughtless spendthrifts who had over-consumed their way into disaster. The vast majority were flipped from financial stability into economic ruin by a single personal tragedy \u2015 a divorce, a massive medical bill, a job loss. These were problems that financial markets were not good at resolving. You couldn\u2019t expect young couples to buy divorce insurance. There was no derivative that a household could buy to protect itself from the local factory moving to Mexico. People would find themselves short of cash, and they would be vulnerable. When they got desperate, they\u2019d turn to bottom-feeders like payday lenders to pay the bills. But these operators would only aggravate their problems, and short-term cash wouldn\u2019t help anybody find a job or eliminate their medical debt. Warren quickly realized that the shortcomings of financial markets weren\u2019t limited to consumer finance. If the existence of payday lenders didn\u2019t address the core source of trouble for American families, why should multi-trillion-dollar corporate debt markets be a panacea for American business? To this day, Warren insists that she believes in markets as a vehicle for prosperity. But what she means by \u201cmarkets\u201d is very different from what Summers means. For Warren, a \u201cmarket\u201d is something governments define and police, with clear rules of fair play and social benefits that can be measured. If those benefits fail to materialize, the government has a responsibility to restructure the market. For Summers, markets are just what happens between consenting corporations when government is absent. This was the heart of Warren\u2019s opposition to his appointment in 2013. To Warren, Summers\u2019 record of advocacy for Wall Street \u2015 never mind the millions he made working for the hedge fund D.E. Shaw during the George W. Bush presidency \u2015 made him unfit to helm the Fed, the most important financial regulator on the planet. The dispute between Warren and Summers that cost him the Fed job was, in comparison to the wealth tax, a minor affair. They disagreed about the need to regulate financial markets and big Wall Street players. Warren was able to rally even corporate-friendly Democrats Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) to her cause on that question. What\u2019s happening with the wealth tax in 2019 is more fundamental. Summers disputes the basic moral, political and economic cases for targeting wealth inequality as a social problem. Protect the poor, fine. But don\u2019t tell Summers that the existence of big fortunes is a big problem. At the Peterson Institute forum last month,\u00a0Summers assailed the idea\u00a0of discouraging billionaires from \u201cinvesting the money in the ways they think are most productive.\u201d They were, after all, \u201csmart enough to accumulate it in the first place.\u201d What\u2019s more, Summers insists, a wealth tax makes billionaires more likely to spend their money on faux-charitable contributions \u2015 nonprofits like right-wing think tanks and conservative magazines that regular folks would recognize as essentially political expenditures. These contributions escape the wealth tax and further entrench the political and social power of the super-rich. There are two basic problems with Summers\u2019 reasoning here. He isn\u2019t really arguing against a wealth tax per se \u2014 he\u2019s arguing against any tax that hits the wealthy at all. Progressive income taxes, capital gains taxes and estate taxes succumb to the same logic. The rich would just divert their income to socially destructive forms of spending to get more bang for their buck. But Summers is not arguing that the United States should give up on other forms of taxation. In fact, he\u2019s claiming we should double-down on them. He believes the better and \u201cmore progressive\u201d alternative to the wealth tax is a higher tax on capital gains, and particularly inheritances. There is no justification, he says, for the super-rich passing down their wealth to their children, who do not automatically inherit their parents\u2019 business acumen. But the estate tax in particular seems more easily gamed than the wealth tax. Why would enormously rich families go to endless creative lengths to avoid a modest annual wealth levy but just shrug their shoulders at a massive, one-time estate tax? They wouldn\u2019t. Saez and Zucman aren\u2019t naive. They know that previous efforts to establish a wealth tax in Europe have mostly failed. But they\u2019ve studied those policies and think they understand why they fell apart. Most wealth taxes kicked in too low, they argue. By taxing people with about $1 million in wealth instead of people with much higher levels, those wealth taxes generated opposition among people who were doing just fine, but who weren\u2019t really rich. If you\u2019ve been paying a mortgage in an expensive neighborhood for a long time, it\u2019s not hard to rack up $1 million in assets. This created a common political bond between the super-rich and the much more numerous upper-middle class, which joined forces to get wealth taxes repealed. The other problem is basic enforcement. Countries in the European Union who tried a wealth tax were simultaneously allowing Swiss banks to help rich people shield income and assets from tax authorities. If you actually police international bank accounts, as the United States has done since 2010, you might get better results. And indeed, if the super-rich were confident they could get around a wealth tax without too much trouble, they\u2019d have no reason to make a fuss about Warren\u2019s proposal. And yet everywhere you look, there\u2019s a billionaire furious about it (see: Michael Bloomberg, Leon Cooperman, Howard Schultz, Steven Schwarzman). Ultimately, the same question applies to Summers himself. If you really want to pursue a more progressive tax code, why strangle a new type of tax in the crib? Maybe it would work, maybe it would need to be tweaked, maybe it would need to be supplemented by other progressive taxes. The original income tax of 1913 was just 1% and applied to only the top 3% of households. Does Summers really think the next Democratic president would be better off with fewer tools to deploy against the super-rich at his or her disposal? But Summers isn\u2019t really arguing over money or numbers or even the future. He\u2019s arguing about the past, seeking the perfect dataset that will show he was right all along, that he and the Democratic Party didn\u2019t squander decades of progress by forging an alliance with the super-rich.",

      "content": " SOMEWHERE ON U.S. ROUTE 18 BETWEEN CHARLES CITY AND MASON CITY, Iowa \u2015 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg would not commit to rethinking the way the federal government prosecutes people who disclose classified information, instead distinguishing between politically motivated leaks during the Obama administration and the federal official who has sought formal \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protections to raise the alarm about President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct. At two campaign town halls in Iowa on Sunday, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor singled out the federal official who has come forward as a whistleblower to report on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, in which Trump appeared to suggest that U.S. security aid was contingent on Ukraine\u2019s investigation of the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Speaking at a high school in the northeast Iowa town of Waverly, Buttigieg said: \u201cWhen somebody blows the whistle on official misconduct, that is an act of loyalty to the republic for which it stands.\u201d During a discussion aboard his campaign bus as it headed to a town hall in Mason City, Iowa, later in the day, HuffPost asked whether, given Buttigieg\u2019s sympathy for the whistleblower at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry, he would still pursue criminal charges against politically motivated leakers of the kind prosecuted by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice drew condemnation from civil libertarians for aggressively pressing criminal charges against eight people accused of leaking classified information to the media. \u201cNot everybody who discloses classified information is a whistleblower,\u201d replied Buttigieg, whose service as a U.S. Navy Intelligence reservist included a stint in Afghanistan. \u201cOne thing I was very much aware of when I was responsible for handling classified information would be the consequences of, especially willfully, mishandling or divulging.\u201d Instead, Buttigieg said he supports strengthening the channels through which national security and other federal officials can report and expose what they believe is misconduct, as well as the legal protections for those individuals once they have submitted their reports. \u201cOne of the things I think we\u2019ve learned is the importance of having a whistleblower function, so that if somebody sees wrongdoing, there is a way to have an accountability for that that doesn\u2019t leave somebody a choice between committing a national security violation by divulging classified information, or being silent about abuses,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the right framework to move forward in \u2015 not one where we\u2019re just deciding on a case-by-case basis, based on public opinion, what abuses of classified information we\u2019re going to tolerate.\u201d HuffPost followed up to ask Buttigieg\u2019s opinion on the case of Edward Snowden, the most famous Obama-era leaker. Snowden, a former analyst for the National Security Agency, shared with journalists a trove of classified documents in June 2013 that, among other things, revealed that the NSA was collecting the phone records of millions of Americans. He successfully sought asylum in Russia to avoid U.S. prosecution under the Espionage Act, a World War I-era law that the Obama administration revived to stamp out leaks, and which limits the tools with which people who are charged can defend themselves. Buttigieg replied that Snowden\u2019s conduct was \u201cproblematic, but also something that if we had a better framework and as we are moving toward with the whistleblower function would not create that same kind of problem, because to the extent that there was activity that was contrary to law or contrary to policy, there was no way to raise that besides just sending classified information out into the world.\u201d Asked by a Fox News reporter whether he would consider cutting a deal with Snowden to get him to return to the United States in exchange for some time of prosecutorial leniency, Buttigieg did not answer directly. \u201cThat\u2019s for the Department of Justice to evaluate whether there are convincing grounds for any kind of exceptions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, there\u2019s got to be a better way than just broadcasting highly classified information and putting lives at risk.\u201d Instead of leaks, he added, \u201cwhistleblower systems and laws \u2015 and, by the way, vigorous [inspector general] systems\u201d are the appropriate channels for reporting abuses. (The Ukraine whistleblower reported his concerns to the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community.) Few of Buttigieg\u2019s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have diverged from the consensus view of the U.S. national security establishment that unauthorized leakers who decline to take advantage of official whistleblower protections should be prosecuted. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has called for the federal government to grant Snowden clemency, saying the former NSA analyst \u201cdid this country a great service.\u201d In an October interview with The Intercept, Sanders also vowed not to prosecute any leakers under the Espionage Act. In a follow-up interview on Monday, Buttigieg declined to rule out prosecuting leakers under the Espionage Act specifically. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can prejudge a future scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also again, the less prosecution has to do with anything that an elected official would like in the Oval Office, is going to be better.\u201d The story has been updated with further comment from Buttigieg.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying world on Wednesday, criticizing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being too aggressive and unwilling to give Republicans a chance. \u201cWith Donald Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to see a number of my Republican colleagues have an epiphany. Mark my words. Mark my words,\u201d Biden said. On the same day Biden made his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was just a few blocks away at the White House, boasting about how he blocked Merrick Garland from getting a seat on the Supreme Court. Garland, of course, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away. McConnell successfully blocked Garland from even getting a hearing \u2015 all long before Trump came into office. Biden spoke at Sidley Austin, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful law firms literally located on K Street (which has long been shorthand for Washington lobbying). Sidley Austin also has a lobbying practice. Biden, like the rest of the major 2020 Democratic candidates, is not taking money from federal lobbyists. Biden has been going after Warren in recent days after she said he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Her comments came in response to\u00a0Biden\u2019s criticism of how she will pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Biden said the next president is going to inherit a \u201cdivided nation,\u201d and he made the case that he, and not someone like Warren, can make it better. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take two things: One is somebody who in fact, knows how to reach across the aisle and get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the people that are running against me tell me I\u2019m na\u00efve, one said I should be in the Republican primary, God love her. That\u2019s not the way you get things done, man. You don\u2019t go in and tell people that they disagree there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with them.\u201d The attendees applauded at Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden has made these \u201cepiphany\u201d comments before. \u2033[T]he thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,\u201d he said in May. \u201cYou will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d This belief is central to Biden\u2019s pitch: Trump is so bad, and Biden is so good at working across the aisle that bipartisan comity will just suddenly break out if he\u2019s elected. Even in the Obama years, Biden was hopeful that Republicans would finally come around.\u00a0In November 2012, he predicted that if Obama won a decisive reelection, he could get Republicans to work alongside the administration and that people would see the \u201cfever break.\u201d Republicans showed little willingness to work with Obama after his reelection. On clean energy, Republicans used a failed green energy startup, Solyndra, to question all of the administration\u2019s energy initiatives and cast the president as corrupt. And Republican senators blocked Garland in 2016. Biden recently said he was open to a super PAC backing him. Those entities can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors. Many of Biden\u2019s opponents have shunned super PACs this cycle, and two of his progressive competitors \u2015 Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 also don\u2019t do high-dollar fundraisers.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " DECORAH, Iowa \u2015 When Pete Buttigieg begins his stump speeches to the throngs of voters who gather to hear him at town halls across Iowa, he doesn\u2019t start with his plan for a particular policy or elucidate a specific critique of President Donald Trump. Instead, with a pastoral touch drawn from his liberal Episcopalian faith, the 37-year-old Democratic presidential contender, who\u2019s also the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asks his audience to imagine the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cI want to ask you to really visualize the first day when the sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told a flock of about 1,000 voters on Saturday night in the college town of Decorah, about 15 miles south of the Minnesota border. Unlike rivals to his left, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg does not ask voters to recognize the supremacy of corporate power and political corruption as much as he wants them to confront the difficulty of healing a country polarized along partisan lines. Uniting the country, he argues, is a prerequisite to expanding health care coverage, tackling climate change, boosting wages and narrowing the racial wealth gap. But for such a monumental challenge, the request Buttigieg issues to his audience is relatively modest. He wants people to summon the patience and courage that they bring to discussions with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table. The day after the election, he wants them to call their friends and relatives who voted for a different presidential candidate and discuss something non-political. And most of all, he wants them to put their trust in him as the person most capable of leading Americans toward these solutions while easing the rancor of the current political moment. \u201cI believe that the right president, the president that I seek to be, can gather together an American majority to get these things done,\u201d he said in Decorah on Saturday. \u201cThe good news is the American people are ready \u2015 you can feel it. Not everybody. But most of us are ready for solutions to these problems.\u201d If the pitch sounds familiar, that\u2019s because like virtually every element of the latest iteration of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s designed to emulate the rhetoric, tactics and spirit of former President Barack Obama. During Obama\u2019s first run, he paired a progressive policy platform with soaring descriptions of the United States\u2019 common fabric and appeals to overcome the partisan divisions that separated \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states.\u201d He preached an optimistic faith in the power of the country to renew itself that was just vague enough for moderates and progressives alike to see their values in his platform. And he too was a young, relative political newcomer and would-be barrier-breaking minority, who took his articulate stump speech to the rural-most corners of the first-in-the-nation caucus state. (Where Obama was the country\u2019s first Black president, Buttigieg would be the country\u2019s first openly gay president.) Where Obama preached \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d Buttigieg is calling for \u201chope\u201d and \u201cbelonging.\u201d Where Obama joked about an end to \u201cScooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence and Karl Rove politics,\u201d Buttigieg relishes an \u201cend to this chaos and corruption and the tweets.\u201d In his barnburner speech at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s massive Liberty and Justice rally and dinner in the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday night, Buttigieg made the comparison explicit to an audience of 13,000, at least a few thousand of whom were his most dedicated supporters. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock doors for a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said, referencing Obama. \u201cAnd we knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d he continued, prompting roars of approval from his blue-and-yellow-clad fans. But the differences between Buttigieg and Obama are just as obvious. Buttigieg has only served as mayor of a city of just over 100,000 people, and he lost both times he sought higher office. (He ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017). And though over one-quarter of the population of South Bend is Black, Buttigieg\u2019s tenure has been rocked by\u00a0race-related scandals, including the July police killing of a Black man accused of trying to steal cars, which sparked heated protests. His support among non-white Democratic primary voters is in the low single digits, according to public polls. He\u2019s also more popular with older voters, despite being the only candidate who is a millennial. Obama, of course, had a strong base of young people who fueled the excitement and energy of his run. What\u2019s more, while Obama courted voters on the activist left, Buttigieg has by turns confused them and spurned them outright.\u00a0Early on, he called for the aggressive measure of adding more justices to the Supreme Court, but more recently, he said that his vision of an expanded bench would encourage the confirmation of \u201cswing\u201d justices like Anthony Kennedy or David Souter \u2015 two men who were chosen by Republican presidents. The comments were widely interpreted as endorsements of Kennedy and Souter, though that did not appear to be his intention. He\u2019s also been especially hard on Warren and Sanders\u00a0for backing a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan that would effectively end the vast majority of private health care coverage. In September and October when Warren declined to say how she would finance Medicare for All \u2014 and whether it would require tax increases \u2014 Buttigieg effectively called her a hypocrite. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d he said in a CNN interview in September.\u00a0(Warren subsequently released a detailed financing plan that did not raise middle-class taxes.) When HuffPost asked him in Iowa last weekend whether his pugnacious rhetoric marked a break with his previous comments, Buttigieg insisted that he has been consistent. \u201cI continue to believe that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what. I think I\u2019ll be better at fending that off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I hold my views on health care policy is because I think it\u2019s the right answer.\u201d In another discussion with reporters in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg also reiterated that his comments about Kennedy and Souter were in reference to a hypothetical scenario in which the Supreme Court is expanded.\u00a0He believes that a larger court could be capable of accommodating swing justices and could transcend the \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d of the present bench. \u201cI was not saying that in the current Supreme Court structure, I would appoint people with the judicial philosophy like Kennedy or Souter,\u201d he said. \u201cA better example would probably be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of a justice whose judicial philosophy largely matches my own.\u201d Notwithstanding Buttigieg\u2019s glaring differences with Obama, he is trying to cultivate the kinds of voters who remain enamored of the former president\u2019s eloquence and sunny disposition. Call it the \u201cWest Wing\u201d lane. He is the kind of candidate that Democrats of varied ideological leanings can see as the personification of their ideal of politics \u2015 a place where intelligence, uplifting rhetoric and an inspiring personal story are enough to vanquish the demons of division that plague the country. Many attendees of Buttigieg\u2019s town halls volunteered comparisons to Obama unprompted, while some cited other iconic Democratic presidents. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of his charisma,\u201d said Barb Neal, a retired banker from Mount Vernon, who attended the Decorah town hall, by way of explaining the Obama comparison. \u201cHe just gives me hope. He\u2019s so positive. So many of them are so negative \u2015 just bashing the other side, and he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Mary Thomsen, Neal\u2019s sister, who still works as a banker, chimed into agree. \u201cHe reminds me of Obama. For some reason he also reminds me of John F. Kennedy,\u201d she said. Of course, former Vice President Joe Biden has, more than any other candidate, sought to capitalize on his direct ties to Obama. He frequently references \u201cmy friend Barack\u201d in his stump speeches. And his strong support among Black voters in the early primary state of South Carolina is widely attributed to positive memories of his partnership with the country\u2019s first Black president. In trying to channel Obama \u2014 rather than generate good will by association with him \u2014 Buttigieg appears to be having success with many of the Iowa voters who are looking for a more moderate contender, but may be underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s performance on the trail. Buttigieg trounced the former vice president in third quarter fundraising (though the mayor\u2019s haul still fell short of Warren and Sanders\u2019 totals). And he has been rising in Iowa\u2019s polls even as Biden has continued to drop. Several Iowa Democrats at Buttigieg\u2019s events in small towns across the northern part of the state over the weekend described concerns about either the effect of Biden\u2019s age on his public speaking abilities, or the negative publicity surrounding his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine. Laura Swalve, a former school psychologist from Swea City who came to see Buttigieg at the VFW hall in Algona on Monday, described herself as a \u201cfan\u201d of Biden\u2019s. But while clarifying that she does not think he is senile, Swalve worries that he\u2019s \u201cjust not as quick\u201d as he used to be. \u201cI honestly think his age sometimes comes through, like in the debates, when he kind of didn\u2019t know how to say things,\u201d she said. For Bill Paup, a retired schoolteacher from Cedar Falls who came to a Buttigieg town hall in Waverly on Sunday, the appearance of wrongdoing related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine was enough to push him toward other options. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not valid concerns, but just like in 2016, it doesn\u2019t take a valid concern to bury somebody,\u201d Paup said. \u201cIt just takes a lot of noise. And he\u2019s got that.\u201d The Liberty and Justice Celebration is the last of several Iowa political confabs that punctuate the six-month period of campaigning leading up to the Iowa caucuses, which are due to take place this year on Feb. 3. Only candidates who purchase the state party\u2019s voter file or have field offices in the state are permitted to speak. They are also welcome to purchase tickets for their supporters to attend and cheer them on in the stands. (In other words, raucous applause is often less spontaneous, and more sponsored.) In November 2007, Obama\u2019s memorable speech at the fundraiser \u2015 then known as the Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2015 set the tone for the homestretch of Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign, which culminated in his historic victory on caucus day. Buttigieg sought to make his speech \u2015 and delegation \u2015 at Friday\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration a similarly impressive turning point. Festivities began with a rally in downtown Des Moines and a march to the dinner that the Buttigieg campaign said included 2,300 people. Although the campaign \u2015 like other campaigns \u2015 coordinated the participation of many Iowa activists, there was also a delegation of some 1,000 members of the ad hoc, internet-based, grassroots group, \u201cBarnstomers 4 Pete,\u201d who attended the event on their own dime. Ariana Wyndham, an undocumented immigrant who can remain in the country thanks to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and who lives in Warren, Ohio, is a leader of the group. She drove to Des Moines with her husband Peter, a crane operator, for the dinner festivities and a few days of canvassing and bonding with fellow activists. Speaking to HuffPost on the concourse of the Wells Fargo arena, Wyndham, covered in Buttigieg swag, described suffering from anxiety and depression after Trump\u2019s election. Without the right to vote, she felt powerless to get involved in politics until she found out about Buttigieg. She was particularly drawn to the account Buttigieg gives in his book, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d of reviving South Bend, a struggling post-industrial city that reminded her of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it can be done everywhere and it should be done everywhere.\u201d The following days were a show of force from Buttigieg designed to capitalize on his strong reception at the Liberty and Justice Celebration. On Saturday, after answering the questions of building trades union leaders at a multi-candidate fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg embarked on a three-day bus tour across rural northern Iowa, welcoming reporters onto his bus for extended group interviews in between campaign stops. Over the course of six town halls, Buttigieg spoke to crowds ranging from 275 people on the low end to upwards of 1,000, according to estimates provided to the campaign by building managers. The turnout was significant considering that all but one of the events took place in towns with a few thousand people. (His fourth stop was in Mason City, which has a population just under 28,000.) The campaign has one of the most extensive field presences in Iowa with over 100 staff on the ground and some 20 offices. Buttigieg has ramped up his investment in digital advertisements in the state as well, spending over $48,000 on Facebook ads targeting Iowans in the past week alone \u2014 more than any other Democrat running for president \u201cIn a lot of the towns that not just campaigns but a lot of economists have written off, Mayor Pete\u2019s team has shown up,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat running to represent several of the towns Buttigieg visited in the U.S. House and who has not endorsed in the presidential primary. \u201cFor months it was Warren. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve switched strategy or something. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m now seeing Pete more.\u201d For Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who tagged along with Buttigieg for a tour of an ethanol plant in Mason City, Buttigieg\u2019s itinerary was still more evidence that he was walking in the footsteps of Obama, who won Iowa twice. All but one of Buttigieg\u2019s bus tour stops was in a county that Obama won at least once and then went for Trump in 2016. \u201cObama was the model. He was everywhere,\u201d Judge said. Buttigieg has not shied away from the obvious differences between himself and Obama. At a town hall in Mason City on Sunday night that was attended by about 500 people, nearly all of whom were white, a voter asked Buttigieg how he planned to increase his support with Black voters. \u201cThe way to win any vote is to deserve to win it. My job is to make sure there is no confusion about where we stand,\u201d he said. To that end, he has unveiled a multi-pronged plan, named after the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, tailored to address the particular challenges facing Black communities \u2015 from difficulty obtaining credit to start a business or buy a home to encountering racial bias in the job market or the health care system. He also devoted a segment of his stump speech each stop in rural Iowa to confronting the country\u2019s legacy of anti-Black racism. The impact of racism \u201cis as important to discuss with mostly white audiences as it was with the NAACP gathering I was at early today,\u201d he told another predominantly white audience in Decorah on Saturday night. \u201cThis could wreck the entire American project \u2026 as long as we allow it to be the case that this is two different countries in your health and your access to housing or ability to get a job,\u201d depending on whether you are white or Black. And when Buttigieg lists mayoral peers to whom he looks for inspiration and guidance, two of the first names to come up are Michael Tubbs and Randall Woodfin, the young Black leaders of Stockton, California, and Birmingham, Alabama, respectively. For the most progressive voters in the Democratic primary, however, Obama\u2019s presidency is a cautionary tale, rather than a model. For example, they see a president whose embrace of corporate-friendly international trade agreements was wrongheaded and politically damaging, and whose Wall Street-cozy cabinet prevented him from adequately addressing the post-2008 housing crisis. But when asked to make the case that he would deliver on his progressive economic promises despite the support he enjoys from corporate America, Buttigieg again turns to Obama. \u201cThese same criticisms were leveled against President Obama,\u201d said Buttigieg, noting that Obama received campaign contributions from corporate leaders, including many Wall Street executives. \u201cIf you think about with respect to Wall Street, he delivered the strongest regulations and accountability that there had been there in a generation.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, Buttigieg\u2019s embrace of conciliatory politics of the kind Obama employed in his first term risks turning off voters disappointed in the Republican-driven gridlock of the Obama era. HuffPost asked Buttigieg on Monday how he would navigate shepherding policy priorities through Congress even in an optimistic scenario where Democrats control the Senate thanks to conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u201cThis is the interesting thing \u2015 you look at a Joe Manchin, some of these kind of swing-state senators, their orientation may be moderate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pro-corporate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have trouble with a lot of moderate senators on the idea of paid family leave, for example, or making sure that the tax code is more beneficial to the working- and middle-class versus the very wealthy.\u201d Later that day, Buttigieg fielded a similar question from a voter at a town hall in Algona about how he would defend his policies from Republican attacks. He addressed the less favorable \u2015 and arguably more likely \u2015 scenario of a Congress that is at least partly controlled by Republicans. Buttigieg\u2019s proposed solution: Holding political rallies in the states and districts of lawmakers obstructing the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right? And when we\u2019re talking about a measure, that\u2019s not just a new policy and something that people support, even in a conservative area, I believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures \u2015 it would be good for their constituents and reminding their constituents what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. Perhaps fittingly, it was a tactic that Obama also tried. And notably, it didn\u2019t work.",

      "content": " South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg praised former President\u00a0Barack Obama after a reporter misquoted him as criticizing Obama\u2019s presidency in a statement that went viral. A Los Angeles Times article published Sunday quoted the Democratic 2020 hopeful as saying that \u201cthe failures of the Obama era help explain how we got Trump.\u201d Evan Halper, the journalist who wrote the story, issued a correction on Monday noting that Buttigieg had actually said \u201cthe failures of the old normal.\u201d In a tweet, Halper called the mistake \u201cthe result of transcribing a noisy recording at a loud rally.\u201d Responding to the fix, Buttigieg offered admiration for Obama\u2019s tenure. \u201cI appreciate this reporter\u2019s swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFrom health care to [Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell] repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s senior communications adviser Lis Smith applauded the candidate in a subsequent tweet as \u201cunfailingly gracious- even to those who misquote and attack him in bad faith.\u201d \u201cThis is what a President looks like,\u201d she said. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served in the Obama administration and is also seeking the Democratic nomination, at first used the quote to bash Buttigieg on social media. He has since announced that he deleted his tweet and regrets that the original quote \u201cwas spread widely.\u201d In an interview with NBC News while on the campaign trail Monday, Buttigieg emphasized his support for both the press and Obama. \u201cThe reality is, despite what this president says, journalists take their obligation very seriously to make sure everything they print is accurate, and you saw that in how quickly that correction took place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe achievements of the Obama administration affected me personally in many ways, including the ability to serve openly,\u201d Buttigieg, the nation\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate, added, referring to his time in the military. \u201cAnd I\u2019m an admirer of President Obama.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority seems prepared to allow the Trump administration to end a program that allows some immigrants to work legally in the United States and protects them from deportation. There did not appear to be any support among the five conservatives in extended arguments Tuesday for blocking the administration\u2019s decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It currently protects 660,000 immigrants who came to the United States as children and are here illegally. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were among the justices who indicated that the administration has provided sufficient reason for wanting to do away with the program. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito raised questions about whether courts should even be reviewing the executive branch\u2019s discretionary decisions. The high court\u2019s decision is expected by June, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign. The program was begun under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration announced in September 2017 that it would end DACA protections, but lower federal courts have stepped in to keep the program alive. President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that if the Supreme Court overturns the immigrants\u2019 protections \u201ca deal will be made with the Dems for them to stay!\u201d But Trump\u2019s past promises to work with Democrats on a legislative solution for these immigrants have not led to an agreement. Trump said in his tweet that many program participants are \u201cfar from \u2019angels,\u201d and he falsely claimed that \u201csome are very tough, hardened criminals.\u201d The program bars anyone with a felony conviction from participating. Serious misdemeanors may also bar eligibility. Justice Sonia Sotomayor made the only direct reference to Trump, saying he told DACA recipients \u201cthat they were safe under him and that he\u2019d find a way to keep them here. And he hasn\u2019t.\u201d She also complained that the administration\u2019s rationale has shifted over time and that it has mainly relied on the view that DACA is illegal, leaving no choice but to end it. In her most pointed comment, Sotomayor said the administration has failed to plainly say, \u201cThis is about our choice to destroy lives.\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco, Trump\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, did not directly respond to Sotomayor. But near the end of the 80-minute arguments, he asserted that the administration has taken responsibility for its decision and is not relying only on its belief that DACA is illegal. \u201cWe own this,\u201d Francisco said. Roberts, who could hold the pivotal vote on the court, aimed his few questions at lawyers representing DACA recipients and their supporters. He did not seriously question the administration\u2019s argument. However, in June the chief justice surprised many observers when he cast the deciding vote to prevent the administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despite not voicing much skepticism during arguments in the case. Some DACA recipients who are part of the lawsuit against Trump\u2019s action were in the courtroom for the arguments. Many people camped out in front of the court for days for a chance at some of the few seats available to the general public. Roberts rejected a request to provide live or same-day audio of the arguments. The court will post the audio on its\u00a0website\u00a0on Friday. A second case being argued Tuesday tests whether the parents of a Mexican teenager who was killed by a U.S. border patrol agent in a shooting across the southern border in El Paso, Texas, can sue the agent in American courts. If the court agrees with the administration in the DACA case, Congress could follow up by putting the program on surer legal footing. But the absence of comprehensive immigration reform from Congress is what prompted Obama to create DACA in 2012, giving people two-year renewable reprieves from the threat of deportation while also allowing them to work. Federal courts struck down an expansion of DACA and the creation of similar protections for undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric was a key part of his presidential campaign in 2016, and his administration pointed to the invalidation of the expansion and the threat of a lawsuit against DACA by Texas and other Republican-led states as reasons to bring the program to a halt. Young immigrants, civil rights groups, universities and Democratic-led cities and states sued to block the administration. They persuaded courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that the administration had been \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in its actions, in violation of a federal law that requires policy changes to be done in an orderly way.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on Friday warned the Democratic field of White House hopefuls not to veer too far to the left, a move he said would alienate many who would otherwise be open to voting for the party\u2019s nominee next year. Though Obama did not mention anyone by name, the message delivered before a room of Democratic donors in Washington was a clear word of caution about the candidacies of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The two have called for massive structural changes \u2014 and in Sanders\u2019 case \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 that would dramatically alter the role of government in people\u2019s lives. The centrist wing of the party has warned for months that a far-left nominee could alienate moderate Republicans and independent voters needed to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it\u2019s important for us not to lose sight of that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff. They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.\u201d Obama has largely refrained from publicly opining on the Democratic primary, which has exposed a growing rift between an ascendant progressive wing of the party and old-guard centrists like his former vice president, Joe Biden. But on Friday he said he felt compelled to weigh in because some of the loudest and most strident voices, particularly on social media, aren\u2019t representative of where most in the party are at. Immigration and health care are two issues he cited as cases where Democratic candidates are out of sync with public sentiment. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. Obama delivered his remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democrats who raise large sums for the party. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the party who narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race last year. He also sought also to ease jittery Democrats who have been wringing their hands over the size of the sprawling field, which some worry will lead to a prolonged contest that will leave the eventual nominee with limited time to prepare for the general election. \u201cI just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNot only did I win ultimately a remarkably tough and lengthy primary process with Hillary Clinton, but people forget that even before that we had a big field of really serious, accomplished people.\u201d",

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " A major issue for many of the Democratic presidential candidates is how they would bring the country together and heal divisions in a post-Donald Trump world. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said he\u2019s confident Republicans will have an \u201cepiphany\u201d after Trump is gone and will suddenly come to their senses and work in a bipartisan fashion. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is another candidate who has touted his ability to bring people together. \u201cWe will fight when we must fight, but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point,\u201d Buttigieg said in an Iowa ad. \u201cThe point it what lies on the other side of the fight.\u201d During the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night, the moderators asked Buttigieg specifically what he would do differently from former President Barack Obama, who also used rhetoric about unity but faced eight years of entrenched Republican opposition. Buttigieg didn\u2019t really have an answer. He said that the country is very different than it was during the Obama administration: \u201cThere is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn\u2019t exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing.\u201d He added that the next president needs to \u201cgalvanize, not polarize, that majority,\u201d throwing some criticism at his more progressive competitors \u2015 including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) \u2015 who support \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d \u201cI believe that commanding people to accept that option,\u00a0whether we wait three years as Sen. Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver,\u201d Buttigieg added. Obama, of course, also took a less-than-radical approach toward health care, opting out of a single-payer plan or public option. The health care system in Massachusetts, which was put in place by then-Gov. Mitt Romney \u2015 who, of course, is a Republican \u2015 was even a model for the Affordable Care Act. That fact, of course, didn\u2019t stop Republicans from inexplicably attacking the law as socialist. At a town hall in Iowa this month, Buttigieg has raised a more specific way he\u2019d win over Republicans who oppose his agenda: going into their districts and applying pressure. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right?\u201d Buttigieg said at the town hall. \u201cI believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures.\u201d But when asked how his approach would differ from that of Obama, Buttigieg struggled to answer. \u201cHe operated under the constraints of being the last Democrat of the Reagan era. And he also faced constraints of a Congress that was not acting in good faith,\u201d Buttigieg said during his bus tour in Iowa. \u201cAnd the part about Congress acting in bad faith has only gotten worse among Republicans.\u201d In 2011, to get support for his stimulus proposal, Obama indeed fired up his airplane and flew it around to redder districts. Obama held rallies in places like Richmond, Virginia, to put pressure on Eric Cantor, who was then the House majority leader. And presidents have long gone out on the trail to stump for their proposals after their State of the Union speeches. But it largely doesn\u2019t work, as Obama found out. In the early days of his campaign, Buttigieg was touting much bolder solutions of structural change \u2015 getting rid of the Electoral College and putting more justices on the Supreme Court. But he discusses those ideas less these days, as he\u2019s taken a firmer position as a more centrist candidate and an alternative to Biden. Democratic voters seem to want more specifics from their candidates on how they\u2019d accomplish their goals. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted ahead of Wednesday\u2019s debate found them skeptical that the candidates can pull it off. Just 41% of Democrats think\u00a0Biden will be able to accomplish all or most of his policy goals, and the numbers are lower for other candidates: Only 33% say the same of Warren\u2019s agenda, while 30% of Democrats are confident in Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 ability to enact his political revolution, and just 28% believe Buttigieg can enact most of his plans.",
