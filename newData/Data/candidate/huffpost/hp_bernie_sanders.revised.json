      "content": " Ben & Jerry\u2019s co-founder Ben Cohen is throwing his weight behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0with a new flavor celebrating the presidential candidate\u2019s 2020 campaign. On Friday, Cohen unveiled \u201cBernie\u2019s Back!,\u201d a limited-edition, small-batch treat that makes a big political statement. As Cohen describes it, the name is a double-entendre. At the core of the confection is a toffee \u201cbackbone,\u201d handmade by Cohen himself and meant to symbolize Sanders\u2019 no-nonsense attitude. Hot cinnamon ice cream surrounds the toffee core, symbolizing the act of holding politicians\u2019 feet to the fire. On top lies a solid chocolate disc, representing the wealth of the 1% that the consumer must crush into tiny pieces and distribute down into pint. Cohen said he\u2019s making between 10 and 40 pints of the flavor, which he and business partner Jerry Greenfield will autograph and raffle off to any contestant who wishes to sign up on Sanders\u2019 campaign site. The Vermont ice cream entrepreneur also celebrated Sanders\u2019 campaign in 2016 with \u201cBernie\u2019s Yearning,\u201d a mint-flavored ice cream which, like his latest invention, featured a chocolate disc at the top. Neither is a mass-distributed flavor, and both are independent of the Ben & Jerry\u2019s brand.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s also running for president, argued that canceling all student debt would widen the racial wealth gap.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Saturday that his plan to cancel all student debt would reduce the racial wealth gap, contrary to the claims of another of the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Sanders and Warren were among 19 contenders for the party nod to speak at a candidate forum hosted by the public-sector labor union AFSCME in Las Vegas. Warren, a populist often grouped alongside Sanders ideologically, said during her appearance earlier in the day that she wants to abolish 95% of student debt \u2015 rather than all of it \u2015 because a total cancellation would exacerbate the wealth gap between black and white Americans. HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel, who moderated the discussion alongside Jon Ralston of The Nevada Independent, asked Sanders to respond to Warren\u2019s claim. \u201cAs I understand it \u2015 I don\u2019t have all the facts in my head now \u2015 our plan will reduce the racial wealth gap from 12 to 1 for younger people, to 5 to 1,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d Sanders later added a statistic he said he learned recently about how student debt affects black college graduates. \u201cFor African American young people, 12 years after they took out the debt, they are more in debt than when they took it out in the first place, because of interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is really crushing an entire generation.\u201d Another major benefit of canceling all student debt is that it would eliminate the bureaucratic paperwork associated with needs-based programs, according to Sanders. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of filling out forms,\u201d he said. Some evidence backs up Sanders\u2019 claim that his plan would reduce the racial wealth gap. A\u00a0study of the impact of both Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s respective student debt cancellation plans, economist Marshall Steinbaum found that Sanders\u2019 plan would narrow the black-white disparity more than Warren\u2019s. But other data contradicts Sanders\u2019 claim. His estimate of how the plan would narrow the racial wealth gap among young people appears to be drawn from an earlier study by Steinbaum that only looked at the effect of student loan cancellation on people ages 25 to 40. Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at the liberal think tank Demos, calculated that only Warren\u2019s plan would reduce the racial wealth gap of the overall population. That\u2019s because the lack of means-testing in Sanders\u2019 plan means that it increases the assets of high-income households, which are disproportionately white. Sanders was clearly one of the crowd favorites in Las Vegas, drawing warm applause when he was introduced and for many of his responses to questions. When Sanders finished his remarks, some in the audience broke into chants of \u201cBer-nie, Ber-nie, Ber-nie.\u201d AFSCME is celebrating the passage of a Nevada law granting state workers collective bargaining rights, and much of Saturday\u2019s discussion focused on the priorities of union workers. Ralston pressed Sanders on whether he could really guarantee that his Medicare for All plan would meet or surpass the quality of some of the deluxe health plans that unions have negotiated for their members. Sanders pledged that Medicare for All would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be equal or better to current union plans, noting that it would cover dental, vision and mental health free of charge at the point of service. He also argued that Medicare for All would be a major boon for unions, since it would effectively take health care off the negotiating table during collective bargaining. The rising cost of health care has weakened unions\u2019 power to negotiate pay increases and other benefits, Sanders observed. \u201cWe will do what every other major country does: guarantee all of you health care as a right, so you can sit down and negotiate decent wage increases,\u201d he said. At another moment in the discussion, Ralston asked Sanders if he thought the private sector was \u201cgood for anything.\u201d Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, responded that it was a \u201cgood question.\u201d \u201cThe private sector is the sector of society which creates most of the wealth in America. And I want them to continue to do that,\u201d he said. He went on to argue that Medicare for All would actually help the private sector grow, because people would no longer rely on their employer for health insurance and would therefore be freer to take the risk of starting their own business. The narrow focus of the private sector on profit, however, means that it is incapable of taking care of important social needs like affordable child care, Sanders argued. \u201cObviously the private sector plays an enormously important role in creating wealth,\u201d he said. \u201dThe function of the public sector is to address the needs, and they are many, of the working class and low-income people of this country.\u201d This story has been updated with additional detail on the competing loan cancellation plans.",

      "author": "Julian Shen-Berro",
      "content": " Mike Gravel, who ran on an anti-war platform as one of the longest of long-shot candidates in a crowded 2020 Democratic primary field, has dropped out of the race and endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). \u201cI\u2019m proud and honored to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders for the presidency of the United States,\u201d Gravel said in a video shared on Twitter Tuesday. \u201cBernie has a program that benefits all Americans \u2014 not just the one percent. He will be a great president for all Americans.\u201d He later clarified in an interview with media site Primo Nutmeg that he was endorsing both Sanders and Gabbard for the presidency and vice presidency, leaving it up to the voters to decide which position each would fill. If you aren\u2019t a political junkie, an avid Twitter trawler or a member of 2020 hopeful Marianne Williamson\u2019s mailing list, this may be the first you\u2019re hearing of the former Alaska senator and his unorthodox campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He failed to qualify for the first debate in June, and though he met the threshold of 65,000 individual donors required to make the second debate in July, he missed the polling mark and was left offstage. Gravel\u2019s campaign, headed by teenagers David Oks and Henry Williams, took place almost entirely on Twitter. The pair of young political activists posted a mix of memes, progressive policy platforms and callouts of the views and voting records of fellow candidates, especially former Vice President Joe Biden. Gravel\u2019s supporters, who enthusiastically refer to themselves as the #Gravelanche, brought him to the 65,000 unique donations that constituted one of the criteria to qualify for the early debate stage. Some candidates who did qualify for the debate, such as former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), did not meet the donor threshold but qualified instead by reaching 1% in three national polls approved by the Democratic National Committee. The Gravel campaign criticized the DNC for prioritizing polling numbers over donor count. Gravel, who was persuaded to run for president by Oks and Williams, is best known for reading the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record at a subcommittee hearing in 1971. Those documents exposed lies from the White House to the public and Congress about the U.S. role in Vietnam leading up to and during the war. The then-freshman senator read 4,100 pages until past 1:00 a.m. when, with tears in his eyes and no other senators left in the room, he established unanimous consent and entered the pages into the record. Gravel left the Senate following his defeat in the Democratic primary in 1980. He ran for president in 2008 \u2014 first as a Democrat and later as a Libertarian \u2014 but failed to receive either nomination. This time around, Gravel and his campaign admitted that the nomination was not their true goal. While attending the June presidential debates, Oks and Williams told HuffPost they weren\u2019t \u201cin it for the long haul.\u201d Instead, they sought to push the field further left and expose voters to the ideas that Gravel has long championed \u2014 most significantly, ending the cycle of American wars and what they refer to as \u201cthe American Empire.\u201d With Gravel\u2019s withdrawal from the race, the campaign has pledged to donate what remains of its fundraising to charity. This story has been updated to include Gravel\u2019s endorsement of Gabbard.",

Asked whether Sanders would be in the White House today had he been the Democratic nominee in 2016, de Blasio told Politico that in his \u201cheart\u201d he believes the answer is yes. \u201cYou know, hindsight\u2019s 20/20, but I think when we look at it now, that was a moment where there was such desire for change,\u201d said de Blasio, who endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Though Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million votes in 2016, Trump ultimately prevailed in the Electoral College with 304 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 227 electoral votes. De Blasio, who ran Clinton\u2019s successful Senate campaign in 2000, has lauded Sanders for years and dubbed meeting the Vermont senator as one of the highlights of his first term as mayor. Still, de Blasio says he\u2019s the best person to be president. \u201cI think the world of Bernie, but I would say I\u2019m someone who has put these ideas into action consistently and effectively in a really tough environment,\u201d said de Blasio, who is trailing far behind other Democratic candidates in the polls.

      "content": " Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has pledged to reveal the truth about aliens if he\u2019s elected in 2020. Podcast host Joe Rogan asked the senator from Vermont in the final moments of an hourlong interview if he would tell the public about aliens and UFOs were he to find something out while in office. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you, my wife would\u00a0demand\u00a0that I let you know,\u201d Sanders replied with a laugh, adding that she had pressed him in his role as senator for any information on aliens. (He said he doesn\u2019t have access to those records.) Sanders went on to say that if he did become president and found out anything about aliens \u2015 he\u2019d announce it on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d Though this is a common question for Rogan to ask his guests, it comes after a recent uptick in conversations about UFOs following a rise in reports of unidentified aircraft by military pilots earlier this year. When asked about the increase in reports during an interview with ABC News in June, President Donald Trump provided little clarity on the origin of the reports. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably \u2015 I want them to think whatever they think. They do say, and I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019ve heard. And I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they\u2019re seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particular,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching, and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d To the disappointment of UFO watchers, Trump\u2019s predecessor was equally vague when pried for information on extraterrestrials. When asked whether he\u2019d \u201cdemanded to see all the classified files about Area 51 and UFOs\u201d on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d in 2015, President Barack Obama deflected with jokes. \u201cThe aliens won\u2019t let it happen. You\u2019d reveal all their secrets, and they exercise strict control over us,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI can\u2019t reveal anything.\u201d Kimmel had also asked Presidents George W.

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron fired back at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for suggesting the newspaper\u2019s owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, influences its coverage of the Democratic presidential hopeful. Sanders implied during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Monday that the Post publishes negative stories about him because he has criticized Amazon\u2019s labor practices and tax history. \u201cAnybody here know how much Amazon paid in taxes last year?\u201d he asked the crowd at his town hall in Wolfeboro.\u00a0\u201cSee, I talk about that all of the time. And then I wonder why The Washington Post ... doesn\u2019t write particularly good articles about me. I don\u2019t know why. But I guess maybe there\u2019s a connection.\u201d He repeated the claim, again citing no evidence, at a separate town hall in New Hampshire later Monday. He also said The New York Times\u2019 coverage of him is \u201cnot much better.\u201d Baron rejected Sanders\u2019 claim about Bezos\u2019 influence, dubbing it a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d \u201cSen. Sanders is a member of a large club of politicians \u2015 of every ideology \u2015 who complain about their coverage,\u201d Baron said in a statement. \u201cContrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest.\u201d A representative for the Times did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Sanders has long accused the \u201ccorporate media\u201d of being biased in its coverage of his presidential campaign.\u00a0Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders\u2019 campaign, suggested Monday in a call with reporters that coverage of his polling numbers has been unfair. \u201cThere seems to be a direct correlation between media coverage of polls and Bernie\u2019s specific standing in those polls,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThe better the number is in the poll, the less coverage it receives. And the worse he does, the more it receives.\u201d Last month, Sanders\u2019 campaign launched \u201cThe 99,\u201d a show livestreamed on his YouTube channel to discuss \u201cthe issues the mainstream media too often overlooks.\u201d \u201cWhile we appreciate our friends in the elite media, they don\u2019t often cover the issues that truly matter to working Americans,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, told The Associated Press. Sanders repeatedly claimed during his 2016 presidential campaign that the media treated him unfairly. A Harvard study published in June 2016 found the media\u2019s focus on the Republican side of the race hurt Sanders\u2019 ability to gain traction against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Five Republican candidates \u2015 Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson \u2014 got more coverage than Sanders in 2015, and Clinton received three times more press than he did, according to the study. But the study also found that the coverage Sanders did receive was largely positive. The Vermont senator\u00a0has defended the media against some of Trump\u2019s most aggressive attacks such as describing the press as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d But the senator\u2019s comments Monday echoed the president\u2019s false claim that the Post is essentially a lobbying arm for Amazon. \u201cA poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper, the Failing New York Times or the Amazon (lobbyist) Washington Post!\u201d the president tweeted in June. \u201cThey are both a disgrace to our Country, the Enemy of the People, but I just can\u2019t seem to figure out which is worse?\u201d",

      "content": " ORIENT, Iowa \u2015 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was four minutes into the Q-and-A portion of a town hall in this rural town of 400 people on Sunday when a voter suggested that the political revolution need not be imminent. \u201cMy concern is that I just read in the Monmouth poll that polled Iowa Democrats, and that poll revealed 75 percent of Iowa Democrats did not favor \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019\u201d the man said, referring to a poll from the New Jersey university that had come out a few days earlier. \u201cIf it\u2019s not resonating, and you\u2019ve done a great job of explaining it \u2015\u201d Sanders politely cut the man off. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who was holding the town hall at the birthplace of Henry Wallace \u2015 a legendary progressive whose unsuccessful 1948 bid for the presidency was built, in part, around a push for universal health insurance \u2015 was in no mood to continue waiting. \u201cDon\u2019t put all your faith in that particular poll, which is wrong in many aspects,\u201d Sanders responded with a wave of his hand. Seven hours later and some 170 miles to the east, California Sen. Kamala Harris was trying to convince Democrats to be patient. On the campus of Iowa Wesleyan University in Mount Pleasant, she pitched the crowd of 500 on what she\u2019s branded her \u201c3 a.m. agenda.\u201d It\u2019s shorthand for a set of policy proposals the former prosecutor sees as inherently nonideological, one focused on alleviating Americans\u2019 most immediate concerns without making grand promises of full-scale societal change. \u201cSome people call it the witching hour. You know when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thought that\u2019s been weighing on you?\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cFor the vast majority of us, what we wake up thinking back on, it is never through the lens of the party with which we\u2019re registered.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s have a problem-solving president,\u201d she continued. \u201cLet\u2019s deal with the issues that are challenging us.\u201d The riff on Americans\u2019 late-night worries is Harris\u2019 attempt to knit together a set of policy proposals that are more ambitious than those offered by former Vice President Joe Biden, but without the sweeping nature of those put forward by candidates like Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Harris has proposed pay hikes for underpaid teachers, a tax cut that would give $500 a month to every American family making less than $100,000 and a plan to deliver universal health care within 10 years. Her positioning puts her on a collision course with Sanders, who has long argued ambitious, blanket policies to confront the malicious influence of big business and transform American society \u2015 including Medicare for All, free public colleges and universities, and the total elimination of student debt \u2015 are both good ideas and good politics. Both candidates, who are now trailing Biden and Warren in most public polling, are counting on their approaches to power their political fortunes, starting here in Iowa. Sanders, who narrowly lost the Iowa caucuses to Hillary Clinton in 2016, is hoping his decision to double-down on the need for a political revolution will recreate that momentum four years later. And after months of occasionally intermittent commitment to the first state to vote in the Democratic primary, a five-day Harris bus tour and a new television ad in the state was designed to show off both her campaign\u2019s newfound emphasis on the state and her decision to fully embrace a nonideological pitch. In an interview, Sanders argued the type of \u201cincrementalism\u201d pushed by Harris would cost the Democratic Party a chance to defeat Trump. \u201cYou want incrementalism? Then Trump is going to win the election,\u201d the Vermont independent told HuffPost. \u201cThe only way we defeat Donald Trump is by having a candidate, such as Bernie Sanders, who is going to run a campaign of energy and excitement and have the largest voter turnout in the history of this country,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only way we get that turnout is when we speak to the pain that so many Americans are feeling right now and their disgust and frustration with establishment politics.\u201d \u201cThe American people do not want to see another complicated health care proposal that they don\u2019t understand, that will take 10 years to implement,\u201d he continued, making it clear he was referring, at least in part, to Harris. Thaddeus Hawley, the chair of the Adair County Democrats, attended Sanders\u2019 event in Orient and backed the senator in the 2016 election. He\u2019s neutral this cycle and said voters in his county are \u201csplit\u201d between more ambitious candidates like Sanders and pragmatists like Harris. He said the candidates in the best position to succeed are those who can prove acceptable to voters in both camps, listing off Warren, Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker as possibilities. But there are signs pragmatism is the ultimate preference. Rep. Cindy Axne (D), who won the U.S. House seat covering the state\u2019s southwestern quadrant in 2018 and is neutral in the primary, said Iowa Democrats wanted candidates who are willing to take small victories when they find them. \u201cI think Iowans are always looking for somebody who\u2019s solutions-oriented and pragmatic,\u201d she said in an interview with HuffPost at the state fair on Monday. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the candidates talk about real, tangible solutions that can actually get us somewhere as opposed to just saying, well, this is where we need to end up.\u201d Attendees at Harris\u2019 event in Mount Pleasant were impressed with her performance, but almost all were still considering other candidates. (\u201cI wish we could somehow amalgamate them all into one candidate,\u201d said David Goodman, a professor who attended the event.) Sanders\u2019 crowd in Orient had some undecided voters, but also a sizable portion of Bernie-or-bust caucusgoers. If there was one thing that united both crowds, it was an emphasis on finding a candidate who can beat Trump. Debi Plum, a school board member in Fairfield who attended Harris\u2019 event, said her top three candidates are Booker, Harris and Warren. \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone who has the personality and leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is one person can have a lot of detailed plans, but they\u2019re just one person.\u201d Both campaigns built packed schedules around this weekend\u2019s two major events in Iowa \u2015 the annual Wing Ding dinner on Friday night and speeches at the state fair in Des Moines. Sanders held a rally in Des Moines aimed at the Latinx community and toured a factory farm. Harris rode across the state in a bus emblazoned with her name in giant lettering and bookended her trip with endorsements from a politically powerful former state party chair, Sue Dvorsky, and from the state\u2019s Asian and Latino Coalition. Midway through her journey across the state, Harris stopped at a family farm, accompanied by a crew gathering footage for future television ads. At the end of her tour, she held a roundtable discussion, chatting about ways to fight consolidation in the industry, how agriculture can help combat climate change and just why she admires farmers so much, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the luxury of engaging in some intellectual, political conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re adaptable.\u201d",

      "content": " BERLIN, N.H. \u2015 After several fairly routine questions about health care and the environment at a town hall here in the northernmost city in New Hampshire, a frustrated Bernie Sanders supporter stood up and demanded to know why the Vermont senator had not yet taken a more aggressive posture toward his Democratic presidential rivals. \u201cYour opponents, to be blunt, have stolen all your ideas,\u201d the man complained. \u201cWhy are you not calling them out for taking your ideas?\u201d Sanders declined to take the bait. The 2020 candidate, wrapping up a two-day swing through the northern part of the Granite State, a rugged, rural area that stretches up to Canada, relished the fact that several of his competitors have also backed populist proposals like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a $15 minimum wage. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call them out. I\u2019m proud of it!\u201d Sanders responded, garnering applause. \u201cPeople can decide for themselves, and what the primary process is about is what candidate do you trust the most? And that\u2019s what you have to decide.\u201d Four years ago, New Hampshire voters put Sanders on the national map and catapulted him into a heated primary contest against the establishment favorite, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Now the senator has to repeat his strong performance in the first-in-the-nation primary, eight days after the Iowa caucuses, if he has any chance of making it to the convention next summer. Unlike in 2016, however, Sanders is facing several well-funded opponents who are battling with him for front-runner status in the early nominating states \u2015 some of whom are running for president for the first time. (Former Vice President Joe Biden is currently leading the polls.)\u00a0The progressive firebrand who took the left by storm several years ago still has his loyal supporters, of course, but he no longer has the \u201cit\u201d factor of four years ago. He\u2019s still railing against the political establishment and the \u201ccorporate media,\u201d but his radical ideas on job security, health care and education don\u2019t seem so radical anymore, at least among a significant chunk of the Democratic Party \u2015 something he acknowledged this week on the campaign trail. Though it\u2019s still relatively early in the race, the possibility of a sophomore slump has left some supporters worried. \u201cI think Americans have very short attention spans, so to speak,\u201d said Jim Rouillard, a retiree from Wolfeboro. \u201cWanting the new flavor all the time, you know? Whereas Bernie has changed very little. I\u2019m disappointed that he\u2019s not the front-runner as I felt he was [in 2016].\u201d Sanders has gotten off to an impressive start, though. He\u2019s raised more money and has more donors than any other candidate in the Democratic primary. Unlike other candidates who have relied on high-dollar fundraisers, his strength lies in a steady stream of contributions from small donors across the country, ensuring he\u2019ll likely stick around for a while. During the second presidential debate in Detroit, Sanders fended off criticism by bottom-tier candidates, such as former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who hammered him over the potential cost of his universal health care plan. The performance earned him the biggest post-debate polling bump, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight. Sanders\u2019 campaign highlighted those points in a call with reporters on Monday, pushing back on the notion, fueled by some recent polling data, that his bid for the presidency had begun to flounder. A Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa released last week, for example, showed Sanders slipping into fourth place in the Hawkeye State. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of in the phase called the \u2018Bernie write-off,\u2019\u201d senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said on the call before his team disputed the poll. \u201cThere seems to be a direct correlation between the media coverage of the polls and Bernie Sanders\u2019s standing in those polls.\u201d In New Hampshire, a state Sanders won by 22 percentage points in 2016, he is currently trailing Biden by 4 points, according to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe survey released earlier this month. Warren, meanwhile, is close behind him in third place. However, 58% of those surveyed said that they may yet change their minds before the primary, suggesting the state is still up for grabs. At four Q&A events in the state on Monday and Tuesday, Sanders spoke in front of hundreds of supporters, many of whom thanked him for jumping into the race once again. Some expressed concerns about the Democratic National Committee putting its thumb on the scale against him, a source of bitterness among his most ardent backers that remains from 2016. But Sanders seemed more interested in doubling down on a strategy that has worked well for him: attacking the media and the political establishment. Again and again on the stump this week, the senator took digs at news organizations for their coverage \u2015 or perceived non-coverage \u2015 of various issues, such as income inequality. He even suggested at one point that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, negatively influenced coverage of his campaign by the newspaper. \u201cMaybe we helped raise the minimum wage at Amazon to $15 as well. Maybe that\u2019s why The Washington Post is not endeared with me, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Sanders said at a town hall in Wolfeboro on Monday. The unsubstantiated charge invited comparisons to President Donald Trump, who often rails against the media over perceived negative coverage of his administration, and he even drew a rebuke from the Post\u2019s executive editor. Sanders\u2019 media-bashing stems from his belief that the press didn\u2019t take him seriously and did not give him fair coverage during the 2016 campaign. This time around, however, the media could play the role of a villain in his campaign even more than four years ago, given the efforts the DNC has made to appear neutral in the primary and the diminished role of superdelegates. \u201cI think his message is being essentially filtered out by a hostile media,\u201d said Michael Bloomer, a New Hampshire native who studies at Stanford, echoing the candidate at a town hall in Wolfeboro. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t know how you can watch that debate where you have [CNN host] Jake Tapper just shouting, \u2018Thank you, senator. Thank you, senator. Now, Mr. Delaney, can you tell us about how Mr. Sanders wants to raise taxes.\u2019 I mean they were totally setting him up.\u201d But other supporters say they\u2019ve become disillusioned by Sanders\u2019 style and are turning to something fresh. \u201cHe cut a swath in 2016, he changed the language, he changed people\u2019s thinking, he opened up excitement,\u201d said Carlotta Hayes, a yoga teacher who worked on Sanders\u2019 last presidential bid but now helps run Marianne Williamson\u2019s presidential campaign office in downtown Concord, New Hampshire. \u201cI think this thing,\u201d she added, mimicking the Vermont senator\u2019s characteristic finger-pointing, \u201cis good for so long. It\u2019s a one tone emotion. Marianne has a range of speaking that\u2019s very compelling. It\u2019s sincere.\u201d The biggest threat to Sanders\u2019 candidacy may be Warren, the other progressive star in the race who has slowly inched forward in the polls thanks to a pair of good debate performances and a flood of policy proposals. Both candidates drew among the largest crowds of all the field at this year\u2019s Iowa State Fair over the weekend, a mandatory stop for presidential candidates looking to connect with caucus-goers, even though they have distinctly different styles when engaging voters. For example, while Warren enjoys taking selfies with supporters after campaign events, the characteristically prickly Sanders clearly does not. He did so at just one stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, rarely saying more than one or two words to supporters in line waiting to pose for a photo. With Biden in the lead, the informal non-aggression pact between Sanders and Warren, who are friends, has held steady. But it\u2019s not clear for how long nor who will benefit if it ultimately breaks out into an all-out war. \u201cWhen you have Bernie having just talked about it for so long, that to me suggests that this is something he is just fundamentally committed to. I\u2019m not saying Warren won\u2019t support people to have health care, but it might just mean it\u2019s not her priority when she\u2019s in office,\u201d Jeremy Mele, a Maine native who works as a library aide, said at his Wolfeboro rally on Monday. Warren also made a stop in northern New Hampshire on Wednesday, taking questions at a town hall in Franconia, which counts a little over 1,000 residents. The senator from Massachusetts drew about 700 attendees to an event overlooking the state\u2019s picturesque White Mountains \u2015 a bigger crowd than at either event for Sanders earlier in the week. She pitched her plan to make sure every U.S. home has a fiber broadband connection at an affordable cost, an issue that resonated with voters in the audience. Neil Brody, a real estate company owner from Bethlehem, New Hampshire, said he preferred Warren to Sanders, whom he backed in the 2016 election, because she is \u201ca little more energetic.\u201d \u201cShe comes off a little more younger. She\u2019s better at explaining things. She tells a better story. Bernie just says it,\u201d Brody explained after her event on Wednesday. Winning over rural parts of the state like Franconia will be crucial to Warren\u2019s chances of catching up to Biden and Sanders, but it won\u2019t be easy, according to Grafton County Democratic Party Chair Sarah Daniels-Campbell. \u201cYou have people that have moved to other candidates, but I think he still has an enormous base in this part of New Hampshire,\u201d Daniels-Campbell said. The two progressive standard-bearers are taking a wide stance around each other as they campaign for the Democratic nomination, distinguishing themselves stylistically and leaving it to voters to decide for themselves whom to support. But that could change, especially if Sanders\u2019 base of support erodes significantly in a state that played such a big role in his political fortunes. Sanders declined another opportunity to attack Warren at a town hall in North Conway earlier in the week, for example, after a voter asked the presidential contender why New Hampshire should support him over his Senate colleague. \u201cElizabeth is a friend of mine, and you will make that decision yourself,\u201d the senator stressed as he quickly moved on to another question.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday released an 11-minute video of pop superstar Cardi B interviewing Sanders about a range of topics, including police brutality, immigration policy and worker pay. The Afro-Latina rapper, born Belcalis Almanzar, endorsed Sanders in the 2016 election and lamented last month that \u201cwe let him down in 2016.\u201d Both Sanders and Cardi were born and raised in New York City. Cardi B, who supports Sanders\u2019 proposals of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and tuition-free public college, is backing the Vermont senator again this election cycle. The pair sat down in July for a heart-to-heart discussion at the TEN Nail Bar, a nail salon owned by Black women in Detroit. The conversation, which the Sanders campaign had been hyping, included its share of lighthearted banter and production flourishes, such as camera pans across the salon. But with Cardi B asking the questions \u2015 which she said were sourced from her fans \u2015 the discussion was almost entirely substantive, giving Sanders a chance to pitch Cardi B\u2019s massive following on his left-leaning proposals. The pop star first asked Sanders how he would address police brutality against Black men and other people of color. \u201cIt makes us feel like we\u2019re worthless. We constantly see our men getting killed, every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it seems like nobody cares, nobody\u2019s sympathizing, nobody\u2019s talking about it.\u201d \u201cObviously, we need to end all forms of racism in this country \u2015 from Donald Trump down to the local police department,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cWe have something like one out of four young Black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey may end up in jail, they may end up on parole, they may end up on probation, whatever it is. That is disgusting and beyond belief.\u201d He went on to lay out a three-pronged approach to the problem: improving education and job access to prevent crime at its roots; task the Department of Justice with investigating when police kill someone; and use the power of the federal government to ensure that police departments \u201clook like the community that they serve, not like an oppressive army.\u201d \u201cWe get rid of a lot of this militarization in the police department, which is a form of intimidating people in the community,\u201d Sanders said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates will descend on Iowa next week to do something that Native Americans say doesn\u2019t happen enough: court their vote. At least seven White House hopefuls have said they\u2019ll attend a forum in Sioux City on Monday and Tuesday named for longtime Native American activist Frank LaMere, who died in June. Tribal leaders and citizens will talk with candidates about issues including health care, education and violence against National American women. Several candidates attending the forum, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro and Marianne Williamson, have issued platforms dedicated to the needs of indigenous people. Marcella LeBeau, a 99-year-old registered Democrat and a citizen of the Two Kettles Band of the Lakota, said that\u2019s a change from the past when politicians largely overlooked Native American issues. \u201cWe\u2019re like a third-world country,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one really listens to us.\u201d Many Native Americans live in \u201chard-to-count\u201d rural areas and are not reflected in the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey, so the census cannot accurately measure their voter registration as it would for black, white, Asian and Hispanic citizens. Census estimates say Native Americans make up around 1.7% \u2014 or 5.3 million \u2014 of the U.S. population, and suggest that more than 3.7 million Native Americans are of voting age. As more Native Americans gain access to the polls, they may be a powerful asset for candidates. Richard Witmer, a political scientist from Creighton University who specializes in American Indian politics and policy, said the Native American vote can swing a close national election. \u201cThe Native vote is absolutely going to matter. It\u2019s going to matter a lot,\u201d Witmer said of next year\u2019s race. Candidates rarely court the Native American vote like they do other demographics, noted Nicole Willis, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla who lives in Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a moral test of a candidate. Like, are you going to pay attention to this group that has traditionally been ignored?\u201d said Willis, who was a Native American outreach adviser to President Barack Obama as well as a 2016 presidential adviser to Sanders. Warren has had her own problems with the Native American community. After President Donald Trump gave her the nickname \u201cPocahontas\u201d for her claims of Cherokee citizenship, Warren took a DNA test to try to prove her ancestry. The test did provide some evidence of a Native American in Warren\u2019s lineage, albeit as many as 10 generations back. But the Cherokee Nation complained that tribal nations, not DNA tests, determine citizenship, and that Warren was \u201cundermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d Warren apologized and will face scrutiny at the forum over how she handles the issue. Ahead of the event, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland, a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo and one of the first Native Americans in Congress, endorsed Warren for president. And Warren joined with Haaland on Friday to propose legislation that would cordon off funding for tribal priorities from Congress\u2019 unpredictable appropriations process, fulfilling a key recommendation the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights made last year. Warren also proposed setting up a permanent White House office dedicated to tribal issues and backed more resources for aiding tribal land acquisition, among other ideas to help Native American communities. Activists say tribal citizens still face barriers to voting that must be addressed. Many Native Americans live on far-flung reservations without polling centers. Before Four Directions, a group promoting voting rights for Native Americans, sued for satellite offices on Nevada\u2019s Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe reservation in 2016, residents had to drive nearly 100 miles roundtrip just to vote, said Oliver \u201cO.J.\u201d Semans, co-founder of the forum and a citizen of South Dakota\u2019s Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Voter ID requirements are another hurdle. States such as North Dakota require voters to provide ID and a street address at the polls, so the many rural Natives with only a P.O. Box number have been barred from voting, Semans said. Just this month, a federal appeals court ruled against members of North Dakota\u2019s Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, who had said such requirements were unconstitutional. Four Directions has worked in New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota and elsewhere to abolish ID laws, establish voting centers on reservations and give Native Americans on reservations the ability to cast no-excuse absentee ballots, often by suing local governments. In some areas where Four Directions has made voting more accessible, Native voter turnout has doubled, Semans said. The swing vote is likely to favor Democrats, who are often seen as more receptive toward the needs of Native American communities on issues like health care, tribal sovereignty and economic development, Witmer said. Indigenous people hold profound respect for their tribal elders and leaders, who can sway the vote of whole reservations, Semans said. Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, Minnesota and Arizona, each of which has a sizable Native population, are most likely to see a Native swing vote in 2020, Semans said. \u201cPolitical parties have taken for granted how Natives turn out and vote,\u201d Semans said. \u201cEither pay attention to us or don\u2019t count on us.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Elana Schor contributed to this report.",

He says the current system does not fairly treat people of color, addicts or the mentally ill. \u201cWe have a system that imprisons and destroys the lives of millions of people,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press before the planned released of his proposal Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s racist in disproportionately affecting the African American and Latino communities, and it\u2019s a system that needs fundamental change.\u201d Sanders was promoting the plan during a weekend of campaigning in South Carolina, where the majority of the Democratic electorate is African American. The Vermont senator, who won the support of some younger black Democrats during the 2016 primary, has stepped up his references to racial disparities, particularly during stops in the South and urban areas. As president, Sanders said he would abolish mandatory minimum sentencing and reinstate a federal parole system, end the \u201cthree strikes law\u201d and expand the use of alternative sentencing, including community supervision and halfway houses. The goal is to reduce the prison population by one-half. \u201cA very significant number of people who are behind bars today are dealing with one form or another of illness,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThese should be treated as health issues, not from a criminal perspective.\u201d According to the\u00a0National Alliance on Mental Illness\u00a0, 2 million people with mental illness are booked into jails annually. Taking aim at what his proposal calls \u201cfor-profit prison profiteering,\u201d Sanders would ban private prisons, make prison phone calls and other inmate communications free, and audit prison commissaries for price gouging and fees. The plan would legalize marijuana and expunge previous marijuana convictions, and end a cash bail system that Sanders says keeps hundreds of thousands who have not been convicted of a crime languishing in jail because they cannot afford bail. \u201cCan you believe that, in the year 2019, 400,000 people are in jail awaiting a trial because they are poor?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is a moral outrage, it is a legal outrage.\u201d According to the\u00a0Prison Policy Initiative\u00a0, more than 460,000 people are being held in local jails around the country while they await trial, with a median bail amount of $10,000 for felony offenses. Sanders wants to improve relations between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. To do that, he proposes to end federal programs that provide military equipment to local police forces, establish federal standards for the use of body cameras, provide bias training and require that the Justice Department review all officer-involved shootings. \u201cYou have a lot of resentment in minority communities all over this country, who see police forces not as an asset but as an invading force,\u201d Sanders said. On capital punishment, Sanders\u2019 plan formalizes his call to end the federal death penalty and urges states to eliminate the punishment as well. \u201cWhen we talk about violence in society and trying to lower the levels of violence, it is not appropriate that the state itself is part of capital punishment,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders said that over the long term, his plan will save the public money because of reductions to overall incarceration costs. \u201cIt will cost money but it will pay for itself many, many times over,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLocking people up is very, very expensive.\u201d ___ Kinnard can be reached at\u00a0http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " WOLFEBORO, N.H. \u2015 If you\u2019re a progressive voter trying to figure out whether to support Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren in the battle for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential nomination, don\u2019t expect them to make the choice easy for you. \u201cElizabeth is a friend of mine and you will make that decision yourself,\u201d Sanders said last week at a town hall here after an attendee asked the Vermont senator why voters should support him over his Senate colleague from Massachusetts, with whom he agrees on many issues. Warren has made similar pledges not to go after rivals in the race, particularly citing her friendship with Sanders that began \u201clong before I ever got into politics.\u201d But even though the two progressive standard-bearers share similar commitments to the need for structural change on several policy fronts, they\u2019re approaching voters on the campaign trail with strikingly different messages. During recent swings each made in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, for example, they detailed their plans to address wealth inequality, the growing threat of climate change and problems with the nation\u2019s health care, criminal justice and education systems. Sanders, however, placed a far greater emphasis on the need to lower health care costs by instituting a single-payer model, known as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d The issue dominated his stump speech at all four events he held in the state, where he quizzed supporters on the cost of their insurance premiums and talked up his recent trip to get insulin at a pharmacy in Canada. The renewed focus on his signature proposal is part of an effort to distinguish himself from his rivals, many of whom have embraced his health care plan. Sanders\u2019 relentless focus on the issue \u201cto me suggests that this is something he is just fundamentally committed to,\u201d Jeremy Mele, a supporter from Maine, told HuffPost at the rally in Wolfeboro.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not saying Warren won\u2019t support people to have health care, but it might just mean it\u2019s not her priority when she\u2019s in office.\u201d Warren, meanwhile, spent much more time at her campaign events spotlighting her plans to fight the influence of special interests in Washington and her proposed tax on the super-rich, an idea Sanders has also supported. The latter proposal would levy a 2% percent tax on assets over $50 million and a 3% tax on assets over $1 billion. Or, as she described it at a town hall gathering in Franconia last week, requiring those \u201cnot just at the top, but at the top of the top of the top\u201d to pay more in taxes to help finance expanded social programs. \u201cThe point is not to be cranky, the point is not to say, \u2018Shame on you,\u2019\u201d Warren said of her wealth tax. \u201cYou built a great fortune, good for you! But you built it at least in part using workers all of us paid to educate.\u201d An even more striking difference in their pitch to voters concerns style, however. Sanders, a known commodity in New Hampshire (his overwhelming win in the state\u2019s 2016 primary propelled his sustained but failed bid for the nomination against Hillary Clinton), wasted no time diving into problems he\u2019s been railing about for decades. He proudly cast himself as an antagonist to the political establishment \u2015 including the Democratic Party and the media. He rarely strayed into his personal biography, and seemed less comfortable than most White House seekers with pressing the flesh. Warren\u2019s stump speech, by contrast, is rooted in recounting her\u00a0family\u2019s struggles trying to make ends meet in Oklahoma. Recalling stories about her mother, her aunt, and her Republican brothers, she weaves a compelling narrative that struggling Americans can easily identify with. And she seems to particularly enjoy taking selfies with her supporters, which she refers to as \u201cthe fun part\u201d of her campaign events. (She took photos with attendees for over an hour\u00a0after a rally in Minnesota this week). Her strategy has resonated with voters: Warren, 70, has slowly inched up in the polls to vie with Sanders, 77, as the leading rival to former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, the frontrunner for the Democratic nod\u00a0who has advocated a more moderate and incremental approach to governing. \u201cShe comes off a little more younger,\u201d said Neil Brody, a real estate company owner from Bethlehem, New Hampshire, who supported Sanders in 2016. \u201cShe\u2019s better at explaining things. She tells a better story. Bernie just says it.\u201d Twig Notman, a part-time nurse from Vermont, said she\u2019d like to see a Warren-Sanders ticket in the general election. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked Bernie, I voted for him last time. But he\u2019s kind of past his prime,\u201d she said. Polls show support for Sanders and Warren does differ in some key demographic aspects despite their mutual appeal to progressives. While he tends to draw more lower-income and less-educated people, she does better with college-educated voters. Sanders performs better with men, while Warren does so with women. Moreover, her message\u00a0hasn\u2019t resonated as well as his with Black voters. More broadly, Sanders supporters tend to identify as independents or democratic socialists, while those backing Warren more often self-identified as Democrats. The differences between their respective bases mean neither has too much to gain by going after the other, and they\u2019ve maintained an informal non-aggression pact so far. But as the Democratic race intensifies, that stance is likely to show signs of strain, if not dissipate. And their more fervent and high-profile supporters may become less restrained, as well. On Monday, for example, actress and activist Susan Sarandon took an apparent dig at Warren as she introduced Sanders at a campaign event in Iowa. \u201cHe is not someone who used to be a Republican,\u201d said Sarandon, a Sanders campaign surrogate.\u00a0She didn\u2019t mention Warren by name, but the Massachusetts senator was a registered Republican in the mid-1990s.",

He said Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats show \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d Trump made the remark to reporters when speaking about Israel barring Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from entering the country. While he did not specifically say who Democratic Jewish Americans would be disloyal to, he has previously called the Muslim congresswomen \u201canti-Israel\u201d and \u201canti-Semites,\u201d and equated Israel with all Jewish people. Nearly 80% of Jewish voters in the U.S. voted Democratic in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center. Many Jewish groups, including the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said Trump was invoking the \u201cdual loyalty\u201d trope against Jewish Americans that is considered anti-Semitic. Sanders often references his family\u2019s experience in the Holocaust. His father migrated to the U.S. as a teenager, fleeing persecution in Poland. Sanders has also made it a point to balance talking about his Jewish heritage with his criticism of the Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinian people. The senator has continuously vocalized support for Omar and Tlaib, who are attacked daily for their criticism of Israel\u2019s government and their support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. After Israel announced its decision to bar the congresswomen, Omar stressed the need for more oversight of the billions of dollars the U.S. gives in aid to Israel every year. Sanders agreed with Omar, saying that Israel should decline U.S. aid if it\u2019s going to prevent a congresswoman from entering the country. \u201cIf Israel doesn\u2019t want members of the United States Congress to visit their country, to get a firsthand look at what\u2019s going on, and I have been there many, many times, but if [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] doesn\u2019t want members to visit, maybe he can respectfully decline the billions of dollars that we give to Israel,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In\u201d last week.

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, rolled out a sweeping plan to expand the rights of workers and unions, including giving federal employees the right to strike, making it easier to form unions, eliminating so-called right-to-work laws and allowing unions in the same industry to jointly negotiate with employers. Sanders, who is currently in the top tier of candidates for the party\u2019s nomination, is competing for union endorsements with former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), and the plan could help woo organized labor in the critical early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Unions can provide crucial volunteers and cash to help put campaigns over the top. The plan is based on the Workplace Democracy Act, legislation Sanders has introduced every year since he arrived in Congress in 1992. \u201cThere are many reasons for the growing inequality in our economy, but one of the most significant reasons for the disappearing middle class is that the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign wrote in rolling out the plan. The campaign said Sanders would aim to double union membership during his first four-year term in office. Union membership has long been in decline in the United States, and only about 1 in 10 workers are members of a union today. Sanders and other progressives have long argued the decline of unions has been a leading driver of economic inequality \u2015 unionized employees typically make more money and are more likely to have health coverage and strong retirement plans. By executive order, Sanders would require federal contractors to take steps to make their workplaces more employee-friendly: They\u2019d be barred from outsourcing jobs, paying their CEOs more than 150 times what their average worker makes and be required to pay workers at least $15 an hour. He\u2019d also push to give federal employees the ability to strike for the first time. Other steps would require a friendly Congress: Sanders would propose eliminating the section of the Taft-Hartley Act that allows states to adopt right-to-work laws that undermine unions. He\u2019d also seek to make union organizing easier with majority sign-up, also known as \u201ccard check.\u201d His plan would seek to bar corporations from forcing employees to attend anti-union meetings and would push for a law guaranteeing the ability of public sector workers to collectively bargain. The last provision could prove particularly popular in Iowa. In 2017, the state\u2019s Republican-controlled government passed a law that said public employees in the Hawkeye State could negotiate only over wages, not for health care or other benefits. Another major union priority included in the plan and that would require congressional approval is sectoral bargaining, which allows unions across a single industry to bargain together and set universal standards for wages and benefits.",

On Tuesday, the singer tweeted a short clip of various 2016 presidential hopefuls, including Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about to observe the national anthem at a Democratic presidential debate. However, the video features Lizzo\u2019s song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d as the anthem. \u201cWhy men great \u2019til they gotta be great? Woo,\u201d Lizzo sings as Clinton, Sanders and others hold their hands over their hearts. The next day, Clinton responded to the tweet with the opening of the song\u2019s first verse: \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out...\u201d The full lyric is \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d Sadly, Clinton did not tweet that part. It\u2019s not clear why Clinton (or her team) chose to respond to this tweet in this way, but relating with singers and rappers seems to be all the rage these days. Rapper Cardi B has long been an admirer of Sanders, and last week the senator\u2019s team released a video of her interviewing him about police reform, minimum wage and health care. And earlier this month, the team of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted a line from \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d in response to a now-unavailable tweet. So, if this country is looking for something to unite both parties, it seems our biggest hope may lie in Lizzo.",

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders released a sweeping $16.3 trillion climate plan on Thursday, vowing to create 20 million jobs and completely zero out planet-heating emissions by 2050. The proposal outlines easily the most ambitious vision for a Green New Deal to date, with calls to massively expand public ownership of everything from power generation to groceries. With Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ending his climate-centered bid for the Democratic nomination a day earlier, the plan vaults the Vermont senator ahead of his 2020 rivals on what\u2019s emerging as the defining policy issue of the Democratic primary. At a moment when record wildfires are raging from the Amazon to the Arctic and Greenland is losing up to 12.5 billion tons of ice in a single day, the plan is dense with detail and frank in its goals. Where other proposals, including those from Inslee and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) depict expanded regulatory regimes and public spending aimed at spurring private investment, Sanders charts out a path to a hospitable global climate through Nordic-style social democracy. \u201cThe scope of the challenge ahead of us shares some similarities with the crisis faced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1940s,\u201d the plan states. \u201cFaced with battling a world war on two fronts \u2015 both in the East and the West \u2015 the United States came together, and within three short years restructured the entire economy in order to win the war and defeat fascism. As president, Bernie Sanders will boldly embrace the moral imperative of addressing the climate crisis.\u201d The campaign declined a request to interview Sanders on Wednesday evening. The plan opens with Sanders vowing to slash U.S. emissions 71% below 2017 levels by 2030 with 100% renewable electricity and zero-emissions vehicles. He declares war on the fossil fuel industry with proposed bans on fracking, drilling on public lands and all imports and exports of oil and gas, and threatens companies with civil and criminal charges for pollution and obstructing climate action. He pledges $200 billion to help developing countries reduce their own climate pollution by 36% in the next decade. Citing the nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima, Sanders, long a critic of nuclear power, swears off new reactors and promises a moratorium on future licenses to existing plants. His plan rules out geoengineering the climate or deploying technologies to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuel plants, which he derided as \u201cfalse solutions.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019d consider carbon capture technologies for difficult-to-decarbonize industries like cement making. Generous pledges for workers animate Sanders\u2019 proposal. The plan, which comes the same week the campaign released its proposal to boost unions, promises five years of unemployment insurance, a wage guarantee, housing assistance, job training, pension support and priority job placement for all workers displaced by the transition. It offers \u201cearly retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work.\u201d It proposes high wages and union protections across nearly every sector. What stands out first is Sanders\u2019 clear answer to the perennial question of how to pay for it. There\u2019s the money saved: $1.215 trillion from \u201cscaling back military spending on protecting global oil\u201d and $1.31 trillion from federal and state welfare \u201cdue to the creation of millions of good-paying, unionized jobs.\u201d Then there\u2019s the money earned: $6.4 trillion from selling electricity produced by the Energy Department\u2019s regional power marketing authorities, $3.085 trillion from \u201cmaking the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies,\u201d $2.3 trillion from income taxes on the 20 million new jobs the plan creates, and an additional $2 trillion from forcing \u201cthe wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share.\u201d Those pushing a Green New Deal, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and the grassroots group Sunrise Movement, have shied away from talking numbers, even as Republicans fabricated a bogus $93 trillion price tag. Instead, advocates have pointed to the costs of sticking to a business-as-usual. The Sanders plan touches on that, too, highlighting that the costs of catastrophic warming could total $70.4 trillion over 80 years. \u201cThis plan will pay for itself over 15 years,\u201d the policy memo reads. \u201cExperts have scored the plan and its economic effects.\u201d The 13,840-word document includes 85 dollar signs. Sanders sets aside $5.9 billion for regional economic development plans, with the lion\u2019s share \u2015 over $2.5 billion \u2015 earmarked for Appalachia. There\u2019s $15 billion for coal miners\u2019 Black Lung Disability Fund. Another $25 billion goes to clearing the national park maintenance backlog. The restored Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal program that planted 3 billion trees in the 1930s, gets $171 billion. Yet the plan aims to correct the original New Deal\u2019s racist legacy. It envisions a beefed up Office of Civil Rights at the Environmental Protection Agency and vows to give \u201cminority and women-owned businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms\u201d priority in federal contracts. It promises to adhere to the principles of environmental justice set out at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 and abide by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The plan calls for creating a $40 billion Climate Justice Resiliency Fund at the Environmental Protection Agency to \u201cconduct a nationwide survey to identify areas with high climate impact vulnerabilities and other socioeconomic factors, public health challenges, and environmental hazards,\u201d then offer block grants \u201cin order of most vulnerable to least vulnerable.\u201d The program would establish a special Office of Climate Resiliency for People with Disabilities to \u201censure that nationwide, the needs of people with disabilities are consistently addressed during adaptation planning and that those efforts are coordinated throughout the federal government.\u201d \u201cThe first two years of this plan will be spent very aggressively laying down a social safety net to ensure that no one is left behind,\u201d the proposal reads. \u201cBecause this plan is so comprehensive in ensuring we solve the climate crisis, we must prioritize establishing a social safety net in the first years of the implementation of this plan.\u201d Water factors heavily into the plan. Sanders, who in February introduced the $35 billion WATER Act to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, calls for its passage in the plan as a means of freeing communities from Flint, Michigan, to Newark, New Jersey, of lead and toxic chemical contaminations. It\u2019s unclear how much of the plan will cover the American territories of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa. But the proposal promises to expand federal food stamp protections to all five. In an email, a Sanders spokesman said resiliency fund would \u201dprovide significant funding to the territories for a just transition including real jobs, resilient infrastructure, economic development.\u201d Where Sanders\u2019 plan diverges most from those of Warren, Inslee and others is in its explicit calls for scaling the public sector in ways unseen since the 1940s. Power marketing administrations, seldom-discussed agencies under the Energy Department that operate transmission lines and sell electricity generated at federally owned hydro dams, are central to the plan. The federal government built four such regional administrations between 1937 and 1977. Sanders calls for building a fifth to cover the states and territories currently outside the other four\u2019s jurisdiction. He earmarks $1.52 trillion to convert the entire operations to\u00a0 wind, solar and geothermal, and an additional $852 billion to build energy storage capacity. The federal revenues from ratepayers are expected to fund the Green New Deal. But the build-out of fuel-free electricity means that, per the plan, \u201cafter 2035 electricity will be virtually free, aside from operations and maintenance costs.\u201d The plan even offers $14.7 billion in federal investments in cooperatively owned grocery stores. \u201cLocal groceries and co-ops are more likely to buy local products, which will help grow markets for farmers to sell their goods,\u201d the plan reads. \u201cWe will also use these funds to bring grocery stores to food deserts ensuring all people have access to healthy, local food.\u201d Harkening to the rural revitalization plan Sanders released earlier this year, the proposal makes a vague call to \u201cincentivize community ownership of farmland.\u201d \u201cOne of the barriers to being able to choose a career in ecologically regenerative farming is the cost of acquiring farmland,\u201d it states. \u201cWe want communities to be able to join together to own farmland to help people grow our local, ecologically regeneratively produced food and help solve the climate crisis and will provide government assistance to do so.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine the political right smearing the proposal as a Soviet-style takeover by an avowed democratic socialist. In reality, the plan leans more toward the first half of Sanders\u2019 self-professed ideological bent than the latter. The proposal redirects subsidies and incentives heaped on big businesses to small ones. It invests $31 billion in local food plants, including slaughterhouses and dairy processors. \u201cRampant consolidation in processing has led to a lack of facilities for small-scale, local producers,\u201d it reads. \u201cInvesting in local facilities will help smaller producers to compete with the Tyson Foods of the world.\u201d The plan provides nearly $3 trillion in grants to lower-income families and small businesses to trade in combustion-engine vehicles for all-electric alternatives. It offers tax credits to businesses that hire workers transitioning out of fossil fuel jobs. Nearly $2.2 trillion is budgeted for grants to homeowners and small businesses to weatherize buildings. An additional $964 billion goes to grants for those same homeowners and businesses to replace gas-fired appliances with electric alternatives. It sets aside $410 billion to pay farmers to store carbon dioxide in soil and \u201ctransition to ecologically regenerative agricultural practices that rebuild rural communities, protect the climate, and strengthen the environment.\u201d \u201cWe need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cWe need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders (I-VT.), while campaigning at the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday, suggested he would not abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said he would get rid of ICE raids but declined to say that he would scrap the agency altogether during a live-taping of an interview with MPR News, which hundreds of fairgoers had gathered to watch. Asked if he agreed with a woman in the crowd who shouted \u201cabolish ICE\u201d during the audience Q&A portion of the interview, Sanders told MPR News host Tom Crann that he would abolish \u201cthe current disastrous immigration system.\u201d \u201cICE is one small part of that system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have to develop a system. But I will say this: We will abolish the ICE raids, which are terrorizing communities all over this country.\u201d Crann continued to press the Vermont senator, asking if he sees \u201ca valid purpose for an agency in the federal government like ICE.\u201d \u201cThe first question you asked, do I believe in open borders? No, I do not,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cSo you need to have protection of our borders and you need people to do that.\u201d The question of whether to abolish ICE has become somewhat of a litmus test among 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Sanders\u2019 comments Saturday mark his strongest statement against shutting down the agency to date. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam are the only two 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls who have called for ICE to be abolished. Sanders has previously called for the restructuring of the immigration enforcement agency and voted against establishing ICE and the Department of Homeland Security when they were proposed over 15 years ago. \u201cICE has become a deportation and detention machine,\u201d\u00a0Sanders said in July 2018. \u201cAnd I would fundamentally restructure the agency, as well as all the agencies that currently enforce our immigration laws, to create a humane and rational immigration system with independent oversight.\u201d Watch Sanders\u2019s full interview with MPR News below.

      "author": "",
      "content": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Andy Vila\u2019s mother remembers her son as a bright, rebellious child who enjoyed Harry Potter books and dressing up as the U.S. president. But when he began to embrace the same ideology his family had fled in socialist Cuba, she pleaded in vain for him to stop his political activism. His socialism made Vila an outlier in his Miami community and opened deep rifts with relatives. He was briefly exiled from home, and his mother entered therapy to bridge their differences. To mention socialism at family dinners, \u201cthat\u2019s a no-go,\u201d Vila said. Relatives would \u201clook at me funny and say, \u2018We\u2019ve escaped that.\u2019\u201d At 21, Vila is part of a wave of young Americans openly supporting socialism, even among Miami\u2019s staunchly anti-left Cubans. Although the definition of the ideology varies widely, it is making particular inroads among millennials and Generation Z voters, who are expected to make up 37% of the 2020 U.S. electorate, according to the Pew Research Center. While more than half of Americans rejected socialism in a recent Gallup poll, 43% surveyed said some version of it would be good for the country. That sentiment was held by 58% of respondents ages 18 to 34, compared with just 36% of those 55 and older. The popularity of self-described democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has influenced the 2020 Democratic candidates, several of whom say they at least partially support socialist-style policies. Vila emigrated from Cuba with his parents in 2004, receiving asylum and a pathway to citizenship. Initially optimistic about a new country where anything seemed possible, he became disillusioned with the American dream after his family lost its home during the Great Recession. As a teen, he identified as a Libertarian-style Republican and spent hours watching YouTube clips of conservative provocateurs lambasting liberals. He served as a congressional intern for longtime Miami Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, and joined a conservative college group. But something began to shift during the 2016 election. Donald Trump and the Republican Party\u2019s increasingly hostile stance toward immigration alienated Vila, though he agreed with the party on other issues. Course readings led him to question his beliefs further. He started attending left-leaning campus events, interacting with students of varying racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. He discovered a Miami beyond his manicured suburban neighborhood. By year\u2019s end, he had developed a disdain for capitalism and the political right. Now the sociology and geography major wants sweeping reforms, including Medicare for all, free access to higher education and a Green New Deal. Americans who came of age during the last recession often embrace a larger government role in social policy. They cite stagnant wages, student loan debt and a decrease in employer-sponsored health insurance and pensions, according to University of California-Irvine political sociologist Edwin Amenta. Younger Americans are less threatened by socialism than older generations, who might associate it with Soviet or Chinese rule, he said. \u201cToday\u2019s socialism for younger people means the Canadian health system and the Swedish welfare state,\u201d Amenta said. More than half of Miami-area Cuban Americans are Republican, though an increasing number register as independent, according to a 2018 Florida International University poll. Their Republican allegiance dates to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign and its emphasis on destabilizing left-wing governments, according to Guillermo Grenier, researcher for the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. \u201cReagan made it clear that the foreign policy of the Republicans would most benefit Cubans if they wanted to go back to Cuba,\u201d Grenier said. Although they remained here, being Republican became \u201ckind of like an identity\u201d for generations of Cuban Americans, he said. The shift away from that identity has put conservative lawmakers on the defensive, especially in Florida, where Republicans have deployed what some observers call \u201cRed Scare\u201d tactics reminiscent of the anti-communist fervor of the 1950s. Other young Cubans are unmoved. Havana-born Ernesto Medina, 31, said he doesn\u2019t care \u201cwhat the old people think anymore.\u201d The Sanders supporter from Miami Beach is perplexed by older Cuban Americans who oppose any left-leaning candidate while benefiting from Social Security and government-subsided health care. Although he understands many were traumatized by events that lead to their exile, \u201cnobody leaves Cuba because they are running away from socialized health care and universal access higher education,\u201d he said. They fled a dictatorship. Curtis Hierro is also a socialist. The 32-year-old labor organizer, whose father joined thousands of Cuban refugees who migrated to Miami during the 1980 Mariel boatlift, said his generation is ready to invest in a \u201cpolitical system and economy that is just for working people\u201d even if it means ruffling a few feathers. Vila\u2019s mother, a hospice nurse, remembers many political arguments with her son. \u201cSocialism hasn\u2019t worked in any country in the world,\u201d said Milankys Lazo, 45, who speaks with the same passionate conviction as her only child. Their arguments intensified. Lazo warned that his activism could endanger the family. Although bluffing, she suggested he would have to move out if he persisted. Unbowed, Vila briefly left home. \u201cHonestly, I learned that Andy is an unwavering individual,\u201d she said. His morals were stronger than his own desire for comfort. Vila balks at the idea that he is betraying his people. He is proud of his roots and speaks a flavor of Spanish ripe with tones from Cuba\u2019s countryside, but declared he is \u201cvery much an American\u201d troubled by the state of the nation. He believes socialism will improve his family\u2019s life. \u201cMy politics don\u2019t concern Fidel Castro or the Cuban Communist Party,\u201d Vila added. In Little Havana, the heart of Miami\u2019s Cuban community, he walked past Cold War monuments and gazed into a park where elderly men played dominoes, many hoping to one day to return to a capitalist Cuba. \u201cIf I told them I was a socialist, they would kill me,\u201d Vila joked. At nearly the same time, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida denounced democratic socialism, hinting it could turn the U.S. into a failed state similar to countries many Americans escaped. \u201cThey are so afraid of us,\u201d Vila said. Young Cuban Americans are more concerned with current problems. \u201cMy opinions are based on the hardships that I\u2019ve seen people go through here.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) scored the first national labor union endorsement of his presidential candidacy on Monday, earning the support of the Pittsburgh-based United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). The 35,000-member union, among the country\u2019s smallest, backed Sanders\u2019 2016 bid and shares his unabashed anti-corporate populism. \u201cBernie understands the need for workers to have a democratic, independent union movement that is unafraid to challenge Corporate America\u2019s stranglehold on our economy,\u201d UE General President Peter Knowlton said in a statement. The UE endorsed Sanders at its national convention in Pittsburgh, and Sanders accepted it in a speech to the group on Monday. In its resolution supporting him in the crowded race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the union cited Sanders\u2019 outspoken support for the UE members employed at a locomotive manufacturing plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, who went on strike in February over concessions demanded by their employer, Wabtec. Among other shows of solidarity, Sanders invited a representative of the striking workers to speak at the kickoff rally for his White House bid in New York in early March. UE, which does not belong the AFL-CIO labor federation, occupies a radical, independent role in the labor movement that parallels Sanders\u2019 status in Congress. The CIO, a precursor to the AFL-CIO, expelled the UE and other unions in 1949 over their alleged communist sympathies, according to a history on UE\u2019s website. The mainstream labor movement\u2019s ostracism contributed to the shrinking of UE\u2019s membership but allowed it to stick to its left-wing political views and militant, rank-and-file-driven approach to labor organizing. For example, unlike some labor unions that have either come out against \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health care or merely given it lip service, the UE actively promotes it and featured it as a key justification for its endorsement of Sanders. (In fact, UE\u2019s support for Sanders goes back to his first victorious run for Congress in 1990, when he defeated both an incumbent Republican congressman and a Democratic challenger.) In remarks at the convention, Sanders said he was \u201chumbled\u201d to receive the union\u2019s backing. He also hailed the Wabtech strike, which led the company to compromise on some demands, as an example of the kind of worker activism he would like to enliven as president. \u201cUE\u2019s successful strike in Erie has sent a message to corporate CEOs across the country that it is absolutely unacceptable for profitable corporations to provide obscene compensation packages to executives while ripping off workers and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cOur fight is about the need for an economy that works for all Americans and not just the 1% percent, and we are going to win that fight together.\u201d Although UE lacks the membership size of its more establishmentarian counterparts in organized labor, it boasts a significant presence in the key general-election battleground state of Pennsylvania. That could help Sanders make his argument that he is the candidate best equipped to defeat President Donald Trump in the once-Democratic industrial states that propelled him to victory in 2016. National labor unions, which typically refer to themselves as \u201cinternational\u201d thanks to their membership in Canada, have been slower to endorse presidential candidates in the 2020 presidential primary field. Aside from UE\u2019s endorsement of Sanders, the International Association of Fire Fighters endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in April mere days after he announced his candidacy. Some unions elicited criticism from their members for backing the presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton early on in the 2016 election cycle, particularly from those who supported Sanders. In his 2016 run, however, Sanders did pick up the endorsements of more left-leaning unions, including UE, the National Nurses United, the Communication Workers of America and the American Postal Workers Union. Notably, NNU, which operated a pro-Sanders super PAC in 2016, had already endorsed him by this time in the last election cycle. This has been updated with more information about UE\u2019s support for Sanders in the past.",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a sweeping plan to protect American journalism on Monday, decrying President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, a spate of megamergers of media companies and the rise of Silicon Valley behemoths leeching advertising dollars from the news industry. \u201cToday, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read, and download,\u201d Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cGiven that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and \u2018benevolent\u2019 billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.\u201d Read the full article in the Columbia Journalism Review. Newsroom employment across the U.S. has plummeted since 2008, and the Pew Research Center said last month that the total number of journalism jobs was slashed by nearly a quarter over the past decade. The cuts were largely seen at newspapers, but other massive digital enterprises have seen dramatic rounds of layoffs in recent years, including BuzzFeed, Vice and HuffPost. From January to May of this year, about 3,000 people working in the news industry were laid off or offered a buyout package, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. At the same time, news companies have been scrambling for ways to become profitable as traditional advertising dollars dry up (or hunted for billionaire benefactors, such as Jeff Bezos\u2019 purchase of The Washington Post or Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s of the Los Angeles Times). Sanders noted that much of that cash still exists, and as of this year, digital advertising\u00a0outpaces both print and television ad revenue.\u00a0But the money largely flows to Google and Facebook, who control about 60% of the digital advertising market. \u201cWe need to rebuild and protect a diverse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires,\u201d Sanders said. Were he to unseat Trump in the 2020 election, Sanders said he would issue an \u201cimmediate moratorium\u201d on mergers of major media corporations and instead focus on protections for local, independent news outlets. The senator also said he would appoint an attorney general to oversee tech giants like Facebook and Google to stop efforts to \u201ccannibalize, bilk, and defund news organizations.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse.\u201d Sanders said he planned to further support initiatives to unionize newsrooms as well as pushing for a plan that could see employees buy their media outlets through a stock-ownership plan before the companies are sold. Sanders has been a leading contender among the crowded Democratic presidential field. A new national poll released Monday showed the senator in a virtual three-way tie with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (although it\u2019s still early to put much faith in such numbers before the primaries even begin, and other polls have had different results). Recode\u00a0notes\u00a0that the Sanders campaign has\u00a0grown frustrated with the media\u00a0in the past, lambasting the \u201ccorporate media\u201d at times. Earlier this month, Sanders suggested that\u00a0Bezos influenced The Washington Post\u2019s coverage\u00a0and was more critical of him than other candidates. The remarks prompted the executive editor of the Post to fire back,\u00a0calling the idea a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d\u00a0while assuring readers that the newspaper operates with \u201cfull independence.\u201d Regardless of the tiff, the plan presents a dramatic and novel effort among the Democratic candidates to better protect a free press, a far cry from Trump\u2019s blistering criticism of anyone and everyone critical of his administration. \u201cOur constitution\u2019s First Amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy,\u201d Sanders wrote on Monday. \u201cMore than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda.\u201d",

      "content": " Staff and volunteers for the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have organized and hosted over 11,000 events, including more than 2,000 in California, the campaign announced Tuesday evening. The vast majority of the events have been organized by volunteers, according to the campaign. The achievement, which top Sanders campaign organizers revealed in a conference call with over 7,000 supporters, reflects what the Sanders campaign sees as a secret weapon as it seeks to stand out in a crowded field of candidates: a \u201cdistributed\u201d \u2015 or volunteer-run \u2015 organizing system that it innovated in the 2016 race and has since fine-tuned. Joining the call with volunteers after several of his advisers spoke, Sanders affirmed that, although the campaign would engage in conventional tactics like television and radio advertisements, its strength was the devotion of its supporters, many of whom have become volunteers. \u201cWe are going to win this campaign because we ... are going to have the strongest grassroots movement of any campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how we win this thing. We win this going to our base, our strength of support.\u201d The conceit of distributed organizing, which has its fair share of skeptics, is that campaigns can amplify by orders of magnitude the effect of the staff they employ directly by empowering exceptionally motivated volunteers to run their own house parties, lead their own canvasses and develop, and monitor their own voter contacts by phone and text message. It differs from traditional campaign volunteering in terms of the resources and technology the Sanders campaign, and others inspired by it, have expended on creating an infrastructure to facilitate the work of its most dedicated supporters. It will be difficult to fully measure the organizing technique\u2019s effectiveness prior to Feb. 3, when Sanders competes in Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucus. On Tuesday evening\u2019s call, the campaign said its staff and volunteers had made 2 million calls and sent 30 million text messages to voters in early states. It also recently concluded a two-week campus organizing boot camp, or \u201csummer school,\u201d that it says graduated more than 1,500 college and graduate school students who plan to serve as campaign ambassadors and organizers at their universities. A viral initiative earlier this month asking Sanders supporters to share on social media the life experience that brought them to the campaign \u2015 dubbed \u201c#MyBernieStory\u201d \u2015 doubled as a volunteer recruitment technique. The campaign directed Sanders supporters who used the campaign\u2019s organizing app, Bern, to post \u201c#MyBernieStory\u201d on Twitter or Facebook to use a digital tool to contact several other voters by text message and encourage them to get involved in the campaign. The campaign estimates that it reached the equivalent number of voters through those digitally facilitated connections as it would normally reach from knocking on 63,000 doors. Critics of distributed organizing argue that it is no substitute for the professionally run field organizing teams that have powered successful presidential campaigns. And on that front, Sanders got a later start than some of his rivals, beginning hiring field organizers in the early states only in May. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, by contrast, already had 50 staff members in Iowa by that time. The Sanders campaign insists, though, that distributed organizing aims not to supplant traditional field organizing but to magnify its impact. It now has dozens of paid, full-time field organizers in each of the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as in California, a Super Tuesday state with a primary open to all registered voters. The conference call noted the campaign\u2019s distributed organizing strategy has gone from identifying and recruiting volunteers to now putting that volunteer army to work more aggressively. Campaign organizing leaders invited call participants to volunteer in real time to host a \u201cPlan to Win\u201d house party in September, where volunteers will bond with their peers and receive marching orders for the next phase of the campaign. The campaign said it received 1,700 commitments from volunteers on the call to host such house parties. The Sanders campaign is hoping to capitalize on the momentum it has developed in recent weeks after a series of high-profile policy rollouts and endorsements, including his first official declaration of support from a national labor union. The Sanders campaign, which has tangled bitterly with media outlets and pollsters for what it believes is bias against the Vermont senator,\u00a0touted a national poll released Monday that showed Sanders in a statistical three-way tie for first place with Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden. But Sanders still trails Biden in the averages of polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, states that are essential to his success. His campaign has argued that polls, which generally survey a universe of likely voters, do not account for the ways in which his campaign is seeking to turn out infrequent and new voters often left out of polling.\u00a0At least one leading pollster has disputed the Sanders campaign\u2019s analysis of the polls\u2019 shortcomings. Still, the Sanders campaign believes its success hinges on reaching those non-traditional voters \u2015 and sees its volunteer force as a key tool to do it. \u201cWe will win this election \u2015 we will win the Democratic nomination, we will defeat Trump \u2015 because we are going to bring out people who, in many cases, have not participated in politics before,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday evening. \u201cAnd I\u2019m talking about a generation of young people who in my view are the most progressive generation in the history of our country \u2015 anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobia, anti-religious bigotry.\u201d",

In a significant shift, the field of presidential candidates participating will be cut in half from the previous debates, ABC News announced Thursday. Per\u00a0guidelines for the event\u00a0published by ABC News, which is hosting the event with Univision, the debate would have stretched across two nights if more than 10 candidates had met the qualifications set by the Democratic National Committee. But only 10\u00a0candidates\u00a0qualified by the Aug. 28 deadline.\u00a0Here\u2019s the list of candidates who will participate in the Sept. 12 event, in the order they will appear on stage, from left to right: Those who failed to qualify include: After failing to qualify for the debate, Gillibrand dropped out of the race. To earn a spot in the third debate, each presidential hopeful had to have more than 2% support in at least four national polls or in polls of early-voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. The candidates also must have raised funds from at least 130,000 individual donors and show that they have 400 unique donors from at least 20 different states. Voters will finally have a chance to compare and contrast all the front-runners on the same stage at the same time. The two previous Democratic debates split up the large field over two-night events, neither of which featured Biden and Warren onstage together. Per ABC News, moderators will allow 1 minute, 15 seconds for direct responses to questions, and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. In contrast to past debates, there will be no closing statements. Candidates will, however, be allowed to deliver opening statements. This article has been updated to include Gillibrand\u2019s departure from the race.",

      "content": " HAMPTON FALLS, N.H. \u2015 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the two most progressive top-tier candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, defended their ability to defeat President Donald Trump during campaign swings through New Hampshire on Labor Day weekend, offering spirited though somewhat different cases for their general election viability. Warren had to address the electability question directly, since it came up in a brief question session with voters on Monday following remarks to a crowd of 800 that braved the rain to hear her speak in the backyard of a supporter in the coastal town of Hampton Falls. Linda Rhodes, a Warren partisan active in the liberal advocacy group Indivisible New Hampshire, asked Warren what to tell people who say they like Warren\u2019s ideas but are not sure she can beat Trump in the general election. Warren began by promoting her pugnacity. \u201cI know how to fight and I know how to win,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a big part of it. You have to be willing to get in this fight all the way.\u201d She also argued that backing a candidate with ambitious ideas for solving people\u2019s problems, many of which predate Trump, is a surer way to motivate them to show up on Election Day than merely promising to roll back the clock to before Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cBeing willing to confront the big problems in this country and then producing plans, real plans, for big structural change \u2015 that\u2019s what people want in this country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to give people a reason to show up and vote and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d In her response, Warren appeared to take a veiled swipe at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has argued that if Trump loses, his presidency will be seen as \u201can aberration,\u201d rather than the product of structural problems plaguing the country. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretending that everything was just fine and then there was this one problem and we get rid of that one problem, it\u2019s all going to work out \u2015 \u2019cause it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. We have problems going back decades now.\u201d Sanders took a more prosaic approach to the topic in three campaign speeches in Raymond and Dover, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, on Sunday. The Vermont senator, who has led Trump in polls of a hypothetical matchup since Sanders\u2019 unsuccessful 2016 primary run, made the argument for his general election viability by pointing to polls that show him ahead once again. He is especially fond of citing a late August poll that showed him beating Trump by 14 percentage points. (The same survey, conducted by Quinnipiac University, found that five Democrats would beat Trump, though Biden had the largest margin of victory with a 16-point edge; Warren bested Trump by 12 points.) Sanders summarized the poll results to a crowd of over 375 in Raymond, before setting out the stakes of a potential showdown with Trump, whom he dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous president in the modern history of this country.\u201d \u201cWe have to get rid of that person in the White House. And with your help, that is exactly what we are going to do,\u201d he declared. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, top Sanders surrogates and co-founders of the Vermont-based ice cream brand Ben & Jerry\u2019s, had a similar message in their remarks introducing Sanders. In poll after poll, Cohen said, \u201cBernie beats Trump.\u201d He repeated the phrase like a mantra, until the crowd, assembled in chairs in a muggy high school auditorium, repeated it like a chant, \u201cBernie beats Trump/ Bernie beats Trump.\u201d At their core though, Sanders and Warren share a conviction that they are running not just to undo Trump\u2019s policies, but to curb the economic inequality and political corruption that they maintain have gripped the country for at least four decades. \u201cI\u2019m going to need your help, the day after we are inaugurated,\u201d Sanders said in Raymond. \u201cWe need your help to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite who have been at war against the working class of this country for the last 45 years.\u201d Both candidates\u2019 electability pitches are likely responses to Biden\u2019s standing in the polls. He has led the pack in early primary and caucus states since entering the race in April. Poll watchers tend to attribute Biden\u2019s lead, at least partly, to his perceived strength as a general election candidate. The former vice president has projected an air of inevitability, training his attention on Trump far more than on his Democratic rivals. And in August, Biden\u2019s wife Jill explicitly pitched her husband\u2019s electability, telling Iowans, \u201cYou may like another candidate better, but you have to look at who is going to win.\u201d Although Warren and Sanders are often cast as the most idealistic in the Democratic presidential primary field, there was some evidence over the holiday weekend that voters are buying the pragmatic case for them at the top of the ticket. Sue Hartman, a retired educator who came to see Sanders in Portland, Maine, stood outside the State Theatre after Sanders spoke to a crowd of almost 2,000 people on Sunday night with a look of awed exhaustion on her face. Asked why she supported Sanders, Hartman volunteered his strength as a general election contender. \u201cWho can step up and slay the dragon? None of those other candidates can slay the dragon the way Bernie can,\u201d she said. \u201cThe others don\u2019t have the fire in the belly.\u201d Kevin Webb, a renewable energy professional from Exeter, New Hampshire, who came to see Warren in Hampton Falls, likewise pointed to how she would fare against Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump can keep up with her. All he has is a racist label \u2015 and nothing else,\u201d said Webb, referring to Trump\u2019s repeated mockery of Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d because of the Native American heritage she has claimed. Other voters who came to see the two candidates described enjoying hearing them speak, but expressed more confidence in other candidates\u2019 abilities to defeat Trump. John Leahy, a retired information technology firm manager from Exeter who came with three family members to hear Warren speak on Monday, said after the speech that he was leaning toward Biden. The former vice president\u2019s more moderate profile, Leahy reasoned, makes him \u201cpotentially a very strong candidate against Trump.\u201d Regina Phillips, a consultant who came to see Sanders speak in Portland with her two sisters, said after his speech that she was \u201cfeeling the Bern.\u201d But pressed on her plans for the Maine primary, slated for Super Tuesday on March 3, Phillips said she was still undecided. \u201cI need to actually see who can beat Donald Trump. That\u2019s the person I can vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s Bernie. He said he\u2019s 14 percent ahead of Trump, but I know Biden\u2019s ahead of Trump too.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday pointed to global warming as a major cause of Hurricane Dorian, which has pummeled the Bahamas\u00a0with devastating winds and massive flooding and is slowly churning toward the coast of Florida. In a tweet, the Democratic presidential candidate slammed the fossil fuel industry for wreaking havoc on the environment, arguing that it \u201ccreates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility.\u201d \u201cLet us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time,\u201d he added. Sanders\u2019 remarks were spurred by a New York Times op-ed on worsening hurricanes, which was shared by the New Consensus, a liberal think tank helping to develop the Green New Deal. Sander\u2019s is a co-sponsor of a version of the Green New Deal. which proposes a broad range of environmental and economic initiatives and has been closely linked to freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). As of Tuesday, Dorian had wound down from a Category 5 storm to a Category 2. It was initially able to gain significant force by feeding on warm ocean waters. Though it may be too early to determine the exact impact of climate change on the hurricane\u2019s development, the warming of the planet\u2019s oceans seems to have fueled upticks in the intensity of hurricanes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more than 90% of Earth\u2019s warming over the last 50 years has occurred in the planet\u2019s oceans, where heat is absorbed much more readily than on land. The 2018 National Climate Assessment, published by the federally mandated U.S. Global Change Research Program, pointed to the rise in greenhouse gasses as a contributing factor in triggering hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean region. It also attributed the intensity of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to \u201ca combination of natural and human-caused\u201d elements. That year\u2019s hurricanes included Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria \u2015 each of which reached Category 5 or 4 intensity.",

      "content": "The head of the United Mine Workers of America doesn\u2019t trust Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal to deliver for coal miners. In a press conference Wednesday that was part political speech and part history lesson, UMWA President Cecil Roberts said miners have been jilted too many times to expect Congress to take care of them in a government-led shift away from fossil fuels. \u201cWhen people tell us, \u2018we\u2019re going to pass legislation, you\u2019re going to have the best jobs in the world, they\u2019re going to be union jobs, don\u2019t worry about anything\u2019\u2026 we don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roberts said at the National Press Club in Washington. \u201cWhen people keep telling us how wonderful we\u2019re going to have it, we\u2019ve got many reasons to believe that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Roberts pointed to the constant political fights his union has waged to preserve pensions and retiree health benefits over the last two decades, as coal companies have tried to shed their obligations through bankruptcy proceedings. The UMWA\u2019s pension plan is on track to become insolvent within just a few years, and Congress has done nothing so far to make sure miners don\u2019t end up with pennies on the dollar. \u201cPeople are talking about us needing a \u2018transition\u2019\u2026 Well, our transition has unfortunately been at the bankruptcy court,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNobody cares about this. Let\u2019s be honest.\u201d Roberts\u2019 speech, delivered the same day a climate town hall for presidential hopefuls would be broadcast on CNN, underscored one of the major hurdles progressive Democrats face in enacting some form of a Green New Deal to dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. The proposal calls for a sweeping industrial plan to rapidly shift away from fossil fuels, plant billions of trees and rebuild infrastructure to withstand a hotter, less predictable world. There are different versions of such a plan, though all promise to create good-paying jobs and look after workers in industries hurt in the transition. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of the most vocal proponents of a Green New Deal, has spoken often about how a climate package should fully fund the miners\u2019 endangered pension plan. Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\u00a0has a plan that includes $15 billion for the Black Lung Disability Fund and a guaranteed five years of salary, health care and pension support for workers displaced by the move to renewable energy. Several other contenders for the 2020 Democratic nomination proposed federal programs modeled on the GI Bill to help coal miners train for new lines of work. While Roberts said he\u2019s appreciated the dialogue his union has had with Ocasio-Cortez and others, he made clear he doesn\u2019t buy that a Green New Deal would produce union jobs on par with the disappearing coal jobs. He mocked the very idea, noting how badly unions have struggled to successfully organize workplaces. The union membership rate is just 6.4 percent in the private sector nationally.\u00a0So few jobs in the booming solar industry are unionized that the nonprofit Solar Foundation stopped tracking them in its annual census report three years ago. \u201cI understand somehow, magically, if certain people get elected president, they\u2019re going to make those union jobs, and they\u2019re going to require them to pay what you get make now,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. I just can\u2019t make that work in my mind.\u201d In June, the Green New Deal picked up two major labor endorsements, from the Service Employees International Union and the Association of Flight Attendants, which is part of the Communications Workers of America union. The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America followed suit last month. But powerful construction unions that rely on the fossil fuel industry for lucrative jobs, such as the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, remained firmly opposed. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about not just eliminating coal miners\u2019 jobs... it would also cost building trade jobs that they have now, utility worker jobs,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a good starting point for Democrats is to eliminate union jobs. It seems to me what Democrats need is a lot more union members, as opposed to fewer.\u201d Roberts made clear that he believes in climate change \u2015 \u201cit\u2019s real, it needs to be dealt with\u201d \u2015 but argued that further curbing coal use in the U.S. would do little when coal-fired power plants continue to open in other countries. Roberts\u2019 speech came at a time when politicians and the media appear to be paying more attention than usual to coal miners. President Donald Trump made them a central theme of his 2016 election, holding rallies with \u201cTrump Digs Coal\u201d signs. News outlets have been sending reporters to Appalachia to see how the president\u2019s coal promises are playing out, and a road blockade staged by\u00a0unpaid miners in Kentucky has made front-page news. The Sanders campaign sent pizza to the miners last month. But Roberts said political concerns for miners often turn out to be hollow. He noted that it\u2019s been nearly 10 years since the Upper Big Branch mining disaster killed 29 miners in West Virginia, and despite promises at the time, Congress still has not reformed mine safety laws. \u201cEverybody wants to get their pictures taken with a coal miner [when they\u2019re] running for office,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want anything to do with us once they get into office.\u201d Roberts had criticism for Trump, too. The president has often claimed, falsely, that the coal sector is being rejuvenated under his watch. But in reality, coal consumption is at its lowest level in decades, despite the administration\u2019s efforts to deregulate the industry. Coal-fired power plants continue to close not because of emissions rules, but because of cheap natural gas. Employment in the coal industry is hovering around just 52,000, up just a little bit more than a thousand from when Trump took office in 2017. \u201cCoal is not back,\u201d Roberts said. Roberts asked that the president, who claims to be a friend of coal miners, do them a favor on Twitter. \u201cIf he just tweeted \u2015 just make us 15 seconds of his day \u2015 that he felt that coal miners entitled to pensions should have [them], I think that might be enough,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019m pleading with him to do that.\u201d",

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who represent the Democratic Party\u2019s more progressive wing, draw more frequent comparisons than any other 2020 primary candidates. News outlets have doggedly documented the two candidates\u2019 subtle differences and, as Warren has climbed in opinion polls, have implied that her rise has come at Sanders\u2019 expense. But the Sanders campaign does not see it that way. His aides argue that they are competing more heavily to win over voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden, rather than Warren or any other candidate. Biden, the Sanders campaign believes, attracts the older working-class voters \u2015 of all races \u2015 with whom Sanders eventually gained traction in the 2016 election cycle. \u201cBernie appeals to younger working-class voters. Biden appeals to older working-class voters,\u201d Ben Tulchin, the Sanders\u2019 campaign\u2019s chief pollster, told HuffPost. \u201cThe latter are some of the same voters Bernie won over last time. Our view is that we can win them back again, especially talking about his core economic message.\u201d \u201cWhen Bernie talks about a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt political system, that really resonates,\u201d he added. In keeping with this approach, the Sanders campaign\u2019s text messaging program has a specific response for voters who say they are supporting Biden. It also has a response for voters who say they are backing Sanders, but only a general response for cases where they say they are supporting any other candidate. The Sanders campaign, which claims to have sent 30 million text messages to voters, shared with HuffPost a text message that a volunteer sent a Nevada voter who said they were deciding between Sanders and Biden. \u201cThanks for letting me know!\u201d the volunteer replied. \u201cDid you know that Joe Biden told a room full of Wall Street billionaire donors that \u2018nothing would fundamentally change\u2019 if he became president? I\u2019m for Bernie because he DOES think we need major change.\u201d That pitch seemed to work. The voter eventually said they\u2019d be backing Sanders. Biden did indeed tell a room full of wealthy donors that \u201cnothing will fundamentally change\u201d for them at a June fundraiser. His campaign maintains that Biden\u2019s full remarks show he was saying that wealthy people would not need to give up their standard of living in order to enact policies that lift up all Americans. Whether one considers the volunteer\u2019s texting appeal fair or not, it is a taste of the kind of contrast Sanders hopes to draw with Biden, who has deployed populist rhetoric about bridging the income gap but has often supported business-friendly policies and courted the party\u2019s donor class over the course of four and a half decades in politics. (Neither Sanders nor Warren use private fundraisers to solicit big donations.) Trade is an area where Sanders believes he has a significant advantage over Biden with older working-class voters, particularly in industrial states like Iowa, a caucus state that hosts the first contest of the presidential primary on Feb. 3. Sanders voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, which cost the United States blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Biden supported both. Sanders also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the now-defunct trade agreement that Biden promoted in his capacity as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. Exit polling suggests that drawing a contrast with Hillary Clinton\u2019s pro-free-trade record helped Sanders pull off a pivotal upset in the Michigan primary in March 2016. The campaign also sees Sanders\u2019 plans to reduce the high cost of prescription drugs \u2014 which even voters on Medicare struggle to pay \u2014 and his long-standing support for expanding Social Security benefits as key selling points for older working-class voters. One of Biden\u2019s main messages though, is that he\u2019s the most electable candidate. He can win against Trump, he says, in part because he\u2019s more moderate than Sanders and Warren. But Tulchin said voters concerned about electability tend to skew more educated and affluent, which are not the primary targets of Sanders\u2019 class-centric message anyway. \u201cThe more upscale you go, the less well Bernie does,\u201d he said. Tulchin emphasized that though Sanders believes he can win over some of the white working-class voters who voted for Obama in 2012 and subsequently switched to Trump, the campaign believes his message has appeal with working-class Black and Latino voters as well.\u00a0The campaign is optimistic about Sanders\u2019 chances in Nevada, where the disproportionately working-class Latino population makes up a large share of the electorate. (An average of public polls in the state nonetheless shows Sanders\u00a0tied for second place with Warren.) Tulchin told HuffPost that public polling data so far supports the campaign\u2019s view that Biden voters have a similar socioeconomic profile to Sanders voters. In a national poll conducted by Monmouth University in late August, Sanders came in first place among Democratic voters without a four-year college degree, with 24% support. He was followed by Biden, who had 18%, and Warren, who had 17%. In the same survey, Biden and Sanders both had similarly high favorability ratings among both college-educated and non-college-educated voters, while Warren had a favorability rating with college-educated Democrats that was 20 percentage points higher than among those without a degree. (Sen. Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg enjoyed a favorability edge among college-educated voters at least as large as Warren\u2019s.) In addition, Morning Consult\u2019s national poll in late August shows that Biden supporters would pick Sanders as their second choice and vice versa. But the public opinion research is vast enough that other polls offer contradictory data. For example, a late August poll released by Quinnipiac University found that Sanders trails Biden among Democrats earning less than $50,000 a year, and lags behind both Biden and Warren among white voters without a college degree. And a Pew Research Center poll from mid-August found that more Biden voters would pick Warren or Harris as their second choice than would pick Sanders. Neither the Biden campaign nor the Warren campaign responded to a request for comment for this story. Over Labor Day weekend, HuffPost interviewed 35 voters at three Sanders rallies in New Hampshire and Maine; a Warren rally in New Hampshire; and a Labor Day breakfast in Maine hosted by local labor unions. There was plenty of affinity for Biden \u2015 and Warren \u2015 amongst the Sanders supporters. Of the 15 Sanders supporters with whom HuffPost spoke, voters cited Biden as their second choice just as frequently as they named Warren. (Some, though, were unwilling countenance a Sanders loss. Others named other second-choice candidates.) Wayne McAllister, 30, who came to see Sanders in Raymond, New Hampshire, on Sunday with his wife Ryann, 24, volunteered for conservative Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the 2016 election cycle. He got turned onto Sanders\u2019 message \u2015 and progressive politics more broadly \u2015 after joining the Iron Workers Local 7 union, which endorsed Sanders in 2016. \u201cHis message is pretty much what the labor movement was, which is: power to the people, band together, take down corporations \u2015 or at least keep them in check to make sure they don\u2019t hold too many of the cards, that the worker still has a voice, that the worker still has a say in the matter of what happens,\u201d McAllister said. And Biden would be his second choice, McAllister said, because he\u2019s \u201cone of the elder statesmen, been around for a while.\u201d Joe Piccone, who works for Teamsters union Local 340 in Maine and attended the Labor Day breakfast in Portland, Maine, said he was backing Sanders because Sanders is a \u201cpro-labor guy.\u201d Biden is the only other person who Piccone said he feels confident would also fight for unions. Biden \u201chas a track record with labor that I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d Piccone said. \u201cThat\u2019s not being critical of Elizabeth Warren \u2015 that\u2019s saying I\u2019m going with a known entity.\u201d But in a clear example of why the Sanders campaign isn\u2019t focusing on Warren supporters, just one of the 10 voters who told HuffPost they\u2019re backing the Massachusetts senator said Sanders was their second choice. Lisa Wenger, a public school teacher who came to see Warren speak in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Monday and said that Warren\u2019s speech won her over, considers Sanders \u201ctoo far left.\u201d Asked what she makes of people who liken Warren to Sanders, Wenger said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a bunch of meshugas.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 In an interview with Yahoo News last Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brushed off the possibility that he and Sen. Elizabeth Warren could split the progressive vote, creating an easy path for former Vice President Joe Biden to win the Democratic presidential primary. As it stands now, polls show Sanders and Warren vying for second place behind Biden even though the combined bloc supporting the two progressives is larger than that of the ex-vice president. Sanders and Warren have broadly similar platforms. While\u00a0there are some differences\u00a0between their approaches, they both support Sanders\u2019s signature Medicare for All public health care plan, large increases in spending to fight climate change, and programs to cut student debt and expand affordable housing. Biden has far more moderate positions, including a health care plan that would\u00a0preserve private insurance\u00a0and\u00a0more modest spending\u00a0to address climate change. And while Biden has called for\u00a0increased education spending, unlike Warren and Sanders, he hasn\u2019t backed plans to make public colleges fully tuition free and to eliminate large amounts of student debt. Sanders has said Biden doesn\u2019t share his \u201cvision\u201d for the country. Still, when asked about the possibility that having two progressive candidates will end up dooming them both, Sanders offered a one word response. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a political process, and people will make their own choices,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling pretty good about the future.\u201d The Vermont senator stressed that he is \u201cconfident\u201d about his organization in key early states. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way away from election day in Iowa. I think It\u2019s about five months, and a lot can change. All I can say is that given the grassroots movement that we have in Iowa, in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, California, I\u2019m feeling pretty good that we\u2019re going to win those states,\u201d said Sanders. While Sanders and Warren share similar policy goals, there are some indications their bases of support are\u00a0quite different, and if one dropped out, the supporters wouldn\u2019t necessarily migrate to the remaining candidate. But Sanders offered a message to any progressives who might be choosing between him and Warren. When asked about the distinctions between the two, Sanders emphasized his record and role in pushing the Democratic Party to the left since his last run for president in 2016. \u201cWhat I would say is, if you look at the issues that folks are talking about today \u2014 not only candidates but people all over this country \u2014 that has a lot to do with my willingness four years ago to stand up to the political establishment, the economic establishment, the media establishment, and say, \u2018You know what? Maybe we need policies and a government that represents all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. While Warren is mounting her first presidential campaign and doesn\u2019t have as long a political career as Sanders, she was a prominent advocate for reducing income inequality during her prior academic career. Since she was elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren has, like Sanders, pushed for dramatic expansions to public education and health care programs. Sanders said he\u2019s pleased other candidates are supporting aspects of his agenda, including universal health care, free public education and aggressive steps to fight climate change. \u201cThese are issues that I talked about in a very aggressive way. I am proud that other candidates are coming onboard,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I think that if you check my record, I have a life of standing up to the very powerful special interests and fighting for working people.\u201d Yahoo News pressed Sanders on whether he was implying that he \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Warren\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to talk about Elizabeth Warren or anybody else; [it\u2019s] not a question of paving the way. Everybody comes to their own views,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAll I can say is that for the last many decades, going back to when I was elected mayor of Burlington, my record has been standing up for working families, taking on powerful special interests and, in fact, achieving some real results.\u201d Sanders, who has the largest number of individual donors so far, went on to say he\u2019s \u201cproud of the record that I have right now in putting together the strongest grassroots movement \u2026 for a political campaign this country has ever seen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d said Sanders.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Progressive Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will share the debate stage for the first time with establishment favorite Joe Biden Thursday night in a prime-time showdown displaying sharply opposing notions of electability in the party\u2019s presidential nomination fight. Biden\u2019s remarkably steady lead in the crowded contest is built upon the idea that the former vice president is best suited to defeat President Donald Trump next year \u2014 a contention based on ideology, experience and perhaps gender. Sanders and Warren, meanwhile, have repeatedly criticized Biden\u2019s measured approach, at least indirectly, by arguing that only bold action on key issues like health care, the economy and climate change can build the coalition needed to win in 2020. The top-tier meeting at center stage has dominated the pre-event talk, yet each of the other seven candidates hopes for a breakout moment with the attention of the nation beginning to increase less than five months before the first primary votes are cast. \u201cFor a complete junkie or someone in the business, you already have an impression of everyone,\u201d said Howard Dean, who ran for president in 2004 and later chaired the Democratic National Committee. \u201cBut now you are going to see increasing scrutiny with other people coming in to take a closer look.\u201d The ABC News debate is the first limited to one night after several candidates dropped out and others failed to meet new qualification standards. A handful more candidates qualified for next month\u2019s debate, which will again be divided over two nights. If nothing else, viewers will see the diversity of the modern Democratic Party. The debate, held on the campus of historically black Texas Southern University, includes women, people of color and a gay man, a striking contrast to the Republicans. It will unfold in a rapidly changing state that Democrats hope to eventually bring into their column. Perhaps the biggest question is how directly the candidates will attack one another. Some fights that were predicted in previous debates failed to materialize with candidates like Sanders and Warren in July joining forces. The White House hopefuls and their campaigns are sending mixed messages about how eager they are to make frontal attacks on anyone other than Trump. That could mean the first meeting between Warren, the rising progressive calling for \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d and Biden, the more cautious but still ambitious establishmentarian, doesn\u2019t define the night. Or that Kamala Harris, the California senator, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, look to reclaim lost momentum not by punching rivals but by reemphasizing their own visions for America. Biden, who has led most national and early state polls since he joined the field in April, is downplaying the prospects of a clash with Warren, despite their policy differences on health care, taxes and financial regulation. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be me, and she\u2019ll be her, and let people make their judgments. I have great respect for her,\u201d Biden said recently as he campaigned in South Carolina. Warren says consistently that she has no interest in going after Democratic opponents. Yet both campaigns are also clear that they don\u2019t consider it a personal attack to draw sharp policy contrasts. Warren, who as a Harvard law professor once challenged then-Sen. Biden in a Capitol Hill hearing on bankruptcy law, has noted repeatedly that they have sharply diverging viewpoints. Her standard campaign pitch doesn\u2019t mention Biden but is built around an assertion that the \u201ctime for small ideas is over,\u201d an implicit criticism of more moderate Democrats who want, for example, a public option health care plan instead of single-payer or who want to repeal Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts but not necessarily raise taxes further. Biden, likewise, doesn\u2019t often mention Warren or Sanders. But he regularly contrasts the price tag of his public option insurance proposal to the single-payer system that Warren and Sanders back. Ahead of the debate, the Biden campaign emphasized that he\u2019s released more than two decades of tax returns, in contrast to the president. That\u2019s a longer period than Warren, and it could reach back into part of her pre-Senate career when she did legal work that included some corporate law. There are indirect avenues to chipping away at Biden\u2019s advantages, said Democratic consultant Karen Finney, who advised Hillary Clinton in 2016. Finney noted Biden\u2019s consistent polling advantages on the question of which Democrat can defeat Trump. A Washington Post-ABC poll this week found that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, 45% thought Biden had the best chance to beat Trump, though just 24% identified him as the \u201cbest president for the country\u201d among the primary field. \u201cThat puts pressure on the others to explain how they can beat Trump,\u201d Finney said. Voters, she said, \u201cwant to see presidents on that stage,\u201d and Biden, as a known quantity, already reaches that threshold. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to beat him, you have to make your case.\u201d Harris, said spokesman Ian Sams, will \u201cmake the connection between (Trump\u2019s) hatred and division and our inability to get things done for the country.\u201d Buttigieg, meanwhile, will have an opportunity to use his argument for generational change as an indirect attack on the top tier. The mayor is 37. Biden, Sanders and Warren are 76, 78 and 70, respectively \u2014 hardly a contrast to the 73-year-old Trump. There\u2019s also potential home state drama with two Texans in the race. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro clashed in an earlier debate over immigration. Castro has led the left flank on the issue with a proposal to decriminalize border crossings. For O\u2019Rourke, it will be the first debate since a massacre in his hometown of El Paso prompted him to overhaul his campaign into a forceful call for sweeping gun restrictions. O\u2019Rourke has recently used the F-word in cable television interviews. He\u2019s given no indication whether he\u2019ll bring that rhetorical flourish to broadcast television. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.",

      "content": " HOUSTON \u2015 After two debates that did not feature the leading Democratic presidential candidates all on one stage, Thursday\u2019s showdown finally felt like a real debate, with establishment front-runner Joe Biden sparring with the progressive challengers close at his heels in the polls, Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.), as well as other moderates in the race. The 10 candidates ditched the introductory boilerplate and dived straight into their differences on health care and the economy, executing veiled shots at each other they\u2019ve telegraphed for weeks. But the highly anticipated face-off between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, the three polling leaders in the race, never really came to a head beyond one exchange on health care. \u201cHow are we going to pay for it?\u201d Biden asked moments after the debate began, referring to the universal health care plan backed by both Sanders and Warren. \u201cI want to hear that tonight. My distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it,\u201d he said, referring to Warren. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d the former vice president added, name-dropping former President Barack Obama. Warren responded by saying \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate, and explained that she planned to make the richest individuals pay for her plan. Sanders, who has made his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan the signature feature of his candidacy, also made sure not to miss a dig at Biden. \u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,\u201d Sanders said. Biden\u2019s campaign previewed his attacks in the days leading up to the debate as advisers repeatedly argued that Democrats should select a nominee able to offer \u201cmore than plans,\u201d a reference to Warren\u2019s most popular line on the campaign trail, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d Warren, meanwhile, took swipes of her own ahead of the debate that were widely seen as focusing on Biden. On the campaign trail, Warren repeatedly touted how she is not \u201cspending my time with high-dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists,\u201d a reference to the former vice president\u2019s fundraising events with well-heeled donors. The tension between the two campaigns spilled out into the open on the eve of the debate after former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Warren a \u201chypocrite\u201d and saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have any trouble\u201d taking his money until she swore off high-dollar fundraisers for her presidential bid this year. Biden\u2019s campaign told reporters on Thursday that he was not involved in the decision to publish the op-ed. The expected fireworks between the two candidates fizzled on stage, however. Warren did not bring up the op-ed, and apart from her remarks on Medicare for All, she played it safe by focusing on her plans for the economy and taking on corruption in Washington. Biden ignored Warren\u2019s former work in bankruptcy law and clients, continuing to make his case about \u201crestoring the soul of America\u201d amid the chaotic tenure of President Donald Trump. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, meanwhile, delivered one of the sharpest attacks against Biden when he insinuated that the onetime Delaware senator\u2019s memory might be failing him. \u201cAre you forgetting what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care, eliciting some gasps from the audience and reprimands from several other candidates on stage. The line appeared to evoke some critics\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s mental acuity. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d lamented South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg afterward. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed, chiming in with, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d Biden campaign adviser Anita Dunn responded by telling reporters that Castro \u201cclearly didn\u2019t learn from the first two debates that taking personal cheap shots at Vice President Biden actually doesn\u2019t work out that well.\u201d But New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker seemed to back up Castro in a later interview with CNN, stating that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.\u201d It was unclear, however, if the damage to Biden over the course of the night was severe enough to knock him from his front-runner perch. Other lower-ranked candidates also had standout moments during the night. Buttigieg got emotional in his closing remarks while talking about coming out as gay\u00a0when the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy forced LGBTQ members of the military to keep quiet about their sexual orientation. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke won applause when he reiterated his support for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. O\u2019Rourke vowed: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d Klobuchar took a swing at Sanders over the specifics in his health care plan, saying, \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill and ... it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\u201d And the audience loved California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 opening remarks in which she spoke directly into the camera to address Trump and his policies.\u00a0\u201cNow, Mr. President, you can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional comments during and after the debate.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner. And there were moments in Thursday night\u2019s debate when he looked the part. Standing between a pair of liberal senators offering radical change, he unabashedly embraced his more moderate position on health care, forcefully pressuring Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to level with Americans about the steep cost of implementing a fully government-run system. He was more polished and practiced than in previous contests. And he repeatedly leaned on the legacy of former President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular Democrat in the nation. \u201cI\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked,\u201d he declared. But the debate was punctuated by moments that highlighted why Biden can\u2019t shake questions about his consistency and whispers about his fitness for office, despite his lead in most national polls and early state surveys. Most glaringly: a meandering answer near the end of the debate about his past statements on racial inequality. Biden said poor parents should play the \u201crecord player\u201d for their children before veering off into comments about Venezuela. Biden\u2019s standing in the Democratic contest is the source of much debate within the party. Is he an experienced elder statesman who can calm an anxious nation and peel back some of the white working class voters who helped send President Donald Trump to the White House? Or is the 76-year-old past his prime and out of step with a party that is growing younger, more diverse and more liberal? Thursday night\u2019s contest provided fresh fodder for each of those theories. Biden was at his best in his lengthy exchange with Sanders and Warren over the future of health care in America. He confidently pressed them over the cost of their sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposals, exposing Warren\u2019s unwillingness to say whether middle class Americans would see a tax increase under her plan (Sanders says they would, but argues the rise would be offset by lower health care costs). In a retort to Sanders, who has said he expects employers would pass on health care savings to their workers, Biden exclaimed: \u201cFor a socialist you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d Biden was the focus of fierce criticism from his rivals in both of the previous Democratic debates. But those attacks did little to diminish Biden\u2019s standing atop polls, nor has a series of verbal flubs and misstatements throughout the summer. The other reality: The candidates who have launched the sharpest attacks on Biden have gained little ground or already dropped out of the race. Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, bested Biden in the opening debate with a highly personal critique over his decades-old position on federally mandated school busing, but any boost for her candidacy was short-lived. Perhaps mindful of that reality, most candidates sidestepped overt criticism of the vice president in Thursday\u2019s debate. The one notable exception was Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing secretary and is in need of a jolt to break out of the lower tier of candidates. In a highly charged moment, Castro challenged Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a barely veiled reference to questions about the former vice president\u2019s age. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care. In a post-debate interview, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker laid into Biden as well, saying there were many people concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball \u201cacross the end line without fumbling.\u201d Castro and Booker were zeroing in on real questions that are being asked about Biden. Is he too old to serve as president? If he were the nominee, would he make a mistake at a critical moment that could clear the way for Trump? Biden\u2019s stumbles later in the debate magnified those questions. He struggled through an answer about the war in Iraq and gave a grab-bag answer to a question about how to repair the legacy of slavery in America. He appeared to suggest that poorer families needed help learning how to raise their children. Biden\u2019s supporters argue that ultimately, those answers \u2014 and the questions they raise \u2014 matter less to voters than their overall impressions of the former vice president. Indeed, there is a deep reservoir of goodwill for Biden in the Democratic Party, shaped in large part by the eight years he served as Obama\u2019s No. 2. Which leaves little doubt as to why Biden spent much of the debate reminding Americans about those years, urging them to see him as the rightful heir to legacy of the last Democrat to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2014 good, bad, indifferent,\u201d Biden said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201chell yes\u201d moment at the Democrats\u2019 presidential debate is scrambling his party\u2019s message on guns. The Democrats have long contended their support of gun control laws does not mean they want to take away law-abiding citizens\u2019 firearms. But on Friday, they struggled to square that message with their presidential contender\u2019s full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,\u201d the former Texas congressman declared during Thursday night\u2019s debate. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso was the site of a mass shooting last month that killed 22 people, and he has put the issue of gun violence at the center of his campaign effort. On Friday, his campaign hawked T-shirts emblazoned with his debate vow. However, some fellow Democrats chastised him and fretted that his remarks may have made things harder for gun control supporters as they negotiate with President Donald Trump on legislation to respond to this summer\u2019s mass shootings. \u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told CNN Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done.\u201d His fears about new rages against gun control supporters seem sure to be borne out. \u201cThis is what their goal is. We\u2019ve always said it, now they\u2019re saying it,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation, based in Washington state. \u201cNow they\u2019ve said it and we\u2019re going to make them eat it.\u201d Meanwhile, Coons is working with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on a measure to require that law enforcement officials be notified when someone fails a gun-purchase background check. Toomey, who is also working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the firearms issue, agreed that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments could backfire. \u201cThis rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\u201d he said. O\u2019Rourke was less provocative in his language but still determined Friday. \u201cMuch respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it.\u201d One worry among Democrats is that calling for outright confiscation plays into claims by Trump and other Republicans that Democrats are coming for people\u2019s firearms. On Thursday night, just as O\u2019Rourke made his call to take back the rifles, Trump warned at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.\u201d Republicans, Trump promised, \u201cwill forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d That line got huge applause at the GOP retreat, and again Friday when it was repeated there by Vice President Mike Pence. By all accounts, Trump needs to run up the score in rural areas to win reelection next year. The 2020 outcome is expected to depend heavily on a trio of Rust Belt states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 that have large numbers of rural voters, many of whom are gun-owners or sympathetic to owners on this issue. And Democrats\u2019 hope of winning control of the Senate rests on states with high rates of gun ownership, like Arizona and Texas. Several gun control groups stressed Friday that they were not advocating confiscation, but they also didn\u2019t follow Coons\u2019 lead in condemning O\u2019Rourke\u2019s declaration. \u201cI think it is very understandable that he is taking a policy position that the larger gun safety community hasn\u2019t taken and he\u2019s trying to push the envelope,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, the gun control group named after Gabby Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011. \u201cIf the American voter does not think this is an appropriate solution, they\u2019ll let us know.\u201d Gun rights groups have seemed to be somewhat on their heels recently as the unabated series of mass shootings has increased pressure for new control measures. Even the staunchly conservative lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, said he supports background checks for all gun purchases after the El Paso attack and a second mass shooting in the state. Infighting and investigations at the National Rifle Association and election wins by pro-gun-control Democrats last November have convinced some politicians that the winds have shifted on the gun issue. Indeed, O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t alone. None of the other nine candidates on the debate stage contradicted him on his proposal to require owners of the two popular styles of assault rifles to sell them to the government. Two candidates \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 have also called for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, asked if she agreed with O\u2019Rourke Thursday night, allowed only that she preferred a voluntary buyback to a mandatory one. All 10 of the Democrats onstage have called for an assault weapon sales ban, the latest sign of how the party has become emboldened on gun control. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much the politics of gun safety has changed \u2014 whereas candidates once avoided gun safety entirely, now they\u2019re jockeying to be the boldest,\u201d said Taylor Maxwell of Everytown, the gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Proposals like background checks and so-called red flag laws, which allow authorities to confiscate guns from people who are deemed threats, are \u201curgent,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many lives are on the line not to take these simple, broadly popular and bipartisan steps immediately.\u201d But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks worry Democrats like Warren Varley, who lost a race for a state legislative seat in Iowa last year. \u201cThe lines like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna come and take your AR-15,\u2019 just play into the fears that the NRA has been stoking, and a proposal like that is just going to make rural Iowa and I think probably rural areas elsewhere more red,\u201d Varley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just a bridge too far for most rural folks, and it conjures up images of the government coming in and invading your home and images of big government trampling over the rights of individuals.\u201d Trump and White House aides have discussed a number of gun control measures with members of Congress, including steps to go after fraudulent buyers, notify state and local law enforcement when a potential buyer fails a background check, issue state-level emergency risk protection orders, boost mental health assistance and speed up executions for those found guilty of committing mass shootings. A formal announcement on the president\u2019s plan is expected as soon as next week. __ Riccardi reported from Denver.

      "subtitle": "The Working Families Party endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 election cycle.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Working Families Party, a leading progressive organization with roots in organized labor, announced Monday that it is endorsing the presidential bid of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The group\u2019s backing provides a boost to Warren as she seeks to solidify her climb in the polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as the leading alternative on the left to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party national director, said in a statement. \u201cOur job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.\u201d As part of the group\u2019s endorsement process, Mitchell grilled five presidential candidates \u2015 Warren, Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2015 on live broadcasts that gave members the opportunity to submit questions or ask them live. Warren distinguished herself in her interview by, among other things, promising to repeal the 1994 crime bill authored by Biden. The group\u2019s interview with Booker proved more contentious, with an extended discussion of his ties to controversial Garden State political bosses. Sen. Kamala Harris of California canceled her interview with the organization, citing a scheduling conflict, a decision that prompted the group to take her out of the running.\u00a0The group had ruled out all but those six candidates based on their answers to a questionnaire. The endorsement, reflecting the views of 61% of Working Families Party members and leaders in a ranked-choice voting system, is a particularly sharp disappointment for Sanders, who picked up the group\u2019s backing in the 2016 election cycle, but received just 36% of the vote from participating members this time around. The Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, Analilia Mejia, is the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Mitchell acknowledged Sanders\u2019 role as a progressive trailblazer in his statement on the endorsement. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d The endorsement nonetheless drew skepticism from Sanders supporters, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the endorsement process and talked of canceling their dues to the organization. Some Sanders supporters interpreted a Mitchell quote in\u00a0The New York Times in which he warned against progressives who hoped to defeat moderate Democrats with \u201cthought pieces or pithy tweets\u201d as a dig at them. Mitchell denied that was his intention in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI was talking about the work all of us have to do to defeat the far right and the corporate forces who want to capture the Democratic nomination \u2015 all those forces. We need to organize against them,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t take this occasion to choose to settle a score against a candidate who I think is amazing and doing great work.\u201d Mitchell acknowledged, however, that the endorsement causes pain to many Working Families Party members who are staunchly in Sanders\u2019 corner and raises the challenge of moving forward as a unified bloc. \u201cWe knew that this would be a hard vote and that there would be folks who would be very disappointed. And that\u2019s what happens when mature political organizations wrestle around really important decisions,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dWe\u2019re going to continue to organize and keep our eyes on the prize.\u201d Mitchell and the Working Families Party also stand behind the fairness of the endorsement process. In the previous presidential election cycle, members of the group\u2019s national committee \u2015 the council of unions and grassroots groups that function as its key stakeholders \u2015 held the vast majority of votes in the endorsement process. This year, activists who are not on the national committee \u2015 both dues-paying members and supporters who do not pay dues \u2015 were allotted half of the votes. The roughly 50 activist leaders representing grassroots organizations on WFP\u2019s national committee had votes worth the other half of the total. And while activists who do not pay dues were permitted to cast ballots in the 2016 election cycle, Working Families Party claims it took specific steps to screen them this year, including through an email blast that required progressives to affirm their support for the group\u2019s agenda and proceed through an online portal for voting. In total, about 10,000 people cast ballots, according to the group. The Working Families Party has neither demographic data about the participants in its endorsement process, nor insight into the rationale of activists who opted for Warren over Sanders.\u00a0It likewise declined to provide a breakdown of votes for either candidate based on whether participants were activist leaders with privileged voting status, dues-paying members or mere sympathetic supporters. Mitchell said that, on a personal note, he appreciates Warren\u2019s ability to communicate progressive ideas to a diverse array of people. \u201cWe need a candidate that can break down these concepts in ways that encourage a multiracial alignment of folks to defeat Trump and defeat neo-fascism and I think she\u2019s uniquely positioned to do that,\u201d he said. Warren\u2019s endorsement last Monday of Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate running for Philadelphia city council, swayed some members of WFP\u2019s leadership with privileged voting status, according to a progressive strategist familiar with these leaders\u2019 thinking. The Working Families Party was founded in 1998 by a coalition of New York labor unions and community organizations hoping to establish a progressive foothold within the Democratic Party-run politics of the Empire State. In New York, where the group retains its largest presence, progressive Democrats have the chance to run on its ballot line as well as that of the Democratic Party as a show of strength from the party\u2019s progressive wing. As Working Families Party has matured, it has gotten bolder in its political stances and more distant from its roots in New York\u2019s labor unions. A decision by the group to endorse Cynthia Nixon\u2019s challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 Democratic primary at once prompted an exodus of nearly all of the labor unions backing the organization and freed it to chart a more independent path. Although New York remains its hub, the Working Families Party now has state-level affiliates in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, as well as local branches in four others. States with affiliates include the general-election battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Working Families Party, which often sets up PACs to boost candidates it endorses in state and local elections, has yet to spell out exactly how it will use its resources to buttress Warren\u2019s 2020 bid. Mitchell, who is African American and previously served as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that the group is well equipped to organize working-class voters and voters of color \u2015 some of the very people polls suggest Warren has had difficulty attracting. Referring to these voting blocs, Mitchell said, \u201cThere are a number of communities that often do not get heard and get taken for granted, unfortunately by a lot of Democrats. It\u2019s going to be our interest to lift them up.\u201d The endorsement from a powerhouse of New York politics comes ahead of a rally Warren is holding in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday evening. The Warren campaign chose the site for its proximity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, a sweatshop where a fire in 1911 killed 145 garment workers. Warren plans to discuss the resonance that the tragedy, which became a rallying cry for labor organizing in the city and across the country, has for her campaign and the movement she is trying to build.

Carter, who turns 95 on Oct. 1, said Tuesday that managing the job of U.S. president even at age 80 would have been too demanding for him. (See the clip below.) \u201cIf I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,\u201d Carter, the longest-lived U.S. leader, said during his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta. \u201cYou had to be very flexible with your mind. You have to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then put them together in a comprehensive way.\u201d Carter\u2019s remarks began on a light note when he was asked if he\u2019d consider running for a second term. \u201cI hope there\u2019s an age limit,\u201d he replied, laughing. Carter did not mention that two of the leading Democratic 2020 candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 78, would turn 80 in office if elected. President Donald Trump, 73, became the oldest newly elected president at 70 on his inauguration day. Carter, who served one term from 1977 to 1981, spoke about the rigors of the presidency, noting his negotiation of a peace agreement between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. \u201cThe things I faced in foreign affairs, I don\u2019t think I could undertake them at 80 years old,\u201d he said, per The Associated Press. \u201cAt 95, it\u2019s out of the question. I\u2019m having a hard time walking.\u201d Carter also took a jab at Trump during the event in Atlanta, saying it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d if he got reelected in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I will vote for, but I will vote for one of them,\u201d Carter said of the Democratic presidential candidates. \u201cI voted for Bernie [Sanders] the last time. But one of the major factors I have in my mind is who can beat Trump.\u201d Former first lady Rosalynn Carter accused Trump of fanning the flames of white supremacy with his rhetoric. \u201cI am so disturbed about white power,\u201d she said. \u201d[Trump] says he is not a racist and maybe he is not. But some of the things he says encourages racism.\u201d The 39th president has spoken out against Trump in the past. In June, he claimed Trump\u2019s presidency is \u201cillegitimate\u201d because \u201cthe Russians interfered\u201d in the election on his behalf. Hayley Miller contributed reporting.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the endorsement of the Working Families Party, one of the country\u2019s most influential progressive organizations. The decision came down to three main factors,\u00a0according to six people who participated in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process:\u00a0her more aggressive outreach to key decision-makers, her strong commitment to racial and gender equity, and the perception that she has broader national appeal. Warren \u201chas a long track record of working with our folks on issues from the foreclosure crisis to the sale of homes to Wall Street,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of the low-income activist group New York Communities for Change and one of two people who cast votes for Warren on behalf of the New York WFP state committee. \u201cA lot of it stems from how she has run her campaign. From the beginning, she centered racial inequality in her campaign. She went to Jackson, Mississippi, and talked to these issues head on. It was not an addendum.\u201d Since announcing its endorsement of Warren on Monday, the Working Families Party has been bombarded with complaints from Sanders supporters questioning whether the outcome of the vote reflected the views of WFP leaders \u2014 who they suspect put Warren over the top \u2014 or the group\u2019s more numerous dues-paying members and supporters. The votes of the former were represented by 56 delegates on the WFP\u2019s national committee, including Westin, and were weighted to make up half of the total endorsement vote. An estimated 10,000 of WFP\u2019s dues-paying members and other progressive activists who participated in the online ballot made up the other half. HuffPost spoke with Westin and five other WFP state and regional leaders whose votes in state-level plebiscites determined the way their national committee delegates voted. The goal of HuffPost\u2019s inquiry was not to assess the fairness of WFP\u2019s endorsement process, but to get a sense of why many delegates chose Warren. In addition to Westin, HuffPost spoke with Andrea Serrano, executive director of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, nonprofit Ol\u00e9; Stephanie Zucker, a WFP activist from near Morgantown, West Virginia; and three other New Yorkers: education activist Billy Easton, organized labor official Sandra Cuellar Oxford and fair housing advocate David Schwartz. Easton, Oxford and Schwartz cast votes that bound New York\u2019s delegates to Warren; Zucker and her fellow West Virginia WFP committee members voted to have their national delegates endorse Warren as well. Serrano would not say how the New Mexico WFP affiliate voted, but described what people who participated in the process found attractive in Warren\u2019s candidacy. As with the four other candidates the WFP considered endorsing, Sanders sat for a public, live-streamed endorsement interview, where he was questioned by WFP national organizing director Nelini Stamp and WFP activists. But Sanders did not participate in a later video conference call with WFP national delegates and members of the WFP\u2019s state committees.\u00a0On that call, presidential candidates could make their case for an endorsement directly to the people with a say in the matter. Warren and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro availed themselves of the opportunity; Sanders did not. \u201cIt was an opportunity for Bernie and his people to make their pitch. It\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d said Oxford, a WFP leader in upstate New York. Sanders\u2019 absence did not sway Oxford per se, who cited other reasons for her vote for Warren. But for other WFP leaders, it reflected Warren\u2019s greater affinity for the political art of courting allies, an activity that critics and supporters alike say Sanders has been less invested in over the course of his career. \u201cThis is the thing about Warren, you see it in her selfie lines: She\u2019ll put in all of the work to try and connect with a voter, to try and secure an endorsement \u2015 like she was trying to do in the WFP process \u2015 and to make her case,\u201d said Westin, who voted for Sanders in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process for the 2016 election cycle. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s actually a quality that we need in terms of somebody who is going to beat Trump.\u201d Prior to the endorsement process, Warren had likewise exhibited a knack for politicking that was unmatched by Sanders. A week before the WFP revealed the results of its endorsement process, she endorsed Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate for one of two at-large Philadelphia city council seats that are effectively reserved for non-Democrats, and currently occupied by Republicans. Warren also endorsed Stephen Smith, the WFP-backed progressive running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in West Virginia. Sanders, whose political director Analilia Mejia previously ran the New Jersey Working Families Party, could have one-upped Warren by endorsing both Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, the second WFP candidate for Philadelphia city council. Instead, he endorsed neither of them. \u201cSupporting progressive Black and other women of color for office is always a positive thing,\u201d Serrano said. The Sanders campaign did not immediately provide an explanation for Sanders\u2019 decisions not to participate in the video conference call, or endorse in the Philadelphia city council races. Sanders has worked hard to dispel the perception, formed during his 2016 presidential run, that he is insufficiently committed to addressing injustices like racism and sexism on their own terms, rather than strictly as manifestations of economic inequality. He hired a more diverse contingent of senior campaign staff; featured race more prominently in his stump speech; took pains to court influential Black leaders in early primary states like South Carolina; and produced, among other things, a far-reaching criminal justice reform platform that seeks to redress racist practices. But several of the WFP leaders who spoke to HuffPost still consider Warren to be more genuinely committed to combating racial inequity, in particular, as a form of injustice that must be addressed independent of structural economic problems. Warren\u2019s remarks in Detroit in July about countering the effects of historic housing discrimination in Black neighborhoods stood out to Easton, who runs the Alliance for Quality Education in Albany, New York,\u00a0and considers racial justice the most important issue in the race. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a white candidate for major office be crystal clear and direct and so effective, breaking down the concept in a way people can understand,\u201d he said. Serrano argued that, by contrast, Sanders\u2019 attempts to broaden his message outward from the economy had been inadequate. \u201cIt is not OK to separate class from race and gender \u2026 People have tried to say, \u2018Do better on this subject,\u2019 and it just doesn\u2019t seem to last,\u201d she said. Conversely, some of the WFP stakeholders cited Warren\u2019s identification as a capitalist seeking to put a check on the economic system\u2019s most oppressive features, rather than replace it, as both more in line with their own thinking, and evidence of her broader national appeal. Zucker, who is a part owner of her family\u2019s veterinary hospital, described Warren\u2019s vision as \u201ccapitalism with a conscience\u201d and said she shares that view. \u201cI\u2019m fully in support of [Sanders\u2019] policies in the vast majority of areas. But I think Elizabeth Warren is doing a better job of communicating what I believe is their shared vision of a just economy.\u201d Others spoke more generally about what they see as Warren\u2019s success expanding beyond a core group of left-wing supporters. \u201cI really feel that Elizabeth Warren would have a better shot at unifying the left and the center. We can\u2019t just think we\u2019re going to go as far left as we can and bring the center along with us,\u201d Oxford said. \u201cI feel that Elizabeth has been somewhat more conciliatory and offered a larger tent to those who definitely won\u2019t vote for Bernie.\u201d Sanders supporters point to polling that has shown higher levels of support\u00a0for Sanders than Warren among working-class voters and, until recently, Black voters, as evidence that he is better equipped to build a winning, national coalition. But Warren\u2019s supporters in the WFP believe that her base of support will continue to diversify as more Americans pay attention to the primary race. \u201cMy membership is low-income people of color and my membership absolutely loves Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Westin said. \u201c[Former vice president] Joe Biden and Bernie have been big names for years. People are just tuning into the race.\u201d Given the complexity of the WFP\u2019s endorsement process, it is not surprising that it has generated some skepticism. Sanders partisans \u2014 acting with some encouragement from the Sanders campaign \u2014 have urged the WFP to release a breakdown of the vote that would show whether Warren won the endorsement thanks to the national delegates or had enough support to win among the dues-paying members and associated activists who voted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they want to release it?\u201d wrote Matt Bruenig, a founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a left-wing think tank. \u201cYou hate to speculate about such things, but the only answer is because the member votes went for Sanders while the leadership votes went for Warren, and the organization is embarrassed to reveal the degree to which the leadership overruled the membership.\u201d The WFP says it is refusing to release the figures because to do so would create an artificial division in the status of different voters, when all of the votes cast are equally legitimate. In some cases, the distinctions might be hazy anyway. Schwartz, Zucker and Easton all voted in the online general membership ballot in addition to casting their state committee votes. More broadly, the WFP defends its practice of granting its most committed activists and partner organizations an outsize say in its endorsement, particularly given the grassroots constituencies they each represent. By contrast, an assortment of sympathetic progressives who were not previously involved in WFP were free to participate in the larger membership vote if they affirmed the WFP\u2019s values through the completion of an online form by Sept. 6. Some Sanders supporters mobilized people to participate on Reddit. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee leveraged its considerable email list to encourage its activists to cast votes for Warren. The WFP also noted that in the 2016 endorsement process, the votes of national delegates were weighted to make up 87.5% of the total vote share \u2015 far more than in the 2020 endorsement process. Those national delegates represented a group of WFP stakeholders that was less diverse and more conservative, including a number of labor unions that departed the organization in 2018 in protest of its endorsement of Cynthia Nixon\u2019s candidacy\u00a0for New York governor. The WFP only ended up endorsing Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, over many of those stakeholders\u2019 protestations, because 87% of the dues-paying members and other activists \u2014 who got the remaining one-eighth of the vote not held by national leaders \u2014 backed Sanders. Part of Bruenig\u2019s argument for the WFP to release the breakdown of its vote, is precisely that the organization released a breakdown of Sanders\u2019 share of the non-leadership vote when it announced its endorsement in Dec. 2015. But the WFP released the figure in the 2016 election cycle as a show of force for Sanders amid deep skepticism from within the WFP\u2019s national stakeholders. The fury expressed by many Sanders supporters toward the WFP endorsement reflects the realization of socialists who got involved in politics thanks to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign that they are not as closely aligned with the national WFP as they previously thought. In New York City in particular, members of the Democratic Socialists of America have worked closely with the WFP. New York City DSA, which endorsed Nixon at the WFP\u2019s urging over the objections of many of its members, provided an essential army of door knockers for her ultimately unsuccessful campaign. But while there is considerable overlap, DSA members are more uniformly socialist in their political outlook than the average WFP activist. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is the most conservative presidential contender for whom they are willing to consider mobilizing their membership to support. For example, Sanders has been far more consistent and emphatic than Warren in his support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which is perhaps the single highest policy priority of DSA members. \u201cThe split is between people who came into politics long before 2016 and have been doing progressive politics as a profession for a long time, and the movement that was sparked by the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Michael Kinnucan, a member of the NYC DSA. \u201cHis campaign got thousands of people involved in American politics at the rank-and-file level, in DSA and elsewhere, and that movement has begun to reshape American politics. Those folks do feel betrayed that the power and potential of that movement is not recognized by some people in the Working Families Party.\u201d",

However, he decried Trump as a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe and religious bigot, saying that he would do anything he could to tackle that type of behavior.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " As Sunday turned to Monday, Briahna Gray, national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, posted a series of criticisms of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Twitter. Gray began with subtlety, highlighting a speech the Vermont senator gave on the House floor in the 1990s in support of gay military veterans and service members. And, in what appeared to be a subtweet at Warren, she noted that Sanders delivered the speech at a time when \u201cyour fave was still \u2018evolving\u2019 (read \u2018triangulating\u2019) on gay rights.\u201d (In a follow-up conversation, Gray would not say to whom she was referring when she said \u201cfave.\u201d Warren supported same-sex marriage during her first Senate run in 2012, prior to former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cevolution.\u201d) Next, Gray noted that under Sanders\u2019 pro-union legislation, Warren\u2019s campaign would be forced into mediation for failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement so many months after recognizing its campaign staff\u2019s union. Finally, in a post shortly after midnight, Gray slammed Warren\u2019s refusal to endorse a national rent control law, echoing a critique voiced earlier in the weekend by left-wing activists. She suggested that it contradicted Warren\u2019s self-described can-do attitude toward other ambitious policies. Gray\u2019s comments in themselves were not out of the ordinary. Sanders campaign aides are notoriously feisty and independent on social media \u2015 a marked contrast with the boringly disciplined etiquette of other campaigns\u2019 staffers. But when HuffPost reached out on Monday to clarify whether Gray\u2019s remarks were part of a shift toward more explicit confrontation with Warren, the campaign directed HuffPost to Gray, who stood by her remarks. \u201cPrimary campaigns are about drawing contrasts between candidates so that voters can make an informed choice between them,\u201d Gray said in a statement. Sanders and Warren reportedly struck a non-aggression pact in December prior to launching their respective campaigns. The much-vaunted d\u00e9tente survived two nationally televised debates in which the two contenders shared a stage. They eschewed the moderators\u2019 efforts to drive a wedge between them in favor of teaming up against moderate rivals. Even in the course of a conversation about this article, the Sanders campaign wanted to emphasize his high regard for Warren. \u201cSen. Sanders respects Sen. Warren and values his friendship with her,\u201d Mike Casca, a senior communications adviser for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve been longtime allies in fighting to improve the lives of working Americans.\u201d But though Sanders himself has yet to criticize Warren, his aides and surrogates have been taking gradually bolder shots at the Massachusetts senator. The non-aggression pact is fraying. Gray\u2019s remarks follow more implicit steps in this direction by other Sanders lieutenants. Amid left-wing uproar over the Working Families Party\u2019s endorsement of Warren, top Sanders spokesman Mike Casca gave his blessing to calls for the WFP to release a breakdown of its endorsement vote that would show whether the group\u2019s national delegates overrode the will of pro-Sanders dues-paying members and activists. The following day, when Sanders received his millionth donor, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir noted that Sanders is the only candidate to rule out high-dollar private fundraisers for the primary as well as the general election. The observation was a veiled ding at Warren, who has said that in the interest of defeating President Donald Trump, she would resume courting wealthy donors during the general election. Just a few weeks ago, HuffPost reported that the Sanders campaign saw supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden as riper targets for persuasion. The campaign had a custom-made text message response for Biden backers, but only a generic one for voters leaning toward other candidates. But Warren\u2019s rise, reflected in everything from the WFP endorsement to new polling showing her winning more of Sanders\u2019 2016 voters than Sanders himself, has raised the specter of her supplanting Sanders as the go-to progressive alternative to Biden. The campaign aides\u2019 jabs at Warren, however tame and haphazard, provide an official imprimatur to a broader argument that Sanders surrogates and partisans have been making more openly for some time: that Warren\u2019s progressive bona fides are questionable and that she is a flawed general election candidate. Below is a summary and explanation of their various claims against her. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. The most recent pile-on against Warren kicked into gear over the weekend when she addressed the Iowa Center for Community Improvement Action Fund\u2019s candidate forum in Des Moines, Iowa. An activist pressed Warren on whether she would back national rent control legislation, which would cap annual rent increases across the country. Warren said that she would fight to ensure that localities are free from state laws that prevent them from pursuing rent control on their own, but would not back a national rent control law. \u201cWriting a rent control plan in Washington may work for Chicago, but it\u2019s not gonna work for Iowa City or it may not work for Dallas,\u201d she said. Warren introduced an affordable housing bill in March that would allot\u00a0$10 billion in grants that cities and regions could compete for, provided that they end restrictive land-use policies.\u00a0It would also give cities that enact tenant protections like rent control opportunities for additional cash. \u201cMy administration will also take whatever legal steps it can to stop states from preempting local efforts to enact tenant protection laws,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post outlining her housing plans. Warren would also invest $500 billion in building or restoring affordable housing \u2015 a figure she pays for by restoring the estate tax to its 2009 level. And she wants to create a home-buying assistance program for first-time buyers in historically redlined neighborhoods to narrow the Black-white wealth gap. Sanders, by contrast, would cap all annual rent increases at the higher of either 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation. Cities would be able to go further and landlords could apply for exemptions from the rule if they make major capital investments in a property. For some left-wing activists, particularly those living in expensive cities, making rent control \u201cuniversal\u201d \u2015 or at least expanding it \u2015 has become a priority nearly as urgent as achieving single-payer health care. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who volunteered for Sanders in 2016, introduced a rent control bill on Wednesday that also caps rent hikes at 3%. As a result, a video of Warren\u2019s exchange with the activist in Iowa posted by California-based labor organizer Brett Banditelli sparked biting criticism of Warren on social media. For example, Cea Weaver, who helped pass New York state\u2019s new rent regulations, suggested that Warren\u2019s lack of interest in national rent control reflected an elitist reliance on economic orthodoxy. Gray, the Sanders campaign aide, embedded Banditelli\u2019s video in her critical tweet as well. \u201cBernie says yes to [national] rent control [because] we can, we should, & we must,\u201d she wrote. Analilia Mejia, the Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, also highlighted the contrast between the two candidates\u2019 platforms on Twitter. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a comparison,\u201d she wrote. Beginning with the first Democratic presidential debate in June, Warren has repeatedly affirmed her support for Sanders\u2019 single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care legislation. When pressed about the bill\u2019s prohibition on all but very limited forms of private health insurance \u2015 a provision that has stirred the most political jitters \u2015 Warren has endorsed it time and again. Two presidential rivals, Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have, by comparison, backed away from Sanders\u2019 bill despite co-sponsoring it in the Senate. But some Sanders partisans note that Warren, a recent convert to the Medicare for All cause, still has not made it a major feature of her stump speech. She barely mentions the policy unless she is asked about it, and she has refused to explicitly say she would back middle-class taxes to pay for it. That has raised fears that Warren would not fight for it once in office, which Medicare for All proponents consider a prerequisite for its eventual passage. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Natalie Shure, a member of the Boston chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, told HuffPost. During a campaign event Wednesday in New Hampshire, Warren sparked a new round of skepticism when she described Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, which she has co-sponsored, as a \u201cframework.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got in Medicare for All is a framework, and it doesn\u2019t have the details, and you\u2019re right to be asking, but the most important part of your asking is to raise awareness so we get this right as we go through it,\u201d Warren said. The remark prompted a swipe from Sanders\u2019 senior adviser Warren Gunnels, who disputed Warren\u2019s word choice on Twitter. Medicare for All \u201cisn\u2019t a framework. It\u2019s a 100-page bill,\u201d he wrote. Bernie World skepticism of Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All is rooted in a broader suspicion of her more recent arrival at stances Sanders has held for decades. They argue that she is less trustworthy in general because she has admitted to being a registered Republican until the mid-1990s.\u00a0(Her research into the struggles of families declaring bankruptcy prompted her to leave the GOP, according to Warren.) Susan Sarandon, an Oscar-winning actor and prominent Sanders campaign surrogate, caused a stir in August when she took a veiled swipe at Warren while introducing Sanders at a campaign event in Iowa. Sanders, she said, \u201cis not someone who used to be a Republican. He is not someone who used to take money \u2014 or still takes money \u2014 from Wall Street. He is the real deal.\u201d Sarandon\u2019s remarks about taking money from Wall Street might refer to Warren\u2019s courtship of wealthy donors, including some from the financial world, during her 2018 Senate reelection campaign. She transferred over $10 million left over from that campaign to her presidential run before announcing that she would shun the fundraisers during the Democratic primary. (Warren\u2019s campaign has noted that big-ticket fundraisers accounted for only one-quarter of her total haul in 2017 and 2018.) John Cusack, another actor backing Sanders, introduced him at a rally on Tuesday in Chicago with members of several of the city\u2019s public-sector labor unions. He has echoed Sarandon\u2019s attacks on Warren\u2019s Republican past. \u201cNo ones [sic] been more consistent then [sic] Bernie for justice,\u201d he tweeted on Monday night. \u201cWarren was a republican as an adult -\u00a0 glad she figured out supply side economics was a hustle - but come on.\u201d In addition to their policy and ideology-based arguments that Warren is not radical enough, prominent Sanders supporters are also claiming that she is less competitive against Trump in a general election. The argument is twofold: First, they point to Warren\u2019s style on the stump and lower rates of support among Democrats without a college degree as evidence that she would have difficulty in a general election. Sanders had a narrow edge among voters with less than a college degree in an August poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, while Warren had a commanding lead over him among voters with advanced degrees. (Biden held the lead for voters at every education level except those with advanced degrees.) Krystal Ball, a co-host of Hill TV\u2019s digital show \u201cRising,\u201d made the case on Monday that Warren\u2019s appeal is stronger among more educated and successful Democrats because her focus on \u201cplans\u201d appeals to their meritocratic faith in common-sense problem-solving. Warren\u2019s failure to resonate with working-class voters despondent in the country\u2019s institutions make Ball \u201cterrified\u201d that Warren will lose to Trump, the pro-Sanders commentator said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got a plan for that\u2019 is like a magical elixir to\u201d highly educated Democrats, Ball said. \u201cIt says, \u2018The experts have been consulted, the white paper has been drafted. We the ascenders of the meritocracy will decide what is to be done about these poor, struggling denizens of the working class.\u2019\u201d Ball\u2019s characterization of Warren is not entirely accurate. She regularly denounces the political and economic system for being \u201crigged\u201d in favor of the super-rich, and has lionized grassroots movements like the one that emerged from the tragic fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911 as models for the kind of structural change she hopes to usher in. And some analysts have noted that newcomers tend to fare worse among working-class voters at the start of primary contests, because those voters follow the news less consistently. When those candidates go on to win their party\u2019s presidential nomination and the general election though, working-class voters have tended to come along. Former President Barack Obama, for example, trailed Hillary Clinton with white working-class voters for much of the primary, but thanks to a populist message, ultimately won enough of their votes to prevail twice in states like Ohio. The second line of attack that Sanders supporters raise against Warren is their objection to her past identification as a Native American in various informal legal settings. Warren has apologized for producing a DNA test in October that showed she likely had traces of Cherokee heritage. She has also affirmed that she is not a person of color. But for some Sanders supporters, who appear to consider the dustup an electoral liability, Warren\u2019s apology is not enough. In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Josh Fox, an anti-fracking activist and filmmaker backing Sanders, said Warren\u2019s identification as Native American \u201cwhen she was actually a descendent of colonialists is a huge self-inflicted mistake.\u201d Fox went on to incorrectly assert that Warren had not even apologized. (In fact, she has apologized for the DNA test, as well as identifying as Native American in various professional legal listings.) \u201cWhy isn\u2019t owning a mistake like this possible? I think it would make her more sympathetic and more human to be honest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf she just said- \u2018hey I was wrong about this, and I am being bullied by Donald Trump and etc.\u2019\u201d This piece has been updated with more information about Warren\u2019s proposed affordable housing bill.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " ROCK HILL, S.C. \u2015 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came to historically Black Clinton College in this suburb of Charlotte hoping to woo the voters she needs to complete a coalition that can claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: African Americans. Warren\u2019s slow and steady rise in polling has been largely powered by white voters with college degrees, though more recent polls have shown gains across basically every demographic within the Democratic Party. But one of her biggest rivals for the nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, still has a substantial lead among African American voters nationally and in this crucial state, the first in the south to cast its primary ballots. Compared to Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 the overwhelmingly white states that vote first and second in the primary \u2015 Warren has spent little time in South Carolina. A local reporter noted it had been more than a month since her last public event in the state, and a candidate tracker from the Charleston Post and Courier shows her attending just 12 events in the state before Saturday, compared to 17 for Biden, and more than 30 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third leading contender for the nomination. (Two African American candidates \u2015 California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2015 lead the way with 36 and 39 events, respectively.) Warren\u2019s supporters in South Carolina say if she picks up her pace in visits to the state, African American voters will embrace her message of battling political corruption and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care and free public higher education. \u201cWe\u2019re still a high-touch community, even in a high-tech society,\u201d said state Sen. Wendy Brawley, an African American who predicted Warren could win the state. \u201cShe gets that she needs to show up where we are.\u201d Warren\u2019s stop at Clinton College showed the promises and challenges that face the former Harvard Law professor. The crowd of roughly 1,000 people was mostly white, and attendees of all races largely said they arrived at the event already in her corner. Warren\u2019s pitch barely varied from her standard stump speech: She walked voters through her famous policy plans while nearly totally avoiding two hot topics of the day \u2015 the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and the details of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She did note her higher education plan would funnel an additional $50 billion to historically Black colleges like Clinton. It\u2019s not new for Warren to be courting African Americans. Some Black progressive activists have been raving about her since at least April, and she\u2019s often held listening sessions with Black leaders as she tours the country. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, what\u2019s broken and how to fix it,\u201d Warren told reporters when asked about the majority-white crowd and what she needed to do to win over Black voters. But it does appears Warren is ready to invest more time and resources in the state. She\u2019s opening a campaign office in Rock Hill next week, her campaign said. But while the Warren team is eager to talk up the strength of their field operations in Iowa and New Hampshire, they declined to reveal how many staffers are on the ground in the Palmetto State. (In total, Warren has 300 staffers, and 60% of those are in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.) Biden\u2019s campaign has 41 staffers on the ground here. Brawley and other Warren backers in the state pointed to two Warren policies they believe could help court Black voters: Her education policies \u2014 including the elimination of student debt \u2014 could woo younger Black voters, while her proposal to make sure no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare would attract Black women of all ages. \u201cIn my district, when you have grandparents raising their grands, when you have people working two jobs to keep a roof over their heads, not having childcare is a real issue,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThese are pocketbook issues that really matter, that can change people\u2019s lives if we give them even a little attention.\u201d Casey McClure, a 26-year-old who said she \u201cloved everything about\u201d Warren, suggested Biden\u2019s lead in the state was due to a generation gap. \u201cIt\u2019s the older voters,\u201d she said, noting she had met Biden during one of his earlier stops in the state. \u201cShe needs to get the young people out to vote.\u201d But there are some signs the gap might be closing. \u201cI love Joe, but he might not be as spunky as he used to,\u201d said McClure\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name. A Quinnipiac University poll this week saw Warren essentially tied with Biden, and building beyond her base of college-educated white voters. She earned the support of 27% of Democrats and Democratic-learning voters nationally, compared to 25% for the former vice president, and 16% for Sanders. That included a lead among college-educated white voters, liberals, voters aged 35 to 50, and those making more than $50,000 a year. She also tied Biden among white voters without a college degree. Among white voters overall, Warren led Biden 33% to 23%. But among Black voters, Biden\u2019s advantage was substantial: Forty percent said they support him, while only 19% backed Warren. That still represents a marked improvement for Warren. In July, the same poll found just 4% of Black voters supported her, while 53% supported Biden. A CNN poll of South Carolina voters released Sunday morning, however, painted a much grimmer picture for Warren. The poll showed Biden earning 37% of the statewide vote to Warren\u2019s 16%, with Sanders at 11%. Among Black voters, Warren tallied just 4% of the vote compared to Biden\u2019s 45% and Sanders\u2019 13%. Biden and his allies have long viewed Black voters as a crucial backstop for his campaign. While Sanders turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2016, his campaign floundered as Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s eventual nominee, routed him among African Americans. The primary schedule is similar this year. Fourteen states are holding their primaries on March 3, so-called Super Tuesday, when more than 40% of the Democratic delegates are up for grabs. Six of those states, including delegate-rich Texas, are at least 10% Black. But state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, another Warren backer, suggested Biden and others shouldn\u2019t count on South Carolina\u2019s voters to stay static, and noted the results in Iowa and New Hampshire could sway their votes. \u201cI know South Carolina for some of the other campaigns is considered to be a firewall state, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think African-American voters are not monolithic, and I think they\u2019re going to make decisions that best suit their community.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The Vermont senator would increase taxes on companies where CEOs earn more than 50 times the median worker.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released an \u201cincome inequality tax plan\u201d on Monday that would increase taxes on big companies where CEO pay is more than 50 times higher than that of the median worker. Sanders, a fierce critic of income inequality who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, identifies the explosion in compensation for top corporate executives as a key factor depressing ordinary workers\u2019 wages. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Sanders said in a statement accompanying the plan. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal, which applies to publicly and privately held companies with annual revenue of $100 million or more, would increase companies\u2019 corporate tax rate by 0.5 percentage points if their CEO received compensation worth between 50 and 100 times what the company\u2019s median employee earned. The higher a company\u2019s CEO-to-median worker pay ratio would go, the higher the surtax it would endure under Sanders\u2019 plan. The legislation would levy a 1-point tax hike on companies with CEO-to-median worker ratios between 100-to-1 and 200-to-1; a 2-point tax hike for those with ratios between 200-to-1 and 300-to-1; a 3-point tax hike for those with ratios between 300-to-1 and 400-to-1; a 4-point tax hike for those with ratios between 400-to-1 and 500-to-1; and a 5-point tax hike for those with ratios of more than 500-to-1. CEO pay has exploded relative to the compensation received by ordinary workers in the past few decades. In 2018, the average CEO-to-median worker pay of a corporation in the S&P 500 index was 287-to-1, according to an AFL-CIO analysis of data collected by the federal government. Prior to the 1970s, the gap between executive pay and that of ordinary workers at their companies was dramatically narrower. CEO compensation, including stock options, at the biggest 350 firms grew 940% since 1978, even as typical worker pay climbed just 12% over the same period, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. The EPI analysis, which looks at average, rather than median, worker compensation, found that the CEO-to-average worker pay ratio went from 20-to-1 in 1965 to 58-to-1 in 1989 to 278-to-1 in 2018. The Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington think tank,\u00a0released a report documenting high CEO pay on Monday as well. The report found that at 50 publicly-traded companies with the highest CEO-to-median worker pay gaps, the median worker would have to work 1,000 years to earn the CEO\u2019s pay. The Sanders campaign estimates that if companies increased median worker pay to $60,000 a year and capped CEO pay at $3 million, no company would pay additional taxes under his plan. Assuming that corporate behavior does not change, however, the plan would raise an additional $150 billion in revenue over a 10-year period, which Sanders would use to fund his plan to cancel Americans\u2019 $81 billion in medical debt. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d A February 2016 survey conducted by Stanford University broadly affirms Sanders\u2019 suggestion that his proposal is popular. The poll found that while Americans usually underestimate how much CEOs get paid, nearly two-thirds \u2015 62% \u2015 support capping their compensation, though just 49% said they wanted changes to come through government intervention. Sanders is locked in something of an arms race of economic populism with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who now leads him in public Democratic primary polls of Iowa and New Hampshire. Last week, Sanders unveiled a plan to tax the wealth of the richest 0.1% of households at gradually increasing rates. It goes considerably further than a proposal Warren released in January, prior to Sanders\u2019 entry in the race, that would impose a 2% tax on wealth above $50 million. Although Warren has not proposed a similar plan to tax CEO pay, legislation she introduced in August 2018, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would, among other things, require corporations to allow employees to elect 40% of corporate board members. The change could reduce CEO pay by giving workers a greater say in executive compensation.",

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, a sum that came from around 1.4 million donations, his campaign reported\u00a0 Tuesday. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d The third quarter ended Monday, and all 2020 candidates must report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. It\u2019s unclear how Sanders\u2019 third-quarter haul stacks up against his fellow candidates, but the senator has long been in the top echelon of fundraising, leaning on the support of small-dollar donations that propelled him forward in 2016. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden had all also\u00a0raised more than $20 million by the end of July, while other candidates have struggled to hit those targets, according to Open Secrets. Sanders\u2019 campaign said Tuesday he had raised a total of $61.5 million since he unveiled his bid for the White House, noting that 99.9% of donors hadn\u2019t yet maxed out how much they\u2019re legally allowed to give. An additional $2.6 million was transferred to the campaign from other campaign accounts. Some Democrats had been ringing the alarm bells to their supporters as the deadline loomed. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) said last month that his campaign was considering dropping out of the race if it didn\u2019t reach a self-imposed goal of $1.7 million for the quarter (his team said they \u201cblew past\u201d that total this weekend). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign also sent out a stark fundraising email in recent days, although his team later said it wasn\u2019t a signal that he planned to leave the race. Candidates\u2019 number of donors will come into play for the Democratic National Committee\u2019s upcoming debates in November. That event will have a higher threshold, mandating candidates have at least 165,000 individual donors as well as reaching at least 3% in at least four approved polls of Democratic voters. President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has already amassed a gargantuan war chest, raising more than $200 million from his campaign committee and outside groups. His campaign has not yet filed its FEC disclosures for the third quarter.",

Sanders spent $1.3 million on the ad buy in Iowa, the first state to vote in the Democratic primary. The senator\u2019s in-house production team created the 30-second and 60-second ads, titled \u201cFights for Us.\u201d They will run in Iowa for about two weeks beginning Thursday morning. The 60-second version of the ad flags President Donald Trump as a \u201cdangerous demagogue\u201d and highlights Sanders\u2019 long history of activism, briefly featuring a photo of a 21-year-old Sanders being arrested at a protest against segregation in Chicago schools in 1963. The announcement for the ad came shortly after Sanders\u2019 campaign revealed that the senator raised $25.3 million from about 1.4 million donations in the past three months. However successful his fundraising, Sanders was still dragging behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden at third place in a recent poll of likely Democratic caucus attendees in Iowa. Warren, who surged in the poll as Biden fell to second place, made an aggressive ad buy last week, spending at least $10 million in advertising in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary, including Iowa.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden raised $15.2 million over the last three months, his campaign announced on Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall,\u201d Greg Schultz, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cThe question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d The campaign also noted that 56% of donors were new to the campaign, which it said indicates Biden\u2019s staying power and popularity in the race to unseat President Donald Trump. The total is notably less than that of at least two of his fellow candidates, although Biden is still the frontrunner in many polls. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has so far raised the most out of any 2020 Democrat, picking up $25.3 million in the third quarter. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised more than $19 million, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) garnered $11.6 million. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who rose dramatically in polls over the summer, has not yet released her third quarter fundraising numbers. Biden has been at the center of the unfolding scandal over Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine earlier this year. During that conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Before the call, Trump ordered his administration to withhold military aid from the country. Democrats have cast the conversation as an unprecedented move by a president to solicit political help from a foreign power as part of a quid pro quo, although Trump has rejected those claims. It\u2019s unclear if the drama will damage Biden\u2019s chances in the presidential race.\u00a0Neither Biden has been accused of wrongdoing in the matter, and House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s behavior. Biden has gone on the offensive in recent days, firing back at the White House for waging what he called a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling.\u201d During a speech to supporters on Thursday, Biden continued to lambaste Trump but said he remained optimistic about this chances in 2020. \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report, before he went on to cite polls from Ohio and Michigan that put him above Trump. \u201cI thought those polls are wrong until Trump decided to go after me \u2015 so now I know they\u2019re right.\u201d Trump, for his part, had a very good financial summer. His reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a figure so large many Democratic leaders warned that the road ahead will not be easy. The two groups currently have more than $156 million cash on hand, double what former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this point before the 2012 election, Politico noted.",

      "content": " Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and now has $25.7 million to spend as the 2020 Democratic race enters its final stretch before primary season. The haul is second only to fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders raised $25.3 million from July to September, while former Vice President Joe Biden raised just $15.2 million. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who trails the other top fundraisers by significant margins in public polling, raised just over $19 million. \u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position \u2014 to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth\u2019s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,\u201d campaign manager Roger Lau wrote. It is all but certain that Warren and Sanders \u2015 two left-leaning progressives who have chosen to bypass high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign \u2015 will be the two candidates with the most successful third quarters. Warren, in particular, faced skepticism over her decision to bypass high-dollar fundraising \u2015 an area where she had excelled prior to the 2020 presidential race. \u201cElizabeth didn\u2019t sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cInstead, she got to spend her time traveling across the country, hosting town halls, taking tens of thousands of selfies, and hearing directly from people about what\u2019s on their minds.\u201d Warren, whose steady rise now has her essentially tied with Biden in most public polling, had 943,000 donations from 509,000 different individual donors. The average donation was $26, and the campaign said more than 300,000 people donated for the first time during the third quarter. Among lower-tier candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised $10 million and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker raised $6 million. Other candidates, including former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, have not yet released their fundraising totals. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign said that it and the Republican National Committee \u2015 which can collect much bigger checks than the individual Democratic contenders \u2015 raised more than $125 million in the third quarter.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday released a plan that would eliminate some of the last unrestrained corporate spending in Democratic politics, by banning corporate funding for the party\u2019s nominating convention and presidential inauguration events. Sanders\u2019 proposal to \u201cget corporate money out of politics\u201d\u00a0\u2015 the first plan his presidential campaign has released since he was hospitalized for a heart attack last week \u2015 would, among other things, ensure public financing of federal elections, create a new federal elections oversight board, prohibit advertising during presidential primary debates, and enact a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and top staffers. But replacing corporations\u2019 sponsorship of the Democratic National Convention with a public financing system is both the most ambitious and the most controversial element of Sanders\u2019 proposal. Seventeen donors were responsible for contributing three-quarters of the funding for the party\u2019s 2016 convention in Philadelphia, including a $5.6 million in-kind donation from Comcast for broadcast and internet services. Sanders said his own campaign\u2019s success raising money in small increments \u2015 he topped the Democratic presidential field with a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter of this year \u2015 shows that corporate money and wealthy donors are not necessary. \u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement accompanying the plan. \u201cWhen we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.\u201d Some of the other changes Sanders proposes include banning lobbyist and corporate PAC donations to the Democratic National Committee if he is the Democratic presidential nominee, barring former DNC chairs and vice chairs from lobbying, and capping individual contributions to official inauguration committees at $500. He would also seek to pass a constitutional amendment clarifying that money is not equivalent to speech and that corporations do not have the legal status of individuals, thereby eliminating key legal justifications for court rulings striking down campaign finance regulations. As Democrats have grown warier of corporate influence in politics, the party\u2019s national convention every four years \u2014 which is overwhelmed by corporate spending and lobbyist influence peddling\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has attracted more scrutiny from good government advocates and progressive activists. Meanwhile, the DNC\u2019s convention CEO, Joe Solmonese, has already set out to court corporate sponsors to raise upward of $70 million for the party\u2019s nominating convention in Milwaukee in July 2020.\u00a0Perks for six-figure donors include VIP convention credentials and box seats to attend the proceedings. That makes the convention a natural target for Sanders, an independent who has long been antagonistic toward the donors and insiders that play an outsize role in Democratic Party politics. \u201cWhen Bernie is the nominee, everything will fundamentally change for corporate elites,\u201d Josh Orton, the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, said in a statement. \u201cA Bernie Sanders convention will be a people-powered convention.\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal is likely to raise questions about his ability and willingness to compete with President Donald Trump, who will have virtually limitless cash to finance a rival convention. A convention provides a political party a key opportunity to introduce its presidential and vice presidential nominees to a national audience on live television. Of course, it is much easier to swear off high-dollar private fundraisers \u2015 as Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have done \u2015 in a presidential primary. It is harder to replace multimillion-dollar corporate checks that come in for the convention than\u00a0the $2,800 checks that closed-door fundraisers earn candidates in primaries. Sanders\u2019 proposal differs from that of Warren, a fellow economic populist who has surpassed him in national and early-state primary polls.\u00a0In an anti-corruption proposal released in September, Warren suggested a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress, presidents, vice presidents, Cabinet secretaries and federal judges.\u00a0But she does not yet have a major plan to reform campaign financing, including how the national political conventions are financed. Warren has also said that she would resume soliciting big checks in private fundraisers if she were the Democratic presidential nominee, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d against Trump and the Republicans. Sanders, by contrast, has said he would not change his ban on the policy.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Less than a week after suffering a heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) addressed hundreds of campaign staffers on Monday afternoon to offer his gratitude for their work and assure them he is more committed than ever to winning the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cIronically, I will tell you that I feel more strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began,\u201d he said, according to the campaign. The mood amongst the staffers who were on the brief call was boisterous,\u00a0according to three people who were on the call who requested anonymity to speak without authorization. One of the campaign aides described being moved by Sanders\u2019 reminder that their campaign \u2014 which boasts the slogan, \u201cNot me. Us.\u201d \u2014 was about the hopes and dreams of millions of working people seeking a better life. \u201cYou work so fucking hard on these things, that it\u2019s good to hear the person you work for have this really kind of humbling approach to it all,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe said \u2018Don\u2019t take your eye off the ball\u2019 in a way that really got people moving.\u201d The call embodied the broader response that the campaign has had since Sanders was hospitalized late Tuesday night with chest pain that ended up being a \u201cmyocardial infarction,\u201d or heart attack: That Sanders is well on his way back to full health, that his fight for Medicare for All is more personal than ever, and that he has no plans to slow down his campaign. \u201cThe working class Americans who are the core of Bernie\u2019s movement wake up each day and battle adversity of all kinds, and we believe they will be drawn even closer to the senator as he continues to fight for a shared vision to transform our country so it works for all of us \u2013 not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Monday. Sanders, 78, was treated in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the insertion of two stents to unclog one of his arteries. On Friday, he emerged from the hospital alongside his wife Jane with a triumphant fist in the air, recorded a video for his supporters on social media, and returned home to Burlington, Vermont. He and his wife took a walk in the rain on Monday, which CNN captured on camera. In addition to facing the politically tricky task of persuading primary voters that a septuagenarian heart attack survivor is up to the task of winning the White House, the Sanders campaign is already working to quiet skepticism of its immediate response to his ailment. Nearly three days passed between Sanders\u2019 hospitalization and the announcement on Friday that he had suffered a heart attack. Sanders\u2019 team maintains that they provided the accurate medical information as soon as it was available; they were not sure of the diagnosis until he was discharged from the hospital. In keeping with a mid-September promise, Sanders will be releasing his full medical records in the near future, though the campaign did not provide any additional details about timing. The Sanders campaign did its best to continue with business as usual in the days following his hospitalization. Over the weekend, the campaign dispatched three of its co-chairs \u2015 former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, California Rep. Ro Khanna and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz \u2015 to barnstorm the early primary states with a packed schedule of events. And early Monday morning, the campaign released Sanders\u2019 plan to get corporate money out of politics, including the cash-riddled presidential nominating conventions. Sanders will have his first chance to demonstrate his vitality at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15. The Vermont senator does not have any public events planned prior to the debate; he canceled a scheduled appearance at an LGBTQ town hall on CNN this Thursday. In the meantime, the campaign is keen to showcase the strength of Sanders\u2019 support network, which appears to have been inspired by his hospitalization to redouble their efforts on his behalf. The campaign announced on Sunday that its staff and volunteers had met its goal of making 1 million phone calls to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and California in ten days\u2019 time. According to an aide, the campaign experienced a spike in volunteers on Wednesday after news of Sanders\u2019 hospitalization broke, pushing the phone call tally up to 1.3 million. The figure is not surprising given the frenzy of emotion among his supporters following his hospitalization. A number of Sanders partisans with significant social media followings downplayed the significance of the stent procedure and highlighted the speed of Sanders\u2019 recovery. And the campaign racked up 8,000 donations on Wednesday, according to co-chair, Rep. Ro Khanna of California. One of the donors was RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of the National Nurses United union, and a prominent campaign supporter, who chipped in $100. \u201cIt was like a rallying cry. It was incredible,\u201d DeMoro said of the outpouring of support for Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between having a movement as opposed to just a campaign.\u201d Sanders supporters, many of whom have lost faith in more conventional politicians, are famously passionate in their support for Sanders. The prospect that a health scare could damage his standing in the polls prompted so much renewed involvement due to supporters\u2019 belief that Sanders is uniquely equipped to defeat Trump and solve the country\u2019s problems, according to Jim Zogby, a pollster and top Sanders surrogate. \u201cPeople all of a sudden woke up and said, \u2018Bernie might not be in the mix \u2015 this can\u2019t be,\u2019\u201d said Zogby, who also runs the Arab American Institute. \u201cHe comes back to an invigorated campaign with a staff and a support base that has doubled down in their efforts to make this happen. Because they realize that for them \u2015 and for me \u2015 he\u2019s the critical choice.\u201d Calls for Sanders\u00a0to drop out of the race \u2015 however few they were in number \u2015 only riled up Sanders\u2019 supporters, many of whom already firmly believe that the established media and political classes will stop at nothing to prevent Sanders from winning. The Thursday release of \u201cRising Up,\u201d a five-minute video created by Matt Orfalea, a Sanders activist not affiliated with the campaign, added to the dramatic \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative that has long animated Bernie World. Orfalea\u2019s video, which many called an advertisement, showed numerous clips of pundits, reporters and comedians mocking Sanders on a series of topics, juxtaposed with footage of him doing the opposite \u2014\u00a0greeting supporters with a smile, listening sympathetically, speaking to crowds of diverse voters. The spot, which featured some of the do-it-yourself charm of the 2016 campaign, earned plaudits from prominent Democrats who are not supporting Sanders but are nonetheless sympathetic to claims of media bias against him. In just a few days, the video racked up over 6.3 million views on Twitter alone \u2015 far more than Sanders\u2019 first official campaign ad, which came out days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s something that deeply resonates and it was released at the perfect moment, when Bernie needed it the most,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any presidential candidate, said of the video. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of things voters don\u2019t just watch but also share.\u201d A question on the minds of some poll watchers is nonetheless how Sanders\u2019 heart attack affects the campaign of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70, a fellow progressive who has surpassed Sanders in national and early primary-state polls. In a gesture of solidarity, Warren\u2019s campaign bought dinner on Wednesday for Sanders\u2019 staff at his campaign headquarters in Washington. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. But two prominent Warren supporters suggested that Sanders\u2019 continued presence in the race could only help her candidacy. Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, argued that the presence of another left candidate is mutually beneficial. It increases the legitimacy of their shared ideas, and is liable to dissuade super-rich donors from erecting a super PAC to take out either one of them, he posited. \u201cIf you knock one out, you help the other,\u201d Green said of such a scenario. \u201cAnd if you run ads hitting both of them, you just elevate them as the two most clear and transformational progressives.\u201d Murshed Zaheed, a partner at the progressive communications firm Megaphone Strategies who previously worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed Green\u2019s sentiments, likening it to a progressive race to the top. \u201cThere\u2019s no coincidence that both of them are smashing the neoliberals in this race in terms of fundraising,\u201d said Zaheed. \u201cCompetition makes each one better.\u201d",

Riggs was 46. \u201cHow do you go on day by day when your heart just keeps breaking over and over?\u201d the obituary said of Riggs\u2019 sudden passing. \u201cOur world will never be the same.\u201d Riggs, who was married to Sanders\u2019 son Levi, died the same day that the Vermont senator returned home after suffering a heart attack.

She was eventually diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \u201cHer last words were to tell her children how much she loved them and she was so sorry that she got sick.

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brushed off claims that his presidential campaign wasn\u2019t being transparent when the presidential hopeful was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders, 78, said of the criticism, according to NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people think campaigns are. You know we\u2019re dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really.\u201d Sanders said his campaign acted \u201cabsolutely appropriately\u201d by not rushing to alert the media after he was hospitalized. \u201cSo the first thing that we\u2019re trying to do is understand what\u2019s going on and not run to The New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cYou know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u201d When the Sanders campaign announced that the senator was hospitalized last week, they didn\u2019t specify Sanders\u2019 exact condition. The campaign noted only that Sanders had\u00a0\u201cexperienced some chest discomfort\u201d and underwent an emergency heart procedure for a blocked artery. Two and a half days later, Sanders was released from the hospital. At that time, his campaign issued a statement in which his doctors revealed he had a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The episode has thrust Sanders\u2019 health into the spotlight as one of the oldest candidates running for president. Critics have raised questions about whether he should campaign aggressively, but his staffers remain energized to move forward. Before his heart attack, the senator promised to release his medical records before the Democratic primaries begin. He told reporters Wednesday that he would release those records \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d according to Politico. Sanders also said he had no intention of slowing down his campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday. \u201cI love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Democratic presidential race that had been largely static through the summer has tumbled into a chaotic fall, shaped by unpredictable events and the deepening impeachment crisis surrounding President Donald Trump. Less than four months before voting begins, front-running candidates are facing urgent questions about their ability to challenge Trump, prompted by a health scare for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an uneven response by Joe Biden to the president\u2019s efforts to tie him to the impeachment inquiry and nagging questions about liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2018s electability. Lower-tier candidates are struggling just to be heard. The uncertainty is heightening anxieties among Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020. Although impeachment could imperil Trump\u2019s presidency, the process has also highlighted Trump\u2019s skill at discrediting his opponents, sometimes with baseless conspiracy theories. And Democrats appear no closer to sorting out what tactics, what ideology and what person is best-suited to overcome that. Progressive candidates like Sanders and Warren are surging in fundraising and drawing support from a wide swath of voters, according to polls, but face opposition from moderates who question whether now is the time to start the kind of sweeping \u2014 and divisive \u2014 economic and societal reforms they are pushing. It\u2019s a concern some moderates say has only increased against the backdrop of impeachment. \u201cThe divisions we have in the country threaten the health and stability of our democracy. President Trump has fractured so many norms,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cLike a patient getting over an illness or injury, we have to first heal the nation\u2019s divisions and reestablish our norms before we have the needed strength to successfully embrace and implement an array of big ideas.\u201d Vilsack, a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 race. He\u2019s been courted by, and consulted with, numerous candidates, and has spoken regularly with Warren. The Massachusetts senator has energized voters with a menu of detailed policy proposals, a folksy, relatable way of explaining them and a swell of small-dollar donations that brought in more than $24.6 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s increasingly turning her into a target for candidates who see her calls for overhauling health care and rebalancing wealth in America as outside the mainstream. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is trying to break into the upper rung, has focused in particular on Warren\u2019s health care plan, the Sanders\u2019-authored \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer system that Buttigieg describes as a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d But it\u2019s more than the policy Buttigieg is arguing against. \u201cWe have to be able not only to thrill a debate audience or a Twitter following but actually make something happen, which tells us that having the smartest policy is only half the battle when it comes to what will actually make a difference,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview. For now, Warren advisers are happy to have Sanders still in the race to help absorb those blows rather than becoming the sole target of the attacks. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey bolster each other\u2019s ideas.\u201d The confidence Sanders\u2019 campaign felt last week after announcing a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter \u2014 the highest in the race \u2014 was lessened after the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack. He told reporters this week that he planned to scale back his campaign, then said he had misspoken. He\u2019ll return to the campaign on Tuesday for a debate in Ohio. His advisers privately acknowledge that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry was escalating \u2014 may have helped limit the political fallout because attention was focused elsewhere. But they also understand that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 chief strategist, dismissed any long-term concerns, noting that the 2020 contest includes several older candidates, including the 73-year-old Trump. \u201cThere are a number of older candidates in the race, including the sitting president of the United States, and I can tell you with confidence, there\u2019s only one we can say with assurance whose arteries are completely open,\u201d Weaver said, referencing the stent procedure designed to clear Sanders\u2019 clogged arteries. Biden, 76, stands as the strongest obstacle to Warren and Sanders, fundamentally opposed on policy and pitching a more conciliatory approach to governing. The former vice president was already facing questions about whether he was out of step with the party\u2019s activist liberal base and up for the challenge of taking on Trump before he got pulled into the impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son. Although Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden are so far without foundation, the president and his allies have aggressively pressed the charges. Biden responded forcefully this week, but only after days of hand-wringing among supporters and advisers who worried he appeared ill-prepared for combatting the kind of asymmetrical political warfare at which Trump excels. Still, Biden backers contend that the mere fact that Trump has appeared focused on trying to take down Biden allows the former vice president to strengthen his electability argument by previewing what a one-on-one race with the president would look like. \u201cHe\u2019s able to go out there every day and make this Biden vs. Trump argument,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for Biden. That\u2019s the fear for some lower-tier candidates \u2014 that the head-to-head fight between Trump and Biden, and the grassroots support of Warren and Sanders, block out their opportunities for a late surge. Everyone is at risk, including those who have had flashes of success in recent months but are now languishing in the single digits in many polls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Buttigieg said there is no secret strategy for those candidates seeking to break out during this intense fall stride toward the first votes other than engaging in a \u201crespectful and robust\u201d debate of ideas. \u201cWhere there\u2019s an important difference, people need to understand that,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a set of \u201ccorporate accountability and democracy\u201d plans on Monday that radically reimagine the role of corporations in U.S. society \u2015 and should shake up an already vibrant debate about corporate power within the Democratic primary field. By far the boldest of the proposals is Sanders\u2019 plan to force large corporations to grant workers ownership of 20% of the shares issued by the company and 45% of the seats on the board of directors. The proposal would apply to all publicly traded companies, as well as privately held corporations with annual revenue of at least $100 million or balance sheets with the same amount. The package of reforms, which also includes a number of less spectacular changes to tax and regulatory laws, is perhaps the senator\u2019s biggest move so far to back up his identification as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d The Vermont independent has generally used that term to describe his support for New Deal-style, welfare-state liberalism, but with this proposal, he is getting closer to the kinds of economic democratization envisioned by members of the Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cFor more than 40 years, the largest and most profitable corporations in America have rigged the tax code and our economy to redistribute wealth and income to the richest and most powerful people in this country,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe American people are saying enough is enough.\u201d \u2015 Sanders argues that if workers have a greater say in their corporate employers\u2019 practices, those companies will be less likely to offshore jobs, overpay CEOs and pollute the communities in which they\u2019re located. \u201cEmployees in worker-owned companies are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else,\u201d his campaign states in its official description of the policy. \u201cThey play a central role in determining what the company does and how it is run.\u201d But critics of worker-owned companies, including some socialists, have noted that even those companies are subject to the competitive demands of a global, for-profit market. That means that worker-owners are often under pressure to embrace exploitative practices even if those practices negatively affect them and their co-workers. Still, Sanders believes that more worker-owners would at least be a monumental improvement on the status quo. With that in mind, he would also force corporations to give their workers the right of first refusal to buy the company before it is shuttered or sold. Companies that automate jobs or outsource them to cheaper workers in other countries would have to give the affected American employees shares in the company. And he would create a U.S. employee ownership bank, which would provide loans to workers trying to buy the companies that employ them, as well as centers to teach the advantages of worker ownership to employees and those business owners looking to sell. In addition, Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability plan features an array of changes to corporate governance, tax law and antitrust enforcement. Sanders would ban large-scale stock buybacks and force corporations to obtain new federal charters requiring them to weight the interests of the diverse array of stakeholders rather than just shareholders. He is calling for the restoration of the top corporate income tax rate of 35%, which was cut to 21% under President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut legislation, and the closing of loopholes and tightening of disclosure requirements to crack down on the use of offshore tax havens. Other Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker\u00a0of New Jersey, have said they are open to raising the top corporate tax rate to the high 20s, but not to its pre-2017 level. Sanders also plans to toughen up antitrust enforcement on U.S. corporations by overhauling the Federal Trade Commission; writing merger rules that weigh impacts on workers and innovation, rather than just price competition; and barring companies from forcing workers into non-compete agreements and other anti-competitive practices. As Sanders scrambles to improve his standing in the polls and regain momentum after his\u00a0heart attack at the start of the month, he has been releasing a steady stream of ambitious policy proposals, most of which relate to his signature issue of economic inequality. In the past few weeks, he has put out plans to eliminate medical debt, curb CEO pay\u00a0and get rid of corporate money in politics. Sanders\u2019 obvious competitor in the Democratic contest for progressive economic ideas is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has surpassed him in both national and early-state polling. The closest analog to Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability and democracy reforms is Warren\u2019s Accountable Capitalism Act, a bill she introduced in August 2018\u00a0that requires 40% of corporate board members to be chosen by employees. She does not yet have a plan to devolve corporate ownership to workers as well. Corporate reform has been a strong suit for Warren, but Sanders evidently believes it is an area where she can be bested. Warren drew criticism from left-wing commentators for a Friday tweet from her Senate account\u00a0that detractors thought painted an overly rosy picture of labor-management relations prior to the country\u2019s rightward economic shift in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cFor most of America\u2019s history, when our companies did better, our workers did better \u2015 and America built a thriving middle class,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Accountable Capitalism Act will help realign our skewed market incentives so companies & workers can once again do well together.\u201d The Sanders campaign still sees the types of working-class voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden as ripe targets for persuasion. But his team has grown increasingly willing to draw distinctions between him and Warren, signaling a weakening of the truce they had reportedly negotiated before launching their respective presidential campaigns. In an interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl that aired on Sunday, Sanders began to underscore their differences. \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, \u2018Enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWe need real change in this country.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "ALTOONA, Iowa \u2015 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, got a warm welcome at a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers union at a casino in this Des Moines suburb. The International President of the UFCW, Marc Perrone, praised him as a \u201cliberal lion\u201d who had changed the debate on health care and economic policy. At the end of Sanders\u2019 speech, the roughly 400 union members stood and applauded. There was one problem, if you could call it that: Sanders wasn\u2019t in Altoona. While Democratic candidates major (former Vice President Joe Biden) and minor (Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet) had flown to Iowa for the event, Sanders appeared from the living room of his family home in Burlington, Vermont, and delivered his speech via Skype. As new polling suggests Sanders\u2019 heart attack may harm his chances to win the nomination, his campaign is working to project normalcy, even as Sanders remains at home under doctor\u2019s orders. Sanders is set to make his first public appearance outside of Vermont since the health scare on Tuesday night at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio \u2015 an appearance his campaign hopes will quiet doubts about whether he can win the nomination. Sanders\u2019 speech at the UFCW forum was his standard fare: He promised \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a $15 minimum wage, doubling union membership in his first term, and floated the possibility of making the work week shorter.\u00a0(Sanders\u2019 friendly welcome from the UFCW crowd wasn\u2019t a total surprise: The union represents his campaign staff.) \u201cYou\u2019ve proven no matter what may come, you\u2019ll never shrink from a righteous fight,\u201d Perrone said before Sanders spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a cardiac event, and you still wanted to be here with us.\u201d Sanders has made himself available to reporters multiple times in the past week and sat for an interview with ABC News on Sunday, hoping to continue to get his campaign\u2019s message out, even if he\u2019s unable to travel to the early states. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 88% of registered voters say they\u2019ve heard at least a little about Sanders having a heart attack. The news appears to have taken a toll on perceptions of his health \u2015 just 19% of voters say they believe he is in good enough physical condition to serve effectively as president for four years. By comparison, 43% believe former Vice President Joe Biden is in adequate health, with 53% saying the same of President Donald Trump and 66% of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Views of the candidates\u2019 health are clearly, to some extent, motivated by politics: 85% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters consider Trump physically healthy enough to serve, while only a quarter of Democrats and Democratic-leaners say the same. But even those on Sanders\u2019 side of the aisle are expressing concerns. Just 28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Sanders is in physical condition to serve effectively, compared to the 59% who say the same of Biden and the 81% who say the same of Warren. More broadly, a 56% majority of voters say they believe Sanders\u2019 age would make it difficult for him to serve effectively as president, with 44% saying the same of Biden, who was born the year after him. Only a third are similarly concerned about Trump\u2019s age. Warren, perhaps helped by the fact that many voters believe her to be younger than she is, fared best on the metric, with just 16% saying her age would make it difficult for her to serve. It\u2019s not yet clear whether or to what extent these concerns will eat into Sanders\u2019 standing in the horse race, which has remained relatively stable in aggregate for months. Polling that focuses specifically on the candidates\u2019 age may overstate the degree to which voters are making their decisions on that basis. The electorate may not be pining for a septuagenarian president \u2015 just 3% of Democrats say they\u2019d consider that ideal, per one survey \u2015 but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from advancing a trio of candidates in their 70s to front-runner status against an incumbent of similar age. There\u2019s also potential room for specific worries about a candidate\u2019s health to recede. In a 2016 Economist/YouGov poll taken after Hillary Clinton suffered a bout with pneumonia, only 45% of voters thought she was in physical condition to serve as president; within two weeks, however, that number had recovered to 52%, close to where she\u2019d stood earlier in the campaign. (That same poll put confidence in Trump\u2019s physical health in the mid-60s, significantly better than his current standing.) Voters say, 64% to 22%, that it\u2019s fair for the media to question a candidate\u2019s physical health. They\u2019re more divided on how much information candidates should be expected to provide about their health. About half say candidates should publicly release all medical information that might affect their ability to serve, while 39% say the candidates should have the right to keep their records private. Democratic voters are more than twice as likely as GOP voters to say candidates should release all their medical information \u2015 a reversal from 2016, when Republicans were the party more likely to favor such disclosure and to consider media scrutiny fair game. Sanders\u2019 campaign maintains that he will demonstrate his vitality on national television when he participates in Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio. It is his first public appearance since the Oct. 1 hospitalization. On the debate stage, said campaign spokesman Mike Casca, voters will see a \u201creinvigorated Bernie.\u201d \u201cHe will dispel any lingering concerns when he returns to his regular pace on the trail,\u201d Casca added. Sanders announced over the weekend that his first major campaign event since the heart attack will be a large \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally on the East River waterfront in Queens, New York, on Saturday. The rally, held in the same city where Warren drew her largest crowd of the campaign, follows a rocky period for Sanders\u2019 as it has sought to quiet doubts about viability. Sanders, who has been recovering at his home in Burlington, Vermont, told a group of reporters staking out his home on Tuesday that he would likely be slowing the pace of his campaign by, among other things, holding fewer than three or four events a day. A day later, he said he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d and that he had no plans to decelerate the campaign. But the campaign has said that Sanders\u2019 error was tonal \u2015 implying that the campaign would be less intense \u2015 rather than substantively inaccurate. It has not taken back the part of his remarks where he said he would hold fewer daily events going forward. In response to a request for clarification from HuffPost, the campaign declined to detail the volume of Sanders\u2019 future events, but said that Sanders would be careful not to overextend himself. Indeed, Sanders and his aides often imply that adopting a lighter schedule would not affect the campaign\u2019s performance, since he previously had one of the most packed schedules of any of the Democratic candidates. \u201cNobody\u2019s run a more vigorous campaign than Sen. Sanders \u2015 often holding three or four rallies a day with town halls throughout \u2015 and he was doing it all with a partially blocked artery,\u201d Casca said. Sanders vowed in mid-September that he would release his full medical records well before the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3. He has reiterated that commitment in the wake of his heart attack. In a Sunday interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl, he said merely that the campaign would be releasing them \u201cas soon as we can.\u201d In the meantime, Sanders has been putting out a steady stream of digital content from his Burlington home designed to showcase his health. On Friday, Sanders released a video on social media showing him hitting baseballs pitched by deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. The clip quickly racked up more than 500,000 views on Twitter. And when Karl interviewed him on Sunday, he pitched to Sanders in the Vermont senator\u2019s backyard. Karl subsequently took a shot at Sanders\u2019 pitches. \u201cTrue \u2015 I got shelled by a 78-year-old guy who just had a heart attack,\u201d Karl wrote in an Instagram post capturing video of Sanders making contact on Karl\u2019s pitch. \u201cBut check out Sanders on the mound.\u201d The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 8-10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " It\u2019s a question every Democratic presidential candidate knows is coming, and yet it always trips them up. They have struggled at every Democratic primary debate so far this year when asked if they support higher taxes not just on the rich but on the middle class, as part of Democrats\u2019 ambitious domestic policy agenda. Debate moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at the Houston debate last month about universal health care:\u00a0\u201cWill middle-class taxes go up?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about health care,\u201d Warren said, launching into an explanation about how middle-class Americans would pay less under a universal health care system. Warren implied that taxes would go up, but refused to give Stephanopoulos a direct answer. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also avoided saying \u201cyes\u201d to the tax question that night. At the debate in June, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) blanched when asked if he\u2019d support a top marginal tax rate of 70%, saying meekly that he supports a tax code \u201cthat is fair to everyone.\u201d And this is the guy who offered a \u201chell yes\u201d when asked if he would confiscate people\u2019s assault weapons. The tax question is a trap, premised on the idea that raising taxes is always bad politics. The moderator already knows the candidate\u2019s position. Both the moderator and the candidate believe that answering with a simple \u201cyes\u201d would launch a thousand Republican attack ads. Not answering doesn\u2019t work either. After the September debate, TV analysts and the Republican National Committee bashed Warren\u00a0for not disavowing taxes and not embracing them. The question also ignores the underlying math. Under the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal that many candidates have endorsed in some form, the $3.5 trillion cost of the U.S. health care system would shift to the government, which currently pays about half of that total. Many households would pay higher taxes \u2015 in lieu of forking out for insurance premiums, copays and surprise medical bills. A single-payer system would have lower administrative costs, meaning that households would end up spending less on health care overall. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fair question because the thing people don\u2019t like about taxes is it means they have less money,\u201d said Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing think tank People\u2019s Policy Project. \u201cBut Medicare for All, as proposed, would mean that middle-class people would have more money, not less money.\u201d A fairer question would be to ask candidates to explain how they\u2019d convince voters of the tax tradeoff\u2019s benefits. Warren tried to do so last month while sidestepping the direct inquiry about a tax increase: \u201cFor hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.\u201d It might have been the best possible response, considering the circumstances, but it\u2019s worth examining the underlying assumption: Are middle-class tax increases really political poison? Vanessa Williamson, a scholar and Brookings Institution senior fellow who has done extensive research on public attitudes toward taxation, doesn\u2019t think so. Williamson previously studied the tea party backlash to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, interviewing activists who ostensibly hated taxes and deficits. She found they actually had favorable attitudes toward big government programs like Social Security and were more motivated by fears that Obama would shower government benefits on populations they considered undeserving, including immigrants and people of color. Williamson noticed that tea partiers frequently prefaced their gripes by saying, \u201cAs a taxpayer ...\u201d and it made her wonder: If these people hate taxes so much, why are they so proud of having paid taxes? Her research found that the seemingly anodyne concept of being a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is full of connotations heavily shaped by politics. \u201cPeople use the rhetoric about taxpaying to get at these bigger issues of who counts as an American and does the government represent people like me,\u201d she said in an interview. In other words, people are less angry about paying taxes than they are about what the government does with that money \u2015 and their understanding of \u201cgovernment\u201d is highly flexible. If a tax is linked to something people like, such as roads, schools, Social Security and Medicare, they don\u2019t hate it at all. Decades of white identity politics have had a major impact. Surveys have shown that someone who believes African Americans are entirely to blame for their economic disadvantages is also far more likely to dislike taxes and oppose public spending. Some of the evidence that people don\u2019t simply hate taxes has been hiding in plain sight. Overwhelming majorities of Americans have told pollsters for years that taxpaying is a civic duty and tax evasion is wrong. Again and again, nearly two-thirds of voters\u00a0tell Pew\u00a0that it bothers them \u201ca lot\u201d that corporations and the wealthy don\u2019t pay their fair share, while less than a third are bothered by what they themselves pay. Majorities of Americans consistently\u00a0tell Gallup that they think their own federal income tax burden is fair. Williamson thinks trends may even suggest a greater willingness to vote for\u00a0more taxes. According to her analysis, voters approved only 20% of tax-increase measures on statewide ballots in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, but in the last decade, voters have approved half of the dozens of tax-hike initiatives that made it onto their ballots. In 2012, for instance, voters in several states endorsed higher income taxes and taxes on marijuana sales. A HuffPost/YouGov survey this month found that 44% of Americans approve of a single-payer program in which all Americans get health insurance through a government plan, while 36% oppose.\u00a0If the program were financed with a tax on households worth more than $50 million, Americans were even likelier to support the proposal, with 50% in favor and 33% against. But if it were financed with a payroll tax, only 36% favored the idea and 39% opposed it. Republicans sometimes play identity politics by claiming that half of Americans don\u2019t pay taxes. Running for president in 2012, Mitt Romney said that 47% of the country pays no federal income tax, is hooked on welfare and will never vote Republican. \u201cAmericans perceive themselves as taxpayers but imagine that many other people, and especially lower-income people, do not pay taxes,\u201d Williamson wrote in her 2017 book, \u201cRead My Lips: Why Americans Are Proud to Pay Taxes.\u201d \u201cThe belief that many Americans are getting government benefits without paying into the system encourages opposition to social safety net spending.\u201d One reason that politicians can manipulate views on taxes is that the tax system itself is confusing.\u00a0Romney was correct that a significant percentage of Americans pay no federal income tax, but income tax is just part of the federal tax code. Even people who owe no income tax have Social Security and Medicare taxes automatically taken out of their paychecks, and those two payroll deductions represent more than a third of all federal revenue. (Federal income tax is also\u00a0incorrectly withheld from the paychecks of some low-wage workers who don\u2019t owe it and who ultimately never get it back in the form of a refund.) The payment of Social Security and Medicare taxes, however, doesn\u2019t get highlighted every year when Americans fill out their tax returns, and many people seem to believe, incorrectly, that someone who doesn\u2019t pay income tax isn\u2019t paying taxes at all. In fact, anyone who earns a paycheck is a federal taxpayer since Social Security and Medicare taxes are taken from a worker\u2019s very first dollar of income. In most states, anyone who buys almost anything at a store pays a state sales tax. One recent analysis argues that if you count state and local levies, the poor pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rich do. But comments like Romney\u2019s reinforce the notion that those taxes don\u2019t count \u2015 and surveys show that Republicans who follow the news are likelier to underestimate the share of Americans who pay taxes. There\u2019s another\u00a0womp-womp reason that Democrats have no good answer to the tax question: They helped lay this trap for themselves. When Democrats created Social Security retirement insurance in the 1930s \u2015 probably the most successful and popular social program in American history \u2015 they paid for it with a new payroll tax. But instead of calling it that, they often described the funding mechanism as \u201ccontributions\u201d made by workers that would eventually pay them an annuity. And when Democrats pushed higher income taxes on the middle class in the \u201940s and \u201950s, they stressed that this was only to pay for wars or to control inflation. During World War II, the Roosevelt administration hired Walt Disney to make propaganda cartoons that\u00a0literally blamed Adolf Hitler for higher taxes. This kind of tax rhetoric has had long-term consequences, according to Molly Michelmore, a historian at Washington and Lee University. Democrats \u201cfailed to link these new tax burdens to a coherent theory about the mutual obligations of the state and its citizens,\u201d Michelmore wrote in her 2012 book, \u201cTax and Spend: The Welfare State, Tax Politics, and the Limits of American Liberalism.\u201d In the \u201960s and \u201970s, the media increasingly focused on sensational stories about welfare fraud. Rather than defend public aid, Democrats turned to tax cuts to stimulate economic growth, which they said would reduce welfare caseloads.\u00a0Amid complaints about the freeloading poor, Republicans positioned themselves as the true defenders of taxpayers. Even as Congress cracked down on cash assistance, it expanded Social Security and added a new health insurance program, Medicare, funded from payrolls. And lawmakers nurtured tax preferences for things like homeownership and employer-sponsored health insurance \u2015 tax cuts that ultimately became pillars of middle-class American life. The tax expenditure for employee health insurance is one of the biggest of them all. It amounted to more than $300 billion in 2018 \u2015 about the size of four food stamp programs. Thus, Social Security and Medicare became \u201centitlements\u201d earned by a lifetime of labor, the concept of direct assistance turned toxic, and enormous tax expenditures remained essentially hidden. When\u2019s the last time you heard someone say they were grateful for the exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance from their taxable income? \u201cLiberals created this discourse,\u201d Michelmore said told HuffPost. Today, Democrats still want to reduce material hardship in the U.S., but their ideas often use the tax code, lest anyone think they\u2019re giving out cash rather than creating market incentives.\u00a0Democratic candidates and members of Congress have put forward a variety of proposals that would use taxes to slash child poverty, reduce child care costs and make housing more affordable. \u201cThis is not a massive new federal program,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said of one such bill\u00a0earlier this year. \u201cIt cuts child poverty by 40%, but it does it as a tax credit.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible to come up with a defense of taxing and spending. The simplest and most famous is a 1927 quote from Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201cTaxes are what we pay for a civilized society.\u201d (The most infamous argument was Obama\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that\u201d gaffe from 2012, in which he mangled a much better articulation \u2015 by Warren \u2015 of how entrepreneurs benefit from publicly funded infrastructure.) Still, neither Williamson nor Michelmore thinks it would be wise for Democratic candidates to embrace taxes in response to an unfair debate question,\u00a0given the way that criticism of \u201ctax and spend\u201d policies leverages decades of unhelpful political messaging. In an open letter to CNN, Tax March, a coalition of liberal organizations like the Center for American Progress and Americans for Tax Fairness, asked for no more \u201cquestions in which proposals like Medicare-for-All are colored as being a possible tax increase on the middle class.\u201d\u00a0The group also tried to call out the network in a national commercial, but they said that CNN, which hosted the July debate and is set to co-host the October one, refused to air the ad. It did play on local TV in Washington, D.C., and in Ohio, where the October debate is happening. Sanders sometimes acknowledges that Medicare for All would come with higher taxes. At the June debate, he said the middle class \u201cwill pay more in taxes but less in health care [costs] for what they get\u201d under his proposal. In the September debate, when he was asked the question\u00a0again, he thought better of his answer, stressing instead that nobody would pay more than $200 per year for prescription drugs under his plan. Joe Biden bashed him anyway, saying people would pay higher income taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s a reality,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a bad idea if you like it. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The stakes in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate were particularly high for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who faced pressure to demonstrate his vitality to serve as president. Sanders\u2019 health may not have been the debate\u2019s central focus, but with an energetic performance he achieved the goal his campaign had set for him. Notwithstanding an occasional rasp in his voice, Sanders sounded as alert, impassioned and articulate as he ever has. The 12-candidate showdown at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was his first campaign event since his hospitalization for a heart attack nearly two weeks ago. With public polling showing Democrats doubting his physical viability, campaign aides vowed that the 78-year-old would assuage such concerns with a robust showing in the three-hour faceoff. He set the tone early, inserting himself into an exchange about the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to expound on a different topic. Discussing the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Sanders reiterated one of his campaign\u2019s enduring themes: That impeaching Trump \u2015 or otherwise confronting his crimes \u2015 is no substitute for delivering real economic relief for ordinary Americans. Sanders supports the president\u2019s ouster from office, but he said,\u00a0\u201cWhat would be a disaster if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump, and we\u2019re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, we\u2019re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change, we are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. \u201cWhat we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.\u201d Time and again during the debate\u2019s first hour, Sanders deployed the mix of passion, moral clarity, anger and dry wit that he is capable of when he is at his best. As part of a prolonged exchange over the middle-class tax hikes that his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan entails, Sanders managed to at once shame centrist critics and draw a subtle contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Warren, unlike Sanders, will not explicitly say that her support for the plan is tantamount to backing a tax increase for non-affluent earners. \u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d he said. Without naming them though, he saved his real ire for the likes of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who teamed up against Warren over her reluctance to explicitly defend tax increases that would help fund Medicare for All. \u201cThe issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d he said, prompting applause from the audience. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d Sanders\u2019 health and fitness to serve in the White House did not come up until the end of the second hour of the debate. CNN\u2019s moderators asked him, Biden and Warren \u2015 all of whom are septuagenarians and, if elected, would be the oldest to ever become a U.S. president \u2015 to speak directly to skepticism about their viability. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders began. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey interjected with a joke. \u201cAnd Sen. Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that\u2019s clear, as well.\u201d \u201cI do.\u00a0I\u2019m not on it tonight,\u201d Sanders quipped back, prompting laughter. Pressed again to address the health issue, Sanders invited everyone watching to attend his campaign\u2019s first rally since his heart attack \u2015 a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering on the East River waterfront in Queens on Saturday. Sanders extended a warm thank you to all those across the country who had reached out to express their concern while he was ill. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country \u2015 that is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d he said. To add to Sanders\u2019 solid performance, the campaign confirmed toward the end of the debate that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York would be endorsing Sanders at his comeback rally in Queens on Saturday. Sanders\u2019 aides were ebullient about his performance. Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager and the owner of a comic book store, said campaign staffers had started calling the senator \u201cWolverine,\u201d a reference to the fast-healing member of the X-Men, because of his \u201camazing regenerative powers.\u201d \u201cIf I can get a pint of his blood, I\u2019m going to store it for the next time I\u2019m ill,\u201d Weaver said. Sanders\u2019 supporters were apparently pleased with his showing as well. Over the course of the day Tuesday, Sanders raised over $620,000 from more than 40,000 contributions, according to the campaign. The campaign raised more money during the debate on Tuesday night than during any previous debate. From 9 to 10 p.m. Eastern, 35% of the donations coming into the Democratic small-donor site ActBlue were for Sanders, the campaign said. \u201cHands down, Bernie won the debate,\u201d said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. \u201cHis ideas dominated the night and his commanding performance left no doubt he\u2019s ready to go toe-to-toe with Trump and defeat him.\u201d Kevin Robillard contributed reporting from Westerville, Ohio.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plans to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the race for the White House, their campaigns said on Tuesday evening. The Washington Post\u00a0was the first to report that the rising progressive star planned to back the senator. HuffPost has confirmed the endorsement, which will be publicly announced at a rally in New York on Saturday. Sanders has faced questions about his health and fitness during the 2020 race after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, although he moved to downplay those fears with his energetic performance during the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders said during the debate, thanking supporters and fellow candidates for their words of support. \u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, who got her start in politics volunteering for Sanders in the 2016 primary, is a major political win for Sanders, and one of the most coveted of the 2020 cycle. It provides a welcome jolt to Sanders\u2019 campaign as he tries to arrest his flagging position in the polls and reassure voters nervous about his health. It is also a setback for his progressive rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has prided herself on having a knack for relationship-building. Warren had worked to develop a rapport with Ocasio-Cortez, joining her in, among other things, social media appearances such as a lighthearted discussion of the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a fellow freshman progressive, announced that she was endorsing Sanders on Tuesday night as well. When she was elected in November, Omar became one of the first two Muslim women to serve in the U.S. Congress. She is liable to serve as a surrogate for Sanders to a faith community with whom he did exceptionally well in key states like Michigan in 2016. In a statement announcing her endorsement, Omar cited her work with Sanders on legislation eliminating student debt, making public school meals free, adopting a more humane immigration policy and ending the United States\u2019 \u201cforever wars.\u201d \u201cBernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d Omar might also have mentioned that Sanders, who would be the first Jewish president if elected, was one of her first and most ardent defenders when she faced allegations of employing anti-Semitic rhetoric in February. \u201cWhat I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the other Muslim woman elected to Congress in 2018, plans to throw her support behind Sanders on Saturday as well, though the Sanders campaign declined to confirm it. A spokesperson for Tlaib did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s unclear who the final member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d of four liberal congresswomen, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), will support. Pressley, who previously served eight years on the Boston City Council, has a more conventional pedigree than the other Squad members and a history of taking less radical stances on matters like U.S. policy toward Israel. Sanders remains a front-runner in the Democratic race, and his campaign reported more than $25 million in campaign donations in the third quarter of 2019. But the Vermont senator has been dropping in the polls, and all eyes were on Warren during Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio.

      "content": " More than two-thirds of the way into the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden took a casual swipe at his rivals without specifying whom he was speaking about exactly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d When a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d What happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms. Sanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Sanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage. Then it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. \u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d Warren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d Biden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.

      "author": "Jonathan Cohn",
      "content": " The question of whether \u201cMedicare for All\u201d would be a winner for the middle class has been a big topic in the 2020 presidential campaign and it came up again in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate. By now, you may be familiar with the arguments. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), author of a leading Medicare for All proposal, openly concedes that it will require some new taxes to finance the cost of generous insurance for everybody. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has endorsed the Sanders bill, refuses to admit\u00a0that taxes would go up, presumably because she doesn\u2019t want to give Republicans fodder for an attack ad. But the underlying arguments from the two are actually the same. Whatever middle-class Americans ended up paying into a new Medicare for All system, Sanders and Warren say, it would be less than what they pay for the current system in the form of private health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs and lost wages. On Tuesday night, Warren turned that claim into a vow. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d Can she deliver on that promise? Can Sanders? Can any backer of Medicare for All? It\u2019s impossible to say definitively right now because the answer depends on some key details still missing\u00a0from the existing proposals. The Sanders bill, for example, doesn\u2019t specify which taxes it would raise. It also doesn\u2019t indicate exactly how the new program would pay doctors, hospitals and other providers of medical care. But you can get a sense of how Medicare for All might look in practice by looking closely at a structurally similar state-level proposal in New York that progressives have been promoting and that was the subject of a thorough analysis last year. The analysis found that the middle class really did come out ahead, although that determination came with a few, very important caveats that frequently get lost in these debates. The proposal is called the New York Health Act\u00a0and, like Medicare for All, it would wipe out nearly all existing insurance arrangements to enroll everybody into a brand-new, state-run program. Financing under the NYHA would come from taxes on payrolls and non-wage income (interest, dividends, etc.). Progressives have been pushing for the idea to get a serious hearing in the New York state legislature, now that Democrats finally have full control. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. But last year, the Rand Corporation, an independent think tank with its own model for projecting the effects of health care proposals, produced a detailed report on how the NYHA might work out in practice. It\u2019s not an easy calculation to make, because introducing such a system would inevitably cause so many changes, some of which would push in opposite directions from others. People would start using more health care services, for instance, because they had coverage for the first time or because the NYHA plan, like Medicare for All, would be more generous than existing coverage. That would tend to drive up the program\u2019s costs. On the other hand, the NYHA plan would simplify billing and administration, in part because doctors and hospitals wouldn\u2019t have to spend time communicating and haggling with private insurers. That would tend to reduce costs. In the end, Rand researchers determined, the NYHA as designed would reduce overall spending on medical care in New York state. And as long as taxes to pay for the program were sufficiently progressive, the benefits would flow primarily away from the rich and toward lower- and middle-income groups. Specifically, the richest 10% of New Yorkers would be paying more for health care on average, while the other 90% would pay the same or less. That sounds a lot like the kind of plan that Sanders and Warren promise \u2015 which is to say, it sounds a lot like a plan that would work out well for most Americans. But this is where those caveats come in. In a single-payer system like the NYHA or Medicare for All, the government sets prices for the suppliers and providers of medical care, including not just drug companies but also doctors and hospitals. That\u2019s why these sorts of proposals can show such big savings. The NYHA doesn\u2019t actually specify what the plan would pay doctors and hospitals, so Rand researchers had to make some assumptions. They figured that, at the outset, health\u00a0providers would be paid at rates that matched the average of what all the different payers in New York (Medicaid, private insurance, etc.) pay now. But over time, Rand researchers assumed, the new system would aggressively limit year-to-year inflation, imposing the kind of cost discipline that does not exist now. This is how universal coverage systems in the rest of the world control costs. But here in the U.S., where such controls have never existed on such a widespread basis, lobbying groups representing the health care industry would fight hard to avoid such limits on their payments. And there\u2019s good reason to think those lobbyists would prevail \u2015 if not by killing Medicare for All outright, then by winning much more favorable terms on payment. That would inflate the program\u2019s cost, forcing the government to raise more revenue. But there are limits to how high taxes on high earners can go, because at some point \u201ctax avoidance\u201d \u2015 that is, people finding ways to shield income or qualify for lower rates \u2015 makes it difficult to increase revenue. \u201cCreating a single-payer plan where the wealthy pay more and everyone else comes out no worse or ahead would require a delicate balance of high tax rates for the wealthy that do not cause substantial tax avoidance and moderate to low tax rates for everyone else,\u201d Jodi Liu, chief author of the Rand report, told HuffPost. \u201cThe overall tax revenue needed would depend critically on how much providers are paid.\u201d Then there is the other big asterisk in the Rand report. It\u2019s one thing to say that, on average, people in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care. It\u2019s quite another thing to say that every single person in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care. In reality, for each income group, at least some individuals would likely find themselves paying more, not less, once a Medicare for All system took effect. Imagine, for example, a 30-year-old who today buys a minimalist policy directly from an insurer \u2015 say, one of the \u201cbronze\u201d plans with relatively skimpy benefits that barely meet the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage standards. Because that plan covers so little and because 30-year-olds pay lower premiums than older people, that bronze plan is probably pretty cheap. The bronze plan could easily cost less than the new taxes for Medicare for All and maybe a lot less, depending on how much money the 30-year-old makes and just how skimpy that plan is. The Rand analysis of the NYHA makes this quite clear. The report\u2019s appendix breaks down the effect that the plan would have within specific income groups. Within the middle income groups \u2015 those with annual income between 139%\u00a0and 400% of the poverty line, or about $35,790 to $103,000 for a family of four \u2015 there is always a fraction for whom the NYHA taxes are more than they would have spent for health care under the status quo. The percentage of people on the hook for higher costs would generally be fairly small.\u00a0But the \u201crate shock\u201d that came with the Affordable Care Act, when people suddenly discovered their insurance cost more than it did the previous year, also affected a tiny portion of the population. It created a huge backlash anyway. That doesn\u2019t mean the same thing would happen with Medicare for All. One reason the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rate shock led to so much anger is that the new Obamacare plans came with high deductibles.\u00a0Lots of people felt like they were paying more but not getting great insurance in return. The whole point of Medicare for All, like the NYHA, is to give everybody better insurance than they have today. Even people who felt worse off in the transition to Medicare for All might be grateful for the switch later on. That 30-year-old with a bronze policy today could be in real trouble if they got hit with serious medical expenses, given that deductibles on bronze plans can approach $7,000. And under Medicare for All, the 30-year-old would probably have more choices of doctors and hospitals. Bronze plans are famous for their tiny provider networks. All of this assumes that Rand\u2019s projections are basically on target \u2015 and that the New York plan is a reasonable proxy for how Medicare for All might work out in the nation as a whole. But projections can be wrong and New York, like any state, has plenty of idiosyncrasies that make extrapolating from it difficult. To the extent experts have tried to perform similar analyses on the Sanders proposal, the verdict has been mixed, depending in part on assumptions they made about missing details in the bill. In 2016, Kenneth Thorpe, an Emory University economist who had served in the Clinton administration, concluded that tax hikes necessary to finance the Sanders proposal would leave nearly three-quarters of working households that previously had private coverage owing more in taxes than they would have owed in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. But just this week, the Commonwealth Fund and the\u00a0Urban Institute released a new report about health care options and concluded that, in a plan that looks like Medicare for All, \u201chigher-income people will likely face the greatest increases in taxes, meaning their new tax burdens would likely exceed their savings; the reverse is likely true for lower-income populations.\u201d As Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost, \u201cA Medicare for All plan absolutely can be designed to fulfill the promise that the middle class would on average pay less for health care. But it requires some big trade-offs to do that.\u201d So far,\u00a0those trade-offs haven\u2019t gotten much attention.",

      "content": " On Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is due to hold his first rally since his heart attack earlier this month \u2015 and he\u2019s planning to make it a big one. Sanders, 78, had a strong debate performance on Tuesday, trying to put to rest any lingering doubts about whether he\u2019s fit enough to be president. And this past week, he rolled out the endorsement of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.), two of the Democratic Party\u2019s young progressive rising stars. The Sanders campaign is obviously hoping for a large crowd on Saturday, when Ocasio-Cortez is slated to join the Vermont senator on stage in Queens, New York, to formally endorse his candidacy. And the campaign is hoping to set the senator apart from some of his opponents \u2015 including other progressives \u2015 by choosing a location and message that reflect his commitment to affordable housing, the Green New Deal and taming corporate power. The \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering is slated to take place in Queensbridge Park, which is in the shadow of both the country\u2019s largest public housing development and New York\u2019s dirtiest power plant. In a nod to his surroundings, Sanders plans to focus his remarks on expanding affordable housing and lifting up racially diverse, poor and working-class communities like those in the neighboring Queensbridge Houses. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ... try to capture the energy of the housing justice movement here,\u201d said New York state Sen. Julia Salazar, a Sanders backer who unseated a Brooklyn Democrat in September 2018 on the strength of calls for greater tenant protections. Sanders\u2019 supporters see his ambitious affordable housing plan as a key point of contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a progressive rival who has overtaken Sanders in national and early-state polling. Sanders has, among other things, called for a national universal rent control law capping rent increases at 3% annually, while Warren has focused on increasing federal funding for the construction of affordable housing. Sanders is also attempting to distinguish himself from Warren through the selection of an industrial and working-class Queens locale. Warren held a rally focused on taking on Big Tech this past March in Long Island City, but in mid-September she chose the more scenic Washington Square Park, in the heart of Manhattan\u2019s upscale Greenwich Village, as the site of her largest campaign rally to date. Sanders, who also convened supporters for a blowout rally in Washington Square Park during his 2016 presidential run, made a point of picking a site with more populist significance this time around. \u201cQueensbridge was a deliberate choice,\u201d a Sanders aide told HuffPost. \u201cIt is a symbolic gesture by Bernie ... saying that this is no longer about being in the heart of Manhattan, this is about the working families in the outer boroughs who have been neglected,\u201d said New York Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Flushing Democrat backing Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for all Americans who feel neglected by Wall Street.\u201d As Sanders speaks on Saturday, the smokestacks of the Ravenswood Generating Station, a fuel oil and natural gas plant, will tower above the park. Fittingly, Sanders will likely be discussing his twin priorities of fighting climate change and environmental injustice. As of 2014, the power plant was emitting more carbon dioxide than any other facility in the state, making it a longstanding thorn in the side of the city\u2019s robust environmental movement. The confluence of Ravenswood, a second power plant in the adjacent neighborhood of Astoria and the traffic flows coming off of the Queensborough Bridge and nearby highways makes Western Queens, once nicknamed \u201cAsthma Alley,\u201d one of the most polluted areas in New York City. The Queensbridge Houses, whose 7,000 low- and moderate-income residents live in the heart of this smoggy corner of New York, are thus a prime example of environmental injustice \u2015 a term that describes how marginalized communities bear the brunt of ecological depredation. But if the setting embodies ills that are plaguing American society, it also has the makings of a potential solution. The site makes plain the case for a Green New Deal that could employ residents of the public housing development to transform the Ravenswood plant into a source of renewable energy, according to Pete Sikora, climate director for the progressive group New York Communities for Change, which has not endorsed in the Democratic presidential primary. Ravenswood\u2019s operators have already submitted a plan to convert the dirty energy source into a facility capable of housing renewable energy storage batteries that Sikora and others believe federal help could usher into reality. \u201cThis backdrop is a beautiful symbol for the Green New Deal,\u201d said Sikora, who supports Sanders in a personal capacity and plans to attend Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cHopefully Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are going to make that point in their speeches.\u201d Northwest Queens has become a hotbed of left-wing politics in recent years, as young newcomers and middle-class families get priced out of Manhattan and trendy swaths of Brooklyn and bring their left-wing, anti-establishment political views to these neighborhoods abutting the East River. The Democratic Socialists of America has a vibrant presence in Northwest Queens, providing a key source of experienced canvassers to aid insurgent candidates willing to take on one of the city\u2019s most influential Democratic Party machine apparatuses. Other, less ideologically radical upstarts in the region, like the New Queens Democrats, have attacked the machine\u2019s arcane levers of power, like the opaque county committee that rubber-stamps candidates for the vast borough\u2019s court system. The combined firepower of Northwest Queens\u2019 ascendant left has produced some of the most significant progressive wins in the country in the past few years. With the help of DSA\u2019s volunteer army, Ocasio-Cortez racked up some of her highest electoral margins in Northwest Queens against then-Rep. Joe Crowley (D) in June 2018. A year after Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win, the activists and rank-and-file progressives of Northwest Queens again flexed their muscles in a historically contentious Democratic primary to fill a vacant district attorney post. In that case, the left\u2019s preferred candidate, the Astoria-based public defender Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, ended up coming a few dozen votes shy of victory. Queens\u2019 bastion of left-wing activism has also punched above its weight outside of the electoral arena. In February, Amazon withdrew its offer to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, amid vocal opposition to the tax subsidies it was due to receive from the city and state to set up shop in the borough. Polls showed that the public favored Amazon\u2019s arrival, but the outspoken skepticism of local elected officials in Northwest Queens, keen to prove their bona fides to restive constituents, contributed to the massive company\u2019s decision to pull out. \u201cThis is ground zero,\u201d said Kim, the Flushing assemblyman, who represents neighborhoods east of Long Island City but was an early and vocal opponent of Amazon\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe progressive wave is happening there.\u201d Saturday\u2019s choice of neighborhood is more than just symbolic for Sanders, though. If he hopes to compete in New York\u2019s primary in April, he will need to maximize turnout in areas like Northwest Queens and neighborhoods in Brooklyn where voters broke for him in the greatest numbers in 2016. The rally is a way of reminding his base that he cares about them and needs their support, according to Salazar, who represents the liberal Brooklyn strongholds of Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Bushwick. \u201cThe people who live Western Queens and the advocates there have demonstrated that they are at least largely aligned with a really progressive \u2015 democratic socialist, potentially \u2015 platform, so that\u2019s definitely favorable for Bernie,\u201d Salazar said.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) secured the endorsements of three additional New York lawmakers ahead of his comeback rally in Queens on Saturday: state Sens. Michael Gianaris and Jessica Ramos of Queens, and state Sen. Luis Sep\u00falveda of the Bronx. \u201cBernie is the best candidate to fight back against the deep-pocketed corporate interests that weaken our democracy and exploit our economy,\u201d Ramos, who unseated a Queens Democrat aligned with state Republicans in September 2018, said in a statement announcing her endorsement. \u201cIn Senator Sanders we have a leader who will protect all members of our society, especially those seeking human rights and better working conditions free from unethical practices.\u201d Gianaris, who as deputy state Senate majority leader is one of the most powerful Democrats in New York, echoed Ramos\u2019 sentiments. \u201cBernie Sanders is the best choice to reduce this growing chasm between the ultra-rich and working people,\u201d he said in a statement. The trio joins a group of five New York lawmakers who had already endorsed Sanders\u2019 bid: New York City Councilman Rafael Espinal, state Assemblymen Ron Kim and Phil Steck, and state Sens. Julia Salazar and James Sanders. (James Sanders is not related to the Vermont senator.) Although New Yorkers cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary in April, well after the crucial early states, some presidential contenders have already sought endorsements from the state\u2019s robust bench of young, progressive lawmakers. Sanders still has fewer endorsements from New York state and New York City elected officials than Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who announced that she had secured the backing of\u00a014 lawmakers at a mid-September rally in Manhattan. Sanders, 78, is hoping to regain momentum after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 that polling indicates raised doubts in the minds of many Democrats about his fitness to serve in the White House. Sanders, seeking to reassure the public of his health and vitality, delivered a strong debate performance on Tuesday and hours later announced he\u2019d secured endorsements from\u00a0Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two of the Democratic Party\u2019s young, progressive stars. Saturday\u2019s rally in Queensbridge Park, chosen in part for its proximity to the country\u2019s largest public housing development, is Sanders\u2019 first major campaign event since his hospitalization. He will be joined onstage at the rally by Ocasio-Cortez, who is expected to formally announce her endorsement there. Sanders courted Ocasio-Cortez in conversations over the course of a month, culminating in a visit she paid to Burlington, Vermont, at the end of September. She met with Sanders and his wife, as well as a group of aides, over two meals, where they developed a rapport, according to someone familiar with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s thinking. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Sanders is not altogether surprising. Ocasio-Cortez got her start in politics volunteering for Sanders\u2019 2016 bid; the pair are both self-described democratic socialists and have collaborated on, among other things, legislation limiting interest rates on credit card debt. But prior to announcing her endorsement of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez had spoken positively about Warren, too. And Warren had apparently made efforts to develop a relationship with her. Ocasio-Cortez was drawn to Sanders\u2019 vision of a rejuvenated democracy where ordinary Americans take a more active role in the political process, according to the person with knowledge of her thinking. \u201cThey\u2019re ideologically aligned, but they\u2019re mission-aligned as well,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey get along really well. They brighten each other up.\u201d Saturday\u2019s rally will give Ocasio-Cortez an opportunity to show if her star power is a major draw for aspiring national leaders. \u201cIf he gets enough of the young, left-wing demo out, the age issue disappears, the health issue is softened and Bernie gets new life. It makes him young again,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York City Democratic strategist. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get a big crowd, then those two issues remain in place.\u201d Michael Ceraso, a Democratic campaign consultant who worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, expressed doubt that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blessing would help him broaden his appeal \u201cin the areas where he has deficits,\u201d such as older voters. But it is likely to help him maximize turnout among the young voters Sanders is relying on to carve a path to the Democratic nomination, according to Ceraso. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cresonates with those young voters who are looking for a reason to vote,\u201d he said.",

      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Storming past questions about his health, Bernie Sanders vowed that he\u2019s \u201cmore ready than ever\u201d to fight for a political revolution \u2014 with a little help from new friends \u2014 at a rally Saturday that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the 78-year-old democratic socialist is still very much a force in the 2020 presidential race. Sanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back,\u201d Sanders declared, sparking chants of, \u201cBernie is back\u201d from the massive crowd. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he added. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d The event marked Sanders\u2019 formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he\u2019s lagging behind liberal rival Elizabeth Warren and establishment favorite Joe Biden. But the fiery Brooklyn native, backed by a slate of new endorsements and two new stents in an artery connected to his heart, appeared to be expanding his coalition on Saturday. A security company hired by the campaign reported a crowd estimate of 25,000. Among those speaking, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore told the cheering crowd that he was endorsing Sanders, shortly before Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised the Vermont senator on stage. \u201cBernie Sanders fought for me,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said as she introduced Sanders. She heaped praise on the Vermont senator but did not explicitly say that she was endorsing him. The Sanders campaign announced earlier in the week that she had. Before the rally, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said endorsements this past week from Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in particular were proof that the Sanders campaign is growing. He predicted that they would especially help Sanders strengthen his support among young, minority voters. \u201cThose are two people who I think have immense power to mobilize young people, and I promise you you\u2019ll be seeing them in Iowa, but not only in Iowa, but around the country, trying to get people engaged around the issues,\u201d Shakir said. For now, at least, Sanders can use the help. While he insists he\u2019s ready to move forward, he\u2019s doing so cautiously. Saturday\u2019s rally was his only scheduled appearance before he returns to Iowa late in the coming week. The week after, he\u2019ll join Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for a tour of her congressional district. Tlaib hasn\u2019t announced whether she\u2019ll endorse Sanders, but she is part of the same small \u201csquad\u201d of minority women on Capitol Hill who gave been a target of President Donald Trump. Despite the aggressive rhetoric from Sanders himself, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said Sanders would ease himself back onto the campaign trail. But by December, he predicted, Sanders health scare will be forgotten. Almost all the speakers during Saturday\u2019s event, which spanned several hours on a sunny, crisp fall afternoon, played down the health concerns. \u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president,\u201d said Moore, the filmmaker. Nina Turner, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs, said it \u201cboggles my mind\u201d that Sanders\u2019 critics have embraced \u201cageism.\u201d \u201cLife happens to us all,\u201d she said. \u201cMemo to the haters: hashtag Bernie Is Back,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never went anywhere, we just pushed pause for a minute.\u201d",

      "content": " QUEENS, N.Y. \u2015 In an endorsement speech to an overflow crowd in Queensbridge Park on Saturday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) credited Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with inspiring her to run for Congress. \u201cThe only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought it was impossible,\u201d she said, referring to the 2016 presidential run for which she volunteered. Then, with the crowd of tens of thousands roaring their approval, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress welcomed her \u201cTio Bernie\u201d \u2015 the oldest presidential candidate in a crowded field \u2015 to the stage. The image of the pair of progressive rock stars with their clasped hands raised triumphantly as they waved to the crowd perfectly encapsulated the message that Sanders hoped to send with his first rally since having a heart attack at the start of the month: that he is not only prepared to serve as president, he is the voice of the rising generation of progressive, multiracial youth. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2015 more ready than ever to carry on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d Sanders declared. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back.\u201d Sanders, who normally ascends the stage to the sounds of John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2019s \u201cPower to the People,\u201d chose a different track for his big comeback rally: AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black.\u201d The event management firm staffing the event and providing security estimated that 25,872 people attended the rally, according to the Sanders campaign. The New York City Parks Department said it had provided a permit for a crowd of 15,000 for the event. And while it is impossible to independently verify the figure, there were indeed throngs of attendees outside the rally perimeter and down the street because the campaign had determined the event was at its legal capacity. If the estimate is even loosely accurate, it makes Sanders\u2019 rally the largest of any Democratic candidate this election cycle. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts likely came closest with a mid-September rally in Manhattan that Warren\u2019s campaign estimates drew 22,000 people. As with other Sanders campaign rallies, the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering in Queens had a festive, carnivalesque atmosphere as devout, mostly young, Berniecrats from across the metropolitan area donned swag, held homemade signs and chanted progressive slogans \u2015 \u201cBernie\u2019s back,\u201d \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and \u201cA-O-C\u201d were just three of the favorites. At least one attendee was wearing a giant, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask of Sanders and was affectionately imitating him. But Saturday\u2019s Queens rally felt more jubilant than his other campaign rallies, which have generally not been preceded by such formative \u2014 and at times, for his supporters, frightening \u2014 developments. Sanders had already proven his mettle with an enthusiastic debate performance on Oct. 15 and the news that Reps. Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) would be backing his bid. At 78, though, he remains under additional pressure to prove his health and vitality after the Oct. 1 heart attack. His campaign was working at breakneck speed in the run-up to the rally, highlighting new policy proposals and announcing\u00a0three additional endorsements from New York elected officials in the hours before Sanders took the stage. Nabbing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s backing was a particular coup for the campaign, given her enormous following. She said on Saturday that after nearly a year in Congress, she found Sanders\u2019 staunch independence throughout his three decades in the same institution even more impressive. \u201cBehind closed doors, your arm is twisted ... and every trick in the book \u2015 psychological and otherwise \u2015 is used to get us to abandon the working class,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt has been in that experience of the past nine months, that I have grown to appreciate the enormous, consistent and nonstop advocacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u201d In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, the roster of speakers that preceded Sanders was a who\u2019s-who of progressive stars and Sanders partisans: his wife Jane; filmmaker Michael Moore; San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz; former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner; and former Queens district attorney candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n. Each of the speakers made a point of pushing back against concerns about Sanders\u2019 health and finding ways to distinguish him from Warren, who has overtaken him in the polls. \u201cThe only heart attack that we should be worried about is the heart attack Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president of the United States,\u201d Moore bellowed. Turner, a veteran of the 2016 campaign known for her pugnacious style, went on an extended riff blasting both former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren without naming either of them. \u201cThere are some people who sat on the sidelines before and there was only one person who stood up to the establishment and his name is Bernard Sanders,\u201d Turner said, referencing Warren\u2019s neutrality during the 2016 presidential primary. \u201cThere are many copies, but there is only one original,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you would take the copy, baby, when you can have the original.\u201d There was no substitute, however, for Sanders himself declaiming for nearly an hour, his voice occasionally growing raspy, about the ravages of corruption and inequality. \u201cBrothers and sisters, Congress may not talk about it, the media may not talk about it, but not only will we talk about income and wealth inequality, we are going to do something about it,\u201d he said. Sanders even tailored parts of his speech to fit the location, deviating from his famously consistent messaging. The campaign deliberately chose to hold the rally in a park next to the largest public housing complex in the country \u2015 and in the shadow of New York\u2019s dirtiest power plant. Sanders promised that his affordable housing plan, which would create a national rent control system preventing significant rent hikes, would allot an additional $20 billion to New York City\u2019s public housing authority alone. And he framed the Green New Deal as a solution uniquely designed to address the kind of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d embodied by the concentration of public housing next to sources of pollution. \u201cTogether, not only will we clean up our environment, but we will finally put an end to environmental racism,\u201d he said. It is not yet clear the size of the impact that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement will have on Sanders\u2019 campaign. Her strongest following is with left-leaning young people, who already make up Sanders\u2019 biggest bloc of support \u2015 albeit one where recent polling has shown him losing ground. But there was no question at Saturday\u2019s rally that she had breathed new excitement into Sanders\u2019 supporters, as well as the senator himself. Sanders said he looked forward to her accompanying him on the campaign trail across the country. \u201cI\u2019ve been around politics for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman \u2015 the youngest woman ever elected to Congress\u00a0... has transformed politics in America.\u201d",

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came to the defense of fellow 2020 presidential contender Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Monday after Hillary Clinton appeared to suggest\u00a0Gabbard was getting a campaign boost from Russia. Sanders called the former Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s suggestion \u201coutrageous\u201d and pointed to Gabbard\u2019s military record, which includes time in an Iraqi combat zone. The controversy began when Clinton discussed the third-party vote and Republicans\u2019 2020 campaign strategy in the \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast last week. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary,\u201d she said,\u00a0\u201cand they\u2019re grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d Clinton did not name Gabbard, but her remarks were widely interpreted to be about the Hawaii representative, based on past media reports\u00a0describing Gabbard as a frequent topic of Russian state news media. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton said on the podcast, without naming the person she was referring to. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her so far.\u201d There has been a flurry of social media accounts supporting Gabbard that appear to be bots, though there\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re part of a coordinated effort by the Russians. Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill later said\u00a0that Clinton was suggesting that the Republicans, not the Russians, were grooming someone to be a third-party candidate. Though she wasn\u2019t named explicitly, Gabbard fired back in a string of tweets, slamming Clinton as the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d Sanders and Gabbard are rivals in this election, but Gabbard\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary against Clinton. To do so, she had to step down from her post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair. President Donald Trump, who has continually rejected intelligence officials\u2019 findings that Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, also denied that Gabbard was a Russian agent on Monday.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman who was a prominent surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his 2016 presidential run, announced Wednesday that she is backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Democratic primary. Warren \u201clistens before she speaks. She is willing to admit when she\u2019s wrong and make swift and necessary changes. She speaks her truths instead of poll-tested talking points,\u201d Flores wrote in a Medium post announcing her endorsement. \u201cAnd when Elizabeth speaks, she speaks to people like me.\u201d The endorsement comes as a boost for Warren as Sanders,\u00a0her progressive rival in the nominating contest, is experiencing something of a resurgence. Sanders, who had been faltering in polls before he suffered a heart attack at the start of the month, delivered an energetic debate performance on Oct. 15. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0announced their endorsement of Sanders shortly thereafter. Flores is one of a number of elected officials, mostly at the state and local level, who backed Sanders\u2019 last bid but are now throwing their support behind Warren. The most high-profile defector is Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, the first member of Congress to endorse Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, who announced his endorsement of Warren in August. Flores, an attorney who now runs the Los Angeles-based digital media company Luz Collective and serves on the board of the Women\u2019s March, made national waves in March after\u00a0accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of unwanted affectionate touching while she was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014. Before he spoke on her behalf at a rally in Las Vegas, Flores said that Biden came up behind her, smelled her hair and kissed her head without asking permission. At the time, at least one prominent Democrat speculated without evidence that Sanders put Flores up to it, which both Flores and the Sanders campaign immediately denied. Warren was one of the first presidential candidates to say she believed Flores and that the former Nevada lawmaker deserved an apology from Biden. Flores does not mention Biden in her post. In her endorsement, Flores, the daughter of working-class Mexican immigrants, said she identified with Warren\u2019s personal story of overcoming economic hardship. She was particularly impressed with Warren\u2019s remarks at the \u201cShe the People\u201d summit in April, which she said reflected a sensitivity to the intersecting forces of poverty, sexism, racism and religious bigotry. (Sanders, whom Flores does not reference in her essay, elicited groans at the same gathering for citing his experience in the 1960s civil rights movement in response to a question about his specific plans to help women of color.) \u201cNot a single candidate has all the answers or all of the solutions, but when I hear Elizabeth Warren speak, I hear a woman who takes our struggles with her everywhere she goes,\u201d Flores wrote. \u201cI hear a woman who understands that the American people can\u2019t afford anything less than bold solutions. I see a woman who has proven time and time again that she doesn\u2019t just have tenacity and the intelligence to lead this country and defeat Trump, she has the heart and the courage.\u201d In an interview with HuffPost, Flores also praised Warren\u2019s record of political and policy accomplishments, including the development of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cWhen you can point to that kind of a success record, it\u2019s not so much about being pragmatic, it\u2019s literally who can put forward a bold progressive agenda and has proven that those things can be executed,\u201d she said. Although Flores served as one of Sanders\u2019 appointees to a Democratic National Committee panel that convened in 2017 to recommend reforms to the party\u2019s presidential nominating process, her decision not to endorse the Vermont senator is not entirely surprising. In April 2018, Flores resigned from the board\u00a0of Our Revolution, the nonprofit that emerged from Sanders\u2019 2016 bid, in protest over what she saw as the group\u2019s insensitivity to Latinx priorities. And earlier this year, Flores told HuffPost\u00a0that she was keeping her options open given the abundance of candidates running. The Warren campaign declined to comment about whether and how they plan to deploy Flores as a surrogate. Flores\u2019 home state of Nevada holds its Democratic caucus on Feb. 22, and voters in her adopted state of California cast their primary ballots on March 3 \u2014 aka Super Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try to help Elizabeth Warren be the next president of the United States in whatever way possible,\u201d Flores told HuffPost.",

      "author": "Ariel Edwards-Levy",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are both largely seen by their party as capable of pulling out a win next year against President Donald Trump, according to a national HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after last week\u2019s primary debate. Sixty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden is capable of winning the general election, with a virtually identical 59% saying the same of Warren. Polls taken after the previous three debates had given Biden an edge of between 6 points and 13 points\u00a0on that metric. Roughly half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters currently think Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is capable of winning, with a third or fewer saying the same of any of the other candidates included in the survey. Overall, 71% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters name two or more candidates as capable of beating Trump, with 53% saying there are three or more viable options. There are a few different ways for pollsters to ask questions about electability \u2015 and when the question is about who has the highest chance of winning, Biden generally continues to dominate. In Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent survey, for instance, 48% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say Biden has the best chance of beating Trump, with just 21% saying the same of Warren. But other polling also suggests that Biden is no longer the only candidate that most Democrats think is capable of pulling out a win. In last week\u2019s Economist/YouGov poll, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters thought Biden would probably beat Trump, with 55% saying Warren would probably win and 54% saying the same of\u00a0 Sanders. Overall, 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say they have a least a good idea of whom they\u2019ll vote for, up from 52% who said the same in September. About a third say they\u2019re still making up their minds. An 83% majority currently say they\u2019re at least satisfied with the 2020 Democratic field, with 45% describing themselves as enthusiastic. As in previous surveys, Warren stands out as a potential consensus candidate, both garnering the broadest enthusiasm and causing the least consternation among members of her party. About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters pick her as someone they\u2019d be enthusiastic to see nominated, with just 9% saying they\u2019d be upset. She\u2019s trailed most closely on this metric by Sanders (37% enthusiastic, 19% upset), Buttigieg (30% enthusiastic, 15% upset) and Biden (37% enthusiastic, 25% upset). Gabbard attracts the most resistance among the candidates included in the survey, with about a third saying they\u2019d be upset to have her as the nominee. Thirty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the primary debate last Tuesday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, with an equal number saying the same of Buttigieg, and a quarter saying they\u2019d left with an improved view of Sanders.

      "author": "Carla Herreria",
      "content": " Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.) on Thursday unveiled a proposal to legalize marijuana within his first 100 days in office as president with an executive order. Sanders vowed to immediately declassify marijuana as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act if elected president. Federal law currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug \u2015 along with heroin, LSD and ecstasy, meaning it is considered to have no medicinal use and have a high potential for abuse. \u201cWe\u2019re going to legalize marijuana and end the horrifically destructive war on drugs,\u201d Sanders said in a statement announcing his proposal. \u201cIt has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d The Democratic presidential contender plans to expunge all past marijuana convictions \u2015 on a state and federal level \u2015 and to use a federal marijuana sales tax to fund a $20 billion grant program that would benefit minority entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs who had been previously arrested for marijuana offenses. Sanders\u2019 plan also prevents the tobacco industry from taking over the legalized marijuana sales industry and offers incentives to entrepreneurs who opt to start their marijuana-based businesses as cooperatives and nonprofits instead of for-profit enterprises. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in the White House, we\u2019re going to end the greed and corruption of the big corporations and make sure that Americans hit hardest by the war on drugs will be the first to benefit from legalization,\u201d the senator said in his state Sanders is not the first Democratic contender to back broad reform on laws prohibiting marijuana use. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also supports legalizing marijuana, declassifying it as a Schedule I drug and expunging past marijuana convictions. Former Vice President Joe Biden supports decriminalizing marijuana and expunging past convictions, though he has proposed classifying the drug as a Schedule II substance. Doing so would place the severity of marijuana on par with 15 milligrams of hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl or Adderall instead of completely legalizing it. Sanders has long advocated for the legalization of marijuana. In February, the senator co-sponsored a bill with Warren, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) aimed at legalizing marijuana and expunging past marijuana offenses on a federal level. Sanders returned to his campaign last weekend with a rally in Queens, New York, after taking a break after having a heart attack. At the Saturday rally, the senator said his plans to legalize the drug would also involve tackling criminal justice reform and racial injustices. \u201cWe are going to end the horrifically destructive war on drugs and legalize marijuana,\u201d Sanders told his supporters. \u201cAnd we are going to end the disgrace of 400,000 people right now locked behind bars because they are too poor to afford cash bail.\u201d",

Both far surpassed Biden, who had just under $9 million. Even South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been polling well below the top three, had $23.4 million.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) 2020 presidential bid. \u201cWe deserve a president who understands that the corporate assault on our lives existed before Trump and it will exist after Trump,\u201d she said at a fiery rally held in her Detroit district. \u201cSomeone who will never back down from a fight with the wealthy and the powerful;\u00a0who will call them out and bring our movement to their front yards;\u00a0someone who looks at a problem and finds the most transformative solutions.\u201d \u201cWe deserve someone who writes the damn bills,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe deserve Bernie Sanders.\u201d The endorsement comes one week after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), another member of the House\u2019s \u201cSquad\u201d (a group of young first-year Democratic women of color), publicly threw her support behind Sanders at a massive rally in Queens, New York. Ocasio-Cortez, who credits Sanders with inspiring her to run for office, and fellow Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), both announced their plans to endorse Sanders after the Oct. 15 debate. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) is the only Squad member who has not yet endorsed Sanders. Tlaib\u2019s formal endorsement adds yet another jolt of momentum to Sanders\u2019 campaign, which faced scrutiny following the 78-year-old\u2019s heart attack earlier this month. Sanders has downplayed critics\u2019 fears that a recent heart attack survivor would not be able to take the White House from President Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders said during the Democratic debate in Ohio. \u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d The senator was energized Sunday in his speech to supporters, who appeared to mostly be part of the younger voter base he\u2019s known to attract. \u201cI am begging you, don\u2019t believe anyone who tells you that moving toward a society of justice is impossible. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that our vision is radical or extreme,\u201d Sanders told the crowd after Tlaib\u2019s endorsement. \u201cJustice is not a radical idea. Justice is what we are entitled to as human beings.\u201d The rally was held in Detroit\u2019s Cass Technical High School, where alumus and musician Jack White opened the event with a performance. \u201cBernie Sanders is telling the truth and I trust him,\u201d White told the crowd in between songs. In her endorsement video, Tlaib discussed the lack of public school funding, and how that dearth disproportionately affects people in lower-income areas. \u201cFor me, representing the third poorest congressional district in the country, [Sanders] is in many ways pushing back against this really painful oppression and it\u2019s been incredibly inspiring to see his unwavering support for the same ideals that I have about people over profits,\u201d Tlaib said. Sanders mentioned Detroit\u2019s lack of federal funding for public education when he spoke on Sunday. \u201cRashida took me around the art district here in Detroit, and I met with beautiful young people who are going to schools in which they don\u2019t have adequate textbooks,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cThey are going to schools where their teachers are forced to work two or three jobs just to make a living. I don\u2019t think it is too much to ask that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we pay our teachers a living salary.\u201d Prior to the rally, Sanders and Tlaib visited the Brightmoor Connection Food Pantry in Detroit, the Young Turks\u2019 Emma Vigeland reported. \u201cRashida said this better than I can, but today we are saying loudly and clearly to Trump and the corporate elites that this nation belongs to all of us, whether they like it or not, and we are going to end their greed and corruption,\u201d Sanders told supporters on Sunday. \u201cAnd we are going to create an economy that works with the children of Detroit, the children of Vermont. Not a handful of billionaires.\u201d",

      "author": "Akbar Shahid Ahmed",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showed just how far successors to President Donald Trump may go to reshape the U.S. relationship with Israel and the Palestinians, taking the stage at a Jewish American group\u2019s conference on Monday to deliver impassioned remarks about his sympathy for Palestinians and issue a proposal that would have once been considered political suicide. \u2033$3.8 billion is a lot of money, and we cannot give it carte blanche,\u201d Sanders said, referring to the amount of military aid Washington provides Israel each year. \u201cIf you want military aid, you\u2019re going to have to fundamentally change your relationship to the people of Gaza... I think it is fair to say that some of that $3.8 billion should go right now into humanitarian aid.\u201d Until recently, U.S. politicians of all stripes mostly avoided proposing policy changes to respond to Israel\u2019s decade-plus-long \u201ccollective punishment\u201d\u00a0blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip for fear of being painted as sympathetic to the militant group. Sanders\u2019 remarks, delivered at the annual confab for J Street, which advocates for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, represent a top presidential candidate\u2019s boldest departure yet from that norm. But they\u2019re only the latest step in an evolutionary process for the Democratic Party. In the past nine months, Democratic 2020 contenders have one by one warmed to putting conditions on American security assistance in order to push Israeli officials to negotiate with the Palestinians. They\u2019ve mulled blocking aid from being used in violations of international law, such as annexing Palestinian land. And they\u2019ve clearly committed themselves to using new tactics to resurrect the decades-old push for two independent states, Israel and Palestine. So perhaps it should be no surprise that Sanders\u2019 proposal was greeted by cheers \u2015 and that it was largely treated as just one more in a range of options for dealing with a human rights crisis. J Street officials didn\u2019t feel the need to run damage control. Neither did Sanders\u2019 campaign. And so far, his rivals for the Democratic nomination haven\u2019t attacked him for his comments. At the end of former President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office, Democrats regularly boasted about the massive new annual aid package he had secured for Israel. This is where they are now. Sanders has driven a lot of that change. The independent Vermont senator, who in his 2016 primary run demonstrated the potential for mainstream Democratic realignment on Israel with frequent commentary on respecting Palestinians and tough words for the traditionally dominant pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, seemed omnipresent at the J Street conference.\u00a0Of the four politicians who spoke Monday, he drew the loudest cheers. Even when he wasn\u2019t in the room, like at a side panel on Palestinian organizing, his name came up: Rawan Odeh of the group New Story Leadership spoke of him as a model for listening to the community\u2019s concerns in a way powerful Americans usually haven\u2019t. The fact that even Sanders rivals, such as centrist fellow speaker Pete Buttigieg, have urged big changes to Obama\u2019s aid policy shows how much of the Democratic Party now believes a major reboot to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is essential. It suggests they don\u2019t see the issue as a political loser. And it indicates that many politically savvy Democrats aren\u2019t ready to be cowed by Trump\u2019s bid to paint them as anti-Semitic for questioning Israel\u2019s actions. \u201cI am very proud to be Jewish and look forward to being the first Jewish president,\u201d Sanders said Monday, using an approach far more personal than his usual stump speech. \u201cIf there is any people on earth who understands the danger of racism and white nationalism, it is certainly the Jewish people, and if there is any people on Earth who should do everything to fight against Trump\u2019s efforts to divide us\u2026 it is the Jewish people.\u201d There\u2019s no inconsistency between supporting Israel as a strategic partner important to the Jewish community in the U.S. (which is overwhelmingly Democratic) and around the world and criticizing some of its policies and hard-line politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sanders and other candidates argued. Simultaneously, almost all highlighted the human rights of the Palestinians, who as recently as 2016 were rarely mentioned by Democrats on the campaign trail. A poll of likely Democratic primary voters conducted earlier this year by J Street, the Jewish American pro-peace group that organized the Monday event, suggests the candidates are in line with their base: 75% said they would be most likely to support a candidate who supported both Israel and the Palestinians, and 74% said the U.S. should be an impartial broker in talks between the two sides. Trump and the GOP claim that because the Democratic Party now includes the first-ever Muslim-American congresswomen, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), whose family is Palestinian, it can no longer be trusted on Israel. Rooted in popular and hateful assumptions about Muslims and buoyed by rhetorical missteps by Omar, that narrative has caused alarm in traditional Democratic circles. Buttigieg attacked it head-on, calling it evidence of \u201cupsetting cynicism\u201d given how Trump has promoted a political narrative of conspiracy theories and racism that echoes anti-Semites in the U.S. and abroad. \u201cThe American people and the American Jewish community are a lot smarter than that,\u201d the South Bend, Indiana, mayor said. And Sanders, who has been endorsed by Omar and Tlaib, noted, \u201cIt will be hard for anybody to call me, whose father\u2019s family was wiped out by Hitler, an anti-Semite.\u201d Sanders, Buttigieg, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro all spoke at the two-day summit. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and author Marianne Williamson sent in video messages to the attendees. The 2020 contenders softened the blow of tough new suggestions for Israeli policy by tying them to proposals of a more ethical approach to a range of concerns about universal rights and freedoms, from China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong and its Muslim minority citizens to America\u2019s systemic failure to provide citizens with decent health care. Castro spoke of defending the constitutional right to boycott Israel, braving a mention of a contentious movement called boycott, divestment and sanctions, or BDS, that few Democrats endorse but almost all say needs to be protected against Republican-led suppression. It\u2019s clear some in the party are still conscious of old guardrails around the issue. It\u2019s good that there is no longer \u201cone voice\u201d dominating political discussions of U.S.-Israel relations, Castro said, saying people should know who he was referring to. Ben Rhodes, the former Obama administration official interviewing him, made a similarly oblique reference in response. Neither said the word \u201cAIPAC.\u201d Klobuchar, one of the more conservative candidates, thanked AIPAC during her Sunday night remarks, drawing the ire of some J Street backers. And Biden, arguably still the front-runner in the race, shied away from talk of conditions on aid or real criticism of Israel in his video, being vague when speaking about who was to blame for the failure to achieve peace except when criticizing the Palestinians. But there was a clear sense that even as Rhodes and fellow Obama White House aide Tommy Vietor led discussions with the candidates \u2015 except with Sanders, who commandeered the stage and the conversation to their visible alarm \u2015 the next Democratic president isn\u2019t likely to try to turn back the clock to the era that ended in January 2017. Between Trump\u2019s reversals of traditional American policy to benefit Netanyahu, the country\u2019s slide toward undemocratic behavior, like policies seen as denying full equality to its Arab citizens, and rising stateside awareness of Palestinians\u2019 struggles, too much has happened.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " INDIANOLA, Iowa \u2015 During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, the campus of Simpson College in this suburb of Des Moines was Bernie Sanders territory. In fact, every college campus in Iowa was. The Vermont senator won the votes of 84% of Democratic voters under the age of 30, according to caucus entrance polls. They were the base of a coalition that nearly toppled Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But polling, as well as interviews with campaign operatives and with students at four campuses across the state, shows these same voters are up for grabs in 2020. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with their proposals to wipe away student debt and promises of systemic change, are the leading candidates among young Democrats, but there is also substantial support for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and interest in New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both of whom are trotting out a youthful, optimistic message. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke brings a similar appeal. Businessman Andrew Yang\u2019s outsider status is attractive, as is the potentially history-making candidacy of California Sen. Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Joe Biden has pockets of support, but some students were dismissive of his candidacy. Almost every campaign is hyping their sustained outreach to young people, and many have staffers in Iowa dedicated to it. If one candidate is able to bring together young voters in a fashion similar to Sanders \u2015 or even to President Barack Obama, who won a majority of those votes in what was essentially a three-way race in 2008 \u2015 that candidate could reap significant political rewards. But if the under-30 crowd splits their votes among multiple candidates, it could benefit Biden, who has strong support among the oldest, most reliable voters in Iowa. The headline battle at the moment is between Warren and Sanders. On a swing through Iowa in October, Warren visited four college campuses in a three-day period. Her campaign aides downplayed the idea that the trip was meant as a play for Sanders-supporting young voters \u2015 and plenty of attendees at the events had at least flecks of gray in their hair \u2015 but it did give the campaign a chance to highlight the students backing her. Simpson College\u2019s student body president, Jailyn Seabrooks, introduced Warren at the event. Seabrooks, who decided to become a political science major the day after the 2016 election, said the number of presidential candidates was \u201coverwhelming\u201d for students voting for the first time. \u201cWe want someone who\u2019s talking about our issues,\u201d said Seabrooks, who cited Warren\u2019s stances on student debt and veterans\u2019 issues as her reasons for backing the senator. \u201cAnd we want someone who\u2019s not patronizing us. We don\u2019t need jokes, we don\u2019t need dances or TikToks. We have serious problems that we want to talk seriously about.\u201d College students and other young voters traditionally played a microscopic role in the Iowa caucuses, where participation can require hours of commitment. That changed in 2008. Obama\u2019s campaign heavily targeted high school and college students, and caucus turnout among young people jumped 135% compared to 2004. Obama won the support of 57% of the voters under the age of 30, compared to 14% for former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and 11% for Clinton. (Obama won 38% of the overall vote in the state.) There are limits to how far popularity, even overwhelming popularity, with young voters can take a candidate. Even though Sanders won 84% of those under 30 in 2016, according to entrance polls, those voters made up less than one-fifth of the total caucus electorate, and he lost the overall vote to Clinton, albeit by less than a percentage point. Still, operatives for many Democratic campaigns believe youth voter turnout could spike again, likely as part of an overall jump in primary turnout. During the 2018 midterm elections, young people cast ballots at double the rate they voted in 2014. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything to dissuade me from the fact that young people are going to be more engaged,\u201d said John Della Volpe, who conducts regular polls of college-age voters for Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics. \u201cI imagine this is going to carry over into the caucus.\u201d On campuses across Iowa, students who spoke to HuffPost were keenly aware of how much influence they could have over who becomes the nation\u2019s next president. Seabrooks noted that five of the last six presidents had visited Simpson, which has only 1,250 undergraduate students. At a Warren town hall at Drake University, a sophomore business major named Max McPartland said he would be \u201cstupid not to come out and experience this.\u201d McPartland, who was interested in Warren but planned on caucusing for Buttigieg, said he had considered many of the candidates \u2015 but not Biden. \u201cHe just seems bureaucratic. He\u2019s been in Washington a lot longer. He\u2019s just out of touch,\u201d said McPartland, who was standing in line for a photo with Warren. \u201cNot a lot of big, new ideas.\u201d That sentiment is not an isolated one, and it\u2019s one the Biden campaign is working to overcome. Jesse Harris, one of the Biden campaign\u2019s top advisers in the Hawkeye State, emphasized Biden\u2019s success in passing legislation on issues that students care about, including gun control and climate change. \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned one thing from the past couple of years, it\u2019s that experience does matter. And that understanding how government works matters,\u201d Harris told HuffPost. \u201cIf you want to rejoin the Paris accords\u201d \u2015 the international agreement to fight climate change abandoned by the Trump administration \u2015\u00a0 \u201cJoe Biden can do that faster than any other candidate because he has the experience internationally.\u201d Harris was also quick to note that 64% of caucus-goers in 2016 were over the age of 45. Sanders, meanwhile, is fighting to hold on to as much of his base as possible: He has a statewide campus organizing director and 8 paid campus organizers, and his campaign trained more than 1,300 college-age volunteers over the summer. While the democratic socialist was never going to replicate his utter dominance of Clinton among young adults, his base still skews youthful. (The campaign boasted on Wednesday about Sanders\u2019 victory in an unscientific straw poll of high school voters in Iowa.) \u201cWe believe students will caucus for the only candidate who\u2019s spent his entire life taking on the greed and corruption of the corporations who caused the climate crisis, profit from student debt and reap the biggest rewards of a rigged economy,\u201d\u00a0Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said. Zoe Swinton, a senior at the University of Iowa who heads up Hawks for Bernie \u2015 the university\u2019s teams are the Hawkeyes \u2015 said the proposals the senator is best known for, especially his push to wipe out student debt, continue to draw students to his campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s offering plans that are more extreme than any other candidate on issues we care about like climate change and student debt,\u201d Swinton said. But she also said she spends time debunking some myths about the senator. She often explains to students \u201cwhat democratic socialism actually is, how progressive policies can actually work.\u201d Sanders and Biden do share a hurdle: the perception of them as old. Sanders is 78, Biden is 76. Warren is 70, but not a single student expressed concerns about her age. Addie Cosgrove, who works for the Biden campaign on Drake University\u2019s campus, said she dismisses concerns about Biden\u2019s age: \u201cI don\u2019t really see this as an issue myself because Joe Biden isn\u2019t that much older than Elizabeth Warren. They\u2019re all the same age.\u201d Swinton said she counters students\u2019 concerns about Sanders\u2019 health by pointing to his rally and parade performances across the country. \u201cThe heart attack was a scare for some people. But he honestly seems rejuvenated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a four-year term. He can last.\u201d Most of the Democratic presidential campaigns are focusing their student organizing efforts at Iowa\u2019s three largest campuses \u2015 Iowa State in Ames, the University of Iowa in Iowa City and Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls \u2015 while also reaching out to students at Drake, smaller liberal arts colleges like Grinnell College, Northwestern College and Simpson, and larger community colleges in the Des Moines area. And seemingly every campaign is engaged in aggressive outreach: Warren has the endorsement of eight former and current presidents of College Democrats chapters. Booker held a press call with student reporters at the beginning of the year, and two of his top Iowa staffers worked at the youth-focused advocacy group NextGen America during the 2018 election cycle. During this year\u2019s back-to-school weeks, Buttigieg purchased Spotify and Pandora ads, interrupting students\u2019 playlists with his pitch. Getting an exact handle on how college students, and young people in general, are planning to cast their ballots can be difficult, with different public pollsters setting different age brackets. The last iteration of the Des Moines Register\u2019s Iowa Poll found Warren leading Sanders among voters under age 35 by a 27% to 22% margin, with every other candidate under 10%. A national poll conducted weekly by CollegePulse and Chegg, a textbook rental company, looks only at college students. It found Sanders with a consistent lead until earlier this month, when Warren went ahead 30% to 28%. Biden drew 10%, Yang was at 9% and Buttigieg drew 7%. And of course, plenty of students remain undecided. Luke Hoffman, a junior math, physics and education major, was standing in line at Warren\u2019s Drake town hall with his friend Rachel Fischer, a junior biology major.

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) called for a public takeover of the investor-owned utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as anger mounts over widespread blackouts aimed at keeping electrical equipment from igniting wildfires. In an interview with HuffPost, the Silicon Valley progressive accused the power company of prioritizing high executive salaries and payouts to investors over infrastructure upgrades needed to operate safely in a hotter, drier climate. \u201cThe for-profit motive does not work,\u201d Khanna said by phone Wednesday. \u201cThe public utility is a much better option because you\u2019re not having to worry about maximizing shareholder returns and you will make the safety investments that are necessary.\u201d Khanna is among the highest-profile elected officials to back a resurgent movement pushing for public ownership of power stations and transmission lines. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom Khanna has\u00a0backed for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, proposed creating a public option for electricity as part of his Green New Deal and this week said it was \u201ctime to begin thinking about public ownership of major utilities.\u201d Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) enacted a law in July directing state regulators to draft a plan to create a public utility to replace investor-owned power companies. Nascent campaigns to municipalize utilities in Chicago and New York City are gaining steam. But the apocalyptic images of suburban homes and cars engulfed in flames and nightmarish stories of residents struggling to survive amid rolling blackouts in the country\u2019s most populous state captured national attention this month and added new momentum to the populist campaigns. PG&E, as it\u2019s known, declared bankruptcy in January in the face of roughly $30 billion in claims stemming from its role in the last two years of wildfires. That includes the Camp fire, the worst fire in California\u2019s history, which last year killed 86 people and destroyed at least 14,000 homes. Officials found the company\u2019s equipment responsible for sparking the blaze. As this year\u2019s fire season approached, PG&E took the dramatic step of cutting off power to millions of homes in California in hopes of preventing sparks from power lines downed by strong winds from igniting dry brush. The company warned that customers should expect rolling blackouts to continue for at least 10 years as it upgrades its infrastructure. Despite the shutoffs, PG&E said this week its power lines may have sparked two wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area. PG&E generated 21% of its electricity from solar and wind in 2016, compared to 17% from natural gas and none from coal, according to the company\u2019s figures, making it a notch greener than California\u2019s power mix overall. But Khanna said a publicly controlled utility freed of the requirement to pay investors dividends could transition much faster to zero-emission sources. He cited Silicon Valley Power, the municipal utility in Santa Clara, which this year generated nearly half its residential electricity from solar and wind. The utility, Khanna said, \u201cis a shining example\u201d of what California lawmakers could transform PG&E into: a locally controlled nonprofit rapidly reducing its emissions and preventing power outages. \u201cWhen you have the public that\u2019s running the utilities, they\u2019re going to care about the consequences of climate changes,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to support renewable energy. They\u2019re not going to be motivated by profit.\u201d PG&E\u2019s profiteering has particularly rankled Californians watching their homes burn, businesses suffer and medical clinics close as modern necessities like phones, refrigerators and electric cars become useless. Just before blackouts began earlier this month, PG&E wined and dined about a dozen employees of the company\u2019s gas division at a ritzy Napa Valley winery. PG&E CEO Bill Johnson apologized for what he called an \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201ctone deaf\u201d event after the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the gathering. \u201cWhile the event was planned for about a year, we sincerely apologize for the insensitivity of the timing and location of the event,\u201d Jeff Smith, a spokesman for PG&E, said in an email Thursday. \u201cMoving forward, we will no longer hold these types of events.\u201d But Johnson\u2019s own pay has drawn criticism. The executive, who earns a base salary of $2.5 million a year, could net $110 million if share prices return to a 2017 peak as part of a bankruptcy deal, according to the Sacramento Bee. \u201cThat\u2019s incomprehensible to me,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cWe ought to have conditioned executive pay at PG&E on fixing the safety risks and repairs.\u201d But Johnson, 65, joined the distressed company at a high price in April after leaving his job as the head of the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority, where he made $8.1 million in total compensation per year. That, according to the Tennessee-based Knoxville News Sentinel, made him the nation\u2019s highest-paid federal employee. The TVA, in some ways, serves as a model for what Sanders proposed under his administration, a government-run power company that provides low-cost electricity to ratepayers whose bills, rather than enriching investors, would go toward rapidly increasing the country\u2019s stock of zero-emission generators. The power sector is the second-largest U.S. source of climate-changing emissions. But an ideal public power network would be less centralized, with distributed renewable generation, batteries and transmission lines that would make the system less vulnerable to fires and extreme weather events, said Johanna Bozuwa, a public power expert at the Washington-based think tank Democracy Collaborative. \u201cWe are not trying to create the institutions of the past,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about a totally new system.\u201d That includes reforming public utility commissions. The regulatory bodies now prioritize profit for investor-owned power companies and fall victim to \u201cregulatory capture\u201d when private utilities deploy their war chests to finance election campaigns and lobby sitting officials. Publicly owned utilities wouldn\u2019t have the same spending power. And states could create oversight boards, such as the entity Paris established when the French capital brought its private water utility under public control nearly a decade ago. \u201cWe\u2019re not going for public ownership; we\u2019re going for democratic public ownership,\u201d Bozuwa said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more people think really critically about how we build the public ownership models that are going to work for us and not just create this arms-length corporatized version of public ownership.\u201d Public takeovers could, in theory, slow some utilities\u2019 transition away from fossil fuels. Boulder, Colorado, started the process of municipalizing portions of the investor-owned Xcel Energy\u2019s grid nearly eight years ago, and it remains locked in a legal fight over the process. But Bozuwa credited the effort with accelerating the Minneapolis-based Xcel\u2019s bid to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Similar calls are growing in California. In September, San Francisco offered PG&E $2.5 billion to buy portions of the grid that serve the city, but the company rebuffed the proposal. Earlier this month, neighboring San Jose followed suit, with Mayor Sam Liccardo announcing the city is considering a range of possible options to form its own utility. PG&E did not respond directly to questions about the campaign to bring it under public ownership. The Edison Electric Institute, an investor-owned utility trade group of which PG&E is a member, did not return a request for comment on Thursday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) isn\u2019t sold on the idea. The first-term governor invited billionaire Warren Buffett to buy PG&E earlier this week. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Buffett\u2019s utility conglomerate that operates power companies in six Western states, did not respond to a request for comment. But Khanna criticized the governor\u2019s proposal. California could issue bonds or spend some of its budget surplus, he said, to buy the utility, break it up and put the grid in the hands of local nonprofits modeled on Silicon Valley Power. \u201cThe idea of having a private entity like Berkshire Hathaway buy it makes no sense,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to be driven by profit motive.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Democrats in the Senate aren\u2019t thrilled with progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) proposal to reshape the U.S. relationship with Israel and the Palestinians by linking American aid to Israel\u2019s behavior toward its neighbors. During a Jewish American group\u2019s conference on Monday, Sanders, who is vying to be the first Jewish president,\u00a0delivered impassioned remarks about his sympathy for Palestinians and issued a proposal that would have once been considered political suicide: making U.S. aid contingent on Israel\u2019s conduct in the region. His proposal, a significant departure from decades-old U.S. policy, was swiftly criticized by Republicans and Democrats, including some of his fellow 2020 presidential candidates. \u2033$3.8 billion is a lot of money, and we cannot give it carte blanche,\u201d Sanders said at the annual confab for J Street, which advocates for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, referring to the amount of military aid Washington provides Israel each year. \u201cIf you want military aid, you\u2019re going to have to fundamentally change your relationship to the people of Gaza. ... I think it is fair to say that some of that $3.8 billion should go right now into humanitarian aid,\u201d the Vermont senator added. The proposal is among a number of Sanders\u2019 ideas to fundamentally reshape the U.S. relationship with Israel, including taking a tougher line against the traditionally dominant pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, and demanding that Israel halt settlement construction. But his ideas would present a substantive break with Democratic Party policy toward Israel. At the end of former President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office, for example, Democrats regularly boasted about the massive new annual aid package they had secured for Israel. Sanders\u2019 push to alter U.S. aid to Israel would also face hurdles in Congress, where there is wide bipartisan support for current policy, including from top Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cI think that has no support here on Capitol Hill,\u201d Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, said of Sanders\u2019 remarks.\u00a0\u201cThe aid that goes to Israel is designated for particular purposes, and the issue concerning the Palestinians is a separate matter that this Congress is not going to take unilateral action that could affect those negotiations.\u201d Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), in line to chair the Foreign Relations Committee if Democrats recapture the upper chamber in next year\u2019s election, also disagreed with the idea. \u201cI think that people have to understand the challenges that Israel faces from Gaza, and so if we didn\u2019t have the malign activities that emanate from Gaza, we would be in a much better place,\u201d Menendez said, referring to the territory blockaded by Israel and controlled by the militant group Hamas. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another Foreign Relations Committee member, said he would oppose \u201canything that would suggest conditioning aid to Israel and Israel not being able to defend itself and not being able to be secure.\u201d The debate over military aid to Israel has emerged as a flashpoint in the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic nomination. At Monday\u2019s J Street conference, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for example, didn\u2019t rule out the idea entirely. But other candidates, like former Vice President Joe Biden, took a more dismissive tone. \u201cThe idea that we would draw military assistance from Israel on the condition that they change a specific policy I find to be absolutely outrageous,\u201d Biden told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The leading Democrats vying for their party\u2019s presidential nomination clashed over the critical issue of health care while offering starkly contrasting visions for the nation\u2019s ideological direction before thousands of cheering Iowa activists at a raucous event kicking off the three-month sprint to the first-in-the-nation caucuses. Former Vice President Joe Biden opened the state Democratic Party\u2019s marquee annual fundraiser, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, by swiping at the candidate who has largely caught him atop the Democratic primary polls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledged generational change, trying to take up the mantle of another young, upstart candidate, Barack Obama, who pulled off a 2008 upset in Iowa on his way to the presidency. The jabs were relatively gentle but previewed arguments that are likely to increasingly dominate the race. Biden said he would overhaul health care nationwide without \u201cincreases in taxes for the middle class. None. None. None.\u201d While not mentioning Warren by name, his pronouncement came hours after she unveiled a much-anticipated proposal to spend $20-plus trillion over the next decade on a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d universal health care plan that she vowed wouldn\u2019t require a middle-class tax increase. Biden\u2019s campaign had already panned that as requiring \u201cmathematic gymnastics\u201d to cover its huge costs. The former vice president has promised not to \u201cabandon\u201d Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The issue has created a stark policy divide between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom back Medicare for All, and more moderate candidates like Biden and Buttigieg, who say the country isn\u2019t ready to do away with private insurance. Biden also called for party unity and tried to cast himself as immediately able to rise to international challenges: \u201cThe next president is going to be commander in chief of a world in disarray. There\u2019s going to be no time for on-the-job training.\u201d Taking the stage a short time later, Warren made an unwavering appeal for sweeping change, saying, \u201cIf the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then we will lose.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on a big idea, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by that big idea,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory.\u201d In all, more than a dozen presidential candidates addressed 13,000-plus Democratic activists, party volunteers and campaign supporters at a basketball arena in downtown Des Moines. The event amounts to the largest gathering of Democrats in an early voting state \u2014 and was something of a dress rehearsal for the Feb. 3 caucuses. Candidates must now move beyond simply introducing themselves to voters and activists and focus on perfecting a grassroots strategy to ensure they mobilize strong support. For White House hopefuls in the top tier, the event was a key test of momentum, while lagging contenders will face further questions about why they\u2019re staying in the race. That was on full display even before Friday\u2019s festivities began, with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke abruptly announcing he was abandoning his campaign. Like Biden, Buttigieg didn\u2019t mention Warren by name but said he supported \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d and promised to honor the decisions of those who aren\u2019t willing to sign up for fully government-sponsored health care. The 37-year-old also offered a veiled swipe at Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 by chiding candidates for being content to \u201cwait for action.\u201d \u201cI am running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us to real action to do right by Americans who have waited far too long,\u201d Buttigieg said. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Friday found Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden bunched together at the top of the field in Iowa, though Biden and Warren have generally been co-front-runners elsewhere. Sanders struck his familiar, defiant tone Friday night, telling the crowd, \u201cWe will pass, whether the insurance companies like it or not, Medicare for All.\u201d The event really started hours before the formal program. The damp, chilly streets outside the arena buzzed all afternoon with campaigns hoping to exhibit strong organization and enthusiasm. Supporters and campaign volunteers waved signs at busy street corners and congregated in chanting droves. Sanders led a pre-event march that his campaign said drew 1,500 people. Warren supporters erected a giant likeness of Bailey, the senator\u2019s golden retriever. Inside the arena, Biden bought tickets for members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed him, while Buttigieg had the largest presence, snapping up thousands of seats for supporters that included an overflow room. Candidates who have traditionally wowed at the gathering have seen it pay big dividends. In 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore effectively blocked former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley\u2019s advance with the chant during his speech \u201cStay and fight,\u201d a nudge at Bradley for leaving the Senate. Four years later, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used it to hold off a dire challenge from Howard Dean. \u201cWe need answers, not just anger,\u201d Kerry said in a hit at the anti-war Vermont governor who had stirred passions on the left but worried others for challenging President George W. Bush during wartime. \u201cIowa, don\u2019t just send them a message. Send them a president.\u201d More recently, Obama, then an Illinois senator, threw down the gauntlet against national Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in 2007, declaring, \u201cTriangulating and poll-driven positions, because we\u2019re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us, just won\u2019t do.\u201d",

      "content": " DECORAH, Iowa \u2015 When Pete Buttigieg begins his stump speeches to the throngs of voters who gather to hear him at town halls across Iowa, he doesn\u2019t start with his plan for a particular policy or elucidate a specific critique of President Donald Trump. Instead, with a pastoral touch drawn from his liberal Episcopalian faith, the 37-year-old Democratic presidential contender, who\u2019s also the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asks his audience to imagine the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cI want to ask you to really visualize the first day when the sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told a flock of about 1,000 voters on Saturday night in the college town of Decorah, about 15 miles south of the Minnesota border. Unlike rivals to his left, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg does not ask voters to recognize the supremacy of corporate power and political corruption as much as he wants them to confront the difficulty of healing a country polarized along partisan lines. Uniting the country, he argues, is a prerequisite to expanding health care coverage, tackling climate change, boosting wages and narrowing the racial wealth gap. But for such a monumental challenge, the request Buttigieg issues to his audience is relatively modest. He wants people to summon the patience and courage that they bring to discussions with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table. The day after the election, he wants them to call their friends and relatives who voted for a different presidential candidate and discuss something non-political. And most of all, he wants them to put their trust in him as the person most capable of leading Americans toward these solutions while easing the rancor of the current political moment. \u201cI believe that the right president, the president that I seek to be, can gather together an American majority to get these things done,\u201d he said in Decorah on Saturday. \u201cThe good news is the American people are ready \u2015 you can feel it. Not everybody. But most of us are ready for solutions to these problems.\u201d If the pitch sounds familiar, that\u2019s because like virtually every element of the latest iteration of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s designed to emulate the rhetoric, tactics and spirit of former President Barack Obama. During Obama\u2019s first run, he paired a progressive policy platform with soaring descriptions of the United States\u2019 common fabric and appeals to overcome the partisan divisions that separated \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states.\u201d He preached an optimistic faith in the power of the country to renew itself that was just vague enough for moderates and progressives alike to see their values in his platform. And he too was a young, relative political newcomer and would-be barrier-breaking minority, who took his articulate stump speech to the rural-most corners of the first-in-the-nation caucus state. (Where Obama was the country\u2019s first Black president, Buttigieg would be the country\u2019s first openly gay president.) Where Obama preached \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d Buttigieg is calling for \u201chope\u201d and \u201cbelonging.\u201d Where Obama joked about an end to \u201cScooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence and Karl Rove politics,\u201d Buttigieg relishes an \u201cend to this chaos and corruption and the tweets.\u201d In his barnburner speech at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s massive Liberty and Justice rally and dinner in the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday night, Buttigieg made the comparison explicit to an audience of 13,000, at least a few thousand of whom were his most dedicated supporters. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock doors for a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said, referencing Obama. \u201cAnd we knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d he continued, prompting roars of approval from his blue-and-yellow-clad fans. But the differences between Buttigieg and Obama are just as obvious. Buttigieg has only served as mayor of a city of just over 100,000 people, and he lost both times he sought higher office. (He ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017). And though over one-quarter of the population of South Bend is Black, Buttigieg\u2019s tenure has been rocked by\u00a0race-related scandals, including the July police killing of a Black man accused of trying to steal cars, which sparked heated protests. His support among non-white Democratic primary voters is in the low single digits, according to public polls. He\u2019s also more popular with older voters, despite being the only candidate who is a millennial. Obama, of course, had a strong base of young people who fueled the excitement and energy of his run. What\u2019s more, while Obama courted voters on the activist left, Buttigieg has by turns confused them and spurned them outright.\u00a0Early on, he called for the aggressive measure of adding more justices to the Supreme Court, but more recently, he said that his vision of an expanded bench would encourage the confirmation of \u201cswing\u201d justices like Anthony Kennedy or David Souter \u2015 two men who were chosen by Republican presidents. The comments were widely interpreted as endorsements of Kennedy and Souter, though that did not appear to be his intention. He\u2019s also been especially hard on Warren and Sanders\u00a0for backing a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan that would effectively end the vast majority of private health care coverage. In September and October when Warren declined to say how she would finance Medicare for All \u2014 and whether it would require tax increases \u2014 Buttigieg effectively called her a hypocrite. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d he said in a CNN interview in September.\u00a0(Warren subsequently released a detailed financing plan that did not raise middle-class taxes.) When HuffPost asked him in Iowa last weekend whether his pugnacious rhetoric marked a break with his previous comments, Buttigieg insisted that he has been consistent. \u201cI continue to believe that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what. I think I\u2019ll be better at fending that off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I hold my views on health care policy is because I think it\u2019s the right answer.\u201d In another discussion with reporters in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg also reiterated that his comments about Kennedy and Souter were in reference to a hypothetical scenario in which the Supreme Court is expanded.\u00a0He believes that a larger court could be capable of accommodating swing justices and could transcend the \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d of the present bench. \u201cI was not saying that in the current Supreme Court structure, I would appoint people with the judicial philosophy like Kennedy or Souter,\u201d he said. \u201cA better example would probably be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of a justice whose judicial philosophy largely matches my own.\u201d Notwithstanding Buttigieg\u2019s glaring differences with Obama, he is trying to cultivate the kinds of voters who remain enamored of the former president\u2019s eloquence and sunny disposition. Call it the \u201cWest Wing\u201d lane. He is the kind of candidate that Democrats of varied ideological leanings can see as the personification of their ideal of politics \u2015 a place where intelligence, uplifting rhetoric and an inspiring personal story are enough to vanquish the demons of division that plague the country. Many attendees of Buttigieg\u2019s town halls volunteered comparisons to Obama unprompted, while some cited other iconic Democratic presidents. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of his charisma,\u201d said Barb Neal, a retired banker from Mount Vernon, who attended the Decorah town hall, by way of explaining the Obama comparison. \u201cHe just gives me hope. He\u2019s so positive. So many of them are so negative \u2015 just bashing the other side, and he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Mary Thomsen, Neal\u2019s sister, who still works as a banker, chimed into agree. \u201cHe reminds me of Obama. For some reason he also reminds me of John F. Kennedy,\u201d she said. Of course, former Vice President Joe Biden has, more than any other candidate, sought to capitalize on his direct ties to Obama. He frequently references \u201cmy friend Barack\u201d in his stump speeches. And his strong support among Black voters in the early primary state of South Carolina is widely attributed to positive memories of his partnership with the country\u2019s first Black president. In trying to channel Obama \u2014 rather than generate good will by association with him \u2014 Buttigieg appears to be having success with many of the Iowa voters who are looking for a more moderate contender, but may be underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s performance on the trail. Buttigieg trounced the former vice president in third quarter fundraising (though the mayor\u2019s haul still fell short of Warren and Sanders\u2019 totals). And he has been rising in Iowa\u2019s polls even as Biden has continued to drop. Several Iowa Democrats at Buttigieg\u2019s events in small towns across the northern part of the state over the weekend described concerns about either the effect of Biden\u2019s age on his public speaking abilities, or the negative publicity surrounding his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine. Laura Swalve, a former school psychologist from Swea City who came to see Buttigieg at the VFW hall in Algona on Monday, described herself as a \u201cfan\u201d of Biden\u2019s. But while clarifying that she does not think he is senile, Swalve worries that he\u2019s \u201cjust not as quick\u201d as he used to be. \u201cI honestly think his age sometimes comes through, like in the debates, when he kind of didn\u2019t know how to say things,\u201d she said. For Bill Paup, a retired schoolteacher from Cedar Falls who came to a Buttigieg town hall in Waverly on Sunday, the appearance of wrongdoing related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine was enough to push him toward other options. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not valid concerns, but just like in 2016, it doesn\u2019t take a valid concern to bury somebody,\u201d Paup said. \u201cIt just takes a lot of noise. And he\u2019s got that.\u201d The Liberty and Justice Celebration is the last of several Iowa political confabs that punctuate the six-month period of campaigning leading up to the Iowa caucuses, which are due to take place this year on Feb. 3. Only candidates who purchase the state party\u2019s voter file or have field offices in the state are permitted to speak. They are also welcome to purchase tickets for their supporters to attend and cheer them on in the stands. (In other words, raucous applause is often less spontaneous, and more sponsored.) In November 2007, Obama\u2019s memorable speech at the fundraiser \u2015 then known as the Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2015 set the tone for the homestretch of Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign, which culminated in his historic victory on caucus day. Buttigieg sought to make his speech \u2015 and delegation \u2015 at Friday\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration a similarly impressive turning point. Festivities began with a rally in downtown Des Moines and a march to the dinner that the Buttigieg campaign said included 2,300 people. Although the campaign \u2015 like other campaigns \u2015 coordinated the participation of many Iowa activists, there was also a delegation of some 1,000 members of the ad hoc, internet-based, grassroots group, \u201cBarnstomers 4 Pete,\u201d who attended the event on their own dime. Ariana Wyndham, an undocumented immigrant who can remain in the country thanks to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and who lives in Warren, Ohio, is a leader of the group. She drove to Des Moines with her husband Peter, a crane operator, for the dinner festivities and a few days of canvassing and bonding with fellow activists. Speaking to HuffPost on the concourse of the Wells Fargo arena, Wyndham, covered in Buttigieg swag, described suffering from anxiety and depression after Trump\u2019s election. Without the right to vote, she felt powerless to get involved in politics until she found out about Buttigieg. She was particularly drawn to the account Buttigieg gives in his book, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d of reviving South Bend, a struggling post-industrial city that reminded her of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it can be done everywhere and it should be done everywhere.\u201d The following days were a show of force from Buttigieg designed to capitalize on his strong reception at the Liberty and Justice Celebration. On Saturday, after answering the questions of building trades union leaders at a multi-candidate fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg embarked on a three-day bus tour across rural northern Iowa, welcoming reporters onto his bus for extended group interviews in between campaign stops. Over the course of six town halls, Buttigieg spoke to crowds ranging from 275 people on the low end to upwards of 1,000, according to estimates provided to the campaign by building managers. The turnout was significant considering that all but one of the events took place in towns with a few thousand people. (His fourth stop was in Mason City, which has a population just under 28,000.) The campaign has one of the most extensive field presences in Iowa with over 100 staff on the ground and some 20 offices. Buttigieg has ramped up his investment in digital advertisements in the state as well, spending over $48,000 on Facebook ads targeting Iowans in the past week alone \u2014 more than any other Democrat running for president \u201cIn a lot of the towns that not just campaigns but a lot of economists have written off, Mayor Pete\u2019s team has shown up,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat running to represent several of the towns Buttigieg visited in the U.S. House and who has not endorsed in the presidential primary. \u201cFor months it was Warren. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve switched strategy or something. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m now seeing Pete more.\u201d For Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who tagged along with Buttigieg for a tour of an ethanol plant in Mason City, Buttigieg\u2019s itinerary was still more evidence that he was walking in the footsteps of Obama, who won Iowa twice. All but one of Buttigieg\u2019s bus tour stops was in a county that Obama won at least once and then went for Trump in 2016. \u201cObama was the model. He was everywhere,\u201d Judge said. Buttigieg has not shied away from the obvious differences between himself and Obama. At a town hall in Mason City on Sunday night that was attended by about 500 people, nearly all of whom were white, a voter asked Buttigieg how he planned to increase his support with Black voters. \u201cThe way to win any vote is to deserve to win it. My job is to make sure there is no confusion about where we stand,\u201d he said. To that end, he has unveiled a multi-pronged plan, named after the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, tailored to address the particular challenges facing Black communities \u2015 from difficulty obtaining credit to start a business or buy a home to encountering racial bias in the job market or the health care system. He also devoted a segment of his stump speech each stop in rural Iowa to confronting the country\u2019s legacy of anti-Black racism. The impact of racism \u201cis as important to discuss with mostly white audiences as it was with the NAACP gathering I was at early today,\u201d he told another predominantly white audience in Decorah on Saturday night. \u201cThis could wreck the entire American project \u2026 as long as we allow it to be the case that this is two different countries in your health and your access to housing or ability to get a job,\u201d depending on whether you are white or Black. And when Buttigieg lists mayoral peers to whom he looks for inspiration and guidance, two of the first names to come up are Michael Tubbs and Randall Woodfin, the young Black leaders of Stockton, California, and Birmingham, Alabama, respectively. For the most progressive voters in the Democratic primary, however, Obama\u2019s presidency is a cautionary tale, rather than a model. For example, they see a president whose embrace of corporate-friendly international trade agreements was wrongheaded and politically damaging, and whose Wall Street-cozy cabinet prevented him from adequately addressing the post-2008 housing crisis. But when asked to make the case that he would deliver on his progressive economic promises despite the support he enjoys from corporate America, Buttigieg again turns to Obama. \u201cThese same criticisms were leveled against President Obama,\u201d said Buttigieg, noting that Obama received campaign contributions from corporate leaders, including many Wall Street executives. \u201cIf you think about with respect to Wall Street, he delivered the strongest regulations and accountability that there had been there in a generation.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, Buttigieg\u2019s embrace of conciliatory politics of the kind Obama employed in his first term risks turning off voters disappointed in the Republican-driven gridlock of the Obama era. HuffPost asked Buttigieg on Monday how he would navigate shepherding policy priorities through Congress even in an optimistic scenario where Democrats control the Senate thanks to conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u201cThis is the interesting thing \u2015 you look at a Joe Manchin, some of these kind of swing-state senators, their orientation may be moderate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pro-corporate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have trouble with a lot of moderate senators on the idea of paid family leave, for example, or making sure that the tax code is more beneficial to the working- and middle-class versus the very wealthy.\u201d Later that day, Buttigieg fielded a similar question from a voter at a town hall in Algona about how he would defend his policies from Republican attacks. He addressed the less favorable \u2015 and arguably more likely \u2015 scenario of a Congress that is at least partly controlled by Republicans. Buttigieg\u2019s proposed solution: Holding political rallies in the states and districts of lawmakers obstructing the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right? And when we\u2019re talking about a measure, that\u2019s not just a new policy and something that people support, even in a conservative area, I believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures \u2015 it would be good for their constituents and reminding their constituents what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. Perhaps fittingly, it was a tactic that Obama also tried. And notably, it didn\u2019t work.",

      "content": " Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is making a big bet that his climate credentials can propel him a victory in the Iowa caucuses and secure him as a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Saturday, Sanders is slated to hold a live-streamed summit on the climate crisis at Des Moines\u2019 Drake University. The event will feature Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), author Naomi Klein and U.S. Youth Climate Strike co-founder Isra Hirsi, the 16-year-old daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). The event marks a new emphasis on climate for Sanders\u2019s Iowa campaign, as the 78-year-old\u2019s base of 18- to 30-year-old voters looks increasingly up for grabs in a heated competition with fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), ascendant moderate South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThe margins are razor-thin here,\u201d said Bill Neidhardt, Sanders\u2019s deputy state director in Iowa. \u201cIf Bernie Sanders can consolidate the climate vote, if he can expand what the climate vote means and win over more union workers, farmers and rural people, that can make the difference.\u201d The campaign spent $1.3 million on a television ad promoting Sanders\u2019 $16.3-trillion Green New Deal as a natural fit for a top wind energy- and food-producing state, as Vox first reported. Sanders is also scheduled to hold at least two rallies with Ocasio-Cortez, who gave him one of his biggest-name endorsements, before moving on to two town halls on green jobs in Iowa\u2019s deep-red 4th Congressional District, which last year reelected white nationalist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). It\u2019s by no means a pivot for Sanders. The senator, long a climate champion, endorsed the Green New Deal movement early on. He hosted a televised town hall on the climate crisis in Washington, D.C., last December featuring the yet-to-be inaugurated Ocasio-Cortez, teenage activists and climate scientists. As the reality sets in that dramatic economic changes are coming \u2015 either by a proactive, planned federal response to global heating or by cataclysmic neglect \u2015 Sanders sees himself as the candidate best positioned to rally voters. With polls showing Sanders drawing anywhere from 9% to 19% of Democratic voters, the campaign is vying to sway not just young voters, but Iowans who have been alarmed by events like the historic floods that devastated the state last March. Opinion polls support the theory that leaning in to climate issues could help Sanders. In a March poll from the Des Moines Register and CNN, 91% of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa said they preferred a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, a sweeping industrial plan to eliminate emissions, transition workers into new jobs and spur new markets for farmers. That same month, a Monmouth University survey pegged climate change as the No. 2 issue that likely primary voters in the state thought about after health care. In an August survey from the Yale Program on Climate Communication, 69% of Iowa voters said they were worried about climate change, while 74% acknowledged warming was having an effect on the state\u2019s agriculture. The trend bears out nationally. Roughly 38% of registered voters favored a Green New Deal proposal that spent upwards of $10 trillion eliminating climate-changing emissions by 2030, according to an August nationwide survey the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress commissioned from the pollster Civis Analytics. That compares to 32.5% who preferred a $1.7 trillion plan to zero out emissions by 2050 \u2015 something more in line with what Biden proposed. Between June 2018 and May 2019, Iowa experienced its wettest year since records began in 1895, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data the Des Moines Register cited. But it\u2019s biofuels, a controversial environmental policy that Sanders excluded from the 13,840-word Green New Deal blueprint his campaign released in August, which could broaden the senator\u2019s appeal. Iowa farmers who produce corn for ethanol, a fuel that helps lower the emissions and tailpipe pollution in gasoline, saw revenues drop by as much as half in the past year as the Trump administration made changes to federal rules on biofuels, said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group. \u201cThat 50% cut in farm income took them from making money to losing money,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cPeople are losing their farms.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that could draw criticism from some in the environmental movement who argue that industrial-scale corn farming poses its own ecological problems and investing in lower-carbon fuel potentially detracts from efforts to rapidly convert the U.S. car fleet to battery-electric vehicles. But it\u2019s good politics in the near term. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposal to exempt some small oil refineries from the federal biofuels mandate known as the Renewable Fuel Standard sent markets tanking. Shaw said Iowa farmers saw the move as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d by President Donald Trump that could \u201copen the door\u201d to a Democrat like Sanders winning voters even in red districts. Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal plan calls for 100% electric vehicles by 2030, and the senator once criticized ethanol\u2019s \u201cnegative impact on farmers and consumers.\u201d Yet he embraced the industry during his 2016 presidential bid and has repeatedly signaled his support in the past few months. In May, Sanders described \u201cbiofuels like ethanol\u201d as \u201can economic lifeline to rural and farm commodities in Iowa.\u201d\u00a0During an interview in Afton, Iowa, in July, he listed \u201ccreating sustainable non-fossil fuels\u201d as an example of a \u201cpositive role\u201d for \u201crural America\u201d in lowering emissions. At a popular fundraiser in the state this month, Sanders offered biofuels his full-throated support. \u201cUnder my administration, we will significantly increase funding for wind, for solar, for biofuels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an energy standard which will encourage research and development into the most efficient biofuels we can, so biofuels and other sustainable energy is exactly the direction we have got to go.\u201d Championing ethanol, said Iowa congressional candidate J.D. Scholten, could warm otherwise skeptical Iowans to some of the more novel proposals in Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal, which earmarks nearly $15 billion for worker-owned grocery co-ops and calls for a massive expansion of federally owned power plants. \u201cPeople who haven\u2019t voted for a Democrat in years \u2015 maybe never \u2015 are giving us a chance,\u201d said Scholten, the Iowa Democrat who nearly unseated King in the last election and hopes to face off with the nine-term congressman again next year. \u201cI personally think if they do it right, the Green New Deal can be a winning message in rural Iowa.\u201d",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " A ruling by Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court allowed former leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to walk free from prison Friday, surrounded by throngs of cheering supporters. The court ruled late Thursday in a landmark decision that defendants may remain free while they exhaust appeals in their cases. The former head of state, popularly known as Lula, has suddenly reemerged as a possible contender against his political opposite: controversial far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. But da Silva, 74, cannot run unless his corruption conviction is overturned. Da Silva was mobbed by supporters as he left the federal police headquarters building in the southern city of Curitiba on Friday. He already looked like he was campaigning as he raised his fist and embraced well-wishers.\u00a0\u201cThey tried to criminalize the left,\u201d he said in an address to the crowd, The New York Times reported. \u201cThey didn\u2019t lock up a man, they tried to kill an idea. But an idea can\u2019t be destroyed.\u201d Da Silva announced that he would hold a gathering of supporters at a metalworkers union in S\u00e3o Paulo on Saturday before launching a national tour. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) linked to a story on da Silva\u2019s release on Twitter and said he was \u201cdelighted.\u201d Sanders said his incarceration \u201cnever should have happened in the first place.\u201d Da Silva responded to Sanders in a tweet, thanking him for his \u201csolidarity\u201d and adding that Sanders has \u201calways been my candidate for the U.S. presidency.\u201d Da Silva began serving a 12-year sentence (later reduced to less than nine years) in 2018 for corruption and money laundering linked to charges that he and his wife illegally received about $1.1 million\u00a0from a construction company tied to a beachfront apartment. In exchange, the construction operation was granted contracts from the state-controlled Petrobas oil company, according to prosecutors. Critics contend the charges were politically motivated at a time when da Silva had been favored to win the 2018 presidential election. Bolsonaro won instead. Others in the corruption case that ensnared da Silva are also being freed, along with thousands of other inmates appealing their sentences. Until the new ruling, people convicted could be ordered to prison to begin their sentences before their appeals were exhausted. The former union leader and head of the Workers Party was in charge during a run of economic growth from 2003 to 2010 that boosted the nation\u2019s middle class. Da Silva\u2019s massive welfare program also helped lift millions from poverty, and he left office with an approval rating of more than 80%.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke out against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s consideration of a 2020 bid, chalking it up to \u201cthe arrogance of billionaires.\u201d While campaigning in Iowa on Saturday, Sanders told ABC News that Bloomberg\u2019s plan to skip campaigning\u00a0(if he enters the race) in early voting states proves just that. \u201cWe\u2019re all over New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, California,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut he\u2019s too important. You see, when you\u2019re worth $50 billion, I guess you don\u2019t have to have town meetings, you don\u2019t have to talk to ordinary people. What you do is you take out, I guess a couple of billion dollars, and you buy the state of California.\u201d Sanders, who staked both his 2016 bid and his current campaign on opposition to the economic and political power of America\u2019s ultra-rich, emphasized that message during his speech to voters in Coralville on Saturday, taking aim directly at Bloomberg. \u201cSorry, you ain\u2019t gonna buy this election,\u201d he said, warning the potential candidate that he\u2019s \u201cnot going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa\u201d and other key states. \u201cThose days are gone.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, echoed Sanders\u2019 skepticism of a Bloomberg bid during an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cWhen people look at this White House and see this multi-millionaire ... I don\u2019t think they say, \u2018Oh, we need someone richer,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI think you have to earn votes and not buy them.\u201d On Friday, Bloomberg took the initial steps of entering the race by turning in paperwork for the Alabama primary, meeting its early filing deadline and indicating he would focus his efforts on large states. \u201cIf we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s adviser,\u00a0Howard Wolfson, told The Associated Press. Alabamians will cast ballots on March 3 \u2014 aka Super Tuesday \u2014 along with voters in 13 other states, making it a turning point in the presidential nomination contest.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Center for Popular Democracy Action, an influential network of progressive community organizations, announced Tuesday that it has narrowed down the number of presidential contenders it is considering for an endorsement:\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The political arm of the Center for Popular Democracy, which is composed of 41 groups representing low-income and working-class Black and Latinx people, plans to issue its first-ever presidential endorsement in early December. It will reflect its belief on which candidate inspires low-income voters of color the most and is best equipped to deliver on progressive priorities, such as criminal justice reform, immigration reform, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a Green New Deal \u2015 key planks in the organization\u2019s\u00a0federal policy platform. The coalition\u2019s imprimatur is likely to be an asset for candidates in the early primary states of Nevada and California, which are home to several of its member organizations, as well as the general-election battleground states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. \u201cIt was Castro, Warren\u2019s and Bernie\u2019s responses that really struck home for our network and our affiliates,\u201d said Natalia Salgado, political director of CPD Action. \u201cThe core thing, the moral compass for us, throughout this whole process, is our federal platform, which is all of the issues that matter to our affiliates.\u201d CPD Action\u2019s board and staff came up with the shortlist from a wider array of candidates topping the polls at the time of its July conference: former Housing Secretary Castro; Sens. Sanders of Vermont, Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden. It graded all eight of the candidates based on their policy positions and their willingness to engage with the organization\u2019s evaluation process. Sanders, Warren and Castro all received an A. Biden and Harris, whom the group claims declined to engage at all, got an F. Booker and Buttigieg received a C, and O\u2019Rourke, who dropped out earlier this month, got a D. Each of the 41 member organizations, which include state affiliates of the immigrant rights group Make the Road, will get a single vote to decide which of the three finalists to endorse. A candidate must obtain a majority of the 41 votes to earn the endorsement, leaving open the remote possibility that the network will not endorse anyone. Even as prominent labor unions with closer ties to the Democratic establishment have been slower to back particular presidential candidates in the 2020 election cycle, newer and more independent progressive groups have been eager to weigh in. The Working Families Party, which shares some of CPD Action\u2019s member organizations, endorsed Warren in September. The blessing provided Warren with something of a shot in the arm since it represented a break with the group\u2019s support for Sanders in the 2016 presidential campaign. The backing of CPD Action could amount to a similar coup for its chosen candidate. For one thing, the network and its member groups have developed a reputation for some of the most pugnacious activism in the liberal landscape, suggesting it would bring considerable grassroots mobilization to its preferred candidate. The network\u2019s Local Progress project created a nationwide progressive caucus for like-minded municipal lawmakers; its Fed Up campaign mounted the first left-leaning movement to pressure the Federal Reserve; and its bird-dogging of senators during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh became a rallying cry for the resistance to Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation. Ady Barkan, the ALS-stricken attorney who conceived of many of the group\u2019s most innovative initiatives, has become one of the country\u2019s best-known and most compelling advocates for Medicare for All. \u201cWe are going to lend all of our political weight to that \u2015 that includes media and digital support. Once we\u2019ve endorsed, we\u2019re going to create an in-state strategy within each state where we\u2019re going to throw down, focus our fundraising on places we think are critical for the candidate to win,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use that network to bring in bodies from noncompetitive states like New York into competitive states.\u201d But more than any one issue or activism tactic, CPD Action plans to amplify the voices of low-income communities of color, which play a marginal role in the earliest stages of the presidential primary process. Iowa and New Hampshire, which host the first-in-the-nation caucus and primaries, respectively, are overwhelmingly white. Liberal activists \u2015 and at least one 2020 candidate, Castro \u2015 have lamented the outsize role the two states have on the nomination process given how unrepresentative they are of the demographics of the country, to say nothing of the diverse Democratic primary electorate. CPD Action\u2019s endorsement is also something of a counterweight to those Democratic campaigns and strategists who progressive activists fear have been insufficiently attentive to the potentially decisive role of increasing Black and Latino turnout in the key states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. They worry instead that Democratic candidates and consultants are focused on catering to the largely white swing voters who backed former President Barack Obama in 2012 and President Donald Trump in 2016 to the exclusion of infrequent voters in communities of color who are more predisposed to back Democrats. \u201cWhat makes us unique in comparison to other organizations is that you have people who are going to have a say in this who live in the most highly incarcerated ZIP code in the country in Milwaukee,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got undocumented workers in Virginia who otherwise aren\u2019t legally allowed to vote but are going to have a voice in our process. You\u2019ve got even some white folks who feel disaffected by what\u2019s going on in this country who are going to have a say in this process.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a super powerful way to go into this presidential process by having people like that that the Democratic Party has always said, \u2018Ehhh, I don\u2019t know \u2015 (A) we legally can\u2019t talk to them, or (B) I don\u2019t really want to waste our time on them,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re saying no, they\u2019re worth the time.\u201d",

Back then, Sanders presented a clear contrast to challenger Hillary Clinton, whose past stances on labor-related issues hobbled her support among organized labor leaders. This time, NNU\u2019s 150,000 members had a much wider field of progressive candidates to choose from. Sanders, however, was the only candidate to sit for an interview with the union in person, The New York Times reported. His closest progressive rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), called in via video chat, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sent the union a recorded video, the Times said. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) declined the NNU\u2019s invitation. The union\u2019s leadership touted Sanders\u2019 support for the Green New Deal, free college and social justice programs, but particularly emphasized his health care proposals. As he did in 2016, Sanders has made his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill a key feature of his 2020 campaign. \u201cFor nurses, our solidarity is a matter of life or death for our patients,\u201d NNU President Jean Ross, a registered nurse from Minnesota, said in a statement. \u201cWe need a president who makes it easier for us to stand together and hold our employers accountable for putting people above profits.\u201d NNU Executive Director Bonnie Costillo said nurses \u201care beyond tired of watching our patients suffer and die needlessly, simply due to inability to pay.\u201d Though Sanders and Warren have similar visions for what American health care should look like, the two senators differ in how they would implement a universal single-payer plan.

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) unveiled sweeping legislation Thursday to invest up to $172 billion over the next decade to drastically upgrade the nation\u2019s 1.2 million public housing units as part of a Green New Deal. The bill, set to be introduced Thursday afternoon, calls for retrofitting the federally owned homes, improving energy efficiency, converting oil-burning furnaces and gas-fired stoves to renewable-energy electric alternatives, and replacing the lead-leaching pipes causing public health crises in cities across the country. The so-called Green New Deal for Public Housing Act marks one of the boldest efforts yet to legislate the Green New Deal movement that, since its debut in mainstream politics with a series of protests a year ago, has reframed the global climate policy debate, providing a popular alternative to the market-friendly dogma that\u2019s dominated Western politics for decades. \u201cFaced with the global crisis of climate change, the United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy,\u201d Sanders, a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement. \u201cThis bill shows that we can address our climate and affordable housing crises by making public housing a model of efficiency, sustainability and resiliency.\u201d The bill is unlikely to become law because it would face fierce opposition from mainstream Democrats and virtually all Republicans, whose party\u2019s ideological project of the past half-century has focused on dismantling the public sector the New Deal expanded rapidly after the Great Depression. Just one other lawmaker, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), co-sponsored the Senate version of the bill. But the legislation provides a tangible marker of what a Green New Deal would actually look like, and it offers a glimpse of how Sanders would govern if he were to defeat President Donald Trump next November. In much the same way that Sanders\u2019s steady drumbeat for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d energized the U.S. movement for the kind of single-payer health care system that exists in much of the developed world, the public housing proposal could build a political constituency to revitalize a crucial source of affordable homes for the American working class. The effort comes as public housing units are a shambles, real estate prices are rising faster than wages in 80% of U.S. housing markets and homelessness has climbed for the past two years. The legislation also shows for the first time how national policy to slash climate-changing emissions can reduce poverty and racial inequity by targeting long-term investments at largely minority communities, cleaning up sickness-causing pollution and creating demand for jobs that would go to local communities. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders\u2019s bid for the presidency last month and held a rally in front of the Queensbridge Houses in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. The nation\u2019s largest public housing development \u2015 already suffering from mold and rat and roach infestations after decades of disinvestment and neglect \u2015 neighbors New York City\u2019s dirtiest power plant. The benefits to the United States\u2019 most populous city would be considerable. Eliminating climate pollution from New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) units would require $48 billion in investments by 2030 but would reduce utility costs by $200 million to $398 million per year and slash asthma rates by up to 30%, according to independent calculations by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress. The employment gains, however, would go overwhelmingly to states that voted for Trump. The bill\u2019s mandate to revamp the existing public housing structures would spur $119 billion to $172 billion in spending over a decade, Data for Progress found. The legislation would help create nearly 241,000 good-paying jobs per year with provisions requiring union labor and U.S.-made materials for renovation projects. It would also create 22,300 to 36,000 career-track jobs in maintenance and construction, with average yearly incomes ranging from close to $70,000 in California to $61,600 in Georgia. Of those jobs, states that went to the Republican presidential candidate in 2016 would receive on average 17,489 jobs compared with 9,428 in blue states, the Data for Progress study showed. Yet, on the congressional level, districts that voted for Democrats in the 2018 election would see a slightly higher influx of jobs, with 14,224 compared with 12,168 in red districts. \u201cYou\u2019re really mobilizing the public sector to deliver benefits to all Americans,\u201d said Daniel Aldana Cohen, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative and the author of Data for Progress\u2019s report. Public housing policy has encouraged market shifts that benefited the many before. In the early 1990s, the state-controlled utility New York Power Authority set about reducing the electricity that refrigerators in NYCHA units used. In 1995, following a competition between three top appliance makers, officials awarded a contract to Maytag to manufacture a small, super-efficient refrigerator. The final product used less than half the power of the older refrigerators, going from 1,110 kilowatt hours per year in 1991 to 437 kilowatt hours by 1997, according to a study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. And making a large-scale investment in public housing would make the United States competitive with other nations again, Aldana Cohen said. In May, the European Union awarded a prestigious architectural prize to an upgraded public housing complex in Bordeaux, France. Last month, the Royal Institute of British Architects\u2019 Stirling Prize went to a 105-home public housing development in the British city of Norwich. Buildings accounted for about 12% of planet-heating emissions in the United States, federal figures show, but the number could be as high as 39% according to the U.S. Green Building Council. The sector\u00a0worldwide amounts to 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the United Nations estimates. \u201cIn Europe, green public housing is one of the most exciting technological sectors of the building industry,\u201d said Aldana Cohen. \u201cWho knows what Americans will contribute by really taking public housing seriously, by investing in it seriously, and by making it green and healthy and safe.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that General Electric made the super-efficient refrigerator in the 1990s. It was Maytag.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a new plan on Friday to pass major legislation expanding health care within 100 days as president and to get a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d government-run health care system enacted by her third year in office. The proposal lays out a vision towards universal health care coverage, but one that also acknowledges the difficult political constraints standing in the way to getting it through Congress under a new Democratic administration.\u00a0It would quickly put in place the building blocks of Medicare for All, which could also serve as a backup plan in case her efforts to establish a universal, government-run health care program fail. Under the plan, Warren would use her executive authority both to drive down the price of prescription drugs (in some cases, by threatening the patents of drugmakers charging high prices) and to reverse changes implemented by President Donald Trump that have undermined the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions. But the plan also has a major legislative component, including the creation of a new, government-run insurance plan. It would be free to all children and all people with incomes less than twice the poverty line, and open to everybody else, who would pay varying, income-based premiums. By design, it would be more generous and generally cheaper than private insurance for many, and probably most, people. The same legislation would also open up the existing Medicare program to people 50 and older, while improving the financial assistance available to people buying insurance through HealthCare.gov and the state exchanges. Such legislation would encounter stiff opposition from the same groups that would fight Medicare for All. But Warren\u2019s campaign says she plans to use a legislative process called budget reconciliation that requires only a simple majority in the Senate to make it law. Republicans recently used budget reconciliation to push through their tax cuts and attempted to used it to pass repeal of the Affordable Care Act. By shifting millions of people to a public health care system gradually, Warren hopes her proposal will help build support for a full-fledged Medicare for All program down the line while offering people immediate health care relief in the short term. However, it\u2019s hard not to view Warren\u2019s new plan through a political lens given the tightening Democratic primary, one in which her impressive rise to the front of the pack in public opinion polls appears to have leveled off\u00a0less than three months from the Iowa caucuses. By delaying the elimination of private health insurance under Medicare for All until later in her presidency, Warren is attempting to blunt attacks from moderate rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, as well as inoculate herself against a Republican onslaught during a general election campaign against Trump. The delayed timeline, meanwhile, would also give Democrats who are uncomfortable with Medicare for All and its elimination of private insurance an opportunity to get on board with her candidacy. The new plan may open her to criticism from Medicare for All supporters, as well. Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for example, has not said he will wait as long as three years to pass his Medicare for All proposal, creating some daylight between the two progressive senators ahead of next week\u2019s presidential debate in Georgia. The three-year timeline, meanwhile, could be fraught with political risk. There are many political variables to consider alongside Warren\u2019s plan to wait until after the 2022 midterm elections to pass Medicare for All, but the Senate map in 2022 looks better for Democrats than the one next year, which could boost Warren\u2019s prospects of getting the program passed. But if the party fails to capture the upper chamber in 2020, a difficult task, it would make much of these calculations moot altogether. Finally, Warren\u2019s reliance on budget reconciliation to pass a public health insurance option acknowledges the difficulties in eliminating the filibuster, which she has called for if Democrats win the Senate next year. If it were easy to convince her Democratic colleagues to get rid of the long-standing 60-vote supermajority requirement, her plan wouldn\u2019t require budget reconciliation at all. But red-state Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, for example, recently ruled out ever supporting eliminating the filibuster. And they\u2019re not alone. Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report.",

Sen. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who two weeks ago introduced her own plan to finance Medicare for All without raising middle-class taxes, announced earlier on Friday that she would also pursue implementation of her plan in stages. She said she would move immediately to introduce a public option and lower the Medicare eligibility age to 50 and then, in the third year of her presidency, she would begin phasing out duplicative private health insurance.

Sanders staked out a contrasting approach. \u201cWith National Nurses United at my side, during the first week of our presidency, we are going to introduce the legislation that will bring Medicare for All to everyone in this country,\u201d the Vermont independent said to a cheering crowd of nurses clad in the union\u2019s signature red T-shirts. The 150,000-member union, which is especially strong in California, is perhaps the country\u2019s leading institutional proponent of Medicare for All. While it had been considering throwing its weight behind Warren, the union cited Sanders\u2019 decades of consistent support for a single-payer health care system in explaining its endorsement. Asked at the press conference whether Warren\u2019s plan is a departure from his plan, Sanders answered diplomatically. \u201cI will let Senator Warren speak for herself, but this is what I believe,\u201d he said before being cut off by the knowing laughs of the nurses assembled before him. Addressing the laughter, he joked, \u201cSee, that\u2019s being very tactical.\u201d He explained that he does not see any value in deferring a confrontation with the private insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies that will stand in the way of a single-payer system. \u201cThat\u2019s a fight that\u2019s going to have to happen,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI will engage that struggle on day one of my administration, not put it off for several years.\u201d Of course, Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation features a four-year phase-in period\u00a0during which he would gradually lower the Medicare eligibility age before making the program completely universal. But unlike Warren, he has decided not to decouple the plan\u2019s most controversial feature \u2015 the abolition of private insurance for practices covered by the new, expanded Medicare program \u2015 from the expansion of coverage. And by refusing to postpone implementation of the full Medicare for All legislation to the third year of his presidency, he does not risk \u2015 as Warren\u2019s left-wing critics fear of her plan \u2015 facing a more hostile Congress and being forced to defer the policy\u2019s enactment indefinitely. The gentle tone of Sanders\u2019 remarks about Warren reflect a non-aggression pact that the two candidates struck prior to announcing their plans to run for the White House. Sanders\u2019 campaign aides have shown signs of straying from the terms of that accord, but Sanders himself has rarely, if ever, offered anything more than veiled criticism of Warren. But Medicare for All is still something of a political obstacle course for Warren, who has scrambled to respond to a monthslong drumbeat of pressure springing from her initial embrace of Sanders\u2019 legislation. She released her plan to finance the single-payer legislation after weeks of questions from journalists and attacks from more moderate rivals demanding to know whether her plan to finance the plan would lead to middle-class tax increases. Before relenting and producing a plan to pay for Medicare for All that limited the tax increases to the wealthy and corporations, Warren had been reiterating that the vast majority of Americans\u2019 underlying costs would go down under her plan without specifying whether that meant that the elimination of out-of-pocket costs would offset a tax increase. (Sanders has openly stated that his health care plan will raise taxes on middle-income earners, but justified it on the grounds that the tax increases would be lower than overall savings.) The presidential campaign of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a moderate contender who perhaps exerted the most effective pressure on Warren, continued to blast her in a Friday statement. Campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith argued that Warren\u2019s decision to embrace the public option, which Buttigieg has labeled \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d was an effort to \u201cpaper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance- whether they like it or not.\u201d \u201cDespite adopting Pete\u2019s language of \u2018choice,\u2019 her plan is still a \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach that would eradicate choice for millions of Americans,\u201d Smith continued. This story has been updated with additional information about Warren and Sanders\u2019 plans.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on Friday warned the Democratic field of White House hopefuls not to veer too far to the left, a move he said would alienate many who would otherwise be open to voting for the party\u2019s nominee next year. Though Obama did not mention anyone by name, the message delivered before a room of Democratic donors in Washington was a clear word of caution about the candidacies of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The two have called for massive structural changes \u2014 and in Sanders\u2019 case \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 that would dramatically alter the role of government in people\u2019s lives. The centrist wing of the party has warned for months that a far-left nominee could alienate moderate Republicans and independent voters needed to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it\u2019s important for us not to lose sight of that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff. They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.\u201d Obama has largely refrained from publicly opining on the Democratic primary, which has exposed a growing rift between an ascendant progressive wing of the party and old-guard centrists like his former vice president, Joe Biden. But on Friday he said he felt compelled to weigh in because some of the loudest and most strident voices, particularly on social media, aren\u2019t representative of where most in the party are at. Immigration and health care are two issues he cited as cases where Democratic candidates are out of sync with public sentiment. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. Obama delivered his remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democrats who raise large sums for the party. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the party who narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race last year. He also sought also to ease jittery Democrats who have been wringing their hands over the size of the sprawling field, which some worry will lead to a prolonged contest that will leave the eventual nominee with limited time to prepare for the general election. \u201cI just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNot only did I win ultimately a remarkably tough and lengthy primary process with Hillary Clinton, but people forget that even before that we had a big field of really serious, accomplished people.\u201d",

      "content": " Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is shelling out $100 million for ads opposing President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election as he considers running for the Democratic nomination. The online ads target voters in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2015 all battleground states \u2015 and began running Friday, according to multiple outlets. The spots will run through the end of the primary season, regardless of whether Bloomberg launches a presidential bid. It\u2019s the latest sign that the billionaire is seriously weighing a run. On Tuesday, he registered for the Arkansas primary, and the week before, he registered for Alabama\u2019s \u2015 both of which fall on Super Tuesday. If he enters the race, Bloomberg reportedly plans to skip campaigning in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire and focus instead on the 14 states holding primaries on that pivotal primary day, which will fall on March 3. In an ABC News interview last week, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Bloomberg\u2019s consideration of a run \u201cthe arrogance of billionaires,\u201d and chastised Bloomberg\u2019s strategy as the thinking of someone who feels \u201che\u2019s too important.\u201d \u201cYou see, when you\u2019re worth $50 billion, I guess you don\u2019t have to have town meetings, you don\u2019t have to talk to ordinary people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat you do is you take out, I guess a couple of billion dollars, and you buy the state of California.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another White House hopeful, echoed Sanders\u2019 discomfort with the idea of Bloomberg jumping into the race, arguing it\u2019s not the time for the mega-rich to run. \u201cWhen people look at this White House and see this multi-millionaire ... I don\u2019t think they say, \u2018Oh, we need someone richer,\u2019\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI think you have to earn votes and not buy them.\u201d",

      "content": " Ahead of this week\u2019s Democratic debate\u00a0hosted by MSNBC, three presidential contenders are urging the network\u2019s parent company, Comcast, to conduct an independent investigation into sexual misconduct at the news network. But instead of taking the fight directly to the company, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are planning to send a letter Tuesday to Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, pressing their case, HuffPost has learned. In the letter, which was coordinated by the women\u2019s advocacy group UltraViolet, the senators say they\u2019re concerned about the message it sends to sexual assault survivors if the Democratic debate happens without the network\u2019s parent at least agreeing to conduct an investigation into allegations of harassment, assault and a cover-up at NBC News. Sen. Kamala Harris signed on to the letter on Tuesday morning. Calling the allegations \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d the senators write: \u201cWe, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors.\u201d On the issue of sexual harassment, it\u2019s crucial for Democrats to distinguish themselves from Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, they write. \u201cDonald Trump has been credibly accused of sexual harassment and sexual abuse by dozens of women. We, as a party, have to offer voters a clear and unquestionable difference come November when it comes to these important issues,\u201d they write. \u201cWe can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.\u201d The candidates join a rising chorus of voices calling for NBC to truly get to the bottom of a swirl of allegations, including claims of harassment and assault that led to the firing of \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer and questions over the way Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct was handled. Current and former NBC employees, media critics and women\u2019s rights advocates, including UltraViolet, have demanded a thorough transparent accounting of what happened. UltraViolet is also demanding the firing of NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC executive Phil Griffin and anyone in leadership that enabled abusers. \u201cAll news organizations, their management and their journalists make mistakes, sometimes very damaging ones,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post. \u201cThe ones who are committed to the truth \u2014 and to their own all-important credibility \u2014 swallow hard and do the right thing: They dig out the facts, relentlessly publish them and, when appropriate, punish the miscreants.\u201d In his book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Farrow offers a detailed account of how top executives at the network actively kept him from reporting rape allegations against Weinstein. He also writes that Lauer\u2019s problems were an open secret at NBC for years before he was fired. After CBS News and Fox News faced similar allegations, both networks brought in outside law firms to investigate company culture. In contrast, NBC went with company lawyers, releasing a report last year that largely cleared the network of any wrongdoing. The network said last month that it won\u2019t do any additional investigation. \u201cWe are very confident in the report that was conducted,\u201d NBCUniversal spokesperson Hilary Smith told The Hollywood Reporter.\u00a0\u201cWe fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation. Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture.\u201d Smith also noted that a team of women conducted the internal investigation and none worked in the NBC News division. The network declined to comment further to HuffPost for this story. \u201cNBC\u2019s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault,\u201d the senators write in their letter. \u201cYet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable.\u201d The letter stops short of threatening to pull out of the Democratic debate if Comcast declines to investigate. Through a spokesperson, Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder of UltraViolet said that the DNC shouldn\u2019t partner with the network again on debates if there\u2019s no investigation. Warren and Booker did not respond immediately to HuffPost\u2019s request for further comment. Here\u2019s the full text of the letter: Dear Chairman Perez: The latest allegations of sexual assault and harassment by former NBC employees perpetrated by NBC executives and on-air talent as well as a cover-up by NBC\u2019s management are deeply troubling. We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors. NBC\u2019s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable. That\u2019s what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management\u2019s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk. Donald Trump has been credibly accused of sexual harassment and sexual abuse by dozens of women. We, as a party, have to offer voters a clear and unquestionable difference come November when it comes to these important issues. We can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership. It is critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks. Signed, Senator Cory Booker Senator Kamala Harris Senator Bernie Sanders Senator Elizabeth Warren This has been updated to reflect that Sen. Harris also signed on to the letter as of Tuesday morning.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is threatening former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead with Latino voters in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with the winner set to potentially reap a huge collection of delegates that could prove crucial to deciding who emerges as the Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump. Both men held town halls in Las Vegas this weekend ahead of a Nevada Democratic Party dinner here on Sunday night, and both used the opportunity to highlight their support in the first state to vote with a significant Latino population. Biden is relying on support from Latino and Black voters to keep his campaign alive and collect large sums of delegates to the Democratic National Convention even if he struggles in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Sanders\u2019 strength with Latino voters is a direct threat to that strategy. \u201cI think the Latino vote will be the single most important part of the delegate map for any candidate this year,\u201d said Chuck Rocha, a top strategist for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve made [Latino voters] a part of the general strategy. In other campaigns, it\u2019s been an afterthought. We\u2019re not doing that to prove a point. We\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s smart politics.\u201d Rocha noted Latino voters are a growing presence in Iowa and South Carolina, and a key bloc in Nevada. But the real prize will come on Super Tuesday. Colorado, Texas and California \u2015 all of which are more than 20% Latino, according to census data \u2015 will combine for more than 700 delegates. And other Super Tuesday states, including Oklahoma, North Carolina and Virginia, are home to sizable Latino populations. Their electoral importance means basically every campaign is aggressively courting Latino voters. One of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s first campaign trips was to Puerto Rico, and her campaign has hired Latino state directors in California, Texas and Florida. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is struggling with voters of color, has hired a Latinx outreach director based in Las Vegas. Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who would be the first-ever Latino major-party nominee, has escorted an asylum-seeker to a check-in with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and is counting on Latinos to turn around his struggling campaign.\u00a0Despite these efforts, public polling of Latinos generally shows Biden and Sanders in the lead. A Noticias Telemundo poll conducted in late October found Biden earning the support of 26% of Hispanic Democrats nationally, while Sanders collected 18% and Warren was at 10%. Every other candidate was below 5%. A Latino Community Foundation poll of Latino voters in California found 31% planned to vote for Sanders, while 22% are planning to back Biden and 11% will back Warren. Here in Nevada, a Nevada Independent poll found 33% of Hispanic voters in the state backed Biden, 24% backed Sanders and just 11% backed Warren.\u00a0(One recent poll does break the Sanders vs. Biden duopoly: A Telemundo poll of Texas found Biden earning 33% of the vote of Hispanic Democrats in the state, with Warren at 16% and Sanders at 11%.) Sanders spent almost the entire weekend courting Latino voters, starting with a rally in East Los Angeles with the punk-funk band Ozomatli on Saturday, then with a candidate forum on Latino issues at a California Democratic Party event, and ending with a town hall on immigration at the East Las Vegas Community Center. The 400-person town hall, packed with college students and young adults, highlighted how Sanders\u2019 support among Latinos is driven by ideologically motivated young people, who have dubbed him \u201cTio Bernie.\u201d Sanders talked extensively about his new immigration plan, which includes the abolishment of both ICE and Customs and Border Protection in their current forms, a moratorium on deportations and the reversal of Trump\u2019s travel ban and policy requiring asylum-seekers to apply from Mexico. \u201cWe will stop the demonization of undocumented people in this country,\u201d Sanders told the crowd, calling both Trump a \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cxenophobe.\u201d \u201cWe will not have agents of the federal government ripping tiny babies from the arms of their mothers.\u201d Sanders has more than 80 Latino staffers across the early states and his Washington, D.C., headquarters, and both his political director and California state directors are Latino. Rocha said the staff diversity helps the campaign understand the differences between communicating with Latinos in Iowa, who are frequently recent immigrants, and Chicanos with a long history of activism in Los Angeles. And he noted young Latino staff members, including DACA recipients, helped Sanders craft his immigration plan. Will Lizarraga, a sales manager, was typical of the crowd at the town hall. Wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo of progressive YouTube show The Young Turks, Lizarraga cited Sanders\u2019 long-term support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and other liberal policies. \u201cIt\u2019s his track record,\u201d Lizarraga said. \u201cEven when I was a little kid, he was fighting for me.\u201d Lizarraga, a U.S. permanent resident, is scheduled to get his citizenship sometime in February. He hopes to become a citizen in time to cast a ballot for Sanders at the Feb. 22 caucus. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who has endorsed Biden, gave a simple reason for backing the former vice president: He trusts him. Biden was the first candidate to meet with the CHC after launching his campaign, Correa said, and promised to \u201cput his back into\u201d passing comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cHe said \u2018Absolutely, I\u2019m your person. I\u2019m going to put my political capital into backing immigration reform,\u2019\u201d Correa recalled. Biden is counting on that trust, formed over a long political career, to help him with Latinos. In his appearances both at a town hall and at the Nevada Democratic Party\u2019s First In The West dinner, Biden began by mentioning his long history of campaigning in the state, dating back to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s first campaign for the Senate in 1986, and running up to his work to elect the Senate\u2019s first-ever Latina, Catherine Cortez Masto, in 2016. \u201cHe has a record of being a consensus-builder,\u201d said Correa, a moderate Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy who represents putting politics aside, who represents putting the partisan labels aside, who wants to get work done for the American people.\u201d But Biden\u2019s diverse coalition requires tending. While Sanders was able to spend virtually the whole weekend focused on Latino voters, Biden\u2019s town hall took place at a majority-Black elementary school, and he flew to rural Elko for a town hall on Sunday afternoon. At the town hall in Las Vegas, Biden presented his more mainstream vision for immigration policy, promising to \u201cimmediately\u201d reunite families at the border and work to protect DACA recipients and attacking Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m running to get rid of those Mexican rapists,\u2019\u201d Biden said at the town hall. \u201cThe words presidents speak matter.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, implicitly criticized Biden earlier in the weekend, saying at a Univision forum it was not necessary for the Obama administration to deport more than 3 million people. Of course, Sanders\u2019 own record on immigration isn\u2019t flawless: He opposed a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill because he objected to guest worker programs that he \u2014 and his labor unions \u2014 worried would create an underclass of workers.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Democrats are skeptical that their leading 2020 presidential candidates will be able to accomplish much of their stated agendas, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night. Just 41% of Democrats think former Vice President Joe Biden will be able to accomplish all or most of his policy goals, and the numbers are lower for other candidates: Only 33% say the same of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s agenda, while 30% of Democrats are confident in Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 ability to enact his political revolution and just 28% believe South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg can enact most of his plans. The lack of confidence comes as each of the three leading candidates doubles down on their own personal theories of how to enact the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda \u2015 and as each of those theories runs into stark challenges. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who wants to change Washington\u2019s internal rules to make progressive change easier, might not have support among Democrats to get rid of the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster threshold. Biden is continuing to tout his ability to work with Republicans amid widespread skepticism. And Sanders, a Vermont independent who is counting on popular support to pressure a Congress reluctant to embrace his ambitious policies, has seen support for his signature policy fall as the campaign advances. Meanwhile, Buttigieg \u2015 who trails the other three in national polling but is running strong in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 is still articulating how his plans to pass legislation would differ from unsuccessful tactics used by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found a plurality of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (43%) thought a reform approach, including weakening the power of lobbyists and corporations to influence policy, was the most effective way for Democrats to pass laws if they win the presidency in 2020. That approach, typically associated with Warren, was more popular than Biden\u2019s preferred method of finding common ground with Republicans. Thirty percent of Democrats supported a compromise approach. The least popular was Sanders\u2019 preferred method of enlisting ordinary people to pressure elected officials to support progressive goals. Only 12% supported this method. There are ideological differences: 51% of liberals preferred a reform approach, and just 25% want to find common ground with Republicans. Among moderates and conservatives, 44% prefer looking for common ground with Republicans, while 28% want to weaken lobbyists and corporations. There\u2019s also a significant age gap: Democrats older than 65 have a strong preference for working with Republicans. These divides were clear at a Warren rally Sunday in Las Vegas. The candidate ran through her ambitious agenda: a wealth tax on fortunes of more than $50 million, substantial investments in early childhood education, an elimination of student debt, a sweeping anti-corruption law. But audience members varied wildly in how much of her agenda they expected her to accomplish and whether her plan to win political victories was the best. Dylan Jaramillo, an electrical engineer who said he\u2019s likely to support businessman Andrew Yang in the primary, said he liked Yang\u2019s (and Biden\u2019s) emphasis on working with Republicans to get things done. \u201cJoe Biden is probably the most realistic one,\u201d he said, predicting Warren would achieve \u201cmaybe 30%\u201d of her goals. Jenna Wurtzberger, an adjunct professor, attended the rally with Byron McDonald, a delivery driver. Both supported Warren\u2019s push to get rid of the filibuster and thought Biden\u2019s hopes to work with Republicans were far-fetched. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk sense with Republicans at this point,\u201d Wurtzberger said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched enough of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d McDonald said in agreement. \u201cFor Biden, that seems a little pie in the sky.\u201d But McDonald still wasn\u2019t totally sold on voting for Warren. \u201cI support big ideas. But I worry not everyone likes big ideas as much as I do.\u201d Warren\u2019s pitch on how she would transform her famous plans into reality has shifted slightly. In her stump speech, she no longer mentions her work with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids. She also now spends more time invoking famous social movements of the past, suggesting a similar movement can push Congress to adopt her ambitious liberal agenda. And some of the roadblocks for Warren\u2019s theory have reappeared. Three Democratic senators \u2015 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2015 recently reiterated their opposition to ending the filibuster, which would force Warren to somehow court GOP support for her plans. (In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters were ambivalent about the filibuster: 29% said it was a good rule, 25% said it was a bad rule and 46% were unsure. Among Democrats, however, 27% said it was a good rule and 33% said it was bad.) Sanders and Biden, meanwhile, have stuck to their guns. Biden, who was widely mocked for predicting Republicans would have an \u201cepiphany\u201d after Trump\u2019s presidency, repeated the line at a fundraiser at K Street law firm in Washington, D.C. Sanders remains committed to a broad political revolution. The new entrant into the top-tier of the race, Buttigieg, has expressed elements of each theory of change put forward by the other leading candidates. Like Warren, he supports eliminating the filibuster. Like Biden, he emphasizes reuniting the country and working with Republicans. And like Sanders, he talks about applying public pressure on reluctant politicians. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right?,\u201d Buttigieg said at a town hall in Iowa earlier this month. \u201cI believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures.\u201d But when asked how his approach would differ from that of Obama, who saw his agenda curtailed significantly by both Republicans and intra-party opposition, Buttigieg struggled to answer. \u201cHe operated under the constraints of being the last Democrat of the Reagan era. And he also faced constraints of a Congress that was not acting in good faith,\u201d Buttigieg said during his bus tour in Iowa. \u201cAnd the part about Congress acting in bad faith has only gotten worse among Republicans.\u201d \u201cI think the dynamics of the country have become more favorable,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, just 12 years \u2015 I don\u2019t know what percent of the country is different over a 12-year period. But just 12 years\u2019 worth of people who have arrived and left. That means that this country has shifted \u2015 plus 12 years of experience as a country on what works and what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Ultimately, Buttigieg concluded, he would have a mandate if he won the election. \u201cYou look at how the New Deal came about, it\u2019s not that FDR promised something even bigger than the New Deal and then he got there and that was the compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a much more kind of dynamic set of things that happened. On health care, in modern times, you could look at the example of the [Affordable Care Act]. You could also look at the example of the Clinton health care reform agenda in the \u201990s. And the biggest lesson I draw is that if we\u2019re really explicit about what we want to do now, then you arrive in office with a mandate to do it.\u201d Daniel Marans and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " ATLANTA \u2015 Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a co-chair and top surrogate for Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, tore into South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg during a fundraiser for Sanders downtown on Tuesday. Turner, who is Black, did not name the 37-year-old Democratic presidential hopeful at the fundraiser, but it was clear whom she was referring to. In her speech, she criticized Buttigieg for not being able to \u201ctake care of the needs of Black folks in your own city\u201d let alone the entire country. Turner later told HuffPost that her comments about Buttigieg were made on her behalf and not the Sanders campaign. The 78-year-old Vermont senator has been reluctant to go after his fellow Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. Buttigieg, who is white, has struggled to win over the support of Black voters during his campaign. His handling of the fatal shooting of a Black man by a white South Bend police officer in June drew backlash from some members of the community. Following the shooting, Buttigieg canceled several campaign events to deal with the fallout at home. While he addressed a crowd of protesters who were calling for the officer to be fired, one woman shouted that Black people would never back him in the 2020 election. \u201cYou\u2019re running for president and you want Black people to vote for you? That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d the woman told him. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m not asking for your vote,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cI will promise that there will be a review to make sure that there is no racism on this department and that it will be independent.\u201d Some voters, like Turner, perceived the remark as \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201ccallous.\u201d \u201cWhen a Black woman says to you over the shooting of a Black man in your city ... \u2018I\u2019m not going to vote for you for president,\u2019 and you say to this Black woman, \u2018I didn\u2019t ask you for your vote,\u2019 I don\u2019t think you are in any position to be the president of the United States of America,\u201d Turner said Tuesday, drawing cheers and applause from the packed upstairs bar of Suite Food Lounge. Asked for comment about Buttigieg,\u00a0Briahna Joy Gray, the Sanders campaign\u2019s national press secretary, declined to comment. \u201cI think I\u2019ll let her words speak for her,\u201d Gray said. Speaking later to HuffPost, Turner said, \u201cIf that\u2019s how you handle a police shooting in your city, what\u2019s going to happen when you become president and there continues to be police shootings across the country on unarmed Black men and women? \u2018I didn\u2019t ask you for your vote\u2019? That\u2019s callous. ... I expect the mayor to know better.\u201d A spokesperson for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said Wednesday that Turner\u2019s comments mischaracterized the situation, noting that Buttigieg had been addressing protesters not as a presidential candidate but as a mayor trying to help the city heal. Turner also called out the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s disastrous rollout of his \u201cDouglass Plan,\u201d\u00a0named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to combat racial inequities and increase economic prosperity in Black communities. Several Black South Carolinians have said Buttigieg misleadingly touted their support for the plan, introduced in July,\u00a0in campaign materials put out last month. \u201cPeople have to stop taking the Black community for granted,\u201d Turner told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s the same scene with that list of supporters he has on the Douglass Plan. Come to find out, most of those supporters on there are white. Some of those supporters never said they supported the plan. The Black community deserves more respect than that.\u201d Turner was referencing an op-ed published last month in the HBCU Times purportedly written by more than 400 endorsees of the Douglass Plan. But several told The Intercept that they were surprised to see their names attached to the plan. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has said it sent the plan to supporters with a note asking them to opt out if they didn\u2019t want their names listed in the op-ed. The campaign has also said it never publicly suggested all of the supporters were Black. As The Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim noted in his reporting,\u00a0the email sent to supporters said the list was meant to represent\u00a0\u201cover 400 Black South Carolinians.\u201d Turner\u2019s remarks, made on the eve of the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, echo the concerns of many Black voters who are skeptical of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign. Black voters represent about 20%\u00a0of the Democratic base. Though polls show Buttigieg excelling nationally, his support among this key bloc of voters remains exceedingly low. A Monmouth University\u00a0poll\u00a0of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina released last month showed Buttigieg with just 1% support from African Americans. The same poll showed former Vice President Joe Biden with 39% Black voter support, followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 11%, Sanders with 11% and California Sen. Kamala Harris with 8%. Johnnie Cordero, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party\u2019s Black Caucus, was one of the \u201csupporters\u201d listed at the top of a press release about the Douglass Plan last month. He told The Intercept he has endorsed neither Buttigieg nor his plan. Aside from the dubious list of supporters, Cordero told the outlet that there are other major issues with Buttigieg\u2019s plan. \u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to think you can come up with a plan for Black America without hearing from Black folk,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in there that said Black folk had anything to do with the drafting of that plan.\u201d \u201cNow I like Pete, please don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll help him in any way I can. ... But you don\u2019t do that. Those days are over and done with. We\u2019re tired of people telling us what we need. You wanna find out what we need? Come and ask us.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s campaign told HuffPost that, in fact,\u00a0a number of Black leaders and activists helped develop the Douglass Plan, including Douglass\u2019 descendants. \u201cOur campaign is working to build a multi-racial coalition, and we sought and received input from numerous Black policy experts and advisers to create a comprehensive plan to dismantle systemic racism: the Douglass Plan,\u201d the campaign said in a statement to The Intercept last week. \u201cPete will continue to talk about the Douglass Plan wherever he goes, regardless of the audience, as there are many communities of Americans committed to eradicating racial inequity,\u201d the statement concluded. This story has been updated to include additional comment from Buttigieg\u2019s campaign. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly referenced poll numbers showing the combined first and second choices of Black voters in South Carolina as their first choice only. The numbers have been adjusted above.",

      "author": "Jonathan Cohn",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rhetorical journey on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d has been circuitous and, at times, painful for even some of her supporters to watch. Early on, the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential hopeful suggested she thought of Medicare for All in more aspirational terms. During a March\u00a0interview on Bloomberg television, she said her goal was \u201caffordable coverage for every American\u201d but that there are \u201cdifferent ways we can get there.\u201d It was a variation on a line she used two months earlier, during a CNN event: \u201cWhen we talk about Medicare for All, there are a lot of different pathways.\u201d Warren also declined for months to issue her own detailed proposal, telling questioners simply that \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d even though she was rolling out plans for just about every other issue. In just the last three weeks, that has changed, first when she unveiled a detailed plan to\u00a0finance\u00a0Medicare for All and then, late last week, when she proposed a two-step process for putting such a system in place. Step one would be a set of executive orders, along with new legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and create a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d open to anybody. The goal would be to make that happen within the first hundred days. Step two would be pursuit of comprehensive Medicare for All legislation that would make enrollment in the new government plan mandatory. Warren says that second step, the full vote, would not come until 2023. Many progressives have interpreted that as a retreat \u2015 and confirmation\u00a0Warren that lacks the conviction of Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who is also running for president and has been Medicare for All\u2019s loudest, most consistent advocate. Sanders responded to Warren\u2019s announcement by reiterating his commitment to introducing Medicare for All legislation in the first week of his presidency, suggesting those progressives may be right about which candidate is more committed to the concept. But does that mean Warren\u2019s approach is a less reliable way to help people pay for medical bills and, ultimately, to make health care a universal right? That is a lot less clear. The differences between Warren and Sanders are obvious to anybody who has watched them campaign. Medicare for All is dear to Sanders and a core part of his identity in a way that it simply hasn\u2019t been for Warren, whose passion has always been more with fighting corruption and regulating Wall Street. It is no coincidence that the first program she proposed in her presidential campaign was for a different kind of welfare state expansion, a universal child care\u00a0initiative, or that health care has generally gotten less attention in her stump speeches than countless other issues. Still, it is not as if Warren doesn\u2019t care about health care. The academic work that first brought her national attention and got her interested in politics focused on bankruptcy, a subject in which medical bills came up frequently. And her progressive bona fides are beyond reproach, or at least they should be. Since coming to the Senate, her voting record has consistently been on the very progressive edge, surpassing even Sanders, according to the site VoteView. When Warren finally decided to develop her own health care plan, according to recent reporting\u00a0in The New York Times, she turned to two of the country\u2019s best known Medicare for All advocates: Donald Berwick, who was chief administrator of Medicare and Medicaid during the Obama administration, and Steffie Woolhandler, who was co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. Those contacts say a lot about Warren\u2019s instincts on policy.\u00a0And the first step of her two-step proposal is designed to be a lot more ambitious than it might sound at first blush. Her proposed executive actions include threatening the patent rights of drug companies that won\u2019t lower the prices of expensive and essential drugs. Her proposed legislation would create a public option, open to anybody, that for a large swath of the population would cover medical care with zero out-of-pocket costs. The actual details of Warren\u2019s proposed legislation are something of a mishmash that would likely require substantial modification before Congress could take it up. As Jon Walker\u00a0put it\u00a0in The American Prospect, the proper way to think about her proposal is probably as a \u201cstatement ... on her legislative strategy, her priorities, and her view of what is possible.\u201d But that statement is precisely what many progressives are questioning. Enacting\u00a0any major health care bill would be difficult for a new Democratic president after the next election, given the inevitable opposition of industry groups and slim Senate majority Democrats would have even under the best circumstances. Warren\u2019s smartest progressive critics recognize this. Warren\u2019s error, according to the progressive critique, is in conceding policy ground upfront rather than laying out an ideal vision and bargaining back from there. \u201cIt may be necessary to accept half a loaf in the negotiation stage,\u201d The Week\u2019s Ryan Cooper wrote on Monday, \u201cbut\u00a0only\u00a0then, and only because moderates wouldn\u2019t accept anything better.\u201d It\u2019s a reasonable argument. As the saying goes, there\u2019s no point in compromising with yourself. But you can\u2019t compromise with anybody if you never get to the negotiating table in the first place.\u00a0And that is a real danger of promoting Medicare for All right away: that it will alienate voters Democratic candidates need in order to win in 2020. The prospect of eliminating private insurance spooks a lot of Americans, as polls have shown pretty consistently. The issue isn\u2019t so much that people love their existing coverage. It\u2019s that they\u2019re wary of an untested, hypothetical public insurance alternative, especially at a time when trust in the federal government is at historic lows. In October 1964, when Lyndon Johnson was running for president on a promise to enact the original Medicare program, 77% of Americans believed the government did the right thing all or most of the time, according to the National Election Survey. Since then, NES, Gallup and Pew Research have asked versions of that question repeatedly and the number has fallen dramatically. As of this March, it was down to 17%. Executive actions to lower drug prices and the creation of a successful, but voluntary public insurance program could help restore some of that lost faith in the federal government \u2015 or, at the very least, it could persuade people that giving up private coverage isn\u2019t so risky. That would likely make Medicare for All an easier political sell. Whether Sanders or Warren has the better of this argument about health care strategy is impossible to say. No Democratic candidate in recent memory has built a grassroots movement for specific legislation in the way Sanders has. It may be that such a focused, impassioned campaign on behalf of Medicare for All would persuade skeptical voters and overwhelm industry critics in a way that past reform efforts have not. It\u2019s also impossible to say whether Warren\u2019s position will protect her from charges that she would take away private insurance, given her past statements and promise to pursue full Medicare for All legislation in three years. It may be that the only way to avoid that political vulnerability is to steer clear\u00a0of any commitment to Medicare for All in the near future, as former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, have. And finally it is impossible to say how consequential a candidate\u2019s position on Medicare for All will ultimately prove in the general election. Other issues will be vying for attention and public perceptions about Medicare for All vary quite a lot depending on which arguments break though in the media. But while primary voters ponder these unknowables, and watch Wednesday night\u2019s debate, they might want to step back and consider how much the top 2020 Democratic contenders actually agree about health care. Each one has promised reforms that would offer more financial protection against medical bills, introduce some kind of new public insurance plan, and give the federal government more power to reduce the price of medical care. That\u2019s a pretty strong consensus for some pretty ambitious initiatives that could help a whole lot of people. The differences among the candidates are important, and a presidential nominating race is precisely the forum in which to argue about them. But eventually the primaries will end. At that point, the debate will be between a president trying to take health insurance away from tens of millions, through repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and one trying to carry on the Democratic Party\u2019s historic quest for universal coverage.\u00a0That surely is the choice that matters most.",

      "content": " Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) plans to propose a bill Thursday that would invest $1.2 trillion over the next decade in 12 million new, affordable rental units. The legislation, a draft of which HuffPost obtained, is arguably the most ambitious Green New Deal policy unveiled since the movement for a sweeping industrial plan to shrink climate-changing emissions and expand protections for the poor went mainstream a year ago. It\u2019s the marquee proposal in a wave of anticipated bills from a half dozen House Democrats seeking to make high-quality, affordable housing a central plank of the alternative political vision they hope to pitch ahead of the 2020 election. More U.S. households rent than at any point since 1965, according to Pew Research Center data that found a sharp increase following the foreclosure crisis that started a decade ago. Over 11 million Americans spend more than half their paychecks on rent, per research from the affordability advocacy group Home1 that Curbed cited. A National Low Income Housing Coalition survey last year concluded that a renter working 40 hours a week and earning the federal minimum wage could afford a two-bedroom apartment in exactly zero counties nationwide. It\u2019s not just an urban crisis. Homelessness has increased in rural states such as South Dakota, according to figures from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \u201cPeople make it sound like the people in the Midwest don\u2019t have the same problems as people in New York and California, and this is one issue that unites us all,\u201d Omar told HuffPost by phone Wednesday morning. \u201cWe are truly struggling.\u201d The bill comes a week after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released the so-called Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, a joint bill to spend, by one estimate, $172 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade the nation\u2019s 1.2 million federally-owned rental units with clean power, efficient appliances and plumbing that won\u2019t leach lead into water. Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) are expected to introduce more proposals in the months to come. Omar\u2019s bill, dubbed the Homes For All Act, goes further. Over a decadelong timeline, it outlines plans to build 9.5 million new units of public housing at the cost of about $800 billion. The legislation earmarks $200 billion for a federal Housing Trust Fund to build 2.5 million new affordable housing units available for low-income families. Another $200 billion would establish a Community Control and Anti-Displacement Fund at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide grants to local governments to combat the effects of gentrification. The combined $1 trillion, for context, equals out to about what the 2009 stimulus bill to keep the U.S. economy from sliding into a depression spent when adjusted for inflation. But the four-comma spending figure puts legislative meat on the bones of multi-trillion-dollar climate platforms Democratic presidential candidates ranging from progressives such as Sanders and Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\u00a0to centrists Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg have proposed. Real estate accounts for about 12% of planet-heating emissions in the United States, federal data shows, but the actual figure could be as high as 39%, according to the U.S. Green Building Council,\u00a0a nonprofit that promotes sustainable construction. Building new public housing \u201cdesigned built and operated to the highest possible environmental standards\u201d could seriously make a dent in those emissions, Omar said. It could also send market signals that compel private industry to follow suit. New York\u2019s public housing agency\u2019s request in the 1990s for energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, spurred a major shift toward energy saving in the appliance market,\u00a0according to a study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. As millions of Americans and refugees from overseas are displaced by extreme weather, sea-level rise and conflict over increasingly scarce freshwater, Omar said, clean, desirable public housing is key to resettling them. \u201cWhen I came to the United States, [homelessness] was the first thing \u2026 that was jarring to me and that I never really expected,\u201d said Omar, herself a Somali refugee who first arrived to New York from Kenya in 1995 and then eventually settled in Minneapolis. \u201cTo arrive and see people sleeping on the side of the street is something that has stayed with me.\u201d It would be shocking if the Homes For All Act became law in the next year. President Donald Trump, a Republican real estate developer with a history of housing discrimination, rejects the reality that emissions from buildings and vehicles are destabilizing the global climate. He would almost certainly veto the bill even if it passed the GOP-controlled Senate. The legislation is also likely to face strong opposition from centrist Democrats who, in some cases, voted for President Bill Clinton\u2019s welfare reform in the 1990s, when the party embraced fiscal conservatism to court a base of white, suburban voters. The effort put new restrictions on public services for the poor and all but ended investments in the federal housing projects that boomed half a century earlier under President Franklin Roosevelt, a fellow Democrat. That included passing the Faircloth Amendment, which barred the federal government from building new public housing after 1999 and severely limited the renovations the Department of Housing and Urban Development can fund. Since then, federal authorities have demolished about 250,000 units and left much of the existing public housing stock in squalor. The bill would repeal the Faircloth Amendment and require Congress to fully fund public housing operations in the federal budget the same way it does Medicare and Social Security. That could, if enacted, reverse a decline in public housing and federal housing vouchers from 45 units per 1,000 American households in 1993 to 35 units per 1,000 American households today, said Yonah Freemark, a housing policy expert and doctoral student in city planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThat decline is indicative of a failure of the federal government to keep up with population growth and a failure to maintain what\u2019s there,\u201d he said. He dismissed critics who say public housing agencies are hotbeds of corruption. \u201cSure, there are examples of poor performance in public agencies, but there are also examples of slumlords.\u201d The bill has no co-sponsors yet. But it\u2019s likely to gain support from progressive allies who back the Green New Deal movement to restore the last century\u2019s federal safety net and update it to address the climate crisis. Omar said she plans to appeal to her more moderate colleagues to \u201crewrite their legacies\u201d and correct for the injustices that came from Democrats\u2019 rightward shift nearly three decades ago. She compared the dynamic to criminal justice reform, invoking the Democrats and Republicans who supported draconian laws in the 1990s that punished millions of mostly minority men for nonviolent offenses and who are now considering ways to reverse the trend. \u201cThis is their opportunity to make amends,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t have the foresight of the harm some of the policies we propose could have. They are now presented with some of those harms that they\u2019ve caused and they get to fix it.\u201d That\u2019s a political message that could buoy Democrats in critical swing states Trump won in 2016. Michigan, for example, is slated to face a shortfall of more than 150,000 affordable units by 2045, the state housing agency forecast in April.\u00a0That forecast comes two years after the Home Builders Association of Michigan issued a \u201cwake-up call\u201d over the looming housing crisis. \u201cEven in rural communities, this is a serious challenge,\u201d said Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive who came in second in last year\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary in Michigan. \u201cPeople are realizing the gig they\u2019re working in an economy where there\u2019s an underemployment epidemic don\u2019t allow them to put a roof over their heads.\u201d Homes for All Act by Alexander Kaufman on Scribd",

      "content": " Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Wednesday during the Democratic primary debate that they would not necessarily reject Democrats who have anti-abortion views, while reaffirming they strongly believe in the need for reproductive justice. Moderator Rachel Maddow asked the two presidential hopefuls if there is room in the Democratic Party for recently reelected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who in May signed a bill banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy \u2015 one of the strictest such laws in the country. Warren and Sanders emphasized that they support access to abortion. But neither senator definitively said they would not support a Democrat who didn\u2019t share their views. Warren responded by saying abortion access is important, and she called it both a human right and an economic right. \u201cProtecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party,\u201d she said. Maddow nudged Warren to answer the question. The senator didn\u2019t offer a direct response, saying instead that it\u2019s not on her to dictate who is or is not in the party. \u201cI have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I\u2019m not here to build fences.\u201d Sanders said he believes men have to stand up and support abortion access. He also called out the GOP for being the party of small government \u2015 except where reproductive health care is concerned. \u201cIt is women who control their own bodies, not politicians,\u201d he said. Although Sanders has always supported abortion rights, he faced criticism from some reproductive justice advocates in 2017 after throwing his support behind anti-abortion Democrat Heath Mello, who was running to be mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. \u201c[Supporting] a candidate for office who will strip women \u2015 one of the most critical constituencies for the party \u2015 of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of advocacy group NARAL Pro Choice America, said at the time. Sanders and Warren aren\u2019t the only candidates who have spoken up about the party\u2019s divide over abortion. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a big tent party,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0told HuffPost in May.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell [national Democratic organizations] what to do. What I know is that my responsibility as a candidate is to stand up for women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d",

      "content": " South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign organizers are forming a union, joining the campaigns of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in doing so. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign still needs to reach a contract agreement with the workers, who are joining the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2321, which is based in North Andover, Massachusetts.\u00a0The union will only represent campaign staff with the title of \u201corganizer.\u201d The agreement means three of the four leading Democratic presidential campaigns are now unionized. Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is not. Campaign unions began forming in earnest during the 2018 midterm elections, as the often-young workers who serve as field organizers looked for ways to secure better pay and benefits and more stable working hours. \u201cWe are proud to work for a candidate who has proposed a bold economic agenda that would restore workers\u2019 rights, expand collective bargaining rights, and make it easier for workers to unionize,\u201d Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we would live our values and support our staff if they wanted to form a union and today, we are proud to keep that commitment.\u201d In a statement, the leaders of the Buttigieg campaign union said they hoped their work to create a dialogue between campaign staffers would \u201cbenefit everyone; not only on this particular campaign, but for future campaigns and for individuals who seek to join the profession.\u201d \u201cWe believe in Pete and look forward to an America where all workers have the right to unionize without interference and to collectively bargain for fair pay and benefits,\u201d the organizers wrote. \u201cBecause we believe, as Pete does, in unions for all, we have chosen to unionize with IBEW Local 2321.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what exact benefits and guarantees Buttigieg campaign staffers will be able to secure. The Sanders\u2019 campaign contract, for instance, includes a $15 minimum wage and a guarantee of four days off a month. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign notified employees about the union\u2019s formation in an email earlier this afternoon.",
