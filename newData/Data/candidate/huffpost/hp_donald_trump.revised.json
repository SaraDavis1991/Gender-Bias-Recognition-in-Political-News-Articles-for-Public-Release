      "content": " Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Sunday accused the whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine of weakening the United States\u2019 relationship with the Eastern European country. The whistleblower,\u00a0reportedly a CIA analyst formerly detailed to the White House, has alleged that Trump used military aid as leverage in his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. His complaint is the subject of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry into the president. But Johnson, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blamed the whistleblower \u2015 not Trump and his alleged pressure campaign \u2015 for any strain on U.S.-Ukraine relations during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cOne thing that I want to point out is the damage that\u2019s being done to our country through this entire impeachment process,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s going to be very difficult for future presidents to have a candid conversation with a world leader because now we\u2019ve set the precedent of leaking transcripts,\u201d he added. The comment appeared to be a criticism of the whistleblower and his sources, though the White House is the only party that has published a summary, which Trump has incorrectly referred to as a \u201ctranscript,\u201d of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cBy the way, those individuals that leaked this, if their interest was a stronger relationship with Ukraine, they didn\u2019t accomplish it,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cHaving this all come out into public has weakened that relationship \u2015 has exposed things that didn\u2019t need to be exposed.\u201d Johnson told CNN earlier this month that he, along with several of Trump\u2019s advisers, had to persuade the president to release the congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine. Trump eventually did so after the White House was made aware of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. But the Republican senator suggested Sunday that exposing Trump\u2019s actions is bad for America and should have been dealt with privately. \u201cThis would have been far better off if we had just taken care of this behind the scenes,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMost people wanted to support Ukraine that were trying to convince President Trump \u2015 and so the whole. ... Listen, if the whistleblower\u2019s goal was to improve our relationship with Ukraine he utterly \u2015 or she utterly \u2015 failed.\u201d Johnson has said he called Trump in late August to inquire about the delayed U.S. aid to Ukraine and that the president told him he had concerns about the country\u2019s issues with corruption. He also wanted European countries to increase their financial assistance to Ukraine, according to Johnson. On Sunday, Johnson told NBC that Trump had denied \u201cany kind of arrangement that Ukraine had to do something before he released that funding\u201d during their August phone call. Johnson said he received a letter Saturday from Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Devin Nunes of California, two Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, asking him to \u201clay out\u201d what he knows about the delayed military aid. He said he won\u2019t be called to testify, but will respond to his colleagues\u2019 letter with his account of what happened. This story has been updated with additional comments from Johnson.",

Pelosi, during an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that aired Sunday, discussed the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry that focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s really a sad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did. But at some point, Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue.\u201d Faced with impeachment and the near certainty that the Senate would vote to remove him from office, Nixon resigned in August 1974. Trump has described his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the focal point of a subsequent whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry, as a \u201cperfect conversation.\u201d He has dismissed the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Several State Department officials have testified that Trump used military aid as leverage in his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden. Pelosi told CBS that \u201cof course\u201d there\u2019s a connection between the whistleblower filing his complaint and Trump eventually releasing the congressionally approved aid. She said Trump has \u201cevery opportunity to make his case\u201d before House impeachment investigators, including testifying before the House Intelligence Committee or answering questions in writing. Trump on Monday said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d Pelosi\u2019s suggestion that he testify. \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d the president tweeted. Pelosi\u2019s comments followed the first week of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry that included testimonies from acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from that position by Trump in May. Asked if Democrats had a good week, Pelosi responded that \u201cthe American people have had a good week.\u201d \u201cI think truth has had a good week,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think patriotism has had a good week. And I think the Constitution has had a good week. I don\u2019t think the president has had a good week.\u201d This article has been updated to include Trump\u2019s tweet.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump responded to North Korea after its state-run news agency attacked former Vice President Joe Biden as a \u201crabid dog\u201d who should \u201cbe beaten to death with a stick.\u201d In a Sunday morning tweet addressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump expressed mild disapproval of the verbal assault, stating, \u201cBiden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a \u2018rabid dog.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be,\u201d the president said, ending his message by encouraging Kim to \u201cget the deal done\u201d on denuclearization. Virtually no progress has been made on the issue. On Thursday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency threatened the Democratic presidential candidate after he criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy and called Kim a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d \u201cAnyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea], can never spare the DPRK\u2019s merciless punishment whoever and wherever,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd he will be made to see even in a grave what horrible consequences will be brought about by his thoughtless utterances.\u201d The agency continued, \u201cRabid dogs like Biden can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,\u201d adding that the former vice president\u2019s demise would \u201cbe beneficial for the U.S. also.\u201d Hitting back at the remarks, Biden\u2019s campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates\u00a0told The Associated Press that it was a sign of Kim\u2019s fear of the 2020 hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and \u2018love\u2019 them, find Joe Biden threatening,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests and values at the heart of our foreign policy.\u201d Unlike North Korea\u2019s treatment of Biden, its regime has praised Trump, including after the ouster of former national security adviser John Bolton. Following Bolton\u2019s departure in September, Kim Myong Gil, North Korea\u2019s chief negotiator for denuclearization talks, reportedly applauded Trump\u2019s \u201cmore practical point of view\u201d in pushing out the \u201ctroublemaker who used to face everything out of his anachronistic way of thinking.\u201d Trump has also spoken highly of Kim in the past, referring to the dictator as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d whose country has \u201ca tremendous future.\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Sunday retweeted a message from his son Eric touting the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The double promotion with White House clout occurred at the same time that the Trump family is slamming Hunter Biden for allegedly profiting from father Joe Biden\u2019s role as vice president by serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The retweet infuriated Walter Shaub, former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics for former President Barack Obama and Trump. \u201cDefinitely not trying to profit off the presidency at all,\u201d Shaub noted sarcastically. Unlike previous presidents, Trump has not divested from his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest. His business operations are in a revocable\u00a0trust \u2014 from which he can withdraw money whenever he wants. The Washington hotel has been the target of lawsuits charging that it violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bans federal officeholders from accepting gifts or cash from foreign interests. The clause is intended to guard against undue influence by foreign interests on American officials. Foreign governments, officials and lobbyists frequently pay for rooms and facilities at the hotel. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky made it point earlier this year to tell Trump that he stayed at another of the president\u2019s hotels, in New York. The Trump Organization is considering selling the lease on the Washington hotel, which is owned by the federal government. As part of a sales pitch for the operation, investors have been told they can make millions from foreign governments, CNN reported. Trump has come under increasing criticism for steering business to his enterprises from the White House, often at taxpayer expense. Vice President Mike Pence in September went out of his way at extra expense to stay at Trump\u2019s golf resort in Doonbeg as part of a trip to Ireland to meet with the nation\u2019s prime minister \u2014 in Dublin. Trump decided to stage the Group of Seven summit next summer at his Doral golf resort in Florida until he backed down amid a storm of bipartisan criticism.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited President Donald Trump to testify in front of investigators in the House impeachment inquiry ahead of a week that will see several key witnesses appear publicly. Pushing back against accusations from the president that the process has been stacked against him, Pelosi said Trump is welcome to appear or answer questions in writing, if he chooses. \u201cIf he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,\u201d she said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Trump \u201ccould come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,\u201d she said. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that suggestion. \u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s hearing, doesn\u2019t like what he\u2019s hearing, he shouldn\u2019t tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath,\u201d Schumer told reporters. He said the White House\u2019s insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating begs the question: \u201cWhat is he hiding?\u201d Trump on Monday said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d Pelosi\u2019s suggestion that he testify. \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d the president tweeted. The comments come as the House Intelligence Committee prepares for a second week of public hearings as part of its inquiry, including with the man who is arguably the most important witness. Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, is the only person interviewed to date who had conversations directly with the president because the White House has blocked others from cooperating with what they dismiss as a sham investigation. And testimony suggests he was intimately involved in discussions that are at the heart of the investigation into whether Trump held up U.S. military aid to Ukraine to try to pressure the county\u2019s president to announce an investigation into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 candidate, and his son, Hunter. Multiple witnesses overheard a phone call in which Trump and Sondland reportedly discussed efforts to push for the investigations. In private testimony to impeachment investigators made public Saturday, Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide and longtime Republican defense hawk, said Sondland told him he was discussing Ukraine matters directly with Trump. Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 \u2014 the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released. And he recounted that Sondland told a top Ukrainian official in a meeting that the vital U.S. military assistance might be freed up if the country\u2019s top prosecutor \u201cwould go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.\u201d Burisma is the gas company that hired Hunter Biden. Morrison\u2019s testimony contradicted much of what Sondland told congressional investigators during his own closed-door deposition, which the ambassador later amended. Trump has said he has no recollection of the overheard call and has suggested he barely knew Sondland, a wealthy donor to his 2016 campaign. But Democrats are hoping he sheds new light on the discussions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to prejudge his testimony,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d But he suggested, \u201cit was not lost on Ambassador Sondland what happened to the president\u2019s close associate Roger Stone for lying to Congress, to Michael Cohen for lying to Congress. My guess is that Ambassador Sondland is going to do his level best to tell the truth, because otherwise he may have a very unpleasant legal future in front of him.\u201d The committee will also be interviewing a long list of others. On Tuesday, they\u2019ll hear from Morrison along with Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs at the National Security Council, and Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine. On Wednesday the committee will hear from Sondland in addition to Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, and David Hale, a State Department official. And on Thursday, Fiona Hill, a former top NSC staffer for Europe and Russia, will appear. Trump, meanwhile, continued to tweet and retweet a steady stream of commentary from supporters as he bashed \u201cThe Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats\u201d for \u201cturning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon.\u201d \u201cThat is very bad for our Country, and not what the Founders had in mind!!!!\u201d he wrote. He also tweeted a doctored video exchange between Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, in which Schiff said he did not know the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry. The clip has been altered to show Schiff wearing a referee\u2019s uniform and loudly blowing a whistle. In her CBS interview, Pelosi vowed to protect the whistleblower, whom Trump has said should be forced to come forward despite longstanding whistleblower protections. \u201cI will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower,\u201d Pelosi said. Trump has been under fire for his treatment of one of the witnesses, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump criticized by tweet as she was testifying last week. That attack prompted accusations of witness intimidation from Democrats and even some criticism from Republicans, who have been largely united in their defense of Trump \u201cI think, along with most people, I find the president\u2019s tweet generally unfortunate,\u201d said Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Still, he insisted that tweets were \u201ccertainly not impeachable and it\u2019s certainly not criminal. And it\u2019s certainly not witness intimidation,\u201d even if Yovanovitch said she felt intimidated by the attacks. Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said Trump \u201ccommunicates in ways that sometimes I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d but dismissed the significance of the attacks. \u201cIf your basis for impeachment is going to include a tweet, that shows how weak the evidence for that impeachment is,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d And the backlash didn\u2019t stop Trump from lashing out at yet another witness, this time Pence aide Williams. He directed her in a Sunday tweet to \u201cmeet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d __ Associated Press writer Hope Yen and HuffPost reporter Hayley Miller contributed to this report.",

Asked by Stelter if he considered McConnell part of the cult, Rather said: \u201cThe short answer is yes.\u201d Rather said the question lawmakers have to decide for impeachment is if Trump tried to \u201cbribe\u201d a foreign government with military aid to investigate a political rival, and if he tried to \u201cintimidate witnesses.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019d say history is closing in on him, facts are closing in\u201d on Trump. But Rather said he doubts the Senate will hold a \u201creal\u201d impeachment trial. The cult concept appears to part a growing narrative about the president\u2019s pull on the Republican Party and his supporters.

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed the new round of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to help struggling farmers survive his trade war with China. But his praise follows a troubling report that the trade aid \u2014 a total over two years of $28 billion \u2014 is being disproportionately doled out\u00a0to farmers in Trump-supporting Southern states, and being paid to the largest, wealthiest farms and foreign corporations. The Department of Agriculture said Friday it will begin making the second round of this year\u2019s $16 billion in trade aid payments to farmers this week. The aid is not being paid \u201ccompliments of China tariffs,\u201d as Trump tweeted, but by the\u00a0Market Facilitation Program\u00a0funded by U.S. taxpayers. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods are paid by American companies that import the products and typically pass on costs to U.S. consumers. Nor has China started to \u201cbuy big again,\u201d as Trump claimed. Though China purchased 50 million bushels of soy from American farmers in October, the American Farm Bureau Federation said it was still 76% below purchase levels before Trump launched his trade war. Also, smaller farmers will unlikely be the \u201cbig beneficiaries\u201d of the aid, as Trump tweeted, because aid is flowing to the\u00a0largest and most successful farmers rather than aiding struggling operations, according to a study in August by the Environmental Working Group.\u00a0More than half of the farm bailouts from January 2018 to April 2019 went to just one-tenth of the recipients in the program,\u00a0according to the\u00a0study. The top 1% of farmers were paid an average of $183,000, while the bottom 80% averaged less than $5,000. Trump\u2019s praise for the aid follows by just days another critical report by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, saying the aid package \u201ctreats farmers unfairly.\u201d Figures show that 95% of top payment rates are going to farmers in the South, even though they have been less affected by the trade war with China, and that significant payments have been made to wealthy farmers and foreign corporations, the report noted. Five Southern states receive the highest payments per acre under the program \u2014 Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Arkansas. All voted for Trump, all but Georgia voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0for him. The analysis determined that farmers in the Midwest and Northern Plains have been hurt the most by the trade war. The report accused the Agriculture Department of doing nothing to direct aid to struggling small and medium farms, and farmers just starting out. Instead, the agency doubled payment limits, directing even more money to large, wealthy farming partnerships. The report also lashed the aid program for making commodity purchases from foreign-owned agricultural conglomerates, including $90 million paid to a subsidiary of Brazilian-owned JBS SA. Meanwhile, farm fortunes continue to stumble. The Farm Bureau reported last month that farm bankruptcies were up 24%, with more on the way. In other data released last week, farm income fell in the third quarter from a year ago in each of the seven rural heartland states covered by the Kansas City Fed.",

      "content": " A talk show host from a conservative radio station in Denver says he was fired midway through his weekly broadcast after criticizing both President Donald Trump and the way station employees had covered the impeachment inquiry. Craig Silverman, a former chief deputy district attorney in Denver, said he was discussing Trump and the president\u2019s criminally indicted associates on 710 KNUS on Saturday when he was abruptly taken off the air. \u201cIt was pretty startling,\u201d Silverman said on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWhile I\u2019m talking about the association of Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Roy Cohn, right as I was making my points about that, the show went dark, the program director came in and said, \u2018You\u2019re done.\u2019\u201d Silverman said the decision followed him criticizing his conservative colleagues for not discussing the ongoing impeachment hearings, which on Friday featured testimony from former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. \u201cMarie Yovanovitch, she inspired me. She was an outstanding witness, but if nobody on radio talks about it, how are the American people going to understand?\u201d he asked. 710 KNUS, which is owned by the conservative-leaning Salem Media Group, did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. In an email to CNN Business\ufeff,\u00a0Brian Taylor, KNUS vice president and general manager, denied that Silverman\u2019s show was taken off the air because of his impeachment coverage. He instead said that it was because Silverman mentioned a recent appearance on a competing station, which Silverman had been told not to speak on. \u201cWe asked Craig to avoid appearing there, since we consider him an important part of KNUS,\u201d Taylor said in the email. \u201cThe notion that he was relieved of his program because he criticized President Trump is absolutely untrue. We have never told Mr. Silverman the position to take on Trump and impeachment.\u201d Silverman, who off the air works as a trial attorney, has said he is an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d for the station. Silverman, who has identified himself as an independent who voted for Trump, posted on Twitter after his alleged firing to say that he won\u2019t let censoring stop him and will continue to \u201ccall things as I see them.\u201d \u201cI see corruption and blatant dishonesty by [Trump] and his cronies. I also see bullying/smearing of American heroes w/ courage to take (an) oath and tell truth,\u201d he tweeted. Silverman said he is confident he\u2019ll find another forum to continue his talk show. This story has been updated with a response from a KNUS representative.",

      "content": " Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet attacking former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as she testified before Congress on Friday was \u201cgenerally unfortunate\u201d but did not amount to witness intimidation. In his tweet, Trump claimed everywhere Yovanovitch went \u201cturned bad.\u201d\u00a0House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) read Yovanovitch the tweet during the hearing Friday \u2015 minutes after it was sent \u2015 and asked for her reaction. She responded that Trump\u2019s comments were\u00a0\u201cvery intimidating.\u201d But Turner, a member of House Intelligence Committee, appeared to shrug off the president\u2019s timely tweet during an appearance Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cDoes it concern you at all that a witness found what President Trump tweeted to be intimidating?\u201d host Jake Tapper asked Turner. \u201cI think along with most people I find Trump\u2019s tweet generally unfortunate,\u201d the Republican congressman responded before attacking Schiff and accusing him of being \u201cobsessed with impeachment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of laughable that in the middle of the hearing [Schiff] reads a witness a tweet that she\u2019s, up to that point, unaware of and then says, \u2018Shazam! Eureka! I have another reason to impeach the president,\u2019\u201d Turner continued. Tapper pressed him again: \u201cI get you don\u2019t like Congressman Schiff, but you do find it concerning that a witness in real time found the president\u2019s tweet to be ...\u00a0 intimidating?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not impeachable,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not criminal. And it\u2019s certainly not witness intimidation. It certainly wasn\u2019t trying to prevent her \u2015 or wouldn\u2019t have prevented her \u2015 from testifying. She was actually in the process of testifying.\u201d But Tapper continued to grill him, asking how the tweet doesn\u2019t amount to witness intimidation if Yovanovitch herself said she felt intimidated by it. \u201cClearly, she testified completely and fully. ... She was in no means intimidated and prevented from testifying,\u201d Turner claimed, prompting Tapper to note that he\u2019s \u201cnot a mind reader\u201d and has no idea whether Trump\u2019s tweet caused her to hold back during her testimony. Though Republicans have largely defended Trump\u2019s comments, his tweet drew significant backlash from Democrats and some members of the GOP. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday, during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d that the House may want to consider the tweet as an article of impeachment. Though Trump abruptly recalled Yovanovitch from her position as ambassador in May, Murphy said,\u00a0she continues to work in the State Department. \u201cThe president is basically telling her during her testimony is that there may be consequences to you and your family and your paycheck if you don\u2019t shut up,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd the message that\u2019s being sent to everybody else who\u2019s thinking about testifying is chilling as well.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is probing whether President Donald Trump\u00a0lied\u00a0in his written testimony submitted to then-U.S. Special Counsel Robert\u00a0Mueller\u00a0as part of the completed federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, CNN said on Monday. A House lawyer told a federal appeals court in Washington on Monday that lawmakers were examining whether Trump\u2019s written answers to federal investigators were untruthful, CNN reported. A spokeswoman for the House Judiciary Committee had no immediate comment. Mueller\u00a0submitted a report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr in March after completing a 22-month investigation that detailed Russia\u2019s campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy in the 2016 election as well as extensive contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow. House lawyers disclosed the investigation into Trump\u2019s written responses in September, saying in a court filing that materials from the\u00a0Mueller\u00a0report could show Trump was not honest about his knowledge of his campaign\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks, which published emails hacked from the Democratic Party. The redacted\u00a0Mueller\u00a0report materials \u201chave direct bearing on whether the president was untruthful, and further obstructed the special counsel\u2019s investigation, when in providing written responses to the special counsel\u2019s questions he denied being aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks,\u201d the House lawyers said in the filing. Last week, Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, suggested in testimony during a jury trial in a criminal case that Trump talked to longtime adviser Roger Stone about WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Gates testified that after finishing a July 2016 call from Stone, Trump indicated that \u201cmore information would be coming,\u201d in an apparent reference to WikiLeaks. Gates\u2019 testimony appeared to conflict with sworn written statements that Trump gave\u00a0Mueller. In Trump\u2019s written responses to\u00a0Mueller, he said he could not recall discussing WikiLeaks with Stone. \u201cI do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.\u201d (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

      "content": " President Donald Trump lambasted Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace on Sunday hours after the veteran journalist subjected Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) to a thorny line of questioning about the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry. The president tweeted that Scalise, one of his loudest cheerleaders in Congress, \u201cblew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace ... away\u201d during his appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThis kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past,\u201d Trump wrote, adding that Wallace \u201cwill never be his father,\u201d the late journalist Mike Wallace. HuffPost reached out to Fox News and Scalise\u2019s office for comment. Neither immediately responded. Though Fox News is often a safe space for Trump, featuring largely friendly coverage of his presidency, he has previously lashed out at a few network employees who have at times been critical of his actions. Last month, he tweeted that someone should explain to Wallace that his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the focal point of a subsequent whistleblower complaint and the ongoing impeachment inquiry, was a \u201cgood one.\u201d He repeatedly attacked anchor Shepard Smith, calling him \u201chopeless\u201d and \u201ctotally biased\u201d before Smith abruptly left the network last month. Trump\u2019s latest criticism of Wallace came hours after the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host interviewed Scalise. During the exchange, Wallace called out Scalise for \u201cvery badly\u201d mischaracterizing some of the impeachment inquiry witnesses\u2019 testimonies. \u201cUltimately, President Trump and President Zelensky were the ones on the call,\u201d Scalise told Wallace. \u201cBoth of them said there was nothing wrong. The foreign minister of Ukraine just came out a few days ago to clear some of this up to say there was never a link between money \u2015\u201d Wallace interrupted to point out that the Ukrainian foreign minister hadn\u2019t been on the call. Scalise has repeatedly tried to dismiss impeachment inquiry witnesses for having only secondhand information about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. \u201cIf [U.S. Ambassador to the European Union] Gordon Sondland says the president told him, \u2018Condition aid to Ukraine on investigating the Bidens,\u2019 are you going to say that he\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s he\u2019s lying?\u201d Wallace asked. Sondland, who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee before the president appointed him as ambassador, is scheduled to publicly testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. He initially testified behind closed doors that he wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to get Ukraine to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He later amended his testimony to say that he knew about it. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve been asking and others have been asking hypothetical questions \u2015 let\u2019s talk in reality,\u201d Scalise said, adding that \u201cnot one\u201d of the State Department officials who testified before Congress last week as part of the impeachment inquiry said they saw Trump commit an impeachable offense. But Wallace interrupted again to scold Scalise for misrepresenting their testimonies. \u201cSir, with all due respect, that very badly mischaracterizes what they said,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWilliam Taylor, for instance, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was asked whether or not these were impeachable offenses. He said, \u2018I\u2019m there as a fact witness. I\u2019m not there to pass judgment.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut he made it clear about what he thought the president was doing,\u201d Wallace continued. \u201cHe said withholding military aid to help with the president\u2019s political campaign was crazy.\u201d Scalise shrugged off Taylor\u2019s claim: \u201cThe problem with that is it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",

Asked if he would like to say anything to Trump, Lorance stared directly into the camera and said, \u201cI love you, sir.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re awesome,\u201d he continued. \u201cI wish you had a better team around you. You need more people watching your back, and I think you don\u2019t have a lot of that.\u201d Many Democrats have condemned Trump\u2019s decision to pardon the men, stating that it could put U.S. troops\u2019 lives at risk and jeopardize justice. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race and a Navy veteran, said Trump had \u201cdishonored our armed services\u201d by issuing the pardons. Lorance dismissed Democrats\u2019 criticism, claiming that senior Pentagon officials \u201cthrew me under the bus.\u201d He said that he\u2019s \u201cactually proud of everything that happened to me.\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged Trump not to intervene in the military justice system by dismissing charges or changing the sentences of service members accused of war crimes, CNN reported. On Monday, Lorance said Trump told him on the phone last week that the pardons would make \u201ca lot of people irritated\u201d but that he didn\u2019t care. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want in my commander in chief,\u201d Lorance said on Fox News. \u201cThe military justice system is completely broken.\u201d Before being pardoned, Golsteyn was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker. Gallagher had been acquitted of murdering a teenage prisoner of war in Iraq, but he was found guilty of posing for photos with the body and demoted for that. Trump restored his promotion. Hegseth, an Army veteran himself, reportedly played a major role in securing pardons for Lorance,\u00a0Golsteyn and Gallagher. \u201cThis has been a group fight,\u201d Hegseth told Lorance toward the end of Monday\u2019s interview. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful you spent your first opportunity here at \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019\u201d Earhardt said Lorance\u2019s story \u201cmakes you want to cry.\u201d \u201cIt does,\u201d Doocy added.

On one hand, Cuomo noted, they\u2019re dismissing any evidence that doesn\u2019t come from a first-hand witness to Trump\u2019s behavior in the White House. On the other, they\u2019re supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to block any witness with first-hand info from testifying, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton\u00a0and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cIf everything is so perfect, then why hide the key players?\u201d Cuomo said on CNN on Tuesday night. \u201cIf the Republicans are so desperate for first-hand knowledge \u2015 so frustrated that people can\u2019t give them the straight truth \u2015 then why don\u2019t they ask for the main players?\u201d He called out the GOP for trying to expose the whistleblower, but not \u201cthe people at the top of the food chain.\u201d \u201cYou want first-hand info, but you don\u2019t want to question Bolton.

All of them are defying subpoenas for either documents or testimony at the White House\u2019s direction. Why?\u201d He said Republicans are trying to deceive the public about the process instead of working to get the information they claim they want: Think about how pathetic it is to watch these men and women pick apart the inches of insight that these men and women who\u2019ve testified so far have about the decisions that others have made, instructions others gave them, and yet leave yards of truth untouched.

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Explosive testimony from a hotelier who turned a $1 million inaugural donation into a glamorous ambassadorship has largely left the White House with a single defense of President Donald Trump: that coercing foreign leaders into investigating a political rival is completely legal and not at all impeachable. Trump, his White House staff and his allies have for weeks been pointing to a Sept. 9 text message from Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, to his State Department colleagues, describing a phone conversation he\u2019d had with Trump: \u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d But in an impeachment hearing Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Sondland testified that not only was there a quid pro quo with Ukraine, but virtually every top official in the Trump administration was well aware of it. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously \u2026 the answer is yes,\u201d Sondland said in his opening statement, which heavily revised what he had told lawmakers in closed-door testimony on Oct. 17. \u201cEveryone was in the loop. It was no secret.\u201d Sondland\u2019s appearance Wednesday also confirmed testimony by several other witnesses that $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine was being blocked by the White House until the new Ukrainian president announced investigations into two matters: alleged corruption by the Democrat Trump most feared in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory falsely claiming that Russia had not helped Trump win the 2016 election but that Ukrainian officials had planted false evidence implicating Russia. All this material will likely make it more difficult for Trump\u2019s defenders in the Senate, should there eventually be a trial on impeachment charges, to argue that Trump did not withhold official benefits to Ukraine in return for politically useful favors to himself, former prosecutors said. \u201cHis best remaining argument is that what he did was wrongful but should not result in his removal from office,\u201d said Renato Mariotti, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago. The White House has struggled to settle on a coherent defense of Trump\u2019s actions, at first arguing that the impeachment process itself was flawed and therefore unfair to Trump. Then, the main thrust became that Trump has a legitimate interest in ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money is not wasted in countries with rampant corruption \u2015 but that was undermined by the lack of any record of Trump criticizing corruption in instances other than the allegations about Biden\u2019s son\u2019s work with a Ukrainian natural gas company. This could leave the White House pushing the most basic argument: that Trump as president has broad authority to set foreign policy, even if it benefits him personally. This argument has been made by outside White House allies as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe president can meet with whoever he wants to meet for good reason or no reason at all,\u201d said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. One White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Trump has been denied the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept as compelling evidence testimony from any witness we haven\u2019t been able to cross-examine. The president has been denied all levels of due process,\u201d the official said. On Wednesday, despite all the witness testimony to the contrary, Trump personally continued repeating his claim that he did not try to coerce Ukraine to help him damage Biden. He read from handwritten notes before boarding a helicopter, repeating what he said he\u2019d told Sondland in a September phone call: \u201c\u2018I want nothing.\u00a0I want nothing.\u00a0I want no quid pro quo.\u00a0Tell Zelensky\u2019 \u2015 President Zelensky \u2015 \u2018to do the right thing.\u2019 So here\u2019s my answer: \u2018I want nothing.\u00a0I want nothing.\u00a0I want no quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d Republicans in the impeachment hearing, meanwhile, continued to make a separate argument \u2015 that the entire question is moot because the aid was ultimately delivered. \u201cThe fact is the aid was given to Ukraine without any announcement of new investigations,\u201d said Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. \u201cThey got the money, they got the money. God bless America, it all worked out, right?\u201d added Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said their argument made no sense, given that the military aid was only released after the White House learned that a whistleblower complaint on the matter was about to make its way to Congress, despite White House attempts to block it. \u201cGetting caught is no defense,\u201d said Schiff. Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor in New York City, said the Republicans\u2019 related argument that Trump could not have committed bribery or extortion because he never used those words is similarly nonsensical. \u201cIf a mobster, caught in the act of kneecapping a victim, were to tell the cops: \u2018I am definitely not committing an extortive act under Title 18, United States Code, section 1951,\u2019 it likely would not be an overly persuasive line of defense,\u201d she said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 They heard the July 25 phone call for themselves. And now, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and adviser Jennifer Williams are set to tell Americans and the world about its content and their concerns as the lead witnesses in perhaps the most consequential week of the impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump. They are the first two of nine witnesses called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee this week. The procession includes officials closest to Trump as lawmakers grind through their investigation of the 45th president. Vindman and Williams were listening with others in the White House Situation Room and heard Trump pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to do him the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigating Joe Biden and his son, all while the U.S. had placed a hold on aid to Ukraine. What to watch as the marathon week of hearings opens at 9 a.m. EST Tuesday: ___ Vindman is a Soviet-era immigrant who came to the U.S. as a toddler and grew up to become a decorated soldier and a White House aide. Now, he is a 20-year Army officer assigned to the National Security Council at the white-hot center of the inquiry. Vindman, 44, testified last month in closed session that he twice raised concerns about Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushing Ukrainian leaders to investigate the former vice president and his son. \u201cI have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman said in written remarks. He earned the Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq in 2004 leading infantrymen. In October, Vindman attended his closed-door testimony wearing his Army service uniform, with a chest full of military ribbons and other commendations. The visual underscored Trump\u2019s conflict with the military and national security establishment. Republicans are expressing concern about Vindman\u2019s \u201cjudgment\u201d in handling his concern about the call. ___ Trump and the world are about to find out. Williams is Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s special adviser for Europe and Russia, on detail from the State Department. On July 25, she was in the Situation Room taking notes as Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about potential 2020 rival Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cIt was President Trump who raised Burisma,\u201d Williams testified on Nov. 7. Later, she says that \u201cI believed those references to be more political in nature and so that struck me as unusual.\u201d The word Burisma does not appear in the rough transcript of the call released by the White House. \u201cTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls,\u201d Trump tweeted in part over the weekend. He called her a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d ___ The president and his allies have pointed to Zelenskiy\u2019s statement during a September press conference, shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump, in which the Ukrainian president said he didn\u2019t feel any pressure in the July 25 call. But even before that call, Zelenskiy had reported feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden, The Associated Press reported. Zelenskiy was concerned Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 election, two individuals said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue. State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy\u2019s concerns at least three times, the two individuals said, and notes summarizing his worries were circulated within the department. ___ He did last week, castigating the ambassador he fired, Marie Yovanovich, on Twitter and giving weight to her account of being bullied out of her job by members of the administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi several times over the past few days has suggested that if Trump wants to testify \u2014 she mockingly explained the word \u201cexculpatory\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s welcome to do so in person or in writing. He hasn\u2019t said he will do so. But Trump did tweet: \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d ___ The administration is confident about the testimony of all the impeachment witnesses this week except for that of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland on Wednesday, according to two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Like all the witnesses, Sondland will testify under oath and penalty of perjury. Sondland already has had to amend his earlier account after contradicting testimony from others. The White House is happy with the role of Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as the committee\u2019s Republican bulldog questioner. But privately these officials pointed to concerns in the White House about the performance of GOP counsel Steve Castor. ___ The president\u2019s allies have mostly stayed together so far during the hearings, but they are hopping between strategies for pushing back. One argument against the inquiry is that witnesses, including the whistleblower and charge d\u2019affaires William Taylor last week, are reporting the goings-on second- or third-hand. Look for whether they abandon that argument when Vindman and Williams testify. Republicans now say the president is innocent because the military money was eventually released. In fact, it was released Sept. 11 after Congress began looking into the holdup. ___ Testifying in a second session Tuesday are Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide who oversaw Europe and Russia Policy. ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",

A rough transcript of the call shows Trump sought Zelensky\u2019s help with a corruption probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, based on unsubstantiated allegations.

Trump has already bashed other impeachment witnesses, including former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch who hadn\u2019t even left Friday\u2019s hearing before he assailed her decadeslong career online.

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " In seeking to deny the existence of a quid pro quo that\u2019s become the center of an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump is relying on the testimony of Gordon Sondland, a hotel magnate who secured his position as ambassador after giving $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Sondland is set to publicly testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in what has the potential to be the most consequential day of the impeachment saga thus far. Sondland, other officials have testified, was a key figure in the apparent plot to condition the release of U.S. military aid on the Ukrainians announcing an investigation into 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The first week of hearings in the impeachment inquiry largely featured testimony from cooperative witnesses. As the White House blocked certain primary witnesses from testifying, Republicans complained that the witnesses who did appear lacked firsthand knowledge of the alleged scheme. Sondland does have firsthand knowledge of key facts, and his testimony could be combative. The self-described lifelong Republican already had to correct the record following closed-door testimony on Oct. 17, and several other government officials have offered accounts that contrast with Sondland\u2019s. Sondland, whom Trump named U.S. ambassador to the European Union, took on a major role in Ukrainian policy. He was in communication with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was working with two indicted Ukrainian Americans who sought the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Sondland, in his testimony last month, sought to portray himself as disappointed by Giuliani\u2019s involvement in foreign relations.\u00a0Sondland told lawmakers that Trump was \u201cskeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption\u201d and that it was \u201capparent\u201d that Giuliani was \u201cthe key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine.\u201d He claimed he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s instructions to involve Giuliani but that he \u201cdid not understand until much later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate [former] Vice President Biden or his son, or to involve Ukrainians directly or indirectly in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d Sondland, who said he believed he spoke to Trump five or six times since becoming ambassador, claimed he had \u201cno idea\u201d that Trump had brought up the Bidens in the call until the White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But testimony from other officials raised doubts about Sondland\u2019s story.\u00a0One key scene took place at a restaurant in Kyiv over the summer, when Sondland called up the president after Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Trump asked, according to testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who will testify publicly on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Sondland told Trump, according to Holmes. After the Sondland-Trump calls, Holmes said Sondland agreed that Trump didn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit about Ukraine\u201d and cared only about the \u201cbig stuff.\u201d Holmes said he\u2019d \u201cnever seen anything like\u201d what he witnessed: someone calling the president from a cellphone in a restaurant in a foreign country and having such a candid conversation. Holmes said he was surprised that the sensitive conversation took place on a non-secure cellphone call in the middle of a restaurant. \u201cWe generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0that Sondland kept White House officials informed of his activities, and Sondland emailed acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry ahead of a call between Zelensky and Trump and said the Ukrainian president would assure Trump \u201cthat he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone.\u2019\u201d For Democrats, Sondland is a compelling antagonist in the impeachment drama. They can portray him as an unqualified political appointee who had no diplomatic experience before he essentially bought a key position in the Trump administration and acted as Trump\u2019s yes man as he tried to use U.S. military aid for political gain. CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Sondland\u2019s phone call to the president from the restaurant took place prior to Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky.",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Is Mitch McConnell\u2019s future as Senate majority leader in 2021 more assured with President Donald Trump at the top of the 2020 Republican ticket? Or with a President Mike Pence? Because while the president\u2019s staff is focused on the ongoing impeachment proceedings in the House regarding his attempts to coerce Ukraine into helping his reelection efforts, Trump\u2019s ultimate fate is more likely to hinge on the calculations of a single lawmaker from the other chamber, Kentucky\u2019s McConnell. And although McConnell would certainly rather keep his control over the Senate and have a Republican in the White House, a number of Republicans predicted that, if Trump\u2019s standing among voters were to fall even further, McConnell would choose his own political future over Trump\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d prefer both. But, if he has to choose, yes, the Senate is his higher priority,\u201d said one former top GOP congressional aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess McConnell. The former aide could not predict how low that approval rating would have to drop. \u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question.\u201d On Tuesday, as additional witnesses testified about Trump\u2019s efforts to use $391 million in military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to announce politically useful investigations, McConnell told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to me that there will be 67 votes to remove the president from office.\u201d The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of those present to remove a president who has been impeached by the House. If all 47 Democrats were to vote that way, it would require 20 Republicans to vote with them for Trump to be forced out. \u201cI think most Republicans are going to fall on a spectrum ranging from no big deal to moderately alarmed to believing this was very bad judgment \u2015 but that it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of impeachment,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP consultant in Kentucky and a former McConnell campaign aide. \u201cI think the White House will need to give Republicans the latitude to express those varying opinions as long as they hold the line against votes to convict.\u201d But Trump\u2019s problem is that while he is feared by Republican senators \u2014 and likely less so now than he has been, given recent GOP losses in Kentucky and Louisiana governors\u2019 races, despite his campaign visits \u2014 he is not particularly respected or liked. Former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said that if the Senate were to hold a secret ballot to convict Trump, \u201cat least 35\u201d Republicans would vote to do so. Which means that Republican senators\u2019 loyalty to Trump likely goes no further than to the extent it benefits them politically \u2014 and they could well abandon him if it appears that doing so is more likely to ensure their own reelections. In the case of McConnell, the limits of his loyalty are more likely to be linked to the fates of the half dozen or so of his most vulnerable Republican members in the coming 2020 election. With that current 53-47 majority, if just four Republicans lose reelection, McConnell would no longer be majority leader \u2014 a title he has sought for decades. Meaning Trump\u2019s fate will be less tied to his polling in safe, Trump-friendly states than to his approval numbers in places like Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and Arizona, where GOP senators are all facing challenging races. \u201cIf Trump is not removed, all those senators lose,\u201d said William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and a Reagan-era Justice Department official who is now running against Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination. He recalled the aftermath of the 1986 elections, when Republicans lost the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s such a feeling of powerlessness, and it\u2019s one that Mitch has had in the past, and he doesn\u2019t want to have it back,\u201d he said. Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who is also running for the 2020 GOP presidential nomination, said McConnell\u2019s primary goal will be to keep Republican control of the Senate. \u201cEverything else is a distant second to that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will dump Trump in a nanosecond if it helps the GOP retain the Senate. And remember, none of the Senate Republicans like or fear Trump. They fear his voters.\u201d Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 GOP primaries, said McConnell understands that the party is better off without Trump heading into the 2020 election. \u201cMcConnell will shrewdly play Trump\u2019s game until a clear majority of voters in enough states that Republican senators need to hold to keep control turn on Trump,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAt that point, he will dump Trump.\u201d Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House after a whistleblower filed a complaint that the president was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless its leaders announced investigations politically useful to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection. According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made the military aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress. John Ryder, a former Republican National Committee member from Tennessee, said few people outside of Washington, D.C., are paying much attention to the impeachment hearings. He said Republicans in particular are wary of the new effort because of the long-running investigation into Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, which did not result in articles of impeachment or a prosecution of the president. \u201cThey\u2019re suffering a little bit of \u2018boy who cried wolf\u2019 syndrome,\u201d he said, adding that Trump\u2019s approval ratings, after dipping a few points when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of the impeachment inquiry, are back to the low 40s. He said that if the percentage of people approving of Trump starts falling to the low 30s, senators who currently back Trump will start to rethink that position. \u201cIf you move public opinion, you start to move senators,\u201d he said.

      "content": " Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade had some advice for President Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday\u2019s House impeachment hearing: Stay off Twitter. \u201cI just think overall, the president should just ignore this whole thing,\u201d the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host said. \u201cDon\u2019t tweet during it, don\u2019t get outraged over it.\u201d Instead, Trump should allow his allies to \u201cfight it out and keep it on the straight and narrow from the Republican perspective,\u201d Kilmeade urged. The Fox News morning program is known to be a favorite of the president, who has routinely live-tweeted what he watches and has offered glowing praise of the show\u2019s ratings. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump will take Kilmeade\u2019s advice. On Friday, when former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified about a smear campaign led by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani that led to her May ouster, Trump assailed her on Twitter. The president ripped Yovanovitch\u2019s long diplomatic career, asserting that \u201ceverywhere\u201d she \u201cwent turned bad,\u201d and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cspoke unfavorably about her\u201d in their July 25 phone call.

A White House summary shows Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0and his son. On Tuesday morning, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, told lawmakers publicly about Trump\u2019s call, which he monitored. Vindman previously testified that Trump conditioned a White House meeting with Zelensky on the probe into the Bidens, and that there was \u201cno ambiguity\u201d about the demand. Vindman also said \u201cthere was no doubt\u201d that Trump was taking aim at Biden, his Democratic rival. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see where the gain would be for the president in investigating the son of a political opponent,\u201d he said. Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy aide to Vice President Mike Pence, testified alongside Vindman. Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council official Timothy Morrison are set to testify in the afternoon.",

Holmes, who testified Friday,\u00a0told impeachment investigators that he overheard President Donald Trump talking with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine. Holmes said Trump was talking so loudly that Sondland had to hold the phone from his ear. This conversation came a day after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden. A whistleblower\u2019s complaint about that call sparked the announcement of the impeachment inquiry. After Sondland told Trump on the July 26 call that Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d the U.S. president responded, \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Sondland replied. Hale, who spoke to lawmakers earlier this month, testified that State Department records show Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, twice in late March. These calls came around the time that Giuliani was involved in\u00a0a political smear campaign against former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch, who testified Friday, said that she tried to get Pompeo to issue a statement of support for her but learned that he declined to do so, purportedly out of concern that Trump could undermine it in a tweet. Hale also said that Pompeo called Fox News host Sean Hannity, which Hannity has denied. Read David Holmes\u2019s testimony here,\u00a0and David Hale\u2019s testimony here. Here you can read the transcript of Hale\u2019s testimony: Below you can read the transcript of Holmes\u2019 testimony. In his testimony, Holmes also detailed how Giuliani was promoting a political agenda, including an investigation of former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter and of supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election (a debunked conspiracy theory that Giuliani nevertheless still pushed). \u201cThe themes that Mr. Giuliani was promoting and his associates were promoting.... In my mind, those were... political things that were not related to the implementation of our policy,\u201d Holmes said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 As Democrats continue to lay out their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: There is nothing Republican lawmakers could hear that would change their minds. \u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday. King said he hasn\u2019t seen anything in the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s hearings that has made him uncomfortable. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing there.\u201d Asked if there were any evidence that would make him uncomfortable, King said he wouldn\u2019t get into hypotheticals. \u201cThe whole thing is a fraud, just like the Russia thing,\u201d he said. Republicans complained on Tuesday that Democrats were using all the wrong words. They argued that Trump was asking for a favor \u2015 a legitimate one, in their minds \u2015 not \u201cdemanding\u201d that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky open an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. They argued that administration officials have merely been interpreting Trump\u2019s motivations while the president himself (shockingly) has not admitted to seeking a quid pro quo. They even suggested that a key impeachment witness might be wearing the wrong clothes. During Tuesday morning\u2019s hearing, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) noted that Alexander Vindman was wearing his military uniform, even though he generally wears a suit to the White House. Vindman had corrected Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) for referring to him as \u201cMister\u201d instead of by his rank \u2015 \u201cLieutenant Colonel\u201d \u2015 so Stewart asked if he always insisted that civilians call him by his rank. Vindman said people in the press and on Twitter had \u201cmarginalized\u201d him as a military officer. After the hearing, Stewart said he did not mean to imply that Vindman should not have worn his military uniform. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s a great reminder of his service,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you could interpret it any other way.\u201d Republicans appear convinced that Trump did nothing wrong, and no matter what comes out in the Intelligence Committee, no matter who testifies, it seems the overwhelming majority of Republicans in Congress are never going to accept that the president acted improperly. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly within the purview of the president\u2019s authority,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost. Perry said it was \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d for Trump to safeguard American taxpayers by withholding military security aid for Ukraine, and he dismissed those testifying that there was a connection between the withholding of the aid and the possibility of Zelensky announcing an investigation because \u201cthey\u2019re not the president.\u201d Asked if there was anything Congress could find out that would make him uncomfortable, Perry said if Zelensky were trying to bribe Trump or Trump were trying to bribe Zelensky, then he\u2019d be uncomfortable. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen any of that,\u201d Perry said. Republicans are increasingly clinging to the talking point that all these White House aides and State Department officials were operating with a false understanding of the president\u2019s intentions. To the GOP lawmakers, because there\u2019s no evidence that Trump ever directly said there was a connection between the security aid and an investigation into the Bidens, there could not have been a connection. \u201cIf you read the actual transcript of the call, to me there\u2019s nothing impeachable there,\u201d Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. In the rough transcript of their July 25 call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate possible Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also raised the topic of investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. But Lesko said that because Trump did not mention either Biden immediately after the word \u201cfavor,\u201d he wasn\u2019t asking for an investigation into the Bidens. \u201cBiden was not in that same paragraph,\u201d Lesko said. Multiple U.S. officials who worked on supplying nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine have testified that it was their understanding the aid would not be released until Zelensky announced such an investigation. Democrats say the aid was only released without that promise because the whistleblower came forward and shined a light on the president\u2019s scheme. But Republicans have jumped to the opposite conclusion: that the aid was released because Trump\u2019s intentions were pure. And no amount of testimony to the contrary looks likely to change their minds. \u201cDemocrats are striking out here,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said. \u201cNot a single witness has stated that any crime has been committed. Certainly no impeachable crimes.\u201d Brady also mocked Democrats for shifting from alleging a quid pro quo to alleging bribery. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s bribery with puppies and sprinkles on top,\u201d he said. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) insisted that because the witnesses didn\u2019t directly hear from the president that the push for a Biden investigation was politically motivated or that it was tied to the aid, that means it wasn\u2019t. He said the case for impeachment was built on \u201can interpretation of a phone call by somebody that never met the president, never talked to the president.\u201d Testimony from Gordon Sondland, a major Trump campaign donor whom the president named U.S. ambassador to the European Union, might be more enlightening, the congressman said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about people that have real knowledge of why the aid was withheld, and we\u2019ll get some of that tomorrow,\u201d Meadows said on Tuesday. \u201cAmbassador Sondland will certainly be able to speak to that more directly than any witness today.\u201d Sondland has already amended his testimony once to note that he now remembers having a conversation with a Ukrainian official in which he made it clear that a White House meeting with Zelensky and the security aid were contingent on Ukraine opening an inquiry into Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor testified last week that one of his aides overheard a conversation between Trump and Sondland in which the president asked about \u201cthe investigations.\u201d If that is true, Sondland\u2019s already shaky testimony will look even more unreliable. Sondland initially testified behind closed doors that he did not believe there was a quid pro quo, and Republicans are counting on him to reiterate that belief on Wednesday, even though his amended testimony now makes it clear he did believe there was a quid pro quo. Still, even if Sondland ends up supporting the conclusions that Democrats are drawing, Republicans are unlikely to be convinced. \u201cWhat I would say is, there are conversations and things that have been held that may not always follow best practices,\u201d Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday. \u201cBut to jump to the point where it\u2019s treasonous or high crimes, I think that leap is so far that, in the end, most Americans will say, \u2018Democrats, you\u2019ve lost your credibility here.\u2019\u201d There are, of course, some Republicans who have sounded less resolute about supporting Trump. The shakiest of them all is Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), who told reporters Tuesday that the officials who are testifying deserve respect. Rooney said lawmakers were caught off guard last week when the president tweeted during testimony by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch that everywhere she went \u201cturned bad\u201d \u2015 a possible example of witness intimidation by the president. \u201cThat was a pretty strong tweet from the president of the United States,\u201d Rooney said. And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), whose district is only mildly Republican, said he wished the FBI was doing the investigation instead of congressional Democrats. He declined to defend Trump but denigrated the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI want to find the facts, that\u2019s what I want,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cAnd this process is not planned to do that when you have partisan politicians doing this investigation.\u201d But, notably, Rooney and Fitzpatrick both voted against even opening the impeachment inquiry \u2015 along with every other Republican in the House. Former Republican \u2015 now independent \u2015 Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said his old GOP colleagues were \u201ccaught up in a lot of word games.\u201d \u201cThe Republicans will use whatever excuse they need to against whichever particular set of witnesses,\u201d Amash said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Kurt Volker, President Donald Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, testified that he was oblivious to the connection between President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and targeting former Vice President Joe Biden. Volker was trying to \u201cthread the needle\u201d between a Burisma investigation (which Trump desperately wanted and Volker believed could help convince him to continue supporting Ukraine) and a Biden investigation (which he says he knew would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d). \u201cI now understand most of the other people didn\u2019t see or consider this distinction,\u201d Volker said of investigating Burisma and investigating the Bidens. \u201cFor them it was synonymous.\u201d It\u2019s common for Trump administration officials to believe that they can advance broad policy goals without becoming complicit in anything improper. An anonymous administration official has insisted to the public that they are working diligently to \u201cpreserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses.\u201d Respected national security officials like John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, and Jim Mattis all thought they could serve as the adults in the room. They all resigned after realizing the futility of that goal. Before Trump was elected president, Volker and friends joked that none of them would want to work in the Trump administration \u2014 but they each wanted the other to do it and serve as the voice of reason. Volker felt committed to Ukraine\u2019s future and the fight against Russia, he said Tuesday. He hoped that he could get a skeptical Trump to support that effort by convincing the Ukrainians to give the president what he wanted. But Volker soon learned that the only way to get Trump on board was with what amounted to a demand that a country deeply dependent on U.S. military aid help advance the president\u2019s personal political ambitions. Volker claimed that he thought there was a distinction between \u201cBurisma\u201d and \u201cBiden,\u201d and that he saw investigating them as \u201cdifferent \u2015 the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable.\u201d When U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland brought up the investigations during a meeting with Ukrainian officials, it was an \u201ceye-roll moment,\u201d Volker said Tuesday. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,\u201d Volker told the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing on Tuesday afternoon. Volker later admitted that he \u201c knew that [Hunter Biden] had been a board member,\u201d but said that he believed that investigating Burisma and investigating former Vice President Biden were \u201cvery different things.\u201d Volker is the first of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d at the center of the Trump-Ukraine scandal to testify in the impeachment inquiry \u2015 Sondland will appear before the committee tomorrow, while Energy Secretary Rick Perry isn\u2019t scheduled to testify. Volker texted a Ukranian official that they would set up a White House meeting after \u201cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016.\u201d Tim Morrison, a White House National Security Council official who testified alongside Volker, told lawmakers that he was hoping that Trump would have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky more support in their phone call in July. Volker said that he didn\u2019t think that the United States foreign policy should be focused on pursuing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d he believed the Ukranians were floating. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians \u2015 particularly the former prosecutor general \u2015 they\u2019re not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d Volker said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sought by Republicans to testify, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine spoke up instead for Democrat Joe Biden in Tuesday\u2019s impeachment hearings, rejecting \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d embraced by President Donald Trump and some of his allies. Kurt Volker said he has known Biden as an honorable man for more than two decades, rebuffing debunked corruption allegations that Trump is said to have wanted the Ukrainians to investigate in exchange for military aid to hold off Russian aggression. \u201cThe allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible,\u201d Volker declared. Broader corruption in Ukraine was \u201cplausible,\u201d but corruption by Biden wasn\u2019t, he said. Volker testified alongside former White House national security official Tim Morrison in the second hearing of the day in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, only the fourth in history against a U.S. president. Morrison, also requested by GOP members on the House Intelligence Committee, said at the outset that he was not there to question the \u201ccharacter or integrity\u201d of any of his colleagues, though earlier Tuesday Republican lawmakers used his prior comments to try to discredit another witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The White House even circulated a tweet that was an earlier quote by Morrison questioning Vindman\u2019s judgment. Democrats say there may be grounds for impeachment in Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine\u2019s new leadership to investigate his Democratic rival and the 2016 U.S. election as he withheld military assistance approved by Congress. Trump says he did nothing wrong and dismissed the hearings as a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d Volker was the first person to come behind closed doors in the inquiry that started in September, resigning his position shortly before he did so. Since then, a parade of witnesses has testified publicly and privately about what they recalled about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Many of those statements cast doubt on Volker\u2019s account that he didn\u2019t know the Ukraine gas company Burisma was tied to Biden, and that he wasn\u2019t aware of a possible quid pro quo offered by Trump. A number of White House and State Department officials were listening to the call, but Volker was not. On Tuesday, he said he opposed any hold on security assistance. And he said, \u201cI did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two.\u201d Even though, he said, he understood that Biden\u2019s son Hunter had been a board member \u2015 and he himself had been deeply involved with Ukrainian officials on a statement, never released, that would have committed the country to investigating Burisma and the 2016 U.S. election. Volker himself requested a meeting on July 19 with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, at which Giuliani mentioned accusations about the Bidens as well as the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. He said he believes now, thanks to hindsight and the testimony of other witnesses, that Trump was using the aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden and his role on the company\u2019s board. \u201cIn retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,\u201d Volker testified. Yet he also acknowledged that Trump never told him he was withholding aid for Ukraine unless there were investigations. He also said Ukrainians never told him that they wouldn\u2019t get a White House visit or military aid without committing to investigations. He said he would have objected had the president asked him to get Ukraine to do investigations. Morrison, who stepped down from Trump\u2019s National Security Council shortly before he appeared behind closed doors last month, said he was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, testimony that Republicans have repeatedly highlighted. \u201cAs I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington\u2019s political climate,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cMy fears have been realized.\u201d He told lawmakers Tuesday that the transcript of the call was incorrectly placed in a highly secure location. Democrats have seen ill intent in that action, but he said, \u201cIt was a mistake ... an administrative error.\u201d Morrison has confirmed to investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and a Ukrainian official. Sondland told the official that U.S. aid might be freed if the country\u2019s top prosecutor \u201cwould go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,\u201d Morrison said in previous closed-door testimony. Volker shifted his account of a pivotal July 10 interaction at the White House. In his closed-door interview last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine or investigations sought by the president. But on Tuesday, he said the meeting was essentially over when Sondland made a \u201cgeneral\u201d comment about investigations. \u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,\u201d Volker said. A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and another envoy in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma. Volker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani \u201craised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.\u201d Volker also said a senior aide to Zelenskiy approached him last summer to ask to be connected to Giuliani. He said he made clear to the Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, that Giuliani was a private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government. He testified he wasn\u2019t part of an irregular foreign policy channel led Giuliani, as others have testified. He also rejected the idea that Trump dubbed him, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry the \u201cthree amigos\u201d in charge of Ukraine policy. \u201cMy role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\u201d Volker said. ___ Associated Press Writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Lisa Mascaro and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) got a round of applause during an impeachment hearing Wednesday when she said that President Donald Trump gets \u201cfive Pinocchios\u201d a day. The comment came during her questioning of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union whose\u00a0testimony incriminated\u00a0many in Trump\u2019s orbit who have been associated with the president\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. Before Speier\u2019s turn, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) used his five minutes to discuss\u00a0a Washington Post column that fact-checked a claim made by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the committee\u2019s chairman, that the whistleblower who set off the impeachment inquiry has a \u201cstatutory right\u201d to anonymity. As an indication of Schiff\u2019s correctness, the writer of the column gave the comments \u201cthree Pinocchios.\u201d When Speier brought up the whistleblower rules during her questioning, Conaway tried to interject by again bringing up the Post\u2019s \u201cthree Pinocchios.\u201d \u201cWell, the president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let\u2019s not go there,\u201d Speier responded, receiving applause from those in the hearing room. Schiff has repeatedly said that the whistleblower has a \u201cstatutory right\u201d to anonymity, often urging witnesses to be cautious when Republicans have asked questions that could reveal that person\u2019s identity. According to the Post\u2019s fact check, anonymity is not an explicit statutory right for whistleblowers, though national security experts warn that revealing the person\u2019s identity would risk his or her safety. Neither the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 nor any similar statues have language guaranteeing anonymity. Those laws, according to the Post, instead provide protections from work-related retaliation: Whistleblowers in the intelligence community are not allowed to be demoted, fired or reassigned for legally reporting concerns; their pay can\u2019t be cut; they can\u2019t be sent in for psychiatric evaluations; and their security clearance can\u2019t be manipulated. The ICWPA implies anonymity \u201cas a shield from other forms of workplace retaliation,\u201d Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, told the Post. Sondland was the first of three people to publicly testify Wednesday in the impeachment investigation into Trump. The EU ambassador started off his testimony by saying that \u201ceveryone\u201d knew the president\u2019s \u201cdesires and requirements\u201d on Ukraine, and that there was a quid pro quo. He also said that many officials in the Trump administration did not want to work with the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani but did so \u201cat the express direction of the president.\u201d",

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Officials who heard President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine over the spring and summer understood that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would have to investigate Trump\u2019s political opponents if he hoped to get the White House visit and military aid his country desperately needed, two key witnesses made clear to Congress on Tuesday. The testimony added more evidence that Trump\u2019s request amounted to a quid pro quo. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran who was working in the White House as the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert, testified that he saw Trump\u2019s push for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as an \u201corder\u201d to Zelensky and felt compelled to report it up the chain of command. Vindman is registered to vote with no party affiliation. Asked if he was a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d he called himself a \u201cnever partisan.\u201d State Department official Jennifer Williams said she found Trump\u2019s now-infamous July 25 phone call to Zelensky \u201cunusual\u201d because it involved discussion of a domestic political matter. Williams, who Trump attacked in a tweet as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d serves as an adviser on Russia to Vice President Mike Pence and campaigned for ex-President George W. Bush in 2004. She testified that \u201cthe reference to Biden\u201d on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky \u201csounded political.\u201d Republicans on the committee spent most of the hearing attacking the media as Democratic \u201cpuppets\u201d and trying to gently undermine a Purple Heart recipient and a Bush campaign official. Republicans pressed Vindman about being offered the position of defense secretary of Ukraine, which Vindman reported to his superiors when he returned home. Vindman said the offer wasn\u2019t something he seriously considered, and considered it laughable because he\u2019s an American and a member of the U.S. military. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said the line of questioning was a question about his loyalty \u201ccloaked in a Brooks Brothers suit.\u201d Vindman testified that he felt it was \u201cimproper for the president to request, to demand, an investigation into a political opponent\u201d and felt he \u201chad to report this to the White House counsel.\u201d He said it would undermine foreign policy and national security. Vindman testified that Trump didn\u2019t mention corruption in either phone call that he had with Zelensky before the July phone call, despite the fact that rooting out corruption in Ukraine was part of U.S. policy and was mentioned in Trump\u2019s talking points. Tuesday\u2019s morning session kicked off a busy week in the impeachment process. Ambassador Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison will testify Tuesday afternoon. Trump donor and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Defense Department official Laura Cooper and U.S. diplomat David Hale will testify Wednesday, and presidential adviser Fiona Hill and State Department official David Holmes will testify on Thursday. Sondland\u2019s highly anticipated testimony could be the most important day of testimony. But Volker is also expected to face tough questions from Democrats, as his testimony has been inconsistent with that of other witnesses. Volker claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of being part of an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Biden, but several other officials testified that Volker was closely involved in the efforts.",

      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " When former White House adviser Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council\u2019s top official on Russian affairs, testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, she described a sharp interaction with\u00a0Gordon Sondland. Hill said it began when she had a tense disagreement with the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. \u201cI actually said to [Sondland], \u2018Who put you in charge of Ukraine?\u2019\u201d Hill said of the encounter. \u201cI mean I\u2019ll admit I was a bit rude, but that\u2019s when he told me the president, which shut me up.\u201d Hill said that she was angry with the ambassador \u2014 and that Sondland dismissed her concerns because she is a woman. \u201cOften, when women show anger, it\u2019s not fully appreciated,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s often pushed onto emotional issues perhaps or deflected onto other people.\u201d Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump\u00a0has routinely demeaned, degraded and attacked women and\u00a0immigrants. Over the past five days of impeachment hearings, some of the most incriminating testimony has come from those very people. Key witnesses who have testified in the public impeachment hearings, which began last week, include women like\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary at the Defense Department, and Jennifer Williams, a top aide to Vice President Mike Pence,\u00a0in addition to immigrants like Army Lt. Col.\u00a0Alexander Vindman, the NSC\u2019s Ukraine expert. (Hill has the distinction of being both an immigrant and a woman.) Day after day, these witnesses laid out a damning case against Trump. Yovanovitch, who served as a foreign service officer for 33 years before Trump recalled her from her post in Ukraine in May, spoke calmly and clearly throughout hours of testimony last week. The cool-headed former ambassador even\u00a0responded to\u00a0smears from the president in real time during the hearing. Her testimony was so well-received that she\u00a0earned a standing ovation from the public at the hearing (and, later,\u00a0at a jazz club in Washington, D.C.). The former ambassador laid out how the Trump administration\u00a0peddled a campaign of lies about her, launched jointly by a Ukrainian official, Trump\u2019s\u00a0personal attorney\u00a0and a host of\u00a0right-wing pundits. During his infamous July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump called Yovanovitch \u201cbad news\u201d and said she was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d She testified last week that Trump\u2019s statement \u201csounded like a threat.\u201d Yovanovitch said that Trump opened the door for corruption by being complicit in \u201ca campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador, using unofficial back channels.\u201d Her experience, she argued, sets a dangerous precedent worldwide. \u201cWhen other countries, other actors... see that private interests, foreign interests can come together and get a U.S. ambassador removed, what\u2019s going to stop them from doing that in the future in other countries?\u201d she said. Cooper, the Defense Department official, clarified a\u00a0key timeline question about the withholding of military aid during her Tuesday testimony. She said that Ukraine was aware that the aid was stalled before Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky. If true, this would make it extremely hard to argue that Trump\u2019s push for politically beneficial investigations that day wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo. Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and immigrated to the U.S. as a toddler, testified as a real-time witness to that now-infamous call. He said there was an obvious \u201cpower disparity\u201d between Zelensky and Trump on the call because of Ukraine\u2019s reliance on the U.S. for military and other aid. \u201cWhen a senior asks you to do something, even when it\u2019s polite and pleasant, it\u2019s not to be taken as a request \u2015 it\u2019s to be taken as an order,\u201d he told the House Intelligence Committee earlier this week. Vindman, whose family fled the Soviet Union, is not the typical immigrant targeted by the Trump administration. Those attacks are normally reserved for\u00a0Black and\u00a0brown\u00a0people. But his status as an immigrant was still weaponized against him. Republican lawmakers and conservative cable news hosts\u00a0questioned Vindman\u2019s loyalty\u00a0to the U.S. because he was born in Ukraine. The 44-year-old Army officer responded to these attacks in one of the more emotional moments of the impeachment hearings. He\u00a0addressed his immigrant father\u00a0in his opening statement. \u201cI also recognize that my simple act of appearing here today ... would not be tolerated in many places around the world,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d Hill, an immigrant from the U.K., said the accusations of dual loyalty lobbed at Vindman were \u201cdeeply unfair.\u201d \u201cThis is the essence of America,\u201d she said during her Thursday testimony. \u201cIt\u2019s why I wanted to be here and why I wanted to stay here, and I think it\u2019s unfair to castigate anyone.\u201d \u201cI do not believe that my loyalty is to the United Kingdom. My loyalty is here, to the United States. This is my country and the country that I serve,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cAnd I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues \u2015 and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council \u2015 felt exactly the same way.\u201d During Hill\u2019s testimony, Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) said that she was \u201cespecially disheartened\u201d by Trump\u2019s treatment of women throughout this process, specifically his ongoing attacks on Yovanovitch. \u201cShe was an easy target as a woman,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that there\u2019s a long line of strong, talented women who have been smeared and victimized by this president,\u201d the congresswoman continued. \u201cWe can either choose to ignore it or do something about it.\u201d After the hearing, Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson (D-Ind.) said, \u201cI think for a certain pocket of society who are perpetuating harmful mythologies about immigrants and women, and who are trying to take our country back to some mythological good old days \u2015 I think it\u2019s important to have representation from women and those who have immigrant backgrounds to dismantle this notion of what it means to be an American.\u201d It\u2019s possible that the dual-loyalty smears against Vindman are a sneak peek of what\u2019s to come as the pressure increases on the president. Given Trump\u2019s history, stoking fears around citizenship and gender for political gain would be nothing new. Igor Bobic contributed reporting.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 In devastating testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, the hotel executive President\u00a0Donald Trump appointed as an ambassador after he donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration said that Trump gave him \u201cexpress direction\u201d to work with\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, who was pressuring\u00a0Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Trump donor turned Ambassador Gordon Sondland said. \u201cIt was no secret \u2026 the suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false.\u201d Sondland, who testified against the wishes of the Trump administration, implicated Trump and a number of top administration officials in what he acknowledged was a \u201cclear quid pro quo\u201d scheme to exchange official acts for millions of dollars in U.S. government funds. Sondland said Giuliani, who spoke for the president, wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into the company Burisma, which included Hunter Biden on its board. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually have to do them, as I understood it,\u201d Sondland testified, confirming that the key interest of the Trump administration was a public announcement that would damage Biden\u2019s campaign rather than an actual investigation aimed at combating corruption. But Sondland insisted that he didn\u2019t realize why, exactly, figures like Giuliani were so focused on Burisma, despite contemporaneous news accounts tying a Burisma investigation to Biden. He said it was only with the benefit of \u201c20/20 hindsight\u201d that he recognized that having the Ukrainian government announce an investigation into Burisma would benefit Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign by hurting Biden\u2019s campaign. Sondland said he kept key figures, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, informed about his activities. He said Trump was clearly interested in \u201cthe investigations\u201d but said Trump never told him directly that a Zelensky-Trump meeting or millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine were conditioned on announcing the investigation. However, he said that was his \u201cpresumption\u201d based on how things played out. Sondland claimed once again that he wasn\u2019t happy with \u201cthe president\u2019s orders\u201d to involve Giuliani in foreign policy, but did so because he was trying to problem-solve and believed it was important to support the Zelensky administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts as well as get the delayed military aid flowing to Ukraine. Sondland said he was trying to \u201cbreak the logjam\u201d by having Zelensky issue a statement. \u201cMr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President,\u201d Sondland said. Although Sondland said it was clear that Trump was interested in the investigations, he said he \u201cnever heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement of investigations.\u201d But even after talking to Trump, Sondland remained \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d that Ukraine wouldn\u2019t get the aid until it announced an investigation into Burisma. \u201cPresident Trump was not really interested in engaging, he wanted Rudy to handle it,\u201d said Sondland, referring to Trump\u2019s lawyer whom other White House officials have placed at the center of the Ukraine scheme. Sondland claimed that he \u201cwould not have acquiesced\u201d to Giuliani\u2019s involvement in foreign affairs \u201cif he had known of all of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s dealings or of his associations with individuals now under criminal indictment,\u201d referring to indicted Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.

Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) got into a heated exchange with Republican donor-turned-ambassador Gordon Sondland at Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearing when Sondland repeatedly refused to say who stood to gain from investigations into President Donald Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201cLet me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president\u2019s political opponents?\u201d Maloney asked Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who is under scrutiny for his role in shaping Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy. The question was in reference to a call at the center of the impeachment inquiry in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his political rival, while discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine. Sondland dodged Maloney\u2019s questions, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize who would have and who would not have.\u201d Maloney, growing visibly frustrated, asked him five more times to answer him until Sondland said:\u00a0\u201cI assume President Trump would benefit.\u201d \u201cThere we have it,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSee, didn\u2019t hurt a bit, did it?\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony Wednesday has been largely damning to Trump, with Sondland admitting that the primary focus for Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani was to leverage aid to Ukraine in order to get the country to investigate Biden, whose son once worked for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, along with other conspiracy theories. \u201cEveryone was in the loop. There were no secrets,\u201d Sondland said of Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky. Trump, meanwhile, attempted to characterize Sondland\u2019s testimony as a positive, claiming he had been vindicated and that the impeachment hearings should come to a close.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union and the\u00a0man at the center of the Ukraine controversy, testified before Congress on Wednesday that President Donald Trump conditioned security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president at the White House upon on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, giving Democrats their most potent sound bite yet. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d Sondland asked himself. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d But for Republicans, somehow, Sondland\u2019s testimony exonerated Trump. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201ca nothing-burger.\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), while admitting he didn\u2019t see any of Sondland\u2019s testimony, said it was \u201call hearsay.\u201d And House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) described Sondland\u2019s testimony as \u201cscrambled eggs.\u201d \u201cA yolk for them, a yolk for us,\u201d Biggs said. Like many Republicans Wednesday night, Biggs disregarded Sondland\u2019s claim that aid and a White House meeting were conditional on the Ukrainian president announcing an investigation into Biden,\u00a0because Sondland also testified that Trump never directly said that it was a quid pro quo \u2014 the existence of one was Sondland\u2019s impression. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence anywhere else around,\u201d Biggs said of the quid pro quo. That, of course, ignores a lot of evidence. For starters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn\u2019t get his White House meeting, and the U.S. security aid for Ukraine was held up. Even if you believe the GOP line that Trump delayed the aid because he was doing due diligence, that doesn\u2019t explain why he wouldn\u2019t agree to meeting Zelensky at the White House. And, even more damning, the aid was only released after the existence of a whistleblower complaint about the situation became public. In the words of former Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan \u2015 now an Independent \u2015 Republicans are relying on simply confusing the public. \u201cThey talk about it like we\u2019re all stupid, like we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on,\u201d Amash told HuffPost, in an elevator full of his former Republican colleagues. \u201cSondland testified to a quid pro quo. He testified to significant details and facts. He testified that he thought it was wrong. So the inference is obvious that the president was withholding security assistance.\u201d When we pressed Amash on what he would say to GOP legislators \u2015 like the ones standing beside him in the elevator \u2015 who say it\u2019s not obvious, Amash was not sympathetic. \u201cIt just is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this were any grand jury proceeding, it would be obvious to everyone.\u201d Predictably, that is not how Republicans see it. Despite Trump freezing the aid and not acquiescing to a White House meeting, Republicans are focused on the fact that the aid was eventually released. \u201cMy biggest problem with the whole thing is that it\u2019s like an armed robbery without a weapon, without a product that\u2019s been stolen and without a victim that\u2019s been robbed,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Wednesday. \u201cAll of this planning that was apparently going on that didn\u2019t come to pass.\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who was in the elevator during Amash\u2019s interview, suggested the comparisons to a grand jury aren\u2019t apt because the federal standards of evidence weren\u2019t being used for the impeachment hearings. \u201cIf it were, almost all of this information, almost every single shred of it, would be inadmissible,\u201d he said. Generally, Republicans were all over the place in their defense of Trump Wednesday night. Some of it was muted and general \u2015 Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that \u201cnothing stands out to me that\u2019s troubling,\u201d before insisting we get in touch with his communications director \u2015 while other defenses were animated and extremely specific. Diaz-Balart said foreign aid gets tied up all the time. He offered the defense that everyone was misinterpreting the president. He went on an extended rant about how the press wasn\u2019t adequately arguing for transparency in the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation. (While the Intelligence Committee did initially depose witnesses behind closed doors, it has been releasing transcripts of those depositions and holding public hearings for the last week.) Other Republicans offered a smorgasbord of defenses. Perry was particularly concerned that Democrats were blocking an investigation into Hunter Biden. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said even the \u201cworst interpretation\u201d was still acceptable. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing impeachable,\u201d King said. \u201c[Trump] has a constitutional right to ask that corruption be eliminated.\u201d And Biggs complained about the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert, Alexander Vindman, deviating from the chain of command to report his concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. \u201cNow see, here\u2019s the problem, you get me going on this stuff,\u201d Biggs said. But if there was one consistent part of Sondland\u2019s testimony Wednesday that Republicans homed in on, it was the president saying \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d In his deposition last month, Sondland described a September 9 phone call with the president during which he asked Trump what he wanted from Zelensky. \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,\u201d Trump said, according to Sondland. \u201cI want Zelensky to do the right thing.\u201d Trump is so convinced that the September call vindicates him that he held an impromptu press conference on the White House lawn on Wednesday with notes that mirrored those quotes from the call. Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) \u2015 perhaps the president\u2019s biggest defender in Congress \u2015 castigated Sondland for omitting the September call from his Wednesday testimony, calling the call \u201cthe best direct evidence\u201d about the president\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine scandal. The entire thrust of Sondland\u2019s testimony was that the president had, in fact, demanded a quid pro quo. At the time of the call, Sondland said Wednesday, he still believed that, contrary to what the president said, Trump still wanted Zelensky to announce investigations in order to get the military assistance and the White House visit that had been promised. After the hearing, HuffPost asked Jordan if he was just insisting that everyone take the president at his word. \u201cThe president said \u2018no quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe wants Zelensky to do what he campaigned on, plain and simple, speaks for itself. And oh, by the way, that matches the facts, because he never announced that there was going to be an investigation.\u201d Republicans \u2015 who initially settled on the defense that, as long as there was no quid pro quo, there was nothing improper about wanting a foreign government to investigate the Bidens \u2015 have now moved to a new stage: As long as Trump denied the quid pro or didn\u2019t make it explicit, it\u2019s fine. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement Wednesday where she clung to the idea that President Trump \u201cclearly stated that he \u2018wanted nothing\u2019 from Ukraine and repeated \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 over and over again.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. aid to Ukraine flowed, no investigation was launched, and President Trump has met and spoken with President Zelensky,\u201d Grisham continued. \u201cDemocrats are chasing ghosts.\u201d That statement ignores a number of facts. For one, as Trump was saying he \u201cwanted nothing,\u201d he was also saying he wanted Ukraine to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d According to the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate Ukraine\u2019s role in 2016 election interference. He also brought up \u201cthe other thing:\u201d investigating the Bidens. Sondland said that a White House meeting and the security aid were conditioned on Ukraine announcing an investigation. Explaining his deductive reasoning on determining that it was a quid pro quo, Sondland said it was simply \u201c2+2.\u201d The aid only \u201cflowed\u201d to Ukraine after the existence of whistleblower\u2019s complaint was made public. (You can read all about the timeline of when the aid was released here.) Furthermore, with questions about a quid pro quo already cropping up in the media, and the aid now headed to Ukraine, Zelensky canceled an interview with CNN where he planned to announce the investigations. Once there were reports of a whistleblower complaint, CNN host Fareed Zakaria said, \u201cit became clear to us that the interview was off.\u201d And finally, while Trump has met and spoken with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president didn\u2019t get the meeting at the White House that he desired. Still, Republicans continue to pretend there could not have been a quid pro quo because the aid was eventually released, Zelensky met with Trump, and there have been no investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s not 2+2,\u201d Jordan said during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s 0 for 3.\u201d",

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " The most damning testimony of the House impeachment hearings came on Wednesday, when a lifelong Republican chosen by President Donald Trump to be ambassador to the European Union eviscerated every talking point the GOP has put out about the Ukraine scandal. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said of the campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping Trump politically. \u201cWe followed the president\u2019s orders,\u201d he added, saying there indeed was a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d In his testimony Wednesday morning, Sondland made clear that it was widely known in the administration that Trump wanted Ukraine to do his bidding on political investigations, in exchange for favorable U.S. foreign policy treatment. Sondland\u2019s testimony was incredibly damaging for Republicans. The ways they\u2019ve tried to discredit the other witnesses or downplay the scandal went out the window with Sondland, and they struggled to lodge critiques that will stick. Some of the excuses Republicans have used thus far: Republicans have gone after other officials who have testified \u2015 such as Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a State Department official responsible for Ukraine \u2015 by saying that they didn\u2019t witness key events. With other individuals who did have some firsthand knowledge, Republicans have dismissed them as being bit players who didn\u2019t talk regularly to Trump. That doesn\u2019t work with Sondland, who spoke regularly to Trump. Other witnesses testified that they understood that Sondland had regular access to the president, and Sondland himself underscored that in his testimony. When asked Wednesday whether he told Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d Sondland replied, \u201cSounds like something I would say. That\u2019s how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. In this case a three-letter.\u201d Yet Trump spoke to reporters while Sondland was testifying, saying he didn\u2019t know Sondland well:\u00a0\u201cI have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though.\u201d Pam Bondi, the new White House communications director for impeachment, went on TV and said Sondland was just a \u201cshort-term ambassador\u201d to Ukraine. (He was never ambassador to Ukraine; he is ambassador to the EU.) Prior to last week\u2019s House Intelligence Committee hearing with Taylor and Kent, Trump tweeted, \u201cNEVER TRUMPERS!\u201d Trump also said Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence who testified on Tuesday, was part of the same group. All denied that characterization. The \u201cNever Trumper\u201d moniker can\u2019t be applied to Sondland. He\u2019s a lifelong Republican who initially supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican presidential primary but then readily got on board with Trump. He became an ambassador through a well-trodden practice used by both parties \u2015 donating lots of money. Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. Brent Bozell, a conservative commentator, tweeted that Sondland showed why the American people elected Trump to \u201cget rid of people like Sondland.\u201d Of course, Trump picked Sondland to be his ambassador to the EU. Bozell must have even realized how lame this attack was, and he deleted his tweet. There\u2019s no question that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who has no government role, was operating in a highly unusual \u2015 and inappropriate \u2015 fashion in the Ukraine scandal. He was able to leverage U.S. foreign policy in ways meant to benefit only Trump politically and personally. Sondland, other witnesses testified, was part of this rogue operation. And there was the possibility, therefore, that they were acting on their own, without the knowledge of those at the top \u2015 including Trump himself. Sondland shot down that theory Wednesday. He said it was \u201cno secret\u201d what they were doing. Among the officials Sondland named as knowing what was going on: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mulvaney\u2019s senior adviser Rob Blair; Pompeo\u2019s counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl; Lisa Kenna, the State Department executive secretary; John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time; Bolton\u2019s deputy Fiona Hill; and Timothy Morrison, who replaced Hill. One of the biggest recent revelations in the Ukraine investigation is that David Holmes, a U.S. embassy official in Ukraine, overheard Sondland talking on the phone to Trump, telling him Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d to which Trump replied, \u201cSo he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d When Holmes asked Sondland what Trump\u2019s views on Ukraine were, Sondland reportedly said, \u201cThe president did not give a shit about Ukraine.\u201d For him, it was all about the political investigations. The existence of the call seemed to put Trump more directly at the heart of the scandal, obsessed with using foreign policy for his political benefit. But Sondland, in his testimony Wednesday, said he barely remembered the call \u2015 because it was so unremarkable. \u201cI would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations,\u201d he said. Yet on Wednesday, a key tactic seemed to be making it seem like Sondland didn\u2019t know what was in Trump\u2019s mind \u2015 and also throwing Giuliani under the bus. Sondland said that when Trump told him and other officials on May 23 to \u201ctalk to Rudy,\u201d he took that as an order to talk to Giuliani and follow his instructions on what to do about Ukraine. In other words, Giuliani spoke for Trump. But Republicans claim that what Trump wanted was still unknowable, because he never expressly told Sondland to hold up aid until Ukraine carried out the political investigations. \u201cSondland never testified that it was the \u2018express direction\u2019 of the President to pressure Ukraine or push a quid pro quo,\u201d the Trump campaign said in an email sent Wednesday. Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) accused Sondland of \u201cmade-up testimony.\u201d This tactic has been more tailored for Sondland, who has been an unreliable witness and has changed his testimony since the time he first spoke to lawmakers behind closed doors. (It was tougher to pull off with Taylor, for example, who took meticulous contemporaneous notes.) Steve Castor, the GOP counsel questioning Sondland during the hearing, tried to make it seem like the ambassador simply doesn\u2019t remember anything: \u201cYou don\u2019t have records. You don\u2019t have your notes because you didn\u2019t take notes. You don\u2019t have a lot of recollections. I mean, this is the trifecta of unreliability.\u201d But Sondland said the reason he can\u2019t recall as much is, in part, the fault of the administration, which has refused to let him view all his phone records, State Department emails and other documents. He said he was also told that he couldn\u2019t work with his staff to pull together the relevant files. \u201cMy lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet, these materials were not provided to me. They have also refused to share these materials with this committee. These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have no doubt that a more fair, open and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records would have made this process more transparent.\u201d",

He said the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, openly discussed how Trump wanted Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into Burisma \u2014 the Ukraine gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat \u2014 as a prerequisite for a coveted White House visit for Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Sondland said he laid out the issue in detail to members of State Department, Energy, and White House staff. Recipients included Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, he said. Everyone understood \u201cTrump\u2019s desires and requirements,\u201d Sondland says. He added: \u201cEveryone was in the loop. It was no secret.\u201d Last month, Pompeo acknowledged for the first time he was on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, but disclosed no details and did not indicate he was kept up to date on the Ukraine pressure efforts. __ 12:12 a.m. Ambassador Gordon Sondland faces tough questions when he testifies to a Houses panel Wednesday about his evolving accounts of the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. A newly revealed phone call with President Donald Trump shows Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, more directly entangled than any witness yet in the Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Sondland is a wealthy hotelier Trump tapped as his ambassador to the European Union. He is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the president\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Sondland\u2019s closeness to Trump makes his appearance of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 A group of progressive lawmakers that includes Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed the Trump administration\u2019s support for the right-wing leaders who have taken power in Bolivia following the ouster of socialist President Evo Morales, saying Friday that the White House\u2019s \u201cdangerously misguided\u201d backing risks creating \u201ca full-blown humanitarian emergency\u201d in the South American nation. \u201cWe are troubled by statements from Administration officials, including President Trump, that welcome these developments in Bolivia that bear the hallmarks of a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d\u00a0the group of lawmakers said in a letter drafted by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a progressive who has been outspoken on human rights issues in Latin America throughout his career in Congress. The letter was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday. Morales, who was first elected in 2005, resigned on Nov. 10\u00a0amid pressure from Bolivia\u2019s armed forces as protests erupted across Bolivia after a disputed October election, in which his opponents accused him of fraud. The Organization of American States, a regional body of governments from across the Americas, said in a preliminary audit that it had found \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in the election. Morales (who says he is the victim of a coup and has fled to Mexico), his supporters, and some independent groups have questioned the evidence behind the OAS findings. Morales\u2019 decision to seek a fourth term \u2014 even after he initially lost a 2016 referendum asking Bolivians to alter constitutional term limits to allow him to do so \u2014 and the fraud allegations sparked the protests that led to his resignation. But his departure came two months before his current term would have ended in January. And his ouster paved the way for the rise of right-wing figures \u2015 including Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, a conservative senator who declared herself interim president\u00a0\u2015 to power. President Donald Trump welcomed Morales\u2019 ouster as a \u201ca significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d and his administration immediately recognized \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s legitimacy as interim leader. But since taking power, \u00c1\u00f1ez and her allies have threatened lawmakers from Morales\u2019 Movement for Socialism party and journalists with prosecution while also unleashing the military, which they exempted from prosecution, to crack down on pro-Morales demonstrations. Protesters have accused the military of killing at least eight people during a demonstration last week. \u201cWe urge you to consider an immediate change in course and to take action to support democracy and human rights in Bolivia,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\u00a0\u201cWhile there is legitimate debate surrounding Morales\u2019 decision to run for a fourth term, it is simply not acceptable for the U.S. administration to welcome the forced removal of a democratically-elected leader before the end of their mandate.\u201d \u201cOur government should call for the prompt restoration of constitutional order, and for an immediate end to all persecution and attacks targeting leaders and supporters of Evo Morales and his political party,\u201d they said. \u201cAdditionally, we call for the adoption of protective measures for those facing threats.\u201d Warning that \u201cBolivia\u2019s escalating crisis threatens to spiral into violent internal conflict,\u201d the progressives argued that the administration\u2019s backing of the current Bolivian leadership \u201ccould well contribute to a further breakdown in the rule of law in Bolivia and a full-blown humanitarian emergency, with large migrant outflows.\u201d \u201cWe strongly urge you to revise this approach and support the prompt restoration of constitutional order, dialogue between opposing political factions, fair and inclusive elections and respect for the human and cultural rights of all Bolivians,\u201d they wrote. Although it was addressed to the Trump administration, the letter also marked the latest effort from progressive lawmakers to set themselves apart from Democratic leadership on foreign policy and human rights issues, particularly in the Americas. In March, progressives came out against the Trump administration\u2019s decision to back Venezuelan opposition to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has become increasingly autocratic and authoritarian as an economic crisis has crippled his country. Millions of people have fled Venezuela, and Trump has aggressively supported efforts to remove Maduro from office by imposing economic sanctions and making thinly veiled threats of military force. Progressive lawmakers argued in March that Trump\u2019s sanctions and threats of \u201cAmerican military-led regime change\u201d would only \u201churt ordinary people\u201d and exacerbate Venezuela\u2019s crises. Progressive Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said at the time that the coordinated effort to challenge the White House even as top Democrats backed Trump\u2019s strategy\u00a0was a deliberate move to reshape foreign policy conversations within the party. Khanna was not among the 14 lawmakers who signed the Friday letter about Bolivia. The signatories were Reps. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Susan Wild (D-Pa.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Debra Haaland (D-N.M.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.), Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Alan Lowenthal (D-N.Y.). Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), Washington D.C.\u2019s representative to Congress, also signed the letter. Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have both previously called Morales\u2019 ouster a coup. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are the\u00a0only Democratic presidential candidates to have done so. Pompeo, in a new statement Thursday, reiterated the United States\u2019 support for \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s transitional government and renewed condemnations of Morales and other party officials who Pompeo said were responsible for \u201cegregious irregularities and manipulation of the vote\u201d in October\u2019s elections. But he also said the United States opposed crackdowns on the press and protesters. \u201cWe support robust press freedoms and peaceful assembly and protest. Violence, repression, and political intimidation have no place in a democracy,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe call on all parties to refrain from such violence, to observe the rule of law, and to respect the rights of all citizens to participate in building Bolivia\u2019s future, whatever their views. Security services must respect the rights of peaceful protestors, and the Bolivian authorities must ensure accountability for any violations of the right of citizens.\u201d",

As if the testimony weren\u2019t enough of a bombshell, about two thirds of the way through, Sondland mentioned a popular rapper by name and sent social media into a tailspin. Sondland described a call he had with Trump on July 26, 2019. The ambassador was in Kyiv at the time and stated that he and the president did not discuss any classified information at that time. In clarifying what the call entailed, Sondland said: \u201cOther witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call.

On Wednesday, Sondland doubled down on the mention of the 31-year-old artist and said later in his testimony that his memory of the July 26 call with Trump was triggered by someone\u2019s reference to A$AP Rocky.

      "content": " Presidential candidates opened the fifth Democratic debate on Wednesday by addressing the public impeachment hearings that have gripped Washington this week with new revelations about President Donald Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. But even as they cheered the House impeachment inquiry and argued that Trump needed to be removed from office, most Democrats on the debate stage in Atlanta, Georgia, used the question about impeachment to pivot to their core campaign message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, deftly tied the hearings to her recently released plan to tackle corruption. \u201cHe wrote a check for a million dollars and that tells us what is happening in Washington... We are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder,\u201d Warren said, referring to bombshell testimony from Trump donor turned European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00a0earlier in the day. Sondland, who was appointed in 2017 after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0delivered devastating testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday morning that implicated Trump and a number of top administration officials in what he acknowledged was a \u201cclear quid pro quo\u201d scheme to exchange official acts for millions of dollars in U.S. government funds. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Democrats need to move forward with the impeachment inquiry, but he also said they must be ready to bring the country together after Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe must confront Donald Trump for his wrongdoings. That means impeachment. But we must do more. I\u2019m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble of his presidency, pick up the pieces, and unify a divided nation,\u201d Buttigieg said. He continued on that theme by noting that each Democratic presidential candidate is \u201crunning to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden used the moment to tout his strength among people who view him as most able to beat Trump in 2020. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee, that\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his family. He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin also \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to be president.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tied impeachment hearings to her \u201cjustice\u201d campaign platform and her biography as a former prosecutor in California. \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Harris said, before taking a swipe at Buttigieg, over his \u201ctender moment\u201d comment seconds earlier. \u201cUntil we get to that tender moment, justice is on the ballot.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), meanwhile, argued that Trump\u2019s presidency is putting democracy at risk. \u201cThis is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests, in front of our country\u2019s interests, and this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man,\u201d Klobuchar said.",

Instead the president simply wanted a television clip that could be used to implicate a potential 2020 Democratic presidential opponent in a criminal investigation. \u201cI never heard ... anyone say the investigations had to start or had to be completed,\u201d Sondland said. He noted the only information he was provided was that Trump wanted Zelensky to make a public statement announcing investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Hunter Biden, and whether Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. The only reason that Sondland said he was given for this was that Ukrainian officials had previously made promises in private that they did not deliver. Sondland\u2019s statements fit with other testimony from witnesses and evidence from call records that Trump never raised broader issues of corruption in Ukraine or actual anti-corruption policy in his conversations with Zelensky. Instead, he focused on specific investigations; one that could help him win the 2020 election, and another that could cloud the stain of how he won the 2016 election. A televised announcement by Ukraine could be extremely useful for the Trump campaign if Biden were to win the Democratic presidential primary to face the president in 2020. It could be referred to at rallies, used in television and internet advertisements, and Trump-friendly news organizations could use it in clips to make claims of corruption against Biden. This could allow Trump to rerun his 2016 playbook, where he used the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server to make broad claims of criminal corruption against her. The New York Times claimed at the time that the then-FBI director James Comey\u2019s first announcement in July 2016 about the Clinton investigation provided a \u201cready-made attack ad\u201d for Trump.",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " President Donald Trump traveled to Austin, Texas, on Wednesday to tour a manufacturing plant with Apple chief executive Tim Cook, touting what he called a \u201cnew\u201d facility that would bring high-paying jobs back to America. The only problem? The plant has been making Apple computers since 2013, long before Trump was elected. The president toured a facility run by an independent company called Flex Ltd. that assembles Apple\u2019s expensive Mac Pro computers. During the tour, Trump suggested that his efforts to convince companies to relocate their manufacturing facilities back to the U.S. \u2014 and in particular,\u00a0his relationship with Cook over the past few years \u2014 had paid off. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant,\u201d said Trump, who has long boasted about his efforts to convince manufacturers to come back to America. \u201cAnybody that followed my campaign, I would always talk about Apple, that I want to see Apple building plants in the United States. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d But that assertion is not true, and Cook did not correct Trump after he made the statements. The New York Times\u2019 Jack Nicas noted shortly after the event that Apple has not, in fact, built any new plants in the U.S. since Trump\u2019s election and that the vast majority of its products are still made overseas. The tech giant did release more details about its previously announced\u00a0$1 billion campus in Austin that will house 5,000 white-collar employees beginning in 2022. But those roles will, by and large, not be manufacturing jobs. \u201cWith the construction of our new campus in Austin now underway, Apple is deepening our close bond with the city and the talented and diverse workforce that calls it home,\u201d Cook said in a company statement. Trump repeated his falsehood on Twitter later in the day, saying, \u201cToday I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.\u201d He also shared a video of his tour of the plant. Trump commended Apple for building the Mac Pro in the U.S. on Wednesday, saying that by doing so, Cook didn\u2019t \u201chave to worry about tariffs\u201d that would affect the cost of the final product. That\u2019s also false. The Verge notes that some Mac Pro parts are imported from China, and Apple has to pay tariffs on them before the devices are assembled in Texas. A new round of tariffs is set to go into effect on Dec. 15, and it will potentially affect the cost of a bevy of Apple products, including iPhones. Apple was flirting with the idea of moving production overseas earlier this year to lower the costs of the Mac Pro but said in September that the latest iteration of the computer would be assembled in Austin after all. The president also tweeted another confusing lie on Wednesday, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had \u201cclosed Congress\u201d on Wednesday, apparently pointing to the ongoing impeachment investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Congress was not closed. Many House lawmakers were holding those hearings. Meanwhile, the Senate\u00a0advanced an important bill addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Native American women.",

Gavin Newsom in July, in the hopes of forcing the president to release his tax returns. The bill\u2019s author, Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, has said that the legislation was designed to take aim at Trump. \u201cThese are extraordinary times and states have a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards,\u201d Newsom said in a statement\u00a0when he signed the law. \u201cThe disclosure required by this bill will shed light on conflicts of interest, self-dealing, or influence from domestic and foreign business interests.\u201d Trump has long refused to release\u00a0his tax documents, in defiance of a federal law that says Congress can have access to private tax information. Trump is the first president in four decades to not release his tax returns. Last month, a federal judge blocked the California law from going into effect, and the state then appealed that ruling.

      "content": " Movie star Robert De Niro has a theory how President Donald Trump could end up staying in the White House for a third term. It involves Trump declaring war in order to remain in office past 2024. De Niro, star of Netflix\u2019s upcoming film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d \u2015 who has previously called the president a \u201creal racist,\u201d a \u201cwannabe gangster\u201d and a white supremacist \u2015 shared the idea in a preview of a new interview that The Daily Beast published online Wednesday. Just to be clear, the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution \u2015 passed by Congress\u00a0in 1947 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s election to a fourth term in 1944\u00a0\u2015 limits presidents from serving more than two terms. But De Niro fears Trump may try to find a way to do so. The actor noted how Trump has often joked about being president for life. He said he thought that if Trump \u201cbecame president for a second term he\u2019d try to have a third term, and let smarter people manipulate it into getting us into some kind of altercation: a war.\u201d Director Martin Scorsese, with whom De Niro worked on the Netflix movie, first suggested the idea. \u201cThe only other president who served a third term was Roosevelt because he was in a war, and this fool would go and start something,\u201d De Niro explained. \u201cThis was what Marty Scorsese was saying, and I said, \u2018Marty, I never thought of that. I never thought he\u2019d go for a third term if there was a war or something.\u2019\u201d Read the full interview with The Daily Beast here. This story has been updated with a reference to the 22nd Amendment.",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " Fiona Hill, the former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia under President Donald Trump, warned the House Intelligence Committee against spreading what she called false conspiracy theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election during her impeachment inquiry testimony on Thursday. \u201cSome of you on this committee appear to believe Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country \u2014 and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\u201d Hill said. Committee Republicans have endorsed numerous unfounded theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Specifically, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has suggested that the \u201cblack ledger\u201d that revealed millions in hidden payments by the government of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych to Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort is a potential forgery. Trump has also endorsed conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee servers and is presently hiding the server in Ukraine. These theories have all been disproven and Manafort was convicted in federal court of receiving illicit payments from Ukraine. On the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cfind out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,\u201d referencing the private firm that investigated the DNC hack. Trump incorrectly claimed that CrowdStrike was funded by Ukrainian oligarchs and that the DNC server was in Ukraine. \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump said. Hill described the theories pushed by committee Republicans as a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d that aims to implicate Ukraine and not Russia as the country that interfered in the 2016 election. She added that these disproven theories Trump floated to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the July 25 call were false. \u201cOur nation is being torn apart,\u201d Hill said. \u201cTruth is questioned. Our highly professional, expert career foreign service is being undermined.\u201d The conspiracy theories endorsed by Trump and committee Republicans are designed to muddy the waters about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hill said that the Russian government supports these theories and that they have gained traction in some quarters of the U.S. independent of that support. She argued that the goal of Russia\u2019s interference in 2016 and continued disinformation campaigns was to \u201cdelegitimize our entire presidency.\u201d \u201cThe goal of the Russians was to really put whoever became the president [in 2016] \u2026 under a cloud,\u201d Hill said. For Trump, that cloud is allegations that he was involved in the efforts by Russian intelligence to interfere in the election. But had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the target of said interference campaign, won the election, Hill noted, \u201cShe too would have had major questions about her legitimacy.\u201d Hill noted that representatives of other countries, including perhaps Ukraine, may have \u201chad harsh words for candidates\u201d in 2016, but these statements did not add up to a concerted campaign to influence the outcome of the election. \u201cI refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes.\u201d",

I don\u2019t care. The choice is so stark and the stakes are so high you cannot afford to be ambivalent,\u201d Obama told about 100 people at a private home in Los Altos Hills, CNN reported. The former president\u2019s advice followed his warning last month to the \u201cpolitically woke\u201d not to be such purists. Last week, he urged Democrats to be \u201crooted in reality.\u201d The\u00a0\u201caverage American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,\u201d he said.

Obama seemed pleased about the diversity of the Democratic field but acknowledged the challenges some candidates may face. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates, and we have one gay candidate, and those candidates will have barriers if they win the nomination, just like I did,\u201d he said. Tickets for the event, which benefited the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Democratic Unity Fund,\u00a0ranged from $10,000 to $355,000.

      "content": " David Holmes had \u201cnever seen anything like\u201d it. Holmes, a State Department official with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine,\u00a0shared new details on Thursday about the phone conversation between President Donald Trump and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that he overheard this summer at a restaurant in Kyiv. \u201cThis was a very distinctive experience,\u201d Holmes told House investigators conducting the impeachment hearing, explaining how the moment stood out against the backdrop of his foreign service career. He recounted the July 26 episode, in which he was seated directly across the table from Sondland on an outdoor terrace with two other aides. His testimony fleshed out a clearer picture of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which kicked off the impeachment inquiry back in September. \u201cSomeone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cellphone to the president of the United States, being able to hear his voice, his very distinctive personality \u2014 we\u2019ve all seen him on television,\u201d Holmes said. Holmes was able to hear much of the discussion simply because Trump\u2019s voice was very loud, he said in his prepared remarks, confirming a previously reported detail. He said Sondland \u201cheld the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that he has \u201cnever\u201d been able to hear a conversation not set to speakerphone, boasting that his hearing is \u201cgreat.\u201d At the restaurant, Sondland told the president that he was calling from Kyiv, at which point the president \u201cclarif[ied]\u201d that Sondland was calling from Ukraine, according to Holmes. (Kyiv is the capital city of Ukraine.) The ambassador then told Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d Holmes said. (The remarks use an alternate spelling of Zelensky\u2019s name.) Holmes continued: I then heard President Trump ask, \u201cSo, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u201d Ambassador Sondland replied that \u201che\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d adding that President Zelenskyy will do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection that these statements were made. What Holmes heard stood out to him because of its relevance to his work. Just one day earlier, on July 25, Trump had asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and look into the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, not Trump. He also asked Zelensky to investigate Burisma, an energy company that once had Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a board member. Trump appeared to believe that the Bidens were involved in corruption in Ukraine \u2015 and that an investigation announcement would hurt Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. Although Holmes did not read a transcript of the July 25 call until its public release in September, he had been hearing about the proposed investigations. For one, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had brought up the conspiracy theories on national television several times over the previous months. \u201c[Sondland and Trump] were directly addressing something I had been wondering about, working on, for weeks and even months. A topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former ambassador,\u201d Holmes said, referring to former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly fired earlier this year.\u00a0Yovanovitch said in public testimony last week that she believed she was fired for pushing back on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to launch an investigation into the Bidens in Ukraine. According to Holmes, Sondland and Trump then pivoted the discussion to rapper A$AP Rocky\u2019s legal troubles in Sweden, where he was held for assault. Sondland said Trump should \u201clet him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker-tape when he comes home,\u201d Holmes recalled. \u201cYou can tell the Kardashians you tried,\u201d Sondland added, according to Holmes. After the call ended, Sondland told Holmes that Trump had been in a \u201cbad mood,\u201d as was \u201coften the case early in the morning.\u201d He went on to testify that Sondland agreed Trump did not \u201cgive an expletive\u201d about Ukraine. \u201cI asked why not,\u201d Holmes said, \u201cand Ambassador Sondland stated that the President only cares about \u2018big stuff.\u2019 I noted that there was \u2018big stuff\u2019 going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant \u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the President, like the \u2018Biden investigation\u2019 that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.\u201d Holmes\u2019 testimony \u2015 concurrent with National Security Council adviser Fiona Hill\u2019s \u2015 is scheduled to be the last given this week in the impeachment inquiry, following public hearings with a number of other high-level officials.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The career foreign service official who overheard President Donald Trump speaking with his donor-turned-ambassador about investigations that would benefit Trump\u2019s political campaign said Thursday that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to pull the Ukrainian government into American politics made United States government officials look like hypocrites. David Holmes, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, pointed out the irony in the U.S. government pushing the Ukrainians to operate with integrity while the president of the United States and his personal attorney pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to take actions to damage former Vice President Joe Biden, who Trump considered his chief political rival. \u201cWhile we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit, on a cable news channel, to a specific investigation of President Trump\u2019s political rival,\u201d Holmes testified Thursday. \u201cThey can recognize hypocrisy when they see it?\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asked Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain why we would do that,\u201d said Holmes. It was Holmes who recalled hearing a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the Trump donor turned diplomat who others placed at the center of the impeachment scandal. This conversation came a day after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, in which Trump pressed his counterpart to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential rival. Holmes told impeachment investigators on Thursday that Trump was talking so loudly on the call that Sondland had to hold the phone away from his ear. During the conversation, which took place at a restaurant in Ukraine, according to Holmes, Sondland told Trump that Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d and the U.S. president responded, \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Sondland responded, according to Holmes. The phone call is yet more evidence that Trump was directly involved in pressuring the Ukrainian government to open investigations into the Bidens. During Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearing, Sondland said that \u201cwe followed the president\u2019s orders\u201d on Ukraine. Trump reacted in real time on Thursday morning as Holmes delivered a lengthy opening statement on Capitol Hill. The president argued on Twitter that it would be difficult to overhear a conversation while someone was not on speakerphone, at least from his personal experience. \u201cNever have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I\u2019ve even tried, but to no avail,\u201d 73-year-old Trump, who is known for talking loudly, wrote in a tweet, urging his followers to try for themselves. Holmes, meanwhile, testified that it was difficult to forget such a \u201cdistinctive experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career,\u201d he said Thursday, referring to hearing the president\u2019s conversation with Sondland. \u201cVery colorful language was used. They were directly addressing something I had been working on for weeks, months.\u201d Sondland did not recall the details of the conversation when asked about it on Wednesday, but he also didn\u2019t dispute Holmes\u2019 account. When asked about the \u201cloves your ass\u201d remark recalled by Holmes, Sondland said it sounded \u201clike something I would say... That\u2019s how President Trump and I communicate \u2014 a lot of four-letter words.\u201d In her testimony before the committee, former Senior Director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council Fiona\u00a0Hill asserted that any talk that Russia did not target the U.S. during the 2016 elections \u201cis a fictional narrative\u201d promoted by Russian forces. Trump and his Republican defenders have repeatedly pushed the baseless theory that Ukraine was to blame instead. Thursday\u2019s proceedings capped off the second week of public impeachment hearings that featured bombshell testimony from nine witnesses who shed new light on Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. Their accounts dismantled nearly every argument Republicans had mounted in defense of the president, implicating him and other senior Trump administration officials in the scheme. Despite this, Trump and GOP lawmakers continue to insist the president did nothing wrong by seeking dirt on a political rival by holding up financial assistance to Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry is expected to pause next week as Congress leaves town for the Thanksgiving holiday, and pick up again next month in the House Judiciary Committee.",

Eventually, he got around to saying,\u00a0\u201cMike Pence is a great vice president \u2014 he\u2019s our man.\u201d George Conway responded to the president\u2019s remarks with two tweets suggesting that people consider Trump\u2019s legacy. The exchange can be watched here, and also below thanks to Haley, who, in a master class on shade, posted it on Twitter, making sure, of course, to \u201cthank\u201d the president for \u201cputting the silly rumors to rest.\u201d",

      "content": " Former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy personally lobbied President Donald Trump to add Brett Kavanaugh to his list of potential replacements when he was preparing for his retirement, according to a new book set to be released next month. The Washington Post first reported details of a secret meeting between Kennedy and Trump in 2017, shortly after the then-justice swore in the president\u2019s first appointee to the nation\u2019s highest court, Neil Gorsuch. During the conversation, Kennedy reportedly told Trump he should consider adding Kavanaugh, one of his former clerks, to his list of potential nominees. Kavanaugh hadn\u2019t been on Trump\u2019s first two lists of candidates. The account will be published in Washington Post editor Ruth Marcus\u2019 forthcoming book, \u201cSupreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover,\u201d which will be released on Dec. 3. Trump ultimately chose Kavanaugh as his second Supreme Court nominee, although the battle over Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation became one of the biggest flashpoints of Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House up to that point. The judge\u2019s nomination was highly contentious after his former schoolmate, Christine Blasey Ford, came forward with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were growing up. Kavanaugh denied the allegations, breaking down in tears at times and angrily defending himself during his confirmation hearing. He was later\u00a0confirmed by a near party-line vote of 50-48 in the Senate in 2018. Marcus also wrote that Kavanaugh had significant backing within the White House as Trump was considering the potential replacements for Kennedy\u2019s seat. Both then-White House counsel Don McGahn and former President George W. Bush reportedly advocated behind the scenes for the judge. The author also wrote that an anonymous source told her Kavanaugh \u201chad the most intense lobbying campaign inside and outside the White House.\u201d \u201cHe had the biggest batch of fierce defenders I\u2019ve ever seen in any kind of political fight in my life,\u201d said the source, Marcus reported. That support for Kavanaugh was not universal, Marcus wrote, as some wondered if Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t conservative enough. Others, including Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, strongly advocated that the president choose another candidate after Ford\u2019s allegations were made public. But Trump stood his ground and has continued to tout his tapping of Kavanaugh at campaign rallies as one of his most notable accomplishments in office.

      "content": "DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump paid respects Thursday to two Army officers who were killed when their helicopter crashed this week in Afghanistan, holding his salute until each of the flag-draped cases containing their remains were returned to their grieving families. Trump and his wife, Melania, traveled to Dover Air Force Base to offer condolences to the families of Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle, 33, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr., 25. The president and first lady led a group of dignitaries that included Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien. Trump and members of the military saluted and civilians placed a hand over their hearts as a carry team of six white-gloved members of the Army\u2019s Old Guard executed the delicate task of transferring the remains from a vehicle the military referred to as a ramp to a waiting vehicle, one case at a time. Trump has said witnessing the dignified transfer of service members\u2019 remains is \u201cthe toughest thing I have to do\u201d as president. As the final day of public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry wound down, Trump left the White House for the short flight to the Delaware military base, where the remains of service members killed abroad are returned to U.S. soil. Knadle, of Tarrant, Texas, and Fuchigami Jr., of Keaau, Hawaii, died Wednesday when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar Province in eastern Afghanistan. Both were assigned to Fort Hood, Texas. Wednesday\u2019s crash brought this year\u2019s U.S. death toll in Afghanistan to 19, excluding three noncombat deaths. The Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter, but the U.S. military has dismissed that as a false claim. The crash remains under investigation. Trump broke off peace talks with the Taliban in September after a bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including an American soldier. Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani spoke on the phone Thursday, the White House announced, and both \u201cagreed a reduction in violence is necessary to move the peace process forward\u201d and for all-Afghan negotiations regarding a political settlement to be successful. The president also thanked Ghani for his support in seeking the release of two Western hostages the Taliban freed this week after holding them in captivity for more than three years, said spokesman Judd Deere. More than 2,400 Americans have died in the nearly 18-year war. Last month, as Trump sought to justify his unpopular decision to remove a small contingent of U.S. service members from northeastern Syria, he began to describe his experiences at Dover and argue for removing the U.S. from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, which he campaigned on in the 2016 presidential race. The president has described the sight of cavernous aircraft pulling up on the base, doors opening, uniformed service members carrying flag-draped \u201ctransfer cases\u201d and once-stoic parents breaking down. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll run to the coffin. They\u2019ll break through military barriers,\u201d Trump said at an unrelated White House event on Oct. 9. \u201cThey\u2019ll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin. Crying mothers and wives. Crying desperately.\u201d \u201cAnd this is on these endless wars that just never stop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a time and there\u2019s a place, but it\u2019s time to stop.\u201d Nothing like the scene Trump described took place at Thursday\u2019s ceremony. The families were kept out of sight of the news media. Trump was also joined by Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Army Sgt. Major Michael Grinston and actor Jon Voight. Trump awarded the Oscar-winning actor the prestigious National Medal of Arts at a White House ceremony earlier Thursday. Voight said in Delaware that Trump invited him to come along if he wanted to. Voight said he did not meet the families but watched from a distance as the soldiers\u2019 remains were transferred. He said he accompanied the president because \u201cI just wanted to pay my respects, say a little prayer.\u201d Thursday\u2019s trip was Trump\u2019s second to the Delaware military base this year, and his third visit there overall as president. Trump went to the base in January 2019 for the return of four Americans who were killed in a suicide bomb attack in Syria. He attended his first transfer service in February 2017, for the return of a Navy SEAL who was killed during a raid on an al-Qaida compound in Yemen. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidates have tried to avoid dwelling on President Donald Trump and the impeachment process on the campaign trail \u2015 and voters in the early primary and caucus states have largely obliged them. But on Wednesday night, the president, the scandal rapidly engulfing his administration and the effect he has had on the country\u2019s political culture exerted influence on the fifth Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta. More than in previous debates, the moderators \u2015 from MSNBC and The Washington Post \u2015 pushed the candidates back, time and again, to the matter of how to handle Trump and the aftermath of his presidency. And the candidates, prepared as they were to stress their preferred policy issues, found creative ways to bring the conversation back to their core message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s response to the first debate question about how she would cajole her Republican colleagues into throwing Trump out of office in an impeachment trial in the Senate was a case in point. After dispensing with the question quickly \u2015 she would recommend that they read special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s conduct \u2015 Warren pivoted to her anti-corruption message. The senator from Massachusetts noted that the Trump administration\u2019s European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, whose explosive testimony in the House on Wednesday prompted discussion of impeachment, had received his post because he donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Warren reminded the audience that she has promised not to grant diplomatic posts to campaign donors and invited her fellow candidates to make that promise as well. \u201cI asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far,\u201d she declared. \u201cI hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.\u201d Other candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, relished the opportunity to wax lyrical about the grand stakes of holding Trump accountable. \u201cWhat this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country\u2019s interest, and this is wrong.\u201d After the exchange on impeachment, Trump reappeared in the debate several minutes later in the form of a discussion about polarization. Asked whether it was appropriate for supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to chant \u201cLock him up\u201d about Trump at his rallies, Sanders declined to condemn such conduct. \u201cThe people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd what the American people are saying, \u2018Nobody is above the law.\u2019\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden would not say if, once Trump is out of office, he would prosecute the former president or decline to do so to avoid reigniting the country\u2019s partisan tensions. He insisted that it would be up to his Department of Justice, which would function independently. But, in keeping with his self-styled image as a healer and unifier, Biden condemned, unprompted, the chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d heard at Sanders rallies. \u201cLook, we have to bring this country together. Let\u2019s start talking civilly to people,\u201d Biden said. Thanks in part to the moderators\u2019 crisp, personalized questions and balanced form of skepticism, the debate featured far fewer fireworks among the four poll leaders \u2015 Warren, Sanders, Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2015 than previous rumbles. Warren, who has struggled for weeks to shake off questions about the evolving details of her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, got a chance to refocus the discussion on what she sees as the benefits of it. And both Biden and Buttigieg made their case that her plan would be too coercive and unrealistic. But, unlike in previous debates, the exchange did not last more than a few minutes and did not devolve into an extended back and forth. Instead, candidates got the chance to discuss a number of other kitchen-table economic issues that had received shorter shrift in previous forums, including paid family leave, child care and housing. Warren, whose sweet spot is precisely in these areas, got the chance to discuss her wealth tax at length and how it would generate revenue for universal child care and preschool. \u201cI\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it\u2019s time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets more,\u201d she declared. The fast-moving yet substance-heavy format was particularly forgiving for candidates whose low standing in the polls gave them something extra to prove on Wednesday night. Sen. Kamala Harris of California got the chance to discuss her paid family leave plan, which she said was tailored to accommodate parents who have children later in life. The six-month duration of her new benefit, she said, is deliberately generous to account for the fact that parents of young children in their 30s and 40s may also be caring for their aging parents, and that this dual obligation falls disproportionately on women. \u201cMany women are having to make a very difficult choice: whether they\u2019re going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on,\u201d she said. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of four candidates onstage Wednesday who has yet to qualify for the next debate in December, came in determined to make a splash. Although in previous showdowns he has stuck to a kind of Goldilocks liberalism somewhere to the left of Biden and to the right of Warren and Sanders, Booker leaned into the business-friendly inclinations that defined the earlier stages of his career. He cut Warren off during a discussion of her wealth tax, calling it \u201ccumbersome\u201d and insisting the country could raise revenue from the wealthy through other means. He also faulted Democrats for failing to adequately encourage entrepreneurship in favor of seeking to cut the superrich down to size. \u201cWe as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it,\u201d he said. His most memorable moment, though, was a progressive one: when he pressed Biden to account for his opposition to marijuana legalization, which Booker said disproportionately harms African Americans. Biden said on Saturday that he would allow states to proceed with legalization experiments but would refrain from legalizing it federally because of his concern that it is a \u201cgateway drug\u201d to the use of more serious substances. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker joked.\u00a0 \u201cMarijuana, in our country, is already legal for privileged people.\u201d But it was Biden\u2019s meandering response, defending his credibility on racial justice by pointing to the depth of his support among Black voters, that proved the most startling element of the exchange. Biden noted that former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois has endorsed him but incorrectly called her the \u201conly\u201d Black woman to serve in the Senate. (She was the first, but not the only one.) Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said with a chuckle, referring to herself. In the end, though, the conversation invariably turned back to Trump, who has become something of a lens through which Democratic presidential hopefuls articulate their theories for effecting positive change. Warren and Sanders diagnose Trump as a symptom of underlying public disenchantment with a corrupt, rigged political system and economy, and promise to bring a fighting spirit and grassroots movement to bear on the ossified levers of power so government can work again for ordinary people. They see unity as the byproduct of this progress, which is likely to be more painful still, rather than a precursor. \u201cIf you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump but transform America, that doesn\u2019t have a super PAC, doesn\u2019t do fundraisers at wealthy people\u2019s homes, please join us at BernieSanders.com,\u201d Sanders said in his concluding remarks. Biden, Buttigieg and Booker, by contrast, see their roles as calming agents whose first order of business would be easing the national acrimony that has escalated under Trump. Buttigieg, who spoke about the need for a president capable of unifying the country when the \u201csun comes up\u201d and Trump is not president anymore, has been vague about how exactly he plans to overcome the combined forces of entrenched Republican opposition \u2015 even if then the Senate is narrowly controlled by Democrats \u2015 and the deep-pocketed resistance of corporate special interests to top Democratic priorities. He did not get any more specific on Wednesday night, falling back instead on his claim that \u201cwe are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago,\u201d shortly before former President Barack Obama took office. \u201cThere is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn\u2019t exist in the same way, even a few years ago,\u201d he said, while neglecting to note that bills that poll well routinely die in today\u2019s hyper-partisan, special interest-infested Congress. But for perhaps the first time in any of the debates, the moderators pressed Biden to explain why exactly he expects Republican lawmakers, who continue to resist holding Trump accountable, to treat him any differently than they treated Obama. Biden responded by suggesting that he is the candidate best poised to create coattails for maintaining the Democratic majority in the House and regaining one in the Senate. \u201cYou have to ask yourself up here: Who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?\u201d This article has been updated throughout with more comments during the debate.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 A key Republican defense of President Donald Trump is that the cadre of diplomatic witnesses are simply mistaken that he tried to extort Ukraine into announcing a sham investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden. Their truth is that Trump was just fighting corruption. \u201cPresident Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukrainian election meddling against his campaign and of widespread corruption in that country,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said at Thursday\u2019s impeachment hearing. But ask Republican lawmakers if they\u2019ve ever heard Trump express an interest in rooting out corruption in other countries, or even mention corruption in Ukraine before Biden got into the 2020 Democratic presidential race this April, and their minds go blank. \u201cIf the subject was Ukraine, he\u2019s expressed his concern about corruption in Ukraine, which everybody understood was endemic \u2015 including [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, who won. So I haven\u2019t talked to the president about other countries where that might have come up,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who serves as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation and as vice chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus. \u201cYou mean other than what I\u2019ve heard over the news? We\u2019ve never had that discussion,\u201d said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), another fierce ally of the president. In 2016, Trump campaigned on \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d in Washington, shorthand for cleaning up the government and chasing away lobbyists. But he\u2019s been one of the swampiest presidents of all time, refusing even to take the most basic step of divesting from his private business. When foreign dignitaries travel to Washington, they line Trump\u2019s pockets by staying at his hotel. And he\u2019s shown an affinity for autocratic leaders of nations where corruption is rampant, like Russia, North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, turning a blind eye to the way they run their governments. After Biden jumped into the Democratic primary in April, however, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani suddenly began planning a trip to Kyiv, seeking to push the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations helpful to Trump ahead of his reelection campaign in 2020. It was those investigations that Trump urged Zelensky to advance in their July 25 phone call \u2015 the call that is now the subject of the House impeachment inquiry. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee who has voiced deep skepticism of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry this week, argues that Republicans don\u2019t have to prove that Trump actually cares about corruption. \u201cCorruption within any country should be rooted out and having two heads of state agree on that seems to be, on its face, fine. So we don\u2019t have to prove anything else,\u201d Conaway said. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is one of the president\u2019s biggest defenders in Congress, said no when asked if he could point to other examples of Trump fighting corruption. \u201cThe focus has been on what happened in Ukraine,\u201d Jordan said, adding that the president is skeptical of foreign aid, that Ukraine is deeply corrupt and that Ukraine\u2019s new president had pledged to clean house. \u201cSo you couple all that together.\u201d Other Republicans highlighted instances of foreign or domestic policy changes \u2015 such as the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture \u2015 that were not primarily about corruption. Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), another Intelligence Committee member, pointed to the president\u2019s March announcement that he would cut foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to try to stop migrants from coming to the U.S. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nearly failed states and the reason is corruption,\u201d Stewart said. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the second-ranking Republican in the House, said the president held up the aid not just because of corruption, but because he wanted to signal to other countries that they needed to help Ukraine as well. \u201cGermany was an example where he was saying, look, the United States is helping but other countries need to step up too and help Ukraine,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t only about corruption. It was also about having other countries do more of their fair share.\u201d It turns out that other countries have together helped Ukraine more than the U.S. has, and the Trump administration knows it. On Thursday, David Holmes, a political counselor to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told the Intelligence Committee that the embassy researched the burden-sharing question in August. They told the White House that since 2014, the U.S. has provided Ukraine about $3 billion in aid, while European Union nations have provided a combined $12 billion. \u201cIf the concern was that others were not spending what we were to support Ukraine, that showed a different story,\u201d Holmes said.",

The idea to use the presidential retreat to woo House Republicans came from acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as the impeachment inquiry got underway, according to the Post. Since then, Mulvaney and other top officials have hosted weekend getaways for Republicans, complete with campfires, hiking and shooting the breeze. Trump often phones in to talk to visiting lawmakers, the Post reported. Trump has met with or reached out to 100 House Republicans since the impeachment process began, while 50 of the 53 Senate Republicans have attended a White House lunch. More than 40 House Republicans have made the trip to Camp David, according to the Post. Though lawmakers are often blown away by a visit to the historic spot, Trump doesn\u2019t get it, according to the newspaper. When Mulvaney first suggested the Camp David trips, the Post reported, Trump asked: \u201cWho would want to go there?\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Friday pushed a false right-wing conspiracy theory roundly debunked by U.S. officials \u2014 including during this week\u2019s House impeachment hearings \u2014 among a cornucopia of false and nonsensical claims he made during a nearly hourlong phone call on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Trump seized on false reports that Ukraine hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server during the 2016 election. (U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly affirmed it was Russia who interfered in the 2016 election.) \u201cA lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right? From the DNC,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the word is.\u201d In damning testimony on Thursday, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill repeatedly urged Republicans to stop pushing the conspiracy theory. \u201cI refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes.\u201d Friday\u2019s nearly hourlong interview devolved into a soliloquy, which frequently occurs when Trump calls into \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Fox News\u2019 morning program that is typically friendly toward him. Trump rambled and mentioned, often without context, some of his favorite targets, including (but not limited to): \u201cshifty\u201d and \u201csick puppy\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who\u2019s leading the House impeachment inquiry; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom Trump referred to as \u201ca bedbug\u201d; former FBI Director James Comey, whom he called \u201ca totally disgusting human being\u201d; and \u201cthe two lovers,\u201d former FBI staffers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Even the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d hosts seemed perplexed at times, trying to squeeze in questions for the president and get him back on track \u2014 to little avail. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt repeatedly tried to shift the conversation to the 2020 campaign, but Trump frequently brought it back to his grievances over the impeachment proceedings. When Trump finally did field questions on the Democratic primary field, he suggested former Vice President Joe Biden might not \u201cmake it mentally. He\u2019s off.\u201d Trump also revived his racial slur against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), referring to her as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d At times, the hosts attempted to push back on his false claims or ask him to clarify. Co-host Steve Doocy asked Trump to provide a source for his spurious assertion that former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration \u201cspied on my campaign.\u201d Trump would not name a source. Doocy also debunked Trump\u2019s false claim that only the U.S. gives aid to Ukraine, one of his defenses against the July 25 call to Ukraine\u2019s president, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. More than 50 minutes into Friday\u2019s phone interview, after asking about the president\u2019s health, co-host Brian Kilmeade suggested Trump call into the program every week as a form of \u201cstress relief.\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser John Bolton\u00a0says he\u2019s ready to share the \u201cbackstory\u201d of his departure from the White House. Bolton took to Twitter on Friday to tease his forthcoming story, claiming the White House had previously \u201csuppressed\u201d his Twitter account to prevent him from speaking out about the details surrounding his resignation in September. \u201cGlad to be back on Twitter after more than two months,\u201d Bolton tweeted. \u201cFor the backstory, stay tuned........\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how or why the White House would have prevented Bolton from posting on the social media platform until Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump fired Bolton in September, though the former national security adviser denied that report and claimed he had turned in his resignation voluntarily. \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d Trump announced in a pair of tweets on Sept. 10. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d Bolton was known for being a hawk on Iran, North Korea and Syria. His\u00a0aggressive foreign policy approach and eagerness for war frequently clashed with Trump\u2019s own approach for less military intervention. Lawmakers have called on Bolton to testify as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump. Bolton\u2019s lawyer, Charles Cooper, has said Bolton would be willing to do so if a court rules he must, given that the\u00a0White House has chosen not to cooperate with the inquiry. In a letter to the chief House lawyer earlier this month, Cooper said Bolton knows about \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d surrounding Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. According to Cooper\u2019s letter, which he provided to HuffPost, Bolton \u201cwas personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which [lawmakers] have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\u201d Bolton was reportedly concerned about Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democratic frontrunners for 2020, and his son Hunter. At one point, Bolton even\u00a0ordered an aide to warn White House attorneys about Giuliani\u2019s behavior. Bolton, however,\u00a0failed to show up\u00a0on Nov. 7 for his scheduled deposition by lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry. He is one of several current and former Trump administration officials who have not appeared for their closed-door depositions. Cooper said Bolton \u201cstands ready\u201d to testify if courts resolve the \u201cconflicting demands of the Legislative and Executive Branches.\u201d",

For Pete\u2019s sake, it was pretty popular.\u201d Colbert later likened the House impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine scandal to HBO\u2019s epic fantasy drama \u2015 dinging Trump and Republican lawmakers in the process \u2015 before using a catchy jingle to break it all down.
