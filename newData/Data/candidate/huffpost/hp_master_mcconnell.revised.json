      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 He changed the rules to make it easier to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks. He tossed out Senate traditions to make it easier to confirm Trump\u2019s circuit judges. So, naturally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to adjust the rules again to make it easier to confirm the rest of Trump\u2019s nominees to lifetime seats on federal courts. The Senate will vote this week to reduce its debate time for most nominees \u2015 district court judges and lower-level executive nominees \u2015 from 30 hours to two hours. This will not apply to Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court nominees or circuit court nominees. Without a whiff of irony, McConnell, whose greatest legacy is denying a Supreme Court seat and dozens of other federal court seats to President Barack Obama, said Thursday that the rule change is necessary because of Democrats\u2019 \u201cunprecedented obstruction\u201d of Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cObstruction for obstruction\u2019s sake,\u201d bemoaned McConnell, who was so Machiavellian about denying Obama the ability to confirm judges that he drove Republicans to\u00a0block their own nominees\u00a0and fueled a vacancy crisis\u00a0on federal courts. It would take 67 votes to make the rules change. All 45 Democrats, along with the two independent senators who caucus with them, are expected to vote against it. But the 53 Republicans could still get it done if they invoke the so-called \u201cnuclear option,\u201d a more confrontational approach that would allow them to change the rules with a simple majority, or 51 votes. It\u2019s not clear if McConnell is prepared to go nuclear to make the change, but he\u2019s previously suggested that he is. Since Trump became president, McConnell has used the nuclear option to lower the vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees from 60 to a simple majority. He\u2019s also endorsed repeated violations of the \u201cblue slip\u201d rule, a Senate tradition of only moving forward with a judicial nominee when both of his or her home-state senators sign off on it. Those changes, along with his latest push to make another rule change, are all part of McConnell\u2019s grand plan: to use Trump\u2019s presidency to put piles of young, anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, anti-voting rights ideologues into lifetime federal court seats before Trump is up for reelection in 2020. \u201cHe just wants to confirm as many as possible in case Trump loses,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and an expert on judicial nominations. McConnell and the White House have made filling circuit court vacancies their top priority so far, and they\u2019ve had quite a run. The Senate has confirmed 37 circuit judges to date. That\u2019s so many circuit judges \u2015 more than any other president by this point in his first term \u2015 that 1 in 5 seats on circuit courts is filled by a judge nominated by Trump. They\u2019ve focused on circuit courts because these courts often have the last word in federal cases. The Supreme Court only hears about 100 to 150 appeals from the more than 7,000 cases that come before the nation\u2019s 13 circuit courts each year. But now McConnell is turning his attention to district courts, where there are a whopping 129 vacancies. Democrats are likely to have more say in who the nominees are for these court seats, as Republicans appear willing to honor the blue-slip rule for them. \u201cMany are less ideological and conservative than the circuit picks and are recommended by home-state senators who usually suggest them because they are competent to move the cases,\u201d said Tobias. \u201cFor example, a number are magistrate judges or state court judges.\u201d If Republicans succeed in changing the rules this week, they could conceivably fill most empty district court seats during Trump\u2019s first term, leaving few to fill after 2020, when a Democrat might be in the White House. Senate Democrats aren\u2019t thrilled by any of this, but there\u2019s little they can do in the minority \u2015 especially if McConnell keeps weakening the few tools afforded to them to block judicial nominees they don\u2019t support. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s approach has always been to manipulate Senate rules when it helps him and then change Senate rules when the tables turn,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThis is just another step in his effort to limit the rights of the minority and cede authority to the administration.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to say Thursday whether he thinks his chamber would confirm Herman Cain to join the Federal Reserve board, casting doubt on the former Republican presidential candidate\u2019s prospects should President Donald Trump advance him for the post. Asked if a Cain nomination would face problems, McConnell, R-Ky., noted that successful nominees must pass background checks and have a likelihood of confirmation. \u201cAnd, as you know, some of my members have expressed concern about that nomination,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cBut as far as I know, it hasn\u2019t been made yet.\u201d Trump\u2019s interest in potentially nominating Cain along with another political ally, conservative commentator Stephen Moore, has sparked questions among lawmakers from both parties in Congress about the president\u2019s influence on the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the importance of the Fed\u2019s independence during a talk Thursday evening with House Democrats meeting in Virginia for their annual issues retreat, according to a source in the room unauthorized to discuss the private session. Powell told lawmakers that he saw his role as totally apolitical. He also said the Fed does not consider political pressure in its decision making, the source said. Another source in the room confirmed the remarks. The chairman fielded questions from lawmakers during a question-and-answer session in Lansdowne, but declined to comment on the president\u2019s potential picks. Powell was Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Fed, but the president has been critical of him for raising interest rates. Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said elevating Cain and Moore to the Fed would risk politicizing the nation\u2019s central bank and endangering the economy. \u201cThese two appointments to the Fed are the worst, ill-suited appointment that the president could come up with,\u201d she told reporters. Three GOP senators \u2014 Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney, Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski and North Dakota\u2019s Kevin Cramer \u2014 told The Associated Press they\u2019d likely vote against Cain. With Republicans controlling the Senate 53-47, it would take opposition from just four GOP senators to sink the nomination, assuming all Democrats are also \u201cno\u201d votes. As he did earlier this week, McConnell also sidestepped a question about whether he would back Cain or Moore, a Fed critic and former Trump campaign aide, for the board. Trump has said he will nominate both men. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s actually nominated,\u201d said McConnell. Cain has run into concerns by lawmakers from both parties that, as a Trump loyalist and deeply conservative political figure, he would threaten the Fed\u2019s traditional political independence. Trump himself has taken a nontraditional approach to the Fed, repeatedly accusing it of mismanaging the economy by not pushing hard enough for low interest rates. The White House offered no fresh comment Thursday about Trump\u2019s intentions, referring reporters to his earlier comments about Cain. Trump initially called Cain \u201ca very terrific man\u201d who would \u201cdo very well there.\u201d But he said earlier this week that he didn\u2019t know how Cain was faring in the vetting process and that Cain \u201cwill make that determination\u201d whether to continue. Cain, former CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He dropped out of the race after allegations of sexual harassment and infidelity, which he denied. Last year, in September, he helped found a pro-Trump super political action committee, America Fighting Back PAC, whose website says, \u201cWe must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.\u201d Cain formerly served on the board of the Fed\u2019s Kansas City regional bank. He has also called for a return to the gold standard to control inflation, which most economists consider unworkable. Moore is a conservative commentator and another Trump political ally. ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Lansdowne, Virginia, and writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Ryan Grenoble",
      "content": " While the political world focused on the Mueller report Thursday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was back in his home state, telling farmers to plant more hemp. McConnell made the urging at a news conference in Louisville, where he announced plans for legislation to raise the nationwide minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21 from 18. He said he expected to introduce the measure in May to restrict access to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and vaping devices. \u201cMy legislation will be similar to the current system, where retailers have the responsibility to verify the age of anyone buying tobacco products \u2014 we\u2019ll just raise the age from 18 to 21,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. Military personnel would be exempt. Eleven states, in addition to Washington, D.C., and Guam, already have laws raising the purchasing age of tobacco products, according to the\u00a0Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation. McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky is not among those. An effort to raise the tobacco purchase age there failed in February amid concerns it might hurt the state\u2019s already shrinking tobacco industry. Tobacco used to be a cash crop for Kentucky farmers, but that\u2019s no longer the case. The state was expected to grow 57,000 acres in 2018, down from 200,000 acres in the 1990s,\u00a0according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The state\u2019s new bumper crop: hemp, which may turn out to be more profitable. Kentucky has been a leader in developing a hemp industry and McConnell has long been a prominent booster. He teamed with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon earlier this year to ask the U.S. Department of Agriculture to quickly finish regulations allowing the industry to operate. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While cigarette smoking among middle school and high school students has been declining for seven years, e-cigarette use has soared. More than 20 percent of high schoolers vaped on a monthly basis in 2018. The Food and Drug Administration last year proposed reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, which would reduce their addictiveness and harm to public health.",

Yet on this central question, the special counsel\u2019s finding was clear: Case closed,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cThis ought to be good news for everyone. But my Democratic colleagues seem to be publicly working through the five stages of grief.\u201d \u201cThis investigation went on for two years,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s finally over.\u201d Democrats have been calling for weeks to hear testimony from some of the biggest figures in Mueller\u2019s report, including the special counsel himself and former White House counsel Don McGahn, who threatened to resign his post in 2017 after Trump attempted to pressure him to fire Mueller. In a tweet\u00a0on Sunday, Trump said Mueller \u201cshould not testify\u201d before Congress, even though he\u2019d signaled last week that he would not stand in the way of such a hearing. House Democrats this week\u00a0moved toward holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over a complete, unredacted version of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence.\u00a0The Justice Department, meanwhile, maintains that the House Judiciary Committee \u201clacks any legislative purpose for seeking the complete investigative files\u201d and that it was inappropriate to \u201copen up the entirety of the investigative file to congressional review.\u201d McConnell defended Barr in his remarks Tuesday, calling him a \u201cdistinguished\u201d public servant and accusing Democrats of\u00a0\u201cundermining the institution of the attorney general itself.\u201d \u201cThe Democrats are angry,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThey seem to be angrier at Bill Barr for doing his job than they are Vladimir Putin.\u201d Notably, McConnell did not touch on any details contained in the second half of the Mueller report on Trump\u2019s extraordinary conduct as president. Mueller ultimately concluded it was not his role to determine whether Trump broke the law, but his report laid out 10 areas of potential obstruction of justice by the president. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called McConnell\u2019s comments an \u201castounding bit of whitewashing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like Richard Nixon saying \u2018let\u2019s move on\u2019 at the height of the investigation of his wrongdoing. Of course he wants to move on. He wants to cover up,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday, vowing to continue pressing for investigations. The Democratic leader also repeatedly hammered McConnell for not putting an election security bill on the floor, chiding Republicans for not taking seriously the threat of Russian interference in the 2020 election.\u00a0Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\u00a0said last week that the Trump administration worked to block bipartisan legislation she co-sponsored with Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) intended to make elections more secure. \u201cIf Leader McConnell is ready to move on to serious things, then how about moving forward with legislation to protect our elections?\u201d Schumer said.",

      "content": " While most of Washington was focused on a House hearing to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress, Senate Republicans on Wednesday confirmed another one of President Donald Trump\u2019s picks for a lifetime court seat \u2015 and once again broke from precedent to get it done. The Senate voted 54-42 to confirm Joseph Bianco to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York. Every Republican voted for him. All but two Democrats \u2015 Sens. Doug Jones (Ala.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) \u2015 opposed him. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Kirsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) did not vote. Bianco\u2019s confirmation marks the third time in history that the Senate has confirmed a judicial nominee over the objections of both of a nominee\u2019s home-state senators. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, didn\u2019t turn in their so-called \u201cblue slips\u201d for Bianco, which are literally blue pieces of paper that signal a senator is ready to move forward with a nominee from his or her home state. Traditionally, the Senate won\u2019t move forward with a judicial nominee unless both blue slips are turned in. Some nominees have advanced with one turned in. \u201cAnother day, another partisan push by Senate Republicans for hard-right nominees to get lifetime appointments on the federal bench,\u201d Schumer said in March, after the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Bianco over his objection. \u201cI will be strongly opposing these nominations when they come to the Senate floor.\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has overseen all three cases of the Senate breaking from this tradition. Earlier this year, he plowed ahead with confirming judges Eric Miller and Paul Matey to circuit courts over the objections of both of their home-state senators. Bianco, 52, is currently a district judge and a member of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump\u2019s judicial selection process by funneling nominees to the White House who oppose abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights. He\u2019s also Trump\u2019s 38th confirmed circuit court judge. That\u2019s more circuit judges than any president has gotten by this point in a first term, and means that one in every six seats on the nation\u2019s circuit courts is now filled by a Trump nominee.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced new legislation on Monday that would raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products nationwide to 21. The bipartisan pair, who both hail from states that have relied on tobacco as a cash crop for generations, said their proposal is driven in large part by the dramatic increase in the use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices by teenagers. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from countless parents who have seen the youth vaping crisis firsthand, and together, Senator Kaine and I are addressing this public health crisis head-on,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Monday announcing the Tobacco-Free Youth Act. \u201cBy making it more difficult for tobacco products to end up in the hands of middle school and high school students, we can protect our children and give them the opportunity to grow and develop into healthy adults. We\u2019re ready for a national debate about the health of our children.\u201d The senators cited figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found 1.5 million more young people smoked e-cigarettes in 2018 than they did in 2017, a precipitous rise that researchers have called unprecedented. Vaping devices far outstripped other tobacco consumption methods, including cigarettes, cigars or smokeless tobacco. \u201cToday, we are coming together to side with young people\u2019s health. With this bipartisan legislation, Senator McConnell and I are working to address one of the most significant public health issues facing our nation today,\u201d Kaine said in a statement. He called the increased age restrictions a \u201ccritical\u201d effort to keep tobacco out of schools and \u201caway from our children.\u201d The proposed act does not have carve-outs that some health advocates had worried would be included. McConnell said last month he wanted the legislation to exempt military members, but the measure introduced Monday would apply to everyone. States would also not be prohibited from passing even tougher laws. Fourteen states and many cities have already raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. Many tobacco and vaping companies have already said they back the proposal to increase the federal sales age. Juul, which has seen a meteoric rise in sales and social clout in recent years, said in April it would support McConnell in his efforts when the plans were first announced. \u201cTobacco 21 laws fight one of the largest contributors to this problem \u2014 sharing by legal-age peers \u2014 and they have been shown to dramatically reduce youth usage rates,\u201d Kevin Burns, Juul\u2019s chief executive, told The New York Times last month. The proposal was cheered by health advocacy groups, including the American Heart Association, which said the legislation would \u201chelp remove tobacco from high schools altogether.\u201d \u201cWe commend Majority Leader McConnell and Sen. Kaine for prioritizing the health of teens and young adults with a bill to raise the national sales age for tobacco products to 21,\u201d Nancy Brown, the CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge strong bipartisan support for this bill as written, and we call on lawmakers to reject any effort to add language that would weaken its impact or benefit tobacco companies.\u201d McConnell touted his new proposal on the Senate floor Monday while explaining the importance of tobacco in Kentucky\u2019s history, noting the new law would not be a \u201czero-sum choice between farmers and public health.\u201d \u201cWe are proud of who we are,\u201d the majority leader said, \u201cBut Kentucky farmers don\u2019t want their children to get hooked on tobacco products while they\u2019re in middle school or high school any more than any parents anywhere want that to happen.\u201d He continued: \u201cKentucky is proud of what we make. But we also take pride in the health and development of our children. And the sad reality is that Kentucky has been the home to the highest rates of cancer in the country.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Anti-tobacco advocates are raising alarms about a bill introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) this week that would raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products nationwide from 18 to 21. While they support the overall goal of the legislation, some advocates worry that a provision in the bill essentially requiring each state to pass a law raising the tobacco-purchasing age to 21 \u2015 on top of the federal statute \u2015 would ultimately be used by tobacco companies to undermine rules governing the sale of certain products like flavored tobacco. McConnell and Kaine, who both hail from states that have relied on tobacco as a cash crop for generations, have pitched the bill as a way to help stem the\u00a0dramatic increase in the use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices by teenagers \u2015 a fast-growing share of the tobacco market that is projected to reach $47 billion by 2025. The senators cited figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found 1.5 million more young people smoked e-cigarettes in 2018 than in 2017, a precipitous rise that researchers have called unprecedented. \u201cBy making it more difficult for tobacco products to end up in the hands of middle school and high school students, we can protect our children and give them the opportunity to grow and develop into healthy adults. We\u2019re ready for a national debate about the health of our children,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Monday announcing the Tobacco-Free Youth Act. The bill is backed by an unusual coalition made up of tobacco industry giants such as Altria and vaping company Juul, as well as major public health groups like the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. Tobacco companies are touting the bill as evidence of their commitment to keeping tobacco products out of the hands of young people. But critics worry that by forcing states to raise their own laws (or else risk not getting federal substance abuse grants), the tobacco industry will be allowed to push poison pill provisions in cities and localities to block stricter rules on the use of tobacco. The fear of some lawmakers and advocates is that the industry is essentially executing a tactical retreat on the minimum age of buying tobacco amid growing pressure from the Food and Drug Administration in order to protect a growing and increasingly profitable share of the market. \u201cWe strongly urge Leader McConnell to join us in cleanly raising the tobacco age to save lives and prevent youth addiction, and work with us on additional efforts, including cracking down on kid-friendly flavors,\u201d Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a statement this week. Vince Willmore, a spokesman for the nonprofit organization Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, echoed the Democrats\u2019 concerns about the bill. He describing the efforts by tobacco companies to weaken regulations in states as a \u201cTrojan horse.\u201d \u201cForcing each state to pass their own law would create both the opportunity and the leverage for tobacco companies to add their special interest provisions,\u201d Willmore added. Fourteen states and many cities have already raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. The tobacco industry and its allies have historically used \u2015 and continue to use \u2015 preemptive strategies to thwart regulations on smoking laws. Earlier this year in Arkansas, for example, the tobacco lobby successfully added a preemption measure that prohibits local governments from passing regulations related to tobacco sales onto a similar law that raised the tobacco-purchasing age to 21. Tobacco lobbyists have pushed \u201cpreemption\u201d measures in other states as well. Juul, in particular, has deployed a small army of lobbyists focused on fighting proposals to ban flavored e-cigarette pods, which are popular with teenagers, as well as other enforcement measures,\u00a0according to The New York Times. Kaine, however, told reporters on Wednesday that the bill would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d allow states and localities to preempt other tobacco regulations. In fact, he said the legislation allows states to enact even stricter rules governing tobacco products. Raising the purchasing age from 18 to 21 \u201cwould be a big win for public health and I think everybody is coming to that position, which is great,\u201d Kaine added. The Virginia senator, whose state includes the headquarters of Altria, argued that creating incentives for states to match federal law on the minimum purchasing age for tobacco would bolster enforcement in states because \u201cif you have an administration that doesn\u2019t care about enforcing the law, then the law is minimally enforced because state and local health officials don\u2019t enforce federal laws.\u201d The FDA already conducts enforcement of federal smoking laws under the Tobacco Control Act,\u00a0which currently prohibits tobacco sales to anyone under 18. The government\u2019s enforcement efforts of the law would be unchanged under the McConnell-Kaine legislation. The effectiveness of proposed FDA regulations governing e-cigarettes at certain stores is also under question in the age of the internet. Thirty-two percent of teens who bought their e-cigarette devices got them online, according to a recent study. Moreover, according to the same study, 64 percent of teens don\u2019t buy their own devices at all \u2015 they get them from friends or family members who have purchased them. A bill introduced by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) earlier this year aims to address teen use of e-cigarettes by requiring an ID check upon delivery of e-cigarettes ordered online. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly characterized comments by a Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids representative. Vince Willmore described efforts by tobacco companies using laws raising the legal smoking age to restrict other regulations on tobacco use as a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d not the McConnell legislation itself.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he would work to fill any Supreme Court vacancy in 2020, an election year, despite his efforts to scuttle Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the bench for that very reason in 2016. \u201cUh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d McConnell said in response to an audience question during an event at the Paducah Chamber of Commerce in Kentucky on Tuesday afternoon. The lawmaker issued a small smile during his answer as guests in the room laughed. He continued: \u201cThe reason I started with the judges ... I mean, if you want to have a long-lasting positive impact on a country, everything else changes.\u201d McConnell\u2019s office did not immediately reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for clarification of his remarks. The senator\u2019s comments are notable, given his rhetoric during the final months of former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in the White House. McConnell refused to hold any debate on Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the vacancy created by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, saying no one should be considered until after that year\u2019s presidential election. Filling the vacancy on the court ultimately fell to President Donald Trump, who named Justice Neil Gorsuch to the bench. McConnell has shifted his story in recent months, saying in an interview with Fox News last October that he didn\u2019t want to \u201cdestroy\u201d Garland, but was following \u201ctradition in America.\u201d \u201cIf you have ... a Senate of a different party than the president, you don\u2019t fill a vacancy created in a presidential year,\u201d McConnell told Fox News host Chris Wallace. \u201cThat went all the way back to 1888.\u201d At the time, he declined to say if he would confirm a Supreme Court nomination in 2020 if Trump were in the midst of a reelection battle. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this year, McConnell called his blocking of Garland the most important thing he\u2019d done in his political career, saying: \u201cI think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.\u201d \u201cThe decision not to fill the Scalia vacancy,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the most consequential thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d McConnell echoed those sentiments on Tuesday and said he hoped his efforts to overhaul America\u2019s judiciary will make a lasting mark on the country\u2019s history. \u201cWhat can\u2019t be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\u201d McConnell said during the event. \u201cSo that\u2019s the most important thing that we\u2019ve done for the country, which cannot be undone.\u201d",

      "content": " Nearly every freshman House Democrat sent a letter on Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) calling on him to bring the sweeping campaign finance and election reform bill passed by the House to the Senate floor for a vote. The For The People Act (H.R. 1) would create a system of publicly financed House elections, expand voting rights by mandating early voting and automatic voter registration, enhance election security and enact ethics reforms like requiring presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns. It passed the House on a 234-193 party-line vote on March 8. Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) has introduced a companion bill in the Senate backed by every Senate Democrat. McConnell, a fierce opponent of campaign finance reform, has attacked the bill a \u201cpower grab\u201d by the Democratic Party and refused to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote.\u00a0 As majority leader, he is under no obligation to bring any piece of legislation to the Senate floor for a vote. The freshmen Democrats calling on McConnell to give their bill a vote in the Senate attacked McConnell as a \u201cbought-and-paid-for\u201d representative of the Washington elite on Wednesday at a press conference hosted by End Citizens United, a pro-campaign finance reform political action committee. \u201cMitch McConnell remains in the pockets of the special interests,\u201d Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cHe won\u2019t even take a meeting with us,\u201d Rose added. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m thinking the only way we can get a meeting with Mitch McConnell is if we take out our checkbooks and max out to him.\u00a0That\u2019s the only reason why he sits down with people cause he is bought-and-paid-for.\u201d Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kansas) said that McConnell \u201ccontinues to defend a rigged system.\u201d New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas (D) added: \u201cMitch McConnell doesn\u2019t know what democracy looks like.\u201d McConnell is even refusing to allow a vote on a piece of the For The People Act that would enhance election security by protecting election infrastructure from potential hacks or other interference, Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) said. \u201cHe has no argument for holding up legislation to protect our democracy from foreign interference,\u201d Malinowski said. \u201cHe is putting party over country.\u201d These House freshmen won election in 2018 by running on issues like campaign finance reform and expanding voting rights. Those calling on McConnell to give the For The People Act a vote in the Senate had previously sent a letter during the 2018 campaign calling on House leadership of both parties to prioritize these issues. McConnell has promised not to bring this bill \u2015 or practically any bill passed by House Democrats \u2015 to the Senate floor.\u00a0While Democrats want a vote on their bill, they also plan to use McConnell\u2019s refusal in their 2020 election campaign to showcase their support for reforming Washington and the Republican Party\u2019s opposition.",

      "content": " Jon Stewart skewered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) response to efforts to safeguard funding for 9/11 first responders, accusing him of acting without compassion for the victims. In a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, the comedian addressed his now-viral speech before House lawmakers during which he shamed congressional leaders for dragging their feet when it comes to permanently reauthorizing the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Stewart took direct aim at McConnell during an interview with host Chris Wallace. \u201cIn terms of getting the 9/11 bills passed, Mitch McConnell has been the white whale of this since 2010,\u201d he said, referring to his alleged attempt to use previous reauthorization of the funding stream as leverage to accomplish separate GOP initiatives. Stewart said Washington leaders\u2019 \u201ccynicism\u201d was part of the reason the issue is fraught with emotion. On Tuesday, the former \u201cDaily Show\u201d host spoke to House Judiciary Committee members at a hearing on the Victim Compensation Fund. In February, the fund\u2019s administrator announced that it is running out of money \u201cto pay all current and projected claims at the same levels as under current policies and procedures.\u201d The VCF \u201cprovides financial compensation for those who were physically injured or died as a result of an eligible 9/11-related illness,\u201d according to its website. In some cases it may cover medical expenses for first responders who are sick and dying from illnesses believed to have been contracted as a result of the terror attacks. The separate World Trade Center Health Program is the primary line of coverage for medical claims. Stewart used the opportunity to call out legislators for \u201cdelay after delay after delay of searching for some must-pass bill to tuck their issue into because this Congress, this Senate didn\u2019t think it was important enough to pass on its own.\u201d \u201cLet me tell you something: We are done with that,\u201d he warned. Though the committee unanimously approved the bill in a scheduled vote the next day, McConnell said he hadn\u2019t spent much time considering the measure. \u201cGosh, I hadn\u2019t looked at that lately,\u201d he said earlier in the day, according to NBC News. \u201cI\u2019ll have to. We\u2019ve always dealt with that in a compassionate way, and I assume we will again.\u201d Stewart dismissed the response altogether. \u201cI want to make it clear that this has never been dealt with compassionately by Senator McConnell,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe has always held out to the very last minute, and only then, under intense lobbying and public shaming, has he even deigned to move on it.\u201d Before moving on to the Senate, the bill will need to pass a full House vote, which has been set for July, according to CBS New York.

Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, tore into Republican lawmakers during an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d for their reluctance to reauthorize the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund\u00a0(VCF),\u00a0which is facing a significant funding lapse. \u201cI want to make it clear that this has never been dealt with compassionately by Sen.

And we will address it again. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s all bent out of shape.\u201d Host Steve Doocy noted that Stewart was outraged that so few members attended a House subcommittee hearing about the bill last week, where he gave an emotional testimony about the needs of 9/11 responders and their families. Out of the subcommittee\u2019s 14 members, just half showed up, CBS News reported. \u201cWell, that frequently happens because members have a lot of things going on at the same time,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt sounds to me like he\u2019s looking for some way to take offense. There\u2019s no way we won\u2019t address this problem appropriately.\u201d Asked if the VCF will be fully funded, McConnell said yes. The Never Forget the Heroes Act of 2019 would ensure the fund can deliver benefits to 9/11 responders for the next 70 years. Stewart has visited Capitol Hill several times in recent months to advocate on behalf of the fund\u2019s beneficiaries. Roughly 45,000 people are suffering from at least one 9/11-related chronic health condition and more than 10,000 have been certified with a 9/11-related cancer, Stewart wrote in an op-ed for the New York Daily News in February. The Justice Department announced earlier that month that a lack of funding for the VCF would lead to compensation cuts as large 50 to 70 percent. A total of 835 awards have been reduced as of May 31, The Associated Press reported. \u201cYour indifference is costing these men and women their most valuable commodity: time,\u201d Stewart told lawmakers on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing they\u2019re running out of.\u201d The House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bill on Wednesday.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 It\u2019s possible to shame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into action despite his record of blocking Democratic initiatives and nominations, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday. \u201cIt seems Jon Stewart is having an effect on him on the 9/11 bill, so yes, I think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Schumer told HuffPost during a news conference on Capitol Hill, referring to the former host of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, tore into McConnell last week during an interview on Fox News. He accused the Senate majority leader of slow-walking a bill that would authorize compensation for first responders and survivors still suffering from conditions related to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. \u201cMany things that Congress does happen at the last minute,\u201d McConnell said Monday in response. \u201cWe\u2019ve never failed to address this issue. And we will address it again. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s all bent out of shape.\u201d McConnell has not yet said when he\u2019ll bring to the floor legislation that would permanently reauthorize the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which is nearing depletion and expires in 2020. Congress has previously dealt with the matter by attaching it to other must-pass bills. The Kentucky Republican has also steadfastly refused to allow votes on any Democratic bills passed by the House, including legislation on gun control, equal pay,\u00a0lower prescription drug prices, and additional protections for preexisting health conditions. The blockade has frustrated many House Democrats, who have taken to accusing McConnell of turning the upper chamber into a \u201clegislative graveyard.\u201d Schumer, meanwhile, has repeatedly called on the GOP leader to bring to the floor legislation that would beef up election security following special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. But on that matter, too, McConnell has refused to comply, calling such bills duplicative and unnecessary. Schumer told reporters Tuesday that Democrats will go to the floor to try to bring up election security bills by unanimous consent, requiring GOP senators to block them. He also said Democrats would push for additional election security funding in the upcoming budget and appropriations negotiations. But there\u2019s little Democrats can actually do to force McConnell to allow a vote. Attempts to shame McConnell into action haven\u2019t worked well for Democrats in the past. He refused to grant Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, a confirmation hearing. He also successfully blocked several of Obama\u2019s proposed initiatives during his second term. What has moved McConnell, however, has been substantial pressure from other GOP senators. The debate over how to advance Democratic priorities if McConnell retains a majority in the Senate in 2020 has become an issue on the campaign trail. Former Vice President Joe Biden this week reiterated his belief in bipartisan cooperation but also said compromise is not always possible. \u201cYou have to go out and beat these folks if they don\u2019t agree with you by making your case, and that\u2019s what presidents are supposed to do, to persuade the public,\u201d Biden said Monday at an event in D.C., adding that \u201cyou can shame people to do things the right way.\u201d But one former Obama administration official disagreed. \u201cMaybe you can shame people,\u201d tweeted Alyssa Mastromonaco, who worked as White House deputy chief of staff. \u201cYou can\u2019t shame McConnell. It would be dope to find a path to greater bipartisanship but this isn\u2019t that path.\u201d",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday dismissed the idea of modern-day reparations for slavery, arguing that civil rights legislation and former President Barack Obama\u2019s election show they are unnecessary. \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\u201d McConnell told reporters at a press conference. The senator then listed the ways in which he felt America\u2019s slave-holding past has been addressed already. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We\u2019ve elected an African American president,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that, and I don\u2019t think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it.\u201d On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is slated to hold\u00a0a hearing on reparations featuring testimonies from actor Danny Glover and author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who thrust the matter back into the national dialogue with his 2014 Atlantic essay \u201cThe Case for Reparations.\u201d The hearing will fall on Juneteenth, the American holiday commemorating the emancipation of slaves. It is expected to cover HR 40, a bill sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) to establish a commission to study reparations and develop relevant proposals. However, in his Tuesday remarks, McConnell argued it would \u201cbe pretty hard to figure out who to compensate.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had waves of immigrants as well who\u2019ve come to the country and experienced dramatic discrimination in one kind or another, so no, I don\u2019t think reparations are a good idea,\u201d he said. According to the committee, Wednesday\u2019s hearing will \u201cexamine, through open and constructive discourse, the legacy of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, its continuing impact on the community and the path to restorative justice.\u201d Reparations have become a hot topic among 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, many of whom have been pressed on whether they\u2019d support the idea. So far, candidates including former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens.\u00a0Cory Booker (N.J.),\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0(N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.),\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0(Minn.),\u00a0Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(Mass.) have expressed support for either implementing reparations of some kind or at least considering them.",

It was the first hearing held on slavery reparations in over a decade. \u201cThe Case For Reparations,\u201d Coates\u2019 2014 essay for The Atlantic, is largely credited with bringing the issue back into the national spotlight. \u201cEnslavement reigned for 250 years on this shore,\u201d Coates said in his remarks. \u201cFor a century after the Civil War black people were subjected to a relentless campaign of terror \u2014 a terror that extended well into the lifetime of Majority Leader McConnell.\u201d He spoke to the continued impact of slavery that occurred during McConnell\u2019s lifetime: the execution of 14-year-old George Stinney in 1944; the blinding of Isaac Woodard by police in 1946; \u201ca regime premised on electoral theft\u201d in McConnell\u2019s birth state of Alabama; the harassment and jailing of those who pushed for civil rights legislation. \u201cThat is the thing about Sen. McConnell\u2019s \u2018something,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 150 years ago and it was right now.\u201d Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have expressed support for the implementation or consideration of some form of slavery reparations, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated support for the bill. If passed in the House, the bill is unlikely to find support in the Senate. \u201cThe question really is, not whether we will be tied to the \u2018somethings\u2019 of our past, but whether we are courageous enough to be tied to the whole of them,\u201d Coates concluded.",

      "subtitle": "Republicans and Democrats alike are trying to turn the senator from Kentucky into American politics\u2019 ultimate antagonist.",
      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Democrats are preparing to make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a central villain of their push to win total control of Congress in 2020, an effort top advisers to the Kentucky Republican say will only further his efforts to become a conservative hero. \u201cMitch McConnell is a transcendent figure in American politics; he is a unifier. He unites everyone in hatred and animosity toward him, including Republicans,\u201d said Matt Canter, a Democratic pollster at Global Strategy Group who recently conducted a survey that could guide Democrats\u2019 anti-McConnell efforts. \u201cHe\u2019s a walking, talking definition of what people hate about Washington and the corrupt political system today.\u201d The focus on painting McConnell as corrupt and obstructionist, on display in early Democratic messaging, coincides with efforts by McConnell\u2019s own advisers to portray him as a Grim Reaper slashing down progressive dreams as he runs for reelection in Kentucky. The dual pushes seem likely to ensure that McConnell\u2019s record as the leader of the Senate is at the center of the 2020 elections, especially in the states that will ultimately determine who wins a majority of seats in the upper chamber. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning Democrats need to win a net of at least three seats in 2020. The poll, paid for by the Democratic campaign finance reform group End Citizens United, surveyed 1,200 voters across twelve presidential battleground states. The initial result found Democrats with a 3 percentage point advantage on a generic ballot for Congress. After being exposed to messaging about McConnell, the Democratic advantage grew to 12 percentage points. That was more effective than messages about President Donald Trump (6 percentage points) or congressional Republicans overall (9 percentage points). McConnell\u2019s approval rating among swing-state voters in the survey is just 26%, with 50% viewing him unfavorably. Among independents, just 18% view him favorably, and 58% have a negative opinion. In counties that swung from former President Barack Obama to President Trump, his approval rating is 25%, while 53% have a negative opinion. End Citizens United is presenting the findings to Democratic congressional leaders, as well as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the anti-McConnell focus is already clear in early messaging from Democratic Senate candidates. Three highly touted Democratic Senate candidates \u2015 Iowa\u2019s Theresa Greenfield, Texas\u2019 M.J. Hegar and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon \u2015 all focus on McConnell\u2019s influence in their campaign launch videos. Hegar refers to her potential opponent, Sen. John Cornyn, as \u201cthat tall guy lurking behind Mitch McConnell in basically every single video.\u201d \u201cHe calls himself \u2018Big John,\u2019 but he shrinks out of the way while Mitch McConnell gets in the way of anything actually getting done in our government,\u201d Hegar says in the video. Gideon highlighted McConnell\u2019s promise of financial support for GOP Sen. Susan Collins, while Greenfield claimed her opponent, Sen. Joni Ernst, voted with McConnell 99% of the time. While McConnell has been a prominent Democratic boogeyman since at least the start of Obama\u2019s administration, the Democratic base is increasingly aware of McConnell after his starring roles in the blockade of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and the successful nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The DSCC\u2019s fundraising messages now focus heavily on McConnell. \u201cWhen President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t even let him have a hearing,\u201d reads one of the dozens of McConnell-centric Facebook ads the DSCC is running. \u201cNow that Donald Trump is in power, Mitch McConnell is going NUCLEAR by changing the rules to pack our courts with extreme right-wing judges like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the bench instead.\u201d Equally noteworthy is who Ernst and Hegar don\u2019t mention in their videos: Trump. The use of McConnell but not the president (Trump won both Iowa and Texas by fairly substantial margins in 2016) shows how Democrats believe McConnell has become a fairly nonpartisan villain, a symbol of corruption and, as one strategist put it, \u201cthe least sympathetic man in Washington.\u201d Democrats hope they can use McConnell\u2019s reputation to turn even swing voters who still like and trust the president against the GOP. (The End Citizens United poll found swing voters were more likely to agree with Democratic arguments when they mentioned McConnell and the corrupting influence of money on politics.) Republicans, including close McConnell allies, say the veteran senator will be able to turn the Democratic attacks to his advantage as he runs for reelection in Kentucky, potentially against Democratic Air Force veteran Amy McGrath. \u201cI think the left has turned him into a deity on the right. The more they highlight what he\u2019s doing in the Senate, the more popular he becomes,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff who remains one of the senator\u2019s top political lieutenants. \u201cEvery time Donald Trump attacks Nancy Pelosi, it makes her stronger. When Democrats attack Mitch McConnell, it makes him stronger.\u201d McConnell\u2019s team has been playing up his status as a b\u00eate noire of the left. The senator himself told voters in Kentucky to \u201cthink of me as the Grim Reaper,\u201d and his reelection campaign has been using \u201cCocaine Mitch,\u201d the infamous nickname bestowed upon him by disgraced coal baron Don Blankenship, as a way to sell merchandise. He also eagerly announced his willingness to fill a Supreme Court seat in 2020 after using the election-year status of Garland\u2019s nomination as a fig leaf for blocking it. \u201cOh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d McConnell told a Kentucky questioner who asked about the plan for a possible Supreme Court vacancy. (CNN noted the senator \u201ctook a long sip of what appeared to be iced tea\u201d before answering the question \u201cwith a smile.\u201d) McConnell\u2019s allies believe he\u2019s been at his weakest when Trump and rank-and-file Republicans have questioned his effectiveness, such as when Obamacare repeal failed in the Senate in the summer of 2017. But they argue his work to push through Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination has restored his approval rating among Republicans, making his reelection in Kentucky safer (no GOP primary challenger has emerged yet) and strengthening his hand when dealing with donors and candidates across the country. But Democrats and Republicans are now both emphasizing his skill and importance. (The portrait of McConnell as master manipulator and strategist ignores the aforementioned failure to repeal Obamacare, as well as his occasional electoral missteps.) Beyond the question of McConnell\u2019s strength, Holmes also said he thinks it\u2019s impossible for Democrats in states like Iowa and Texas to shift the conversation from the all-encompassing Trump to the relatively low-key McConnell. \u201cWhen you can go after party leaders, you\u2019re making a straight partisan play to solidify your base. But it doesn\u2019t go further than that,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWith Donald Trump running for reelection, the idea that voters are going to ignore that and then pick and choose based on party leaders, that\u2019s absurd to me.\u201d The End Citizens United poll, conducted by Global Strategy Group, was an online survey of more than 1,200 voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The survey, part of a broader effort by End Citizens United to develop the best Democratic message on corruption and money in politics, also found that voters are evenly split between Trump and Democrats on who they can trust to crack down on corruption and the influence of money in politics. \u201cThis dynamic provides a clear opportunity for Democratic candidates to shape and win the debate, while also demonstrating the danger of ceding the issue to Republicans,\u201d Global Strategy Group\u2019s pollsters wrote in a memo. \u201cCommitting to enacting these policies and making these issues a focus of their campaigns will be critical for Democrats to win over persuadable voters in 2020.\u201d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " The biggest villain at the first presidential debate of the 2020 campaign surprisingly wasn\u2019t President Donald Trump. It was Mitch McConnell. The Republican Senate majority leader, who blocked scores of President Barack Obama\u2019s initiatives and even his Supreme Court nominee, dominated discussion among the 10 Democratic presidential candidates who sparred on stage Wednesday night in Miami. Much of the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda hinges on McConnell even if Democrats manage to win back the White House in 2020. Ambitious progressive proposals like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d or the Green New Deal, for example, stand little chance of becoming law given near-unanimous Republican opposition and the filibuster, the upper chamber\u2019s long-standing supermajority requirement. That\u2019s why MSNBC host Rachel Maddow asked candidates who participated in the first of two Democratic presidential debates on Wednesday how they planned to deal with the notoriously recalcitrant Kentucky Republican if they are elected president. It\u2019s a tough question not only because of the sheer difficulty Democrats face in flipping the Senate but also because they would have to win seats in red states like Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, which they need to be able to enact big policy change. Few candidates had good answers. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who enacted universal pre-K in his city, urged the Democratic Party to stop acting \u201clike the party of the elites and be the party of the working people.\u201d He urged Democratic candidates to campaign in red states in order to \u201cput pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward\u201d by a Democratic president. Under McConnell, Republicans have confirmed dozens upon dozens of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees \u2015 including some rated extreme and unqualified to serve as a judge. Even vulnerable GOP senators like Cory Gardner of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who are up for reelection next year, have supported them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) confirmed she had \u201ca plan\u201d to deal with McConnell if he remains majority leader in 2020, echoing her favorite line on the campaign trail so far. But she, too, gave a weak answer, especially considering that so much of her policy agenda hinges on being able to pass things in the Senate. \u201cShort of a Democratic majority, you better understand the fight still goes on,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.\u201d  Sure, Democrats face a better Senate map in 2022. More GOP senators are retiring, especially from states Democrats consider increasingly winnable, such as Pennsylvania and Georgia. But that doesn\u2019t account for what happens in 2021. Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has advocated for accomplishing things in a bipartisan manner, said that \u201chuge majorities\u201d of Americans are needed in order to push through transformative changes in Washington. But he cautioned against fighting for liberal priorities like universal health care. \u201cWe need real solutions, not impossible promises,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe need to put forth ideas that work.\u201d Asked how he would get past McConnell, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) responded by highlighting his work helping pass a criminal justice reform bill in the Senate, an effort that was backed by an unusual coalition of both Democrats and Republicans, including Trump. \u201cI have taken on tough problems that people said we cannot achieve it. I have been able to get things accomplished,\u201d Booker said. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, though, was the only candidate who, when asked about McConnell, touted his support for getting rid of the filibuster (Warren and Booker have also called for doing so). \u201cWe have to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something it. Our towns are burning and fields are flooding, and Miami is inundated. We have to understand this is a climate crisis.\u201d As part of his strategy in taking on McConnell, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) made an electoral argument that Democrats ought to appeal more to blue-collar workers in red states. \u201cIf you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out and Lindsey Graham out, you have to have a blue-collar party to go into the textile communities in South Carolina.\u201d Democrats are preparing to make McConnell a central villain of their push to win back the Senate in 2020, focusing on painting him as corrupt and an obstructionist. Polling conducted by Democrats shows anti-McConnell ads are more effective among voters than messages about Trump or congressional Republicans overall. Three highly touted Democratic Senate candidates \u2015 Iowa\u2019s Theresa Greenfield, Texas\u2019 M.J. Hegar and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon \u2015 have all focused on McConnell\u2019s influence in their campaign launch videos. The question about how to handle McConnell has tripped up former Vice President Joe Biden as well. The ex-senator drew mockery from his former Democratic colleagues earlier this month when he claimed that Republicans would become more accommodating once Trump was out of office.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In the end, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0had to cave. Faced with a rebellion from moderates in her own party \u2014 as well as Republicans in both chambers who wouldn\u2019t give in to a single provision \u2014 Pelosi pulled a border aid bill on Thursday that many House Democrats preferred and passed the Senate version of the legislation 305-102, with 95 Democrats and seven Republicans voting no. On Tuesday, the House passed a bill aimed at addressing the humanitarian crisis involving undocumented immigrants detained at the border. The vote was mostly along party lines, 234-195. The next day, the Senate passed its own bipartisan version of the bill, drafted by Sens. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 84-8. In retrospect, that was the moment when Pelosi lost. The California Democrat said there was no chance the House would simply pass the Senate bill. Instead, she said Democrats would pass a new bill with only a few changes to the Senate legislation. Those changes would have put additional restrictions on how the administration could spend the about $4.5 billion in the bill and would mandate basic conditions for border detention facilities \u2015 provisions that progressives fought earlier this week to make sure were in the House legislation. But about a dozen and a half moderates in the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus said they would vote no on the new Democratic bill. Republicans in the House had also shown a resolve to not go along with anything but the Senate bill, which President Donald Trump said was the only border aid measure he would sign. That left Pelosi without the votes to pass even her compromise legislation, and she was forced to pull the bill from floor consideration. From there, the only thing the speaker could do \u2014 if she wanted to pass a border bill before the July Fourth recess \u2014 was put the Senate bill up for a vote. \u201cWe will not engage in the same disrespectful behavior that the Senate did in ignoring our priorities,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats on Thursday. \u201cIn order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill.\u201d \u201cThe children come first,\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have to make sure that the resources needed to protect the children are available.\u201d Democrats were adamant that the children should come first, but not everyone was in agreement that Democrats should give in to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other Republicans. Progressive Caucus Co-Chairman Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) asked in a tweet Thursday when the Problem Solvers Caucus had become \u201cthe Child Abuse Caucus.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t they want to at least fight against contractors who run deplorable facilities? Kids are the only ones who could lose today,\u201d Pocan said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also criticized the decision to pass the Senate bill, tweeting that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d should the House vote on the Senate bill without negotiations. \u201cHell no,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cThat\u2019s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do.\u201d But Pelosi\u2019s decision to pass the Senate bill was an acknowledgment that no amount of time was going to make McConnell give in. The Senate majority leader was adamant that Republicans would not negotiate. \u201cWe did not, in the end, continue to play political games over this,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThey did. And it\u2019s their problem to solve.\u201d He noted that Pelosi had spent time on Thursday talking to Vice President Mike Pence about ensuring that at least some of the Democratic requests could be handled administratively. It\u2019s unclear whether Pelosi received any assurances in that regard, but the guardrails to stop the administration from transferring funds to other border purposes or to establish standards for treating children detained at the border aren\u2019t in the Senate bill.",

      "author": "Jennifer Bendery",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans chalked up a major win on Thursday when the Supreme Court gave its blessing to\u00a0extreme partisan gerrymandering. They largely have Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to thank. The court\u2019s 5-4 ruling broke down along partisan lines, with the five conservative justices holding the majority opinion. Republicans have done far more gerrymandering than Democrats in the past decade and currently have the power to draw many more congressional districts than Democrats. If this trend continues beyond the 2020 elections, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will effectively entrench GOP rule in states all over the country. We wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for McConnell, whose unwavering focus on remaking the nation\u2019s federal courts to benefit Republicans \u2015 democracy be damned \u2015 is paying off. One of the court\u2019s conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch, wouldn\u2019t even be on the court if it weren\u2019t for McConnell. Gorsuch filled a seat that was supposed to go to President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. But when that seat opened up in February 2016 after then-Justice Antonin Scalia died, McConnell announced he would block any Obama replacement. He and Senate Republicans spent the next year denying a hearing and a vote to Garland \u2015 an unprecedented level of obstruction aimed at a sitting president \u2015 and eventually let President Donald Trump fill the seat with Gorsuch in 2017. This was after McConnell changed the Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch, and after McConnell boasted that \u201cone of my proudest moments\u201d was looking Obama in the eye and telling him he would block his Supreme Court pick. If Garland had made it onto the court and Trump had only been able to fill one Supreme Court seat instead of the two he\u2019s filled, Thursday\u2019s ruling likely would have been the opposite: a 5-4 ruling that severe partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional. That was certainly the opinion of the four liberal-leaning justices, who, led by Justice Elena Kagan, warned of the corrosive effect gerrymandering is having on American democracy. \u201cOf all times to abandon the Court\u2019s duty to declare the law, this was not the one,\u201d Kagan wrote in a blistering dissenting opinion. \u201cThe practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court\u2019s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to quantify how far the ripple effects of McConnell\u2019s stolen Supreme Court seat will reach. Gorsuch was the deciding vote in at least two major cases in 2018, when the court narrowly upheld Trump\u2019s travel ban and, separately, upheld the rights of anti-abortion centers. Thursday\u2019s decision means Republicans are poised to win more House and Senate seats going forward. It means it will be harder for federal courts to intervene in gerrymandering that intentionally deprives black people of political power, as long as people claim the district was drawn for partisan gain. It means McConnell\u2019s calculation that prioritizing putting conservatives into lifetime federal court seats, even if they are embarrassingly unqualified, even if it requires blowing up the rules to do it, even if it means pretending your actions are guided by principles instead of bad faith arguments, will all be worth it. \u201cMcConnell, who knows that Republicans can\u2019t win in a fair set of elections, has focused single-mindedly on stacking the deck for generations after he is gone, and the policies he represents have been rejected by voters,\u201d said Norm Ornstein, a political scientist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington D.C., conservative think tank. Ornstein went on a Twitter tirade after the court\u2019s ruling on gerrymandering, accusing the justices of giving too much leverage to Republicans at the expense of the public. \u201cI see it as a true perversion of a Republican form of democracy,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cCitizens are supposed to choose their representatives and this is distortion in major ways.\u201d McConnell told Capitol Hill reporters Thursday that he was pleased with the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThere is no such thing as a nonpartisan gerrymander,\u201d he said, citing Democrats winning the House in 2018 despite GOP-led redistricting efforts. \u201cThe problem is overstated.\u201d He\u2019s right that Democrats won more votes and flipped hundreds of seats in state legislatures in the 2018 elections. But they should have won more. Republicans won about 16 more U.S. House seats than expected and may have held onto as many as seven state House chambers thanks to those districts being drawn to give the GOP a built-in advantage, per a March 2019 analysis by The Associated Press. McConnell was an unexpected focus in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, where moderators asked each of the candidates how they would deal with him if elected president. None had a good answer. Igor Bobic contributed reporting.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is calling on Nike to reverse its decision to pull its Independence Day-themed shoes, pledging that if they do, he will make the first purchase. The Air Max 1 USA featured prominent red, white and blue colors and depicted an American flag with 13 stars, commonly known as the \u201cBetsy Ross flag,\u201d on its heels. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans, I think we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d McConnell told reporters at an event in Lexington, Kentucky, according to the Lexington Herald Leader. \u201cI hope Nike either releases these shoes or some other shoe maker picks up the flag, puts it on a pair of shoes and starts selling it. I\u2019ll make the first order.\u201d Nike canceled production after Colin Kaepernick, a Nike endorser and former NFL quarterback, told company officials that he and others found the symbol offensive as it connected to an era of slavery in America.\u00a0The flag, which features 13 stars referring to the 13 original colonies, was flown during a period of American history entrenched in the practice of slavery. Nike made Kaepernick the face of its \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign in 2018, after he was widely criticized over his protest of police brutality against black Americans during the 2016-2017 NFL season, during which he kneeled during the national anthem. Kapernick was a free agent during the 2017-2018 season. Others have weighed in on Nike\u2019s decision to pull the Independence Day-themed shoes. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) expressed his outrage in a series of tweets, and pulled financial incentives for Nike to build a new manufacturing plant in the state. \u201cArizona\u2019s economy is doing just fine without Nike. We don\u2019t need to suck up to companies that consciously denigrate our nation\u2019s history,\u201d he said. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News show host, called Nike\u2019s decision \u201cpathetic,\u201d adding that neither she nor her family would ever purchase the company\u2019s shoes again. MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d anchor Joe Scarborough denounced Nike on Twitter. \u201cPC madness is accelerating just in time for 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump feeds on your reflexive Wokeness.\u201d But in an interview with CBSN, Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro praised the shoe company\u2019s decision. \u201cI was glad to see that. And my hope is that they didn\u2019t just do it to do it. They understand the significance there. And look, there are a lot of things in our history that are still very painful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Confederate Flag that still flies in some places, and is used as a symbol. And I believe we need to move towards an inclusive America that understands that pain.\u201d",

Why don\u2019t we put it on the floor of the Senate in honor of the women who won the World Cup? Why don\u2019t we do that, Leader McConnell?\u201d Schumer said.

      "author": "Akbar Shahid Ahmed",
      "content": " Congress is about to put historic pressure on Saudi Arabia for the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating military campaign in its desperately poor neighboring country of Yemen and other excesses, such as the alleged torture and sexual assault of detained female activists \u2015 unless Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his lieutenants intervene. It\u2019s a critical test of whether the U.S. can hold foreign partners accountable for repugnant and destabilizing behavior enabled by American security guarantees and a potentially telling moment for a Republican Party that presents its hawkish approach to global affairs as fundamentally moral. Over the next two weeks, the Democrat-controlled House will finalize its version of this year\u2019s defense authorization act, a piece of legislation that\u2019s often called \u201cmust-pass\u201d because it greenlights continued funding for the military. Lawmakers skeptical of the Saudis are focused on three amendments to the bill: a yearlong ban on selling U.S. bombs to Riyadh and its chief partner in the bloody Yemen intervention, the United Arab Emirates; no more money for the two main aspects of U.S. support for that effort, intelligence-sharing and logistical help; and a requirement for the Trump administration to name all people it knows to be involved in the assassination of Khashoggi and place sanctions on them \u2015 a move that would likely target people beyond the 17 Saudi officials already blacklisted for the murder and possibly affect even the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Although many Democrats and a handful of Republicans have spent months criticizing the prince for his reported role in the killing and have spent years highlighting alleged war crimes and the development of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, Capitol Hill hasn\u2019t yet formally penalized Saudi Arabia. It instead has advanced\u00a0historic but largely symbolic measures to signal disapproval. President Donald Trump used an emergency declaration in May to torpedo the policy with the greatest real-world impact, a hold that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) placed last year on $2 billion worth of weapons for the Saudis and the UAE. Angry with Trump\u2019s disregard for legally enshrined procedure on arms sales and still eager to show Riyadh that misdeeds have consequences, members of Congress see the process of passing the defense bill as a way to force change. \u201cI\u2019m reasonably confident that we can get it done in the House,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who authored the amendments on arms sales and sanctions. Support from mainstream Democratic leaders is bolstering Malinowski\u2019s suggestions and Rep. Ro Khanna\u2019s (D-Calif.) bill to defund U.S. assistance in Yemen. House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who\u2019s usually been sympathetic to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations competing with Iran, supports Malinowki\u2019s amendments, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who runs the House Intelligence Committee, has blessed Khanna\u2019s plan, which will help weaken the common criticism that cutting off intelligence support for the Yemen campaign threatens important counterterrorism work.\u00a0Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who as chair of the House Rules Committee plays a big role in deciding what legislation gets considered, has long called for the U.S. to reassess its cozy relationship with the Saudis. There could be tweaks and snafus in the process of getting the amendments attached to the defense bill. One or all could be put up for a vote by the full House to signal strong support, including from Republicans, rather than simply passed in leadership\u2019s package of scores of non-controversial additions.\u00a0Other Saudi-related initiatives currently receiving less attention could attract sudden interest.\u00a0And arguments between progressives and centrists over the total approved defense spending could delay passage of the overall legislation. But the real dispute will come when representatives of the two chambers gather to reconcile their versions of the defense bill and craft a compromise that can make it to Trump\u2019s desk. This is the first time in this presidency that one of these measures has had to make it through a House and Senate controlled by different parties. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who is a key Republican in the process as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to do anything related to Yemen,\u201d said Kate Kizer, the policy director at the nonprofit Win Without War. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a battle.\u201d McConnell, Inhofe and other GOP power players on foreign policy, such as Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, largely hew to Trump\u2019s line that the U.S. relationship with the Saudis is too important to be derailed over matters like a high-profile murder in a diplomatic facility. Some influential members of the caucus, notably Sens. Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are resisting that kind of cynicism, but most Republicans are following McConnell\u2019s cue. Come conference time \u2015 when Inhofe, his counterpart Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Reps. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) negotiate over the final form of the defense bill \u2015 danger looms for the efforts to mandate a change of course by the Saudis and their allies. \u201cGiven McConnell does MBS\u2019 and this White House\u2019s bidding, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll try to maneuver to keep these provisions out of the final bill [and]... steamroll the House,\u201d a Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity, using a popular acronym for the Saudi prince. \u201cNow with our new majority, we will have key Democratic leaders fighting to keep these provisions in.\u201d Were Republicans to quash serious restrictions out of concern over U.S. national security and relationships in a strategic region \u2015 or just to avoid angering Trump and big donors in the defense industry \u2015 they would be shielding a dictator and encouraging his ilk to commit even more brutal excesses. They might not, of course, see that as a problem. The question for the fate of the monthslong congressional campaign for accountability is whether its proponents in the GOP are as serious about justice as they purport to be in public. So far, Risch has felt pressured enough that he has claimed he will offer his own road map for addressing Saudi behavior, but Young has struggled to advance a bill he and Menendez designed to alter Saudi behavior. McConnell\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. For Democrats, what counts is how much they prioritize the measures during dealmaking as they throw their revitalized strength behind other major concerns, such as\u00a0preventing a war with Iran and challenging Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members, and whether the party can keep its own disparate ideological factions united while securing the kind of limited GOP support it has had in the past on Saudi-related issues. Engel\u2019s decision to support the weapon transfer ban was a striking turn that suggested a more assertive approach from leadership after he abandoned an effort to present a bill with a high-ranking Republican that would have been more lenient to the Saudis. His choice also reflects the party\u2019s shifting dynamics: as Engel faces two primary challengers who are blasting him as a hawk, the 16-term lawmaker \u201chas a new sense of urgency,\u201d a peace advocate who is tied into congressional circles told HuffPost. Antiwar and human rights activists are closely watching whether Reed, the top Democrat on defense issues, will also indicate more support for their causes by fighting to keep an end to U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE Yemen campaign in the bill. (Last year, Trump responded to public pressure over the conflict by ending the clearest element of U.S. assistance: aerial refueling for the Arab states\u2019 bombing sprees. But just months ago, the president vetoed successful bipartisan legislation to pull U.S. forces out of the war altogether.) Given the furor and discussions among senators of even tougher proposals targeting the Saudis, Republicans could see the Democratic amendments as relatively moderate and something they could support, said Malinowski, who entered Congress just six months ago and who was the main human rights official in President Barack Obama\u2019s State Department. \u201cI think there\u2019s broad consensus among Democrats, including leadership, that we need to do something,\u201d Malinowski said. \u201cAnd significant concern on the Republican side as well.\u201d",

Andy Barr \u2015 who received an\u00a0endorsement\u00a0from President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2015 in Kentucky\u2019s 6th District in 2018. Her announcement comes after months of speculation that she might run, including reports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) actively recruited her for the race. McGrath is the first major Democrat to jump into the race against McConnell, who was last challenged by Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in 2014.",

      "content": " Say this about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: He\u2019s consistent, especially when he has a chance to sneak in a dig at former President Barack Obama. That\u2019s what the Kentucky senator did on Tuesday when he was asked for his reaction to an NBC News report\u00a0that showed two of his great-great-grandfathers owned slaves, according to U.S. census records. All told, the two men,\u00a0James McConnell and Richard Daley, owned at least 14 slaves in Limestone County, Alabama. McConnell snidely used the report to declare common ground with Obama. \u201cYou know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,\u201d McConnell said at a press conference. \u201cWe both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.\u201d McConnell is correct about Obama\u2019s position on reparations:\u00a0During the 2008 presidential campaign Obama did speak out against offering them to the descendants of slaves. Instead, he said that the government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools, health care and the economy for all, according to The Associated Press. And while many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have openly called for reparations, Obama stuck by his stance in a 2016 interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates.\u00a0Of course, Obama\u2019s stated reasons for opposing reparations have been practical and political considerations, whereas McConnell has simply argued that \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d As for Obama\u2019s ancestors owning slaves, that\u2019s also correct with a little more nuance. Back in 2007, an amateur genealogical researcher named William Reitwiesner published a history of Obama\u2019s mother\u2019s family suggesting the future president\u2019s great-great-great-great grandfather George Washington Overall owned two slaves in Kentucky,\u00a0The Guardian reported. In addition, Obama\u2019s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother also owned two slaves. However, in 2012, Ancestry.com released a report linking the president to John Punch, America\u2019s first documented African slave for life. CNN reported that the connection came not from Obama\u2019s African-born father, but from his white mother. McConnell has used Obama to shut down any serious discussion of reparations in Congress. Last month, he said that civil rights legislation \u2015 and\u00a0Obama\u2019s presidency\u00a0\u2015 prove reparations are unnecessary.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday responded to the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump\u2019s onslaught of racist tweets by urging both sides of the aisle to avoid \u201coverheated\u201d rhetoric. The Kentucky Republican did not single out the president by name when making his first public comments on the Sunday tweets, in which Trump urged four women of color in Congress to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. But McConnell did call out Democrats in the House, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cFrom the President to the Speaker, to the freshmen members of the House, all of us have a responsibility to elevate the public discourse. Our words do matter,\u201d McConnell told reporters at a weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. Trump\u2019s attacks, which he repeated to reporters Monday and\u00a0continued on Tuesday, didn\u2019t initially name the congresswomen he was targeting, but they were almost certainly Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, all outspoken freshmen who have recently butted heads with Pelosi. Trump\u2019s comments elicited condemnations this week from Democrats \u2015 and even some Republicans \u2015 who agreed the tweets were, in fact, racist. Asked Monday if she thought Trump\u2019s comments were racist, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of McConnell\u2019s leadership team, said, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d But McConnell dodged the question on Tuesday, saying instead he did not believe the president himself is a racist. \u201cWe\u2019re better off talking about the policies of our adversaries,\u201d McConnell said, pointing to proposals supported by progressive House members he said would take the country down the wrong path. When asked if he\u2019d be offended if his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao,\u00a0who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan, were told to go back to where she came from, McConnell again dodged the question. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of legal immigration,\u201d he said, calling it \u201ca fulfilling of the American dream.\u201d Asked if he\u2019d ever use the kind of language Trump has used, McConnell said, \u201cI\u2019m obviously a fan of legal immigration, it\u2019s been a big part of my family for a quarter of a century.\u201d",

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " A Democrat who farms and previously worked as a rural newspaper editor has entered the race to try to upset Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in 2020\u2019s general election, unveiling his campaign with a blunt video. Mike Broihier (BROY-er) announced his candidacy\u00a0Thursday with the release of the video that begins with several people holding chalkboard slates with a noun written on them \u2015 descriptors that include \u201cBitch,\u201d \u201cThug,\u201d \u201cHillbilly\u201d and \u201cQueer.\u201d Broihier, a 57-year-old former Marine, in a voiceover says that McConnell uses \u201clabels to reinforce old prejudices, to divide us, to maintain his grip on power.\u201d The first-time candidate, who moved to Kentucky\u2019s Lincoln County about 14 years ago to farm and worked as an editor at The Interior Journal newspaper, goes on to say he is running \u201cto strip away the labels and strip Mitch McConnell of power.\u201d He said the six-term incumbent has \u201crefined the art of obstruction\u201d and \u201cthrows the rules and 200 years of tradition onto the ash heap of history \u2015 democracy be damned.\u201d \u201cAs a Kentucky farmer, educator and small-town newspaper editor, I\u2019ve developed a greater understanding and respect for the challenges and struggles Kentucky\u2019s working families and rural communities face than Mitch McConnell ever has or ever will,\u201d Broihier said in a separate statement. \u201cTheir lives, their stories are a part of me.\u201d Broihier has embraced an unabashedly progressive platform for a solidly red state, telling The Louisville Courier-Journal that he supports abortion rights, background checks for all gun purchases, legalizing marijuana and the goal of closing the gender pay gap. In comments to\u00a0The Associated Press,\u00a0he denounced the migrant detention centers at the U.S. southern border and said he would have voted against the 2017 package of tax cuts that McConnell helped steer into law. Broihier is the second military veteran to emerge as McConnell\u2019s potential Democratic opponent. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, 44, who last year ran a strong but ultimately unsuccessful race for a House seat against a GOP incumbent,\u00a0entered the race last week. Her candidacy attracted national attention due to her support from major party leaders,\u00a0and her bid has already brought in millions of dollars in donations. But she stumbled out of the gate when she told the Courier-Journal that although she had concerns about Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court last fall, she \u201cprobably would have voted for him.\u201d She walked back her comments hours later, tweeting, \u201cUpon further reflection and further understanding of [Kavanaugh\u2019s] record, I would have voted no.\u201d Broihier told the AP that he absolutely would have voted against Kavanaugh \u2015 who won confirmation on a largely party-line vote \u2015 as well as any other judge \u201cwho just doesn\u2019t accept the fact that the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade (the1973 case legalizing abortion) correctly.\u201d McConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but his campaign posted a tweet Thursday morning saying, \u201cDeleted scene from [Broihier\u2019s] launch video.\u201d The tweet included a photoshopped picture of McGrath holding a chalkboard slate with \u201cFlip Flop\u201d written on it. Broihier\u2019s campaign quickly responded with a video citing McConnell\u2019s \u201cflip-flopping\u201d about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year. He single-handedly blocked outgoing President Barack Obama from filling such a slot in 2016, citing the pending election, but recently said he would not follow that precedent next year as President Donald Trump seeks a second term. Broihier has characterized McGrath as the hand-picked candidate\u201d of Washington\u2019s Democratic establishment and that such backing matters little to Kentucky voters. The state\u2019s primary vote is set for next May. Either Democrat faces an uphill battle against the 77-year-old McConnell. First elected in 1984, his clout in Congress \u2015 and wife Elaine Chao\u2019s post as Trump\u2019s transportation secretary \u2015 pays dividends for Kentucky in terms of federal spending. In 2014, Democrat Alsion Lundergan Grimes \u2015 Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state and a member of a well-known political family \u2015 seemed poised to give him a closely contested race. McConnell defeated her by 15 percentage points. He also should benefit from sharing next year\u2019s ballot with Trump, who carried the state in 2016 by almost 30 points.",

      "author": "Travis Waldron",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Democrats\u2019 narrow path to victory against unpopular Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2020 runs not through longshot appeals to rural voters the party has lost but through massive turnout in Kentucky\u2019s deep and increasingly blue urban centers,\u00a0the state\u2019s only Democratic congressman told HuffPost in an interview this week. \u201cI would spend all my time [campaigning] in Louisville and Lexington,\u201d Rep. John Yarmuth said. Kentucky\u2019s two largest cities together are home to nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s 4.5 million residents. Both have become reliable Democratic strongholds even as the state has become more and more red over the last two decades. Louisville, Lexington and Frankfort, the state capital, are always a focus for Democratic candidates running statewide in Kentucky, where any hope for victory requires racking up big margins across the three cities and in a handful of smaller blue counties before holding on for dear life in the rural, GOP-heavy parts of the state. But like many Democrats across the country, those candidates have also balanced their appeals to urban voters with attempts to woo back white, rural Kentuckians who\u2019ve abandoned the party in droves as national Democrats have embraced more progressive positions on abortion, gun control, LGBTQ rights and other issues. In Kentucky, those rural voters often take priority in the eyes of statewide candidates. In her 2014 Senate race against McConnell, for instance, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, refused to say whether she had voted for President Barack Obama, a widely derided attempt\u00a0to avoid alienating some voters that instead dampened early enthusiasm for her campaign. McConnell will enter the 2020 cycle as one of the least popular senators in the country, and his abysmal approval ratings in the Bluegrass State have tempted a number of potential challengers, including retired fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who raised more than $2 million in the first 24 hours after her campaign officially launched earlier this month.\u00a0(Former Marine Mike Broihier and Steve Cox, a Louisville health care professional, have also entered the race.) McGrath focused heavily on rural voters\u00a0when she ran for a House seat in 2018 in a district that includes both Lexington and Frankfort but also a number of rural counties surrounding them. That strategy lifted her to an improbable primary victory, but she lost to Republican Rep. Andy Barr in the general election. Her Senate campaign launched with a similar bent: In her first appearance on cable news after the launch, McGrath attempted to drive a wedge between McConnell and President Donald Trump, saying the senator had prevented the president from enacting parts of his agenda that rural Kentuckians supported. She also wavered on whether she would have voted to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, in what may have been an attempt to ingratiate herself to conservative anti-abortion voters in the state. McGrath changed her position on Kavanaugh hours later, and said she wouldn\u2019t have voted for him, but her\u00a0waffling seemed to reduce enthusiasm for her campaign. Meanwhile,\u00a0McConnell had already used McGrath\u2019s declarations that she is pro-choice and a progressive to brand her as too liberal for Kentucky. But even in rural areas, Yarmuth said, McGrath and other McConnell opponents should focus on the few pockets of reliably Democratic voters. \u201cShe spent a lot of money and time in those counties thinking that she could convert Republican votes, and she never did,\u201d he said, of McGrath\u2019s 2018 House race. And although Yarmuth agreed with that strategy at the time, he said, \u201cthat should be a lesson for her in a Senate race. She needs to spend her money where the gettable votes are, not thinking she can convert Republican votes.\u201d Democratic chances are still slim. McConnell\u2019s ability to amass and hold onto political power in Washington has always outpaced his popularity back home, and no Democrat has come within 100,000 votes of beating him since 1990.\u00a0Much of his unfavorability, meanwhile, comes from his right, a problem that may be ameliorated by Trump\u2019s presence on the ballot, given that the president\u2019s popularity in Kentucky dwarfs that of his senior Senate ally. \u201cI would say that if this were not a presidential year, Amy would be a favorite against Mitch,\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cI think she can win, but with Trump on the ballot I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the favorite.\u201d Yarmuth has never seriously considered a statewide bid, he said, and he has no interest in running against McConnell. But he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible for a Democrat to knock off the state\u2019s highest-profile politician. \u201cThe people who\u2019ve looked at it here have said, \u2018A Democrat can win statewide, but it has to be a very surgical race,\u2019\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cAnd what they would say is, \u2018You have to know exactly where your voters are, and you don\u2019t waste any time on persuadables. You need to persuade the ones you know are going to vote for you [to] vote.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s reelection bid may further blunt Democratic efforts to reach rural voters who have traditionally supported them: In eastern Kentucky, where McConnell has at times struggled, the president is popular even among registered Democrats. What may be a liability in the rural areas of the state could be a strength in its metropolitan areas, though. Trump may further hinder McConnell in Louisville and Lexington, where both are unpopular, and\u00a0where Democrats have fared increasingly well in Senate, House, gubernatorial and presidential elections since McConnell launched his political career nearly four decades ago. McConnell hasn\u2019t won Jefferson or Fayette counties, in which Louisville and Lexington are located, respectively, since 2002, and the last time either went for a Republican presidential candidate was 2004. Louisville, like many major metro areas, has become almost solidly blue over the last decade. Yarmuth, whose district encompasses almost the entirety of Louisville and Jefferson County, defeated a five-term Republican incumbent in 2006 and has not faced a serious challenge since. And in 2018, Louisville Democrats scored victories in city council and state legislative races even in the city\u2019s more traditionally Republican-aligned areas. Trump will lose both counties by large margins in 2020, and Democrats in those areas may be further energized by Kentucky\u2019s 2019 statewide elections, in which the party has a chance to defeat\u00a0firebrand conservative Gov. Matt Bevin, who is now considered the most unpopular governor in the country. \u201cBevin is governor because Democrats didn\u2019t turn out. Donald Trump is president because Democrats didn\u2019t turn out in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s where elections are won and lost now. It\u2019s who comes out to vote.\u201d",

He also quashed another proposal to require candidates, their campaign officials and their families to alert federal authorities if they\u2019re offered aid from foreign governments \u2015 something President Donald Trump himself has not committed to doing. The next morning, the hashtag #MoscowMitch began spreading on Twitter, appearing to have been sparked by MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who slammed McConnell in a fiery rant on his \u201cMorning Joe\u201d broadcast. \u201cHe is aiding and abetting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin\u2019s ongoing attempts to subvert American democracy, according to the Republican FBI, CIA, DNI, intel committee,\u201d he said. \u201cAll Republicans are all saying Russia is subverting American democracy and Moscow Mitch won\u2019t even let the Senate take a vote on it.

Joe Scarborough lit into McConnell after he blocked two election security measures. Democrats attempted to expedite passage of the measures via a unanimous consent request after Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, testified Wednesday about continued Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \u201cHe is aiding and abetting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s ongoing attempts to subvert U.S. democracy, according to the Republican FBI, CIA\u201d and director of national intelligence, Scarborough said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cAll Republicans are saying Russia is trying to subvert U.S. democracy, and Moscow Mitch won\u2019t even let the Senate take a vote on it.

A visibly riled McConnell responded in a blistering speech on Monday, calling Scarborough and Milbank \u201chyperventilating hacks\u201d who\u2019d distorted his record. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken at length about Russian interference... I worked to ensure hundreds of millions of dollars were sent to states to improve their defenses\u201d from election interference, McConnell said, pointing to a bipartisan spending bill in 2018 that included $380 million for states to improve election security and technology. The Kentucky Republican listed a number of comments he\u2019s made over the years calling for increased vigilance about the threat that Putin poses to the U.S. (He did not, however, mention his role undercutting an effort by the Obama White House to call out the Kremlin\u2019s election meddling\u00a0just before the 2016 presidential election.) McConnell claims the U.S. is sufficiently prepared to defend its election infrastructure ahead of 2020, even as federal officials continue to issue warnings about foreign influence operations from Russia and other countries. But his objection to election security legislation isn\u2019t simply one of cost or feasibility. He often claims that federal regulations concerning how elections are run shouldn\u2019t be the government\u2019s responsibility at all. Democrats, on the other hand, believe that states and localities can\u2019t respond to election meddling like the federal government can. For that reason, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) argued last week for the need to institute\u00a0\u201cmandatory, nation-wide cybersecurity requirements\u201d to election systems. \u201cWe would not ask a local sheriff to go to war against the missiles, planes and tanks of the Russian Army,\u201d Wyden said in a bipartisan report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russia\u2019s election meddling. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ask a county election IT employee to fight a war against the full capabilities and vast resources of Russia\u2019s cyber army.\u201d The report described how Moscow targeted election systems in all 50 states in 2016 \u2014 and how the states were woefully unprepared to respond to cyberattacks. But it recommended nevertheless that states should remain firmly in the lead on running their own elections.",

Leader McConnell must call the Senate back for an emergency session to put the House-passed universal background checks legislation on the Senate floor for debate and a vote immediately,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bernie Sanders (I-V.t.) similarly urged McConnell to bring the Senate back into session following the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which took place within 24 hours of each other. More than 30 people died and scores more were injured in the two shootings. The Senate adjourned last week for its annual August recess. No votes are scheduled until Sept. 9 and most lawmakers are meeting with constituents in their home states. Some also typically travel abroad during recess on congressional delegation visits to other nations. One Republican senator indicated Sunday he would be willing to go back to Washington to discuss gun violence. \u201cI\u2019d leave tonight, I\u2019ll go tomorrow. It doesn\u2019t matter to me, this is such an important issue and an issue that we sometimes only get part of the picture because of the mass shootings,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d referring to the 2015 Charleston church shooting in his state. Earlier this year, the Democratic-controlled House passed a bill requiring background checks on all firearm sales in the country. But the measure has languished in the Republican-controlled Senate, with McConnell unwilling to bring it to the floor for a vote. In 2013, the Senate voted on a similar bill that would have expanded background checks to all gun purchases. It failed to reach the necessary 60-vote threshold to advance, however. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the author of the measure alongside Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), on Sunday called on Congress to pass \u201cbipartisan proposals such as my legislation with Senator Joe Manchin to expand background checks to all commercial firearm sales.\u201d \u201cWhile no law will end mass shootings entirely, it\u2019s time for Congress to act to help keep our communities safer,\u201d Toomey added in a statement. Other Republicans, such as Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, suggested the federal government has no good solution to stemming gun violence. \u201cFor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. Sadly, there are some issues, like homelessness and these shootings, where we simply don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d\u00a0Cornyn tweeted Sunday. This article was updated after the death toll in the El Paso shooting increased Monday.",

The Kentucky Republican, who is notorious for blocking bipartisan legislation, said he\u2019s spoken to Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Senate\u00a0Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\u00a0Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to \u201cengage in bipartisan discussions of potential solutions to help protect our communities without infringing on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d McConnell said he asked Graham, Wicker and Alexander to come up with legislation \u201cthat can pass the Senate, pass the House, and earn the president\u2019s signature.\u201d \u201cPartisan theatrics and campaign-trail rhetoric will only take us farther away from the progress all Americans deserve,\u201d the GOP leader said, despite his own refusal to work with Democrats. McConnell has prided himself in being called the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d a nickname that stems from his long history of continuously blocking or killing progressive-leaning legislation in the Republican-controlled Senate, even if the bills have bipartisan support. Most notably this year, the senator has refused to bring a House-passed universal gun background checks bill to the Senate floor for a vote despite widespread bipartisan support for such legislation. After the mass shootings this past weekend, Democrats renewed their call on McConnell to reconvene the Senate \u2015 which is currently in recess \u2015 to vote on the background checks bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized McConnell on Monday for failing to address the issue of gun control and continuing to refuse to put the background checks bill on the floor for a vote. \u201cI believe it would pass,\u201d Schumer tweeted. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote a letter Monday to her Democratic colleagues saying that the House is continuing to press McConnell to pass the background checks bills and would come back from recess \u201cif the Senate sends us back an amended bipartisan bill.\u201d McConnell\u2019s statement comes after he received Twitter backlash for his initial response on Sunday to the deadly shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton,\u00a0 Ohio. He echoed the tired and repetitive \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d sentiment that Republican leaders put out after every tragedy that involves a gun. Critics slammed McConnell\u2019s refusal to pass gun control legislation and started the hashtag #MassacreMitch, which\u00a0went viral on Sunday. McConnell\u2019s campaign also got called out for tweeting a photo \u2014 shortly after the El Paso shooting \u2014\u00a0of mock tombstones\u00a0bearing\u00a0the names of former Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, McConnell\u2019s Kentucky Democratic opponent Amy McGrath and \u201csocialism.\u201d",

It also features a supercut of President Donald Trump\u00a0dismissing the well-documented threat\u00a0of election interference from Russia. The ad will run on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC and during \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Fox News in D.C. (the latter is known to be one of Trump\u2019s favorite shows).

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Shifting the gun violence debate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he now wants to consider background checks and other bills, setting up a potentially pivotal moment when lawmakers return in the fall. The Republican leader won\u2019t be calling senators back to work early, as some are demanding. But he told a Kentucky radio station that President Donald Trump called him Thursday morning and they talked about several ideas. The president, he said, is \u201canxious to get an outcome and so am I.\u201d Stakes are high for all sides, but particularly for Trump and his party. Republicans have long opposed expanding background checks \u2014 a bill passed by the Democratic-led House is stalled in the Senate \u2014 but they face enormous pressure to do something after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, that killed 31 people. McConnell, who is facing protests outside his Louisville home, can shift attention back to Democrats by showing a willingness to engage ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is fail to pass something,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhat I want to see here is an outcome.\u201d McConnell said he and Trump discussed various ideas on the call, including background checks and the so-called \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow authorities to seize firearms from someone deemed a threat to themselves or others. \u201cBackground checks and red flags will probably lead the discussion,\u201d McConnell told Louisville\u2019s WHAS-AM. He noted \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of support\u201d publicly for background checks. \u201cThose are two items that for sure will be front and center as we see what we can come together on and pass.\u201d Trump has been interested in federal background checks before \u2014 and tweeted Monday about them \u2014 only to drop the issue later, a turnaround similar to his reversal on gun proposals after the 2018 high school shooting at Parkland, Fla. The powerful National Rifle Association and its allies on Capitol Hill have long wielded influence, but the gun lobby\u2019s grip on Democrats started slipping some time ago, and it\u2019s unclear how much sway the NRA and other gun groups still hold over Republicans in the Trump era. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump assured them in phone calls Thursday he will review the House-passed bill that expands federal background checks for firearm sales. In a joint statement, they said Trump called them individually after Pelosi sent a letter asking the president to order the Senate back to Washington immediately to consider gun violence measures. Schumer and Pelosi said they told Trump the best way to address gun violence is for the Senate to take up and pass the House bill. Trump, they said, \u201cunderstood our interest in moving as quickly as possible to help save lives.\u201d The politics of gun control are shifting amid the frequency and toll of mass shootings. Spending to support candidates backing tougher gun control measures \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 surged in the 2018 midterms, even as campaign spending by the NRA declined. NRA chief Wayne LaPierre said in rare public statement Thursday that some federal gun-control proposals \u201cwould make millions of law-abiding Americans less safe and less able to defend themselves and their loved ones.\u201d The organization said proposals being discussed in Congress would not have prevented the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that killed 31 people. McConnell has been under pressure from Democrats, and others, to bring senators back to Washington after the back-to-back weekend shootings. Earlier, more than 200 mayors, including those in Dayton and El Paso, urged the Senate to return to the Capitol. \u201cOur nation can no longer wait,\u201d they wrote. McConnell on Thursday rejected the idea of reconvening the Senate, saying calling senators back now would just lead to people \u201cscoring points and nothing would happen.\u201d Instead, the GOP leader wants to spend the August recess talking with Democratic and Republican senators to see what\u2019s possible. Senators have been talking among themselves, and holding conference calls, to sort out strategy. \u201cIf we do it prematurely it\u2019ll just be another frustrating position for all of us and for the public,\u201d he said. The politics of gun violence are difficult for Republicans, including McConnell. He could risk losing support as he seeks reelection in Kentucky if he were to back restricting access to firearms and ammunition. Other Republicans, including those in Colorado, Maine and swing states, also would face difficult votes, despite the clamor for gun laws. GOP senators are also considering changes to the existing federal background check system, modeled on a law signed last year that improved the National Instant Criminal Background Check system, as well as increased penalties for hate crimes. While many of those proposals have bipartisan support, Democrats are unlikely to agree to them without consideration of the more substantive background checks bill. \u201cWe Democrats are not going to settle for half-measures so Republicans can feel better and try to push the issue of gun violence off to the side,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who, along with Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is pushing a bill to expand background checks, said Trump\u2019s support will be the determining factor in whatever gets done. \u201cAt this point in time leadership comes from President Trump,\u201d Manchin said. ___ Associated Press writer Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.",

McConnell\u2019s actions last month caused the derisive nickname #MoscowMitch to trend on Twitter as critics accused him of failing to give election officials the resources needed to fight expected Russian interference in the 2020 presidential election. Republicans for the Rule of Law, a GOP group highly critical of President Donald Trump, launched a campaign earlier this month demanding that the Senate leader allow a vote on the bills. But McConnell hasn\u2019t relented, so now the organization is taking out TV spots in the home states of four key senators: Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). The ads urge the senators to stand up to McConnell to get a vote on the stalled bills.\u00a0Republicans for the Rule of Law said the ads will run on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in each senator\u2019s home state as well as online. \u201cDon\u2019t let Mitch McConnell stand in your way,\u201d the spots conclude. The videos mix news footage describing Russia\u2019s 2016 interference with each senator\u2019s own comments on the threat. \u201cRussia\u2019s interference is a threat to our democracy,\u201d Graham said in the footage. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hit them hard, we will be empowering Russia.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Vladimir Putin interfered in our election,\u201d Rubio said in the spot slated to air in Florida. \u201cI know he did.\u201d Graham,\u00a0Rubio and Lankford are all cosponsors of election security bills. Blunt has said he will not bring up the bills for a vote in the Rules Committee, which he chairs. The bills blocked by McConnell\u00a0include a\u00a0$775 million measure passed by the House that would shore up state election systems.\u00a0McConnell has insisted that President Donald Trump is working to protect next year\u2019s election and said the bills weren\u2019t needed. Trump has also indicated that he\u2019d accept dirt on a political rival from a foreign power. \u201cThey have information? he told ABC News in June. \u201cI think I\u2019d take it.\u201d",

      "content": " In the wake of yet another deadly mass shooting, Democratic leaders have urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to do something about the \u201cgun violence epidemic\u201d in the United States by taking up legislation that would expand federal background checks on gun purchases. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pressed McConnell on Saturday to take action on H.R. 8, also known as the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. The bill \u2014 which seeks to close loopholes allowing private or online sales of guns and sales at gun shows without background checks \u2014 was passed by the Democratic-controlled House in February. McConnell has faced mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers and others to bring the legislation to the Senate floor, but he has yet to do so. The majority leader \u201cshould bring up H.R. 8 the week Congress returns,\u201d Schumer said in a Saturday night tweet, hours after a gunman went on a shooting rampage in West Texas, killing multiple people and injuring at least 21. Three officers were among those who were injured, police said. A 17-month-old baby was also wounded in the attack. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Pelosi said later in a statement. \u201cEvery day, the epidemic of gun violence inflicts a devastating toll in communities in every corner of our country, forcing far too many to endure heartbreak and tragedy.\u201d \u201cThe Republican Senate must end its obstruction and finally pass the commonsense, bipartisan, House-passed gun violence prevention legislation that the country is demanding,\u201d she added. Congress will reconvene on Sept. 9 after its summer recess. Other Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, also called on McConnell to do more. \u201cAmerica is done waiting for you,\u201d Warren, a 2020 presidential contender, tweeted. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) appealed to McConnell to move on H.R. 8 as well as H.R. 1112, another gun control bill passed by the House in February that would require a gun dealer to wait 10 days to hear back from federal authorities about a potential buyer\u2019s background check before moving ahead with a gun sale. The hashtag #MassacreMitch\u00a0started trending on Twitter on Saturday as people called on the senator to take action against gun violence. The hashtag also\u00a0went viral in August following back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reiterated Tuesday his position on bringing gun control legislation to the floor of the upper chamber, saying he will only do so if it has the backing of President Donald Trump, who would need to sign it before becoming law. The Kentucky Republican was asked about the matter during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt following the latest mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, where a gunman killed at least seven people and injured 22 others in a drive-by rampage. That incident came less than a month after the deadly mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and in Dayton, Ohio. \u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell told Hewitt in the interview. McConnell said the Trump administration is \u201cin the process of studying what they are prepared to support, if anything\u201d on the topic of gun control, and that he expected to know the answer next week after the Senate returns from recess. \u201cIf the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly \u2014 and I know that if we pass it, it\u2019ll become law \u2014 I\u2019ll put it on the floor,\u201d he added. The House passed a bill earlier this year that would require universal background checks for all gun purchases. It faces stiff opposition in the GOP-controlled Senate, however. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a vocal gun control advocate, has been in conversations with the White House about a potential deal on expanding background checks for gun purchases. He told reporters last month that he\u2019s holding out hope for Trump to follow through on taking action on guns, despite his habit of making promises and then backtracking after facing resistance from his base. Some Senate Republicans also see a path forward on gun control legislation. \u201cI have spoken with the president repeatedly and recently about this topic. He is very interested in doing something meaningful,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.)\u00a0said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d adding that his staff and the White House are \u201cvery seriously pursuing this.\u201d Toomey co-sponsored a bipartisan background checks bill with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). That legislation failed to overcome a GOP-led filibuster in 2013. Trump\u2019s position on background checks and other measures seeking to keep guns out of the hands of potentially dangerous people has varied widely in the last month, though. It\u2019s also unclear whether he can stick to an endorsement of any potential deal on gun control after hearing from conservative news outlets and the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s top gun lobby.",

      "content": " \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d has gained traction as a nickname for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0and the powerful Kentucky Republican is none too happy about that. In an interview Tuesday with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, McConnell decried the alliterative sobriquet given him by critics after he stymied Senate consideration of two election security bills. The label, he complained, is a political smear. \u201cIt\u2019s modern-day McCarthyism,\u201d he said. \u201cUnbelievable for a Cold Warrior like me who spent a career standing up to the Russians to be given a moniker like that. It\u2019s an effort to smear me.\u201d Referring to a previous tag he had earned for thwarting other bills, he said, \u201cYou know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d In July, McConnell thwarted a House-passed measure that sought to authorize $775 million to fortify state election systems and require paper ballots for added security. He also blocked a separate proposal that would have required candidates as well as their staffers and family members to alert federal authorities if offered aid by foreign governments \u2015 a measure sparked by the various revelations into Russian interference in the U.S. 2016 election. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough derided the senator the next day, dubbing him \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d \u2015 and the nickname was born. Within hours, it began trending on Twitter, even inspiring a song from rock musician Ben Folds, who performed the tune at a show in New York. It also followed McConnell home, with opponents chanting it as he tried to speak at a political picnic a few weeks ago in Fancy Farm, Kentucky. Continuing to voice his frustration over his inability to shake the tag, McConnell told Hewitt it\u2019s a product of \u201cwhat we\u2019re up against with the hard left today in America.\u201d Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank had also taken McConnell to task just after he senator blocked action on the election security bills, calling him a \u201cRussian asset\u201d in a searing op-ed. \u201cLet\u2019s call this what it is: unpatriotic,\u201d Milbank wrote. \u201cThe Kentucky Republican is, arguably more than any other American, doing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bidding.\u201d A visibly enraged McConnell responded with a defensive Senate floor speech at the end of July, dismissing both Scarborough and Milbank as \u201chyperventilating hacks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like an inflationary crisis, but with outrage instead of dollars,\u201d he said. McConnell\u2019s sensitivity to the nickname may stem in part from a potentially spirited Democratic challenge to his bid for a seventh term in the 2020 election. CORRECTION: This article previously misattributed the \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d song to the Ben Folds Five; rather, it is by Folds as a solo artist.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday introduced an amendment that would give $250 million to the states to beef up their voting systems after months of criticism that he was standing in the way of attempts to strengthen election security. The amendment was successfully added to an annual spending bill by a bipartisan voice vote in the Senate Appropriations Committee, which the Kentucky Republican sits on. McConnell and other Republicans repeatedly blocked previous efforts from Democrats to strengthen election security. In August 2018, for example, nearly every Republican voted against adding $250 million to election security funding ahead of the midterms that year, maintaining that funds Congress previously allocated for the effort had not yet been spent. Democrats also sought to pass additional election security bills in June following special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s warning that Russia was laying the groundwork to interfere in the 2020 election. But McConnell blocked those as well, earning him the nickname \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d from MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. The moniker seemed to hit a nerve with McConnell, who later condemned it as \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism\u201d and an \u201cover the top\u201d smear on his career. McConnell maintained he was broadly opposed to all Democratic legislation concerning election security \u2015 in addition to a major bill the Democratic-controlled House passed last year \u2015 because of his concern it would give the federal government too much power over state election systems. He echoed that argument again on Thursday. \u201cThe Trump Administration has made enormous strides to help states secure their elections without giving Washington new power to push the states around. That\u2019s how we continue the progress we saw in 2018 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d McConnell said on the floor Thursday after announcing his support for the amendment. Even though House Democrats are requesting an additional $600 million in election security funding, their Senate counterparts welcomed the news that McConnell had moved closer to their position on the matter. \u201cThank God, he\u2019s seen the light,\u201d Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a speech on the floor. \u201cMaybe, just maybe, Republicans are starting to come around to our view.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, offered a more pithy response when informed by reporters of McConnell\u2019s announcement. \u201cNo more invitations to the Kremlin for him,\u201d Durbin quipped.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric hit new levels of recklessness over the weekend as he suggested a civil war could break out and accused a top Democratic House member of treason as the impeachment investigation against him ramps up. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) doesn\u2019t seem to have any problem with it. Asked specifically for comment on Trump\u2019s escalating attacks over the past 48 hours, McConnell went ahead and changed the subject. \u201cLook, what I want to do is spend our time accomplishing things for the American people,\u201d the Senate GOP leader said in a Monday interview on CNBC. \u201cThe House wants to spend \u2015 they spent the last three years harassing this president and I gather we\u2019re going to get another chapter of that with the impeachment episode,\u201d McConnell continued. \u201cBut we need to find other things that actually make a difference for the American people and try to accomplish as much as we can.\u201d (McConnell\u2019s words ring particularly hollow considering there are piles of House-passed bills sitting in the Senate going nowhere. His unwillingness to act on that legislation, or on Senate bills, is frustrating to\u00a0some even in his own party.) In a series of tweets Sunday, the president quoted Dallas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, who said during an appearance on Fox News that if Democrats remove Trump from office, \u201cit will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\u201d On Monday morning, the president suggested in a tweet that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who will lead the impeachment investigation, ought to be arrested for treason. The penalties for treason include death. House Democrats could vote to impeach the president as soon as this year, but it wouldn\u2019t remove him from office. That would only happen if the Senate subsequently votes to convict Trump of charges laid out in House articles of impeachment. It would take a supermajority to do that, or 67 senators \u2015 meaning 20 Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic Caucus \u2015 which seems unlikely. But McConnell said he would not try to prevent the trial from occurring. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow the Senate rules,\u201d McConnell said Monday. \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up.\u201d Trump has also suggested that an intelligence community whistleblower committed treason by using official channels to warn that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a top 2020 political rival. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which says the president \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d is corroborated by a White House summary of the president\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy. Only a couple of Republicans have dared to say the president is going too far with his rhetoric. \u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s Civil War post. \u201cThis is beyond repugnant.\u201d Last week, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) warned about the president\u2019s rhetoric without criticizing him directly. \u201cThrowing the word \u2018treason\u2019 around is as dangerous has throwing the word \u2018impeachment\u2019 around,\u201d Conaway told HuffPost.",

The White House announced on Sunday that it would effectively allow Turkey to invade northern Syria by withdrawing U.S. troops from the region. The decision startled some members of Congress, including Republicans, who warned such a move could precipitate a genocide of the Kurds and lead to the return of the self-described Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in the region. \u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. Trump defended his decision, which he made against the recommendations of the Pentagon and State Department. \u201cThe U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,\u201d the president falsely claimed in a Monday tweet. \u201cIt is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory.\u201d Trump also tweeted that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the country took any action he considers \u201coff limits\u201d in the wake of the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal. In a bipartisan statement, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)\u00a0on Monday requested Trump send a representative to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to defend the move. \u201cThe Administration must come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and explain to the American people how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\u201d the senators said. Sen.

This reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS\u2019s tyranny.\u201d This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed Wednesday that the U.S. Senate will hold a trial if the House sends it articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The Kentucky Republican gave GOP senators a tutorial on the hypothetical process based on previous trials in the Senate at a weekly caucus lunch. The chamber could take up articles of impeachment against Trump as early as next month, depending on how fast the House advances its inquiry into the president. \u201cSenators will not be allowed to speak, which will be good therapy for a number of them,\u201d McConnell quipped to reporters after the meeting. As in the trial of President Bill Clinton, the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice would preside as judge. The senators, meanwhile, would act as the jurors. The proceedings would carry on six days a week (all except Sunday) until a final vote on conviction. However, McConnell has previously suggested it is within his power to determine the trial\u2019s scope and length. Senators had many questions about the process on Wednesday, including how long it would last. Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial lasted five weeks \u2015 meaning Trump\u2019s trial could take up the entire legislative work period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. \u201cEvery question you could imagine was probably asked so I did not ask any questions but I have to admit I was grateful for the civics lesson because it\u2019s not something we deal with very often, thank God,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. Many of the rules governing the trial, however, will depend on bipartisan agreement at its outset. During the Clinton trial, for example, both sides agreed that senators could call a vote on a motion to dismiss the articles, which would effectively amount to a vote to acquit Trump of wrongdoing. \u201c[Then-West Virginia Sen. Robert] Byrd made a motion to dismiss two weeks in, but of course it was agreed upon by unanimous consent that he could make that motion, and it failed. Basic nerdy stuff like that that we actually kicked around,\u201d Cramer added of the Senate GOP discussion. The House launched a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0last month following a whistleblower complaint concerning a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine\u2019s president to initiate an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump did so while holding up U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The White House, however, has refused any cooperation with the House impeachment inquiry, blocking testimony from numerous Trump administration officials. Democrats warned that the refusal amounts to obstruction of justice. Republicans, including McConnell, have also spoken dismissively of the House impeachment inquiry, calling the way Democrats have conducted it unfair to the president. \u201cDemocrats have been engaged in a three-year-long impeachment parade in search of a rationale. Prominent House Democrats were promising impeachment at the very beginning of this presidency. Fairness and due process are not their objectives here,\u201d McConnell said in a floor speech earlier on Wednesday. But McConnell declined to weigh in on the appropriateness of Trump\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine at his press conference Wednesday, saying only that Trump is \u201centitled to due process in the House.\u201d",

Unless halted, our retreat will invite the brutal Assad regime in Syria and its Iranian backers to expand their influence.\u201d McConnell also noted that \u201cwe are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond. ... Predictably, our adversaries seem to be relishing these developments.\u201d The Kentucky senator pointed to his experience working with three presidential administrations since the Sept. 11 terror attacks and learning that the threat from groups like the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS, \u201cis real and cannot be wished away,\u201d he warned. He pointed out that the U.S. is \u201cnot in this fight alone,\u201d and has relied on local forces, including the Kurds, in the fight against ISIS. \u201cIronically, Syria had been a model for this increasingly successful approach,\u201d McConnell noted. \u201cWe saw humanitarian disaster and a terrorist free-for-all after we abandoned Afghanistan in the 1990s, laying the groundwork for 9/11,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe will see these things anew in Syria and Afghanistan if we abandon our partners and retreat from these conflicts before they are won.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump agreed to cede the battlefield in northeast Syria to Turkey, which began attacking Kurdish residents of the region almost immediately.

But this time, he took it a step further, tweeting that he is the victim of a lynching \u2015 a term usually applied to the acts of terror against Black people that occurred primarily in the Jim Crow-era South. Though McConnell mildly criticized Trump\u2019s statement on Tuesday, he\u00a0refused to condemn the president\u2019s series of racist tweets about Democratic congresswomen of color in July, merely stating that \u201call of us have a responsibility to elevate the public discourse.\u201d The month before, McConnell dismissed the idea of modern-day reparations for slavery \u2015 an idea that has been seriously considered by other lawmakers \u2015 because \u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d Besides, he said, civil rights laws and President Barack Obama\u2019s election prove that reparations are not necessary. Shortly after, when NBC News reported\u00a0that the senator\u2019s ancestors were slaveholders, McConnell said he was \u201cin the same position\u201d as Obama because \u201cwe both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.\u201d McConnell joins a relatively short list of Republicans who have scrutinized Trump\u2019s recent comments, although some have responded more forcefully. \u201c\u2018Lynching\u2019 brings back images of a terrible time in our nation\u2019s history, and the President never should have made that comparison,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) tweeted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters that Trump\u2019s words are \u201cnot the language I would use.\u201d Conversely, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump loyalist on nearly all issues, doubled down on the president\u2019s statement, claiming the impeachment inquiry \u201cis a lynching in every sense.\u201d Michael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chairman, took direct aim at both Trump and Graham on Twitter, sharing an image of a lynching. \u201cTrump this is not happening to you and it\u2019s pathetic that you act like you\u2019re such a victim; but it did happen to 147 black people in your state Lindsey,\u201d Steele wrote. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley argued that Trump was \u201cnot comparing what\u2019s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history,\u201d despite the fact that the president\u2019s tweet did exactly that.",

Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-Md.) memorial service at the Capitol last Thursday went viral for refusing to shake Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) hand. The defiant act instantly rocketed him to internet fame. Now, he\u2019s speaking out about the snub. Bobby Rankin, Cummings\u2019 close friend, told The Washington Post that he skipped over McConnell at the service as the senator waited with his hand extended because Rankin was reminded of his brother Jerry. Jerry served in the Marines and died of cancer last October after exposure to tainted water at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. According to Rankin, Jerry never received the veterans benefits he had earned before his death. Rankin said he felt McConnell was partly to blame. \u201cI could not put my hands in the man\u2019s hand who refused to help somebody who served his country,\u201d Rankin said in an interview with the Post, published Monday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, because I was thinking about my brother.\u201d Rankin said Cummings had \u201creached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits\u201d by contacting McConnell\u2019s office. However, Rankin did not offer a clear explanation as to why Jerry didn\u2019t receive the benefits or what role McConnell had in the matter, if any. McConnell\u2019s office did not confirm to HuffPost whether the senator had worked on the issue, and has offered no details. A Twitter user filmed the snub while streaming Cummings\u2019 service online, and her video has received more than 44,000 views. Cummings, the first Black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol, served as chair of the House Oversight Committee, one of three of the chamber\u2019s panels helming an impeachment probe of President Donald Trump. The committee has also separately investigated potential power abuses by the Trump administration. Though Cummings received praise after his death for his ability to work with both parties, Trump called Cummings a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d and labeled his Baltimore district a \u201crodent infested mess\u201d in a racist Twitter rant over the summer. Cummings died at age 68 on Oct. 17 after facing \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said.",

      "content": "HOPKINSVILLE, Kentucky \u2014 The confetti had barely hit the floor at Andy Beshear\u2019s election night party on Tuesday when Democrats began proclaiming that his apparent defeat of unpopular GOP Gov. Matt Bevin should terrify Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cMitch McConnell did not go to bed happy last night,\u201d Kentucky state Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey said of the top U.S. Senate Republican, who hopes to win a seventh term in Washington a year from now. \u201cAll I have to say is: Mitch, you\u2019re next,\u201d Amy McGrath, the retired Marine pilot who is running as a Democrat against McConnell, wrote in a fundraising email sent out just an hour after Beshear declared victory. Republicans in the state declared McConnell safe as he\u2019s ever been. Kentucky voters hadn\u2019t rejected the GOP, they insisted, but the \u201cbad apple\u201d in Bevin. The GOP\u00a0won every other race on the ballot Tuesday night, even one for attorney general, an office no Republican has held since 1948. The dueling reactions in Kentucky mirrored the national mood. The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee saw it as proof that \u201cDemocrats are ready to compete everywhere and win tough races in 2020,\u201d while Texas Sen. John Cornyn\u00a0shrugged Beshear\u2019s victory off as \u201cunrelated to national politics.\u201d Pundits on deadline saw the result as either a sign that McConnell should worry, or a total anomaly for a Democratic Party with no future in a deep red state. Both sides may be too sure of themselves. McConnell is deeply unpopular in the Bluegrass, just as Bevin was \u2014 the same poll that considered Bevin the least popular GOP governor in the nation ranks McConnell as the lowest-rated member of the Senate. But these days, the overwhelming majority of Senate races are won by the same party the state voted for in the last presidential election \u2014 Kentuckians chose Trump by 30 points in 2016, and will almost certainly vote for him again. No Senate majority leader, meanwhile, has lost a bid for reelection since 1952. And Kentucky has been trending steadily more Republican over the three decades of McConnell\u2019s career \u2014 its last Democratic senator was reelected in 1992, and it hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. Beshear\u2019s victory also may not be as big of an anomaly as Republicans hope. The tone of conversations, both public and private, with Kentucky Democrats and activists changed after Tuesday: the nervy, almost forced optimism that barely masked a bleak outlook for the future found itself replaced by something close to real hope. While winning in Kentucky is still a long, uphill battle that requires nigh-perfect circumstances, they at least had proof of concept now. Beshear drew a map of Kentucky that, at least in the cities and suburbs, appeared similar to those of other states in the Trump era. And he did it all as an unapologetic Democrat. \u201cThis is the first time a modern Democrat beat a modern Republican in Kentucky,\u201d said Dave Contarino, the executive director of Kentucky Family Values, a political action committee supported primarily by teachers and other labor unions. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some old-line, southern conservative Democrat. This was a pro-choice, pro-labor Democrat. I don\u2019t want to overstate it, but it may suggest that we\u2019re not as far off as some people think we are.\u201d Democrats probably won\u2019t win a Senate seat next year. But a high-profile Senate race could further rejuvenate a party trying to prove it\u2019s still alive. ***** On the drive down Highway 68 near the Tennessee border, a hulking obelisk rises into the sunny sky to commemorate Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president who was born there in 1808. The monument went up a century later, during the Lost Cause years. It\u2019s cast a shadow over Hopkinsville, one of the state\u2019s Blackest cities, ever since. There\u2019s a pretty strong conventional wisdom in Kentucky politics that for Democrats, beating McConnell or any other statewide candidate would require running up huge margins in Louisville, Lexington \u2014 and, as U.S. Rep John Yarmuth, a Louisville Democrat, told me this summer, \u201cthe few other pockets\u201d of the state \u201cwhere there are lots of Democrats.\u201d \u201cThe people who\u2019ve looked at it here have said, \u2018A Democrat can win statewide, but it has to be a very surgical race,\u2019\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cAnd what they would say is, \u2018You have to know exactly where your voters are, and you don\u2019t waste any time on persuadables. You need to persuade the ones you know are going to vote for you [to] vote.\u2019\u201d Even knowing that, the party has struggled to get some of its most likely supporters to the polls, in part because they haven\u2019t focused on them, and that\u2019s especially true for voters in places like Hopkinsville, a city where 30 percent of the population is Black. Black voters in Hopkinsville have proven their power before. In 2016, organized efforts to turnout Black voters powered Democrat Jeff Taylor to victory in a special election that made him the area\u2019s first-ever Black state representative. But Taylor lost in 2018 by roughly 400 votes, a margin that he said could have been swung had either Black voters or registered Democrats turned out in heavier numbers. The Black precincts in Hopkinsville, Taylor said, routinely rank among the lowest of all of Kentucky\u2019s in terms of turnout, a problem that Taylor chalks up largely to apathy \u2014 and a lack of belief, among Black voters there, that the Democrats have anything to offer them. In West Louisville \u2014 where nearly three-quarters of the city\u2019s Black population lives, and where turnout numbers are also typically lower than in other parts of the city \u2014 one activist told me that Democrats \u201conly come here when it\u2019s election time,\u201d and that \u201cnone of them have addressed anything\u201d on issues like gun violence, mass incarceration, or other issues at the forefront of Black voters\u2019 minds. In 2015, when Democrats lost the governor\u2019s mansion for just the second time since 1971, many of the Blackest precincts in west Louisville had turnout rates 10 points lower than the countywide rate. Neither the state nor national Democratic Party has \u201creally invested in Black electoral work,\u201d said Cassia Herron, the chairwoman of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots group that has more than 12,000 members across the state. \u201cIt always comes from somewhere else, if it comes at all.\u201d Heron, who is Black, recounted a recent conversation with a middle-aged Black man from west Louisville about November\u2019s governor\u2019s race. \u201cHe\u2019s a barber who runs his own business and has a college education, and he doesn\u2019t vote. And he doesn\u2019t plan to vote,\u201d Herron said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not investing in people like him, we\u2019re missing a huge opportunity. They could move the electorate, but we\u2019re just making the assumption that they\u2019re going to vote Democratic.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Black population is smaller than those in other southern states that have captured Democratic imaginations, but it\u2019s still a powerful potential base. \u201cWhen we show up to vote, the candidate we support wins,\u201d Andre Carson, a Hopkinsville native who moved home three years ago and formed a group of local business leaders and residents to help bring more attention to the local Black community. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to see you after the election. We\u2019ve got to see results,\u201d Carson said. \u201c[Black people] will come out and vote, but not in bunches for a guy they see once in three months, or if they don\u2019t see results after the election.\u201d That Kentucky Democrats haven\u2019t shown up or put in the work necessary to turn out potential supporters isn\u2019t a critique unique to Black voters \u2014 it\u2019s a common description of the party\u2019s problems across the commonwealth, where cities haven\u2019t delivered the sort of margins they have for Democrats elsewhere, suburban counties haven\u2019t trended in Democrats\u2019 direction as quickly as they have nationally, and former Democratic strongholds have abandoned the party completely. During the governor\u2019s race, the Beshear campaign, the Kentucky Democratic Party and the outside groups that supported them worked to change that. The KDP, under new chairman Ben Self, began rebuilding its infrastructure in 2017, after a bloodbath at the ballot box the year before nearly destroyed any hopes of a Democratic future in Kentucky, with the aim of building a \u201cpermanent campaign infrastructure\u201d that would improve contact with voters, help more register to vote, drive them out once they did \u2014 and not immediately go away the minute a campaign cycle ended. Though they focused heavily on areas where Democrats had lost some standing, they also put an emphasis restating their case to base voters, too. Across the state, Beshear\u2019s campaign and Democratic Party canvassers combined to knock on more than 1 million doors, and in parts of Louisville, Beshear\u2019s campaign alone made as many as four canvassing passes. McGarvey, the Democratic senate leader, called it \u201cthe greatest get-out-the-vote effort I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d in the city, and Beshear replicated the strategy elsewhere, in the mountains of Appalachia, the northern suburbs of Cincinnati, and the farthest reaches of western Kentucky. Kentucky is also home to a number of grassroots organizations, new and old, that helped. Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, the grassroots group that has expanded across the state since it launched as an Appalachian-focused group 30 years ago, ran its own voter registration and canvassing drives. Teachers from KY 120 United, the group of 38,000 educators that sparked mass protests against Bevin last year, canvassed across the state; the Kentucky Education Association held events in nearly all 120 counties. Working America, the AFL-CIO\u2019s campaign arm, said it knocked on more than 40,000 doors, talked to 13,500 voters and pushed its 114,000 members to vote through digital campaigns. For the first time in a long time, everyone from the state party to the campaign to the grassroots seemed to be on the same page. Black voters weren\u2019t the only focus, but they were a big one \u2014 in Hopkinsville, Taylor credited Beshear\u2019s efforts to reach out to Black residents and organizations. And, Kentucky Family Values, which backed Beshear, helped register more than 7,500 new voters in Louisville, where it focused its efforts on the western part of the city. (It also knocked on more than 300,000 doors and made a half-million phone calls.) Beshear also pledged to restore voting rights to 140,000 thousand ex-felons, a priority for civil rights groups in Kentucky, one of just three states that permanently bans them from voting. That policy has disenfranchised nearly one of every 11 voters in the state and had an especially large impact on Black adults \u2015\u00a026 percent of whom are ineligible to vote, the highest rate in the nation. It didn\u2019t always work. Beshear\u2019s margin in Christian County, where Hopkinsville is located, was barely better than Democrats had achieved four years ago. But in other places, the impact was evident, even if demographic and precinct turnout data isn\u2019t yet available \u2014 and weeks before the election, yard signs supporting Beshear, or at least opposing Bevin, were prominently displayed across the city\u2019s West End. Turnout in the big cities dwarfed expectations, and boosted Beshear, who ran up a margin of nearly 135,000 votes in Lexington and Louisville alone \u2014 a huge performance relative to what Democrats have achieved there in recent election cycles. And with the help of state Rep. Rocky Adkins, a mountain populist who finished second to Beshear in the primary and campaigned alongside him during the general, Beshear won parts of Appalachia that some Democrats thought were gone for good. ***** If success in gubernatorial contests translated directly to victories in Senate races, McConnell never would\u2019ve made it to Washington. Democrats have now won 11 of the past 13 governor\u2019s races, but they\u2019ve lost eight consecutive Senate races since 1992, and haven\u2019t come within 100,000 votes of McConnell since 1990. It\u2019s understandable that Republicans are skeptical that any of what Beshear built or accomplished in 2019 will affect 2020. But Democrats and their allies outside the party swear its replicable \u2014 in September, Self told me over coffee in his Frankfort office that the party\u2019s aim was to roll staff, data and infrastructure straight from the governor\u2019s race into the battle with McConnell. Some parts of Beshear\u2019s map \u2014 especially the swaths of blue in southern Appalachia \u2014 may not translate to a federal race when Trump, who remains popular in Kentucky, replaces Bevin on top of the ballot. But Democrats hope that some of it will. Beshear won two northern Kentucky counties, just outside Cincinnati, plus Warren County in the west and Scott County just north of Lexington \u2014 four well-populated areas that have been solid red for decades but all look like the type of suburbs that have been trending away from the GOP and toward Democrats throughout the Trump era. The suburban east end of Louisville, which Republicans used to count on, has now delivered huge victories for Democrats in both 2018 and 2019. Bevin\u2019s late-stage attempts to tie himself to Trump may have been a costly mistake. \u201cThe nationalizing of the campaign cost [Bevin] in the suburbs,\u201d Contarino, the executive director of Kentucky Family Values, said. \u201cAnd McConnell has a similar problem.\u201d Warren County may not be a fluke. In 2018, Western Kentucky University history professor Patti Minter won a state House race there, and though Democrats have held her district for four decades, she ran an energetic campaign that supported LGBTQ rights, swore off corporate campaign donations, and never apologized for its outward progressivism. Some Democrats feared she\u2019d cost them the seat; instead, she won by seven points. For the last three years, Democrats and their allies in Kentucky have been drawing lessons primarily from losses. But Minter\u2019s win, followed by Beshear\u2019s, in a county Democrats once couldn\u2019t fathom would go their way generated hope that they can replicate the success, especially given that Trump isn\u2019t as popular in Kentucky as he once was: Trump\u2019s net approval rating, according to Morning Consult, has dropped 23 points in Kentucky since the beginning of his administration, from plus-34 to just plus-11. Nearly half of Kentuckians said they disapproved of the president in October. Heading into 2020, the dynamics in Kentucky still favor McConnell, barring a massive and unexpected change. And they\u2019ll probably benefit Republicans in the state for at least another decade, said Scott Lasley, a Western Kentucky University political scientist and district vice chairman in the state GOP. Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers, and Lasley\u2019s guess is that it could take 30 years for Democrats to regain control of either. That\u2019s not just GOP sentiment: \u201cWe can get it back,\u201d Jeff Taylor, the former lawmaker from Hopkinsville, said of the state legislature, sounding as if he was trying to convince himself more than me. \u201cBut this is not happening overnight. It\u2019s going to be a long time.\u201d That sort of shift has happened before. Just ask McConnell, who has spent his 35 years in the Senate slowly and steadily building the Kentucky GOP into the machine it is today. \u201cWhen I first started coming to western Kentucky frequently, the ratio in this state was two-and-a-half to one in favor of registered Democrats. Now it\u2019s about 1.3 to 1 Democrat,\u201d McConnell recounted at an event this spring. \u201cBack then,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t one solitary [GOP] state senator or representative\u201d in far western Kentucky. \u201cToday, there is not a single Democratic state representative or state senator in that area. We\u2019ve come a long way together. A long way.\u201d McConnell\u2019s long Bluegrass slog is proof that Democrats\u2019 fight against the state party he has built will take more than one election to complete \u2015 as Self, the party chairman, put it, Democrats are \u201clooking not just toward the next election, but toward the next 20 years.\u201d The race against McConnell will bring tens of millions of dollars into Kentucky \u2014 the national desire among progressive small dollar donors and the Democratic Party to knock off the country\u2019s most unpopular Senator means McGrath or any other candidate could raise $50 million or more, especially if the race proves competitive. The cash and enthusiasm that comes with a high-profile Senate race could be vital to Kentucky Democrats\u2019 efforts to restructure their party and start winning legislative seats again, as down-ballot candidates draft off the hope, energy and resources of the big-time Senate race \u2014 just as Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 Senate campaign did in Texas, where Democrats now have a chance to seize majority control of the state legislature. \u201cWe need to take every cent that comes here for the McConnell race, and use it to build up the grassroots,\u201d one Kentucky Dem told me. \u201cWe need to use it to elect state legislative and city council candidates, and let that filter up to Amy McGrath. And if she wins, great.\u201d That\u2019s not just a big priority for the party, but to many of the activists who have helped boost it from the outside: \u201cWe still have a few scores to settle,\u201d Nema Brewer, the public school employee behind the group that organized Kentucky\u2019s teacher protests and turned educators into a powerful political force, said Wednesday of the teachers\u2019 plans for future electoral work. As the teachers pushed back against GOP legislators who forced through the pension reform and school budget cuts that enraged educators and organized workers, \u201cthere were a few folks who were really ugly to us,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a long memory.\u201d ***** In early September, as I traversed Kentucky in search of any sign of a progressive pulse, I visited Minter in Bowling Green, where the Western Kentucky University history teacher has attempted to push her city \u2014 and by extension her state \u2014 forward on LGBTQ rights. Since 2013, Minter has gathered activists in Room 207 of Cherry Hall, the campus building where she teaches, for monthly meetings aimed at persuading the Bowling Green city council to pass a fairness ordinance \u2014 the name in Kentucky for an official measure to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. The dozen activists in attendance were in the final planning stages, that night, for Bowling Green\u2019s third annual Pride festival. But their attention was also focused across the state on Georgetown, a suburb of Lexington in Scott County, which had long supported Republicans but where the city council was voting on a fairness ordinance. The ordinance had been a top priority for organizers in Georgetown, I learned a few days earlier at a similar meeting there, after the city council voted it down by a single vote two years prior. They had spent the time since trying to persuade local residents and legislators to reconsider. Not so long ago, LGBTQ issues were untouchable for Democrats in Kentucky \u2014 in 2015, many Democrats thought that the national furor over Rowan County clerk Kim Davis\u2019 refusal to sign same-sex marriage licenses had helped drive Republicans to the polls and elect Bevin governor. But now Georgetown was on the cusp of becoming the 10th Kentucky city to pass a fairness ordinance in the last five years; Democrats and LGBTQ activists had rallied, in 2018, to defeat Davis in her bid for reelection. Minter, meanwhile, had won election to her state house seat in Bowling Green \u2014 the seat of traditionally red Warren County \u2014 in 2018 just three weeks after marching with drag queens. Even in this deep red state where Democrats had lost almost everything, there were pockets where the fight to loosen the GOP\u2019s grip on the Bluegrass was long underway. Minter\u2019s foot tapped nervously on the hard tile floors of the empty hallway as she described how she won \u2014 recruited into the race by a new group that trains women to run for office, doubted by consultants, sure the whole time that Bowling Green \u201cwasn\u2019t as conservative\u201d as everyone else claimed. Then a cheer went up in Room 207, and Minter turned and bolted back to the doorway. \u201cDid we just win?\u201d she shouted into the room. \u201cWe won!\u201d Two months later, Rowan, Scott and Warren counties all voted for Andy Beshear. This piece has been updated with final voter contact numbers from Working America. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said Kentucky last elected a Democratic senator in 1988. However, Sen.\u00a0Wendell Ford (D) was reelected in 1992, meaning Democrats have lost eight consecutive Senate races since then.",

      "author": "Travis Waldron",
      "content": " Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker (D), who in 2018 became the state\u2019s youngest Black elected lawmaker in nearly a century, announced Monday that he would test the waters for a 2020 campaign against U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0(R). Booker, whose legislative district spans Louisville, has been considering a run against McConnell for months. His decision to launch an exploratory committee comes just a week after the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Andy Beshear, upset unpopular Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in a heated gubernatorial contest \u2015 a win that has\u00a0given Kentucky Democrats hope that they have a shot at ousting McConnell a year from now. Booker opened his electoral effort with a broadside against McConnell, who has been in the Senate since 1985 and is seeking a seventh term in 2020. (The Democratic lawmaker was born a month before McConnell won that first Senate election.) \u201cYou know the name of the man I\u2019m talking about, but he doesn\u2019t know your name,\u201d Booker said of McConnell in a two-minute video that accompanied Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see you in the hospital bed, or in the checkout line, or at the safety drills in your classroom. He doesn\u2019t see you at all.\u201d Booker argued that Kentucky hasn\u2019t benefited from the power McConnell has accrued over three-plus decades in Washington. \u201cSince we sent Mitch McConnell to Washington, he\u2019s become one of the richest politicians in America \u2015 but Kentucky has been left behind,\u201d Booker said in his Monday release. \u201cThe more power Mitch McConnell has gained in DC, the more we\u2019ve lost here at home.\u201d If he ultimately does run, Booker could become the first Black candidate to win a major party\u2019s Senate nomination in Kentucky\u2019s history. If he won the general election, he would be the first Black Democrat to win a statewide election in Kentucky. (Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron (R) last week became the first Black candidate to win a statewide election independently in Kentucky. The first Black candidate to win any statewide election there was Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton, who ran on the ticket with Bevin in 2015.) Booker would join a Democratic primary field headlined by former Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, the onetime Marine pilot who announced a run against McConnell in July. In Monday\u2019s release, Booker painted himself as a progressive voice who could offer a new vision for Kentucky and pledged that his campaign would mark the launch of a \u201cbold, unapologetic populist movement\u201d in the Bluegrass State. The would-be candidate, who was raised in Louisville\u2019s predominantly Black west end, said his experience growing up in poverty, acquiring student loan debt to graduate from college, and paying more than $1,000 a month for insulin as a diabetic has given him first-hand experience with some of the biggest issues facing voters. He would run on a platform that supports a Green New Deal to address climate change, a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan (a key issue in the Democratic presidential primary), poverty reduction, and support for workers and organized labor. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the start of a campaign,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThis is the beginning of a movement. A movement of the people taking on the powerful. A movement of Kentuckians whose voices haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d He is positioning himself as the Bluegrass version of the progressive insurgents who have filed to run in other key Senate races in Colorado, North Carolina and Texas. McGrath, who narrowly lost a congressional race against Rep. Andy Barr (R) in a central Kentucky swing district last year, was recruited into the race by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Her campaign launch via a viral ad generated enthusiasm among national Democrats and progressives eager to take out McConnell; multiple Senate Democrats tweeted their support. And after proving herself a capable fundraiser in 2018, she is once again hauling in cash: McGrath raised nearly $11 million in the third quarter of this year, a record total for a Kentucky Senate candidate. But McGrath stumbled in the early days of her campaign when she appeared to cozy up to supporters of President Donald Trump and said she would have voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court (a position she later changed). In Kentucky, her rocky start generated calls for potential primary opponents to jump into the race. Matt Jones, the host of a popular statewide sports radio show, is also considering a run against McConnell. Last week he suggested that the Kentucky GOP\u2019s decision to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission that led to his removal from the air may help push him into the race. This fall, Booker appeared alongside striking coal miners at the Blackjewel mine in Harlan, where employees fought for their final paychecks after the company suddenly went bankrupt. And in September, he appeared at a Youth Climate Strike event in Louisville. In the Kentucky state House, where the GOP holds a supermajority, Booker has sponsored legislation to automatically restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences,\u00a0which is a priority of the incoming Beshear administration. Booker has also challenged Republican efforts to further restrict abortion rights in the state. During one abortion debate in 2018, a white GOP lawmaker told Booker to \u201csit down\u201d as he spoke on the floor, an incident that Booker later suggested was fueled by racism and discrimination.",

      "content": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday he was \u201csorry\u201d the governor of his home state lost his reelection bid to a Democrat last week, but suggested it was time to move on and accept the results. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) appears to have lost the election to Democrat Andy Beshear by a mere 5,000 ballots, but he has so far refused to concede. Instead, Bevin has demanded a recanvass of the votes, citing vague voting \u201cirregularities\u201d without evidence. McConnell didn\u2019t seem to be having it during an event on Monday, saying Bevin had a \u201cgood four years,\u201d but the election result was unlikely to change. \u201cBarring some dramatic reversal on the re-canvass, we\u2019ll have a different governor in three weeks,\u201d the Senate leader told reporters, per The Associated Press. \u201cMy first election was almost the same number of votes that Beshear won by. We had a recanvass, added them up, it didn\u2019t change and we all moved on.\u201d The recanvass Bevin requested is scheduled for Thursday. Beshear has declared victory in the race, which could have dramatic implications for the state ranging from voting rights to public education. His inauguration is scheduled for Dec. 10. McConnell refused to say Monday if he was concerned about the blue wave that led to Bevin\u2019s poor showing, simply saying \u201cwe\u2019ll find out.\u201d Democrats have already begun planning their campaign to unseat McConnell, who is up for reelection next year. \u201cAll I have to say is: Mitch, you\u2019re next,\u201d Amy McGrath, a retired Marine pilot who is running to unseat him, said in a fundraising email just hours after Beshear declared victory.",

      "content": " Legendary newsman Dan Rather on Sunday accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of being part of the troubling \u201ccult\u201d of President Donald Trump. \u201cIncreasingly, President Trump\u2019s support seems cultish,\u201d Rather told Brian Stelter on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d noting: \u201cI\u2019m not the only one making this observation.\u201d It\u2019s \u201call about him, it\u2019s not about the policy, it\u2019s not about the standards of politics,\u201d he explained. \u201cCults generally don\u2019t end well,\u201d he said, echoing a tweet he posted Friday. Asked by Stelter if he considered McConnell part of the cult, Rather said: \u201cThe short answer is yes.\u201d Rather said the question lawmakers have to decide for impeachment is if Trump tried to \u201cbribe\u201d a foreign government with military aid to investigate a political rival, and if he tried to \u201cintimidate witnesses.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019d say history is closing in on him, facts are closing in\u201d on Trump. But Rather said he doubts the Senate will hold a \u201creal\u201d impeachment trial. The cult concept appears to part a growing narrative about the president\u2019s pull on the Republican Party and his supporters. Sources told Vanity Fair for an article last week that conservative attorney George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, has complained that his\u00a0wife is part of the Trump \u201ccult.\u201d Check out Rather\u2019s comments in the video above.",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Is Mitch McConnell\u2019s future as Senate majority leader in 2021 more assured with President Donald Trump at the top of the 2020 Republican ticket? Or with a President Mike Pence? Because while the president\u2019s staff is focused on the ongoing impeachment proceedings in the House regarding his attempts to coerce Ukraine into helping his reelection efforts, Trump\u2019s ultimate fate is more likely to hinge on the calculations of a single lawmaker from the other chamber, Kentucky\u2019s McConnell. And although McConnell would certainly rather keep his control over the Senate and have a Republican in the White House, a number of Republicans predicted that, if Trump\u2019s standing among voters were to fall even further, McConnell would choose his own political future over Trump\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d prefer both. But, if he has to choose, yes, the Senate is his higher priority,\u201d said one former top GOP congressional aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess McConnell. The former aide could not predict how low that approval rating would have to drop. \u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question.\u201d On Tuesday, as additional witnesses testified about Trump\u2019s efforts to use $391 million in military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to announce politically useful investigations, McConnell told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to me that there will be 67 votes to remove the president from office.\u201d The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of those present to remove a president who has been impeached by the House. If all 47 Democrats were to vote that way, it would require 20 Republicans to vote with them for Trump to be forced out. \u201cI think most Republicans are going to fall on a spectrum ranging from no big deal to moderately alarmed to believing this was very bad judgment \u2015 but that it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of impeachment,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP consultant in Kentucky and a former McConnell campaign aide. \u201cI think the White House will need to give Republicans the latitude to express those varying opinions as long as they hold the line against votes to convict.\u201d But Trump\u2019s problem is that while he is feared by Republican senators \u2014 and likely less so now than he has been, given recent GOP losses in Kentucky and Louisiana governors\u2019 races, despite his campaign visits \u2014 he is not particularly respected or liked. Former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said that if the Senate were to hold a secret ballot to convict Trump, \u201cat least 35\u201d Republicans would vote to do so. Which means that Republican senators\u2019 loyalty to Trump likely goes no further than to the extent it benefits them politically \u2014 and they could well abandon him if it appears that doing so is more likely to ensure their own reelections. In the case of McConnell, the limits of his loyalty are more likely to be linked to the fates of the half dozen or so of his most vulnerable Republican members in the coming 2020 election. With that current 53-47 majority, if just four Republicans lose reelection, McConnell would no longer be majority leader \u2014 a title he has sought for decades. Meaning Trump\u2019s fate will be less tied to his polling in safe, Trump-friendly states than to his approval numbers in places like Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and Arizona, where GOP senators are all facing challenging races. \u201cIf Trump is not removed, all those senators lose,\u201d said William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and a Reagan-era Justice Department official who is now running against Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination. He recalled the aftermath of the 1986 elections, when Republicans lost the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s such a feeling of powerlessness, and it\u2019s one that Mitch has had in the past, and he doesn\u2019t want to have it back,\u201d he said. Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who is also running for the 2020 GOP presidential nomination, said McConnell\u2019s primary goal will be to keep Republican control of the Senate. \u201cEverything else is a distant second to that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will dump Trump in a nanosecond if it helps the GOP retain the Senate. And remember, none of the Senate Republicans like or fear Trump. They fear his voters.\u201d Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 GOP primaries, said McConnell understands that the party is better off without Trump heading into the 2020 election. \u201cMcConnell will shrewdly play Trump\u2019s game until a clear majority of voters in enough states that Republican senators need to hold to keep control turn on Trump,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAt that point, he will dump Trump.\u201d Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House after a whistleblower filed a complaint that the president was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless its leaders announced investigations politically useful to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection. According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made the military aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress. John Ryder, a former Republican National Committee member from Tennessee, said few people outside of Washington, D.C., are paying much attention to the impeachment hearings. He said Republicans in particular are wary of the new effort because of the long-running investigation into Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, which did not result in articles of impeachment or a prosecution of the president. \u201cThey\u2019re suffering a little bit of \u2018boy who cried wolf\u2019 syndrome,\u201d he said, adding that Trump\u2019s approval ratings, after dipping a few points when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of the impeachment inquiry, are back to the low 40s. He said that if the percentage of people approving of Trump starts falling to the low 30s, senators who currently back Trump will start to rethink that position. \u201cIf you move public opinion, you start to move senators,\u201d he said.
