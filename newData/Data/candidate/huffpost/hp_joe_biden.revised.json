      "content": " President Donald Trump was given a chance Thursday to say whether his\u00a0suggestion\u00a0that China investigate his political rival Joe Biden was a joke \u2015 and he passed. Trump, asked by reporters on the White House lawn if he had meant his comments in jest, replied: \u201cChina has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d He added: \u201cFrankly, as far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too. That\u2019s up to China.\u201d Trump told reporters last week that China should start an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He made the comments amid impeachment proceedings prompted by his July 25 phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested that foreign government\u2019s aid in digging up dirt on Biden. Multiple Republican lawmakers, when asked if they believed Trump\u2019s China comments were appropriate,\u00a0defended them as being a joke, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.), Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cDo you really think he was serious about thinking that China is going to investigate the Biden family?\u201d Jordan said last week. McCarthy commented: \u201cYou watch what the president said, he\u2019s not saying China should investigate.\u201d The president\u2019s exact words were: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Trump\u2019s response on Thursday did not suggest he was joking about China. CNN reported last week that\u00a0Trump raised the topic of Biden\u2019s political prospects during a June 18 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to sources familiar with the call. The call record was stored on the same highly secure White House computer system used to house the summary of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Trump\u2019s entreaties to China followed GOP questions over Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of a Chinese private equity fund in 2013, while his father was the vice president. He accompanied his father on an official trip to China during that time.",

      "content": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday pressed his argument that the House impeachment inquiry is nothing more than a new attempt to overturn his election based on \u201ca lot of crap.\u201d Trump found a sympathetic audience in Louisiana, where an arena packed with his supporters roared at his profane denunciations of the proceedings hundreds of miles away in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to stop us for more than three years with a lot of crap,\u201d he said, referring to the investigation into Russian election interference that concluded earlier this year. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t win on Election Day so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bulls\u2015- impeachment,\u201d the president thundered at his second political rally in as many days. Trump also pressed his unproven claims against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Trump complained about a double standard in news media coverage. He said if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn\u2019t call the allegations unsubstantiated \u2014 \u201cThey would be saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the nearest cell?\u2019\u201d There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, in which he asked that country\u2019s president during a telephone call in July to investigate Biden. An intelligence community whistleblower complained that Trump was abusing his office for personal political gain. Trump insists he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and has called the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cperfect.\u201d Zelenskiy has said he was not pressured by Trump. Trump claimed Democrats are \u201crage filled\u201d and have opened the impeachment inquiry because they \u201chave gone completely insane\u201d in their \u201cnonstop battle\u201d to overturn the 2016 presidential election result. \u201cNancy Pelosi hates the United States of America, or she wouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Trump said of the Democratic speaker of the House, who had long resisted calls to initiate impeachment proceedings. Pelosi has said \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and Trump must be held accountable for actions that she says jeopardize U.S. national security, the integrity of American elections and the Constitution. Trump came to Louisiana to unite a squabbling Republican Party against the Deep South\u2019s only Democratic governor, hoping to keep John Bel Edwards from notching a primary win in Saturday\u2019s election. Republican loyalties are split between two major candidates: Ralph Abraham, a third-term congressman and physician from rural northeast Louisiana, and Eddie Rispone, a businessman and longtime political donor from Baton Rouge who is making his first bid for office. Both Republican candidates claim long-term support from Trump. \u201cTomorrow, you\u2019ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out,\u201d Trump said, criticizing the Democrat as bad for the state. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get 50%, then one of our two great candidates will win that.\u201d The president is not endorsing either GOP candidate to maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff, according to a White House aide and a campaign aide, both of whom asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy. Trump plans to endorse whichever GOP candidate makes it to a runoff against Edwards, the aides said. In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. With polls showing Edwards well in the lead, national Republicans have bombarded the state with millions in advertising and visits from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. to urge anti-Edwards votes and force a Nov. 16 runoff. Trump acknowledged the reality of college football season in the South and urged everyone to vote before they head to Saturday\u2019s big matchup between Louisiana State University and Florida State. He said people should vote before they go to the game, otherwise they will feel guilty and \u201cit will ruin your entire afternoon.\u201d Trump called Edwards \u201ca liberal Democrat who has sold you out,\u201d even though Edwards isn\u2019t the type of liberal with whom the president usually clashes. He described Abraham and Rispone, the two Republican candidates, as \u201cpro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-life, and they\u2019re pro-Louisiana energy if that\u2019s OK.\u201d Trump also kept up a sports theme by inviting the winners of the 2019 Little League World Series to the stage. Trump met in the Oval Office earlier Friday with members of the Eastbank All-Stars and invited them to fly home aboard Air Force One. The team is based in suburban New Orleans. Trump said he had become accustomed to watching Japan win the event. \u201cBut this year you have the world champions,\u201d he told the rally crowd before introducing the players one by one. ___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. __ Follow Darlene Superville and Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at:\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap and http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte",

      "content": " Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Sunday denounced President Donald Trump\u2019s decision earlier this month to publicly urge China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary race. Asked during an interview Sunday with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to ask China to open such a probe, Cruz stammered for a few moments before saying \u201cof course not.\u201d \u201cElections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it\u2019s not the business of foreign countries \u2015 any foreign countries \u2015 to be interfering in our elections,\u201d he said. Trump drew heated backlash from Democrats and some Republicans on Oct. 3 when he told reporters on the White House lawn that China \u201cshould start an investigation into the Bidens\u201d while discussing trade talks with the country. His comments echoed remarks he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call in which he urged the foreign leader to look into Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official and later the centerpiece of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump. Many of Trump\u2019s Republican defenders have claimed the president was only joking when he encouraged China to investigate the Bidens. But one of Trump\u2019s China advisers, Michael Pillsbury, told the Financial Times that he received \u201cquite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese\u201d following Trump\u2019s remarks. CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan continued to press Cruz on Sunday, asking whether it had been appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to get involved. \u201cDo you think that, say, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s been talking about China, who\u2019s been talking about Ukraine, do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy?\u201d she asked. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last week that he wants Giuliani, who has been urging foreign officials to investigate the Bidens at the behest of Trump, to testify before his committee. \u201cListen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections,\u201d Cruz, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Brennan. \u201cThat\u2019s true for Russia, that\u2019s true for Ukraine, that\u2019s true for China \u2015 that\u2019s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d He added that it would \u201cmake a lot of sense\u201d for Giuliani to testify. Watch Cruz\u2019s full interview with \u201cFace The Nation\u201d below. His comments about Trump\u2019s request to the Chinese begin around the 4:30 mark.",

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday that no family member of his would have an office in the White House or act as a diplomat under his potential administration. The Democrat\u2019s comments at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) forum in Iowa were in response to an NBC reporter\u2019s question of what kind of ethical guidelines Biden would create if elected president. The reporter referenced the candidate\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, whose business dealings in China and Ukraine have been at the center of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption\u00a0against the Bidens. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d the former vice president told reporters. \u201cPeriod. End of story.\u201d Biden appeared to be drawing a contrast with Trump\u2019s children, some of whom have been involved either as senior advisers in the White House or as\u00a0diplomats with foreign nations. The Democrat\u2019s remarks came just hours after his son Hunter Biden announced his planned resignation\u00a0from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, George Mesires, released a statement earlier Sunday\u00a0that said the younger Biden intends to resign from the board of directors of BHR Partners by Oct. 31. The statement also said Hunter Biden promises to avoid conflicts of interest if his father is elected president, and will continue to keep the former vice president out of his business affairs. At the forum, Joe Biden continued to stress that he has not discussed his son\u2019s business affairs with him, adding that he was not aware of what was in Mesires\u2019 statement until he read it upon release. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is let you take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden told reporters at the UFCW forum. \u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I\u2019ve done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d Hunter Biden had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings when Joe Biden was vice president, and stepped down from the position in April. The younger Biden\u2019s attorney has maintained that no law enforcement agency has ever accused his client of wrongdoing during his time on the board. In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country while his father, now one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, was vice president. Trump\u2019s phone call, and his request that a foreign government interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, is part of what sparked the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president for abusing the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. Trump has repeatedly defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing, saying that the call was \u201cperfect.\u201d Biden announced last week that he believes Trump should be impeached. He was one of the last 2020 Democrats to say so.",

Biden told ABC News, in an interview that aired on Tuesday, that he never made a mistake \u201cbased on some ethical lapse,\u201d but acknowledged he exercised \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by getting involved in something he compared to a \u201cswamp.\u201d Hunter Biden on Sunday announced he was stepping down from his position as a director for Chinese investment company BHR Partners as Trump continues to accuse him and his father of corrupt activity in Ukraine and China. Trump has urged foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Chinese government, to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into the president after a whistleblower complaint alleged he repeatedly pressured Zelensky and may have withheld U.S. military aid as leverage. Trump claims Joe Biden, as vice president, called for the removal of a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. There\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden or Hunter Biden did anything illegal. Hunter Biden told ABC News repeatedly that he never discussed his business dealings in Ukraine and China with his father. Hunter Biden acknowledged that his last name helped him professionally, and that he likely wouldn\u2019t have been asked to serve on Burisma\u2019s board had he not been the vice president\u2019s son. \u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he told ABC News of his foreign business deals. \u201cWhen I look back on it, I know that [I] did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d He denied Trump\u2019s claim that he raked in $1.5 billion from an investment deal in China, saying it has \u201cno basis in fact in any way.\u201d In recent weeks, Trump has gone after Hunter Biden during his political rallies and in appearances to reporters, bashing him for avoiding the media while his business dealings have been thrust into the national spotlight. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Trump tweeted several times over the last week. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m working and living my life.\u201d Biden said he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in giving a \u201chook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d an apparent reference to Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push for foreign leaders to investigate his family. \u201cDid I do anything improper?\u201d Hunter Biden added. \u201cNo, not in any way.

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " Republicans \u2015 the party that elected a president who built his real estate empire thanks to his father\u2019s help, allowed his children to run his company and gave his daughter and son-in-law top White House jobs \u2015 are appalled by the nepotism going on in the Democratic Party, particularly in the Biden family. Taking their cues from President Donald Trump, Republicans have been hammering presidential candidate Joe Biden for his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China. Trump has pushed the conspiracy theory that as vice president, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the country\u2019s chief prosecutor to prevent him from investigating a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden recently announced that he will resign from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month amid the political maelstrom. He has insisted he never did anything illegal or improper, although he said in an interview with ABC that he probably showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in joining the ventures. While Trump\u2019s allegations about the Bidens are entirely baseless, Hunter Biden did seem to be taking advantage of his famous name to score lucrative positions with foreign companies. (There\u2019s no indication he had any expertise in the Ukrainian energy industry otherwise.) Many people sincerely believe that there should be less nepotism in politics and it should be easier for people without connections to get jobs in government and elsewhere. But some of the people criticizing Hunter Biden and acting shocked about what happened have benefited from the same system. Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, went after Hunter Biden on Tuesday. McDaniel is the niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). Her grandfather was governor of Michigan, and both her grandmother and mother ran for Senate. Her father ran for attorney general of Michigan. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is the son of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and garnered much of his early political experience working on his dad\u2019s campaigns, also felt like it would be \u201cfair\u201d to investigate Hunter Biden if Democrats wanted to go after Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who was running a shadow foreign policy operation to personally benefit the president. \u201cSo if we want to investigate Rudy Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings, by all means do it,\u201d he said on MSNBC Tuesday. \u201cBut at the same time, you should, if you want to be fair, investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s economic dealings in the Ukraine as well.\u201d When host Stephanie Ruhle pressed Paul on whether that meant Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner should also be scrutinized for how they got ahead, Paul went into how \u201cboth sides\u201d are doing it. \u201cIf we want to go down the road of the politics of self-destruction of everybody, criminalize all politicians on both sides of the aisle and go after their family, yes. We can do that. But both sides are doing that,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody should excuse themselves and say, \u2018We\u2019re holier than thou, Trump is evil.\u2019\u201d On \u201cThe View\u201d Tuesday, Meghan McCain and Abby Huntsman\u00a0did not feign indignation over Hunter Biden like McDaniel and Paul, but they did\u00a0debate\u00a0whether his interview on ABC helped his father\u2019s presidential campaign. McCain is the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Huntsman is the daughter of Jon Huntsman (R), the former governor of Utah. Fox News had Peter Doocy report on Hunter Biden Wednesday morning. Doocy is the son of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy. The young Doocy, not coincidentally, was immediately hired by the network upon his graduation from college. And then, there was the tweet by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. There\u2019s not much more that can be said about the absurdity of this outrage. And for the record (because I know I will get emails and messages about this), I am not \u2015 at least in any way I can tell \u2015 related to the writer Studs Terkel. This story has been updated with Doocy\u2019s segment.",

Republicans have been hammering the younger Biden over his business dealings in Ukraine and China, where he served on several corporate boards, earning tens of thousands of dollars a month. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to compel Ukraine to help investigate the Bidens were uncovered by a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah), from calling out Hunter Biden for nepotism on Tuesday. But she wasn\u2019t the only GOP official with famous relations who\u00a0took umbrage about nepotism in Washington. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), and Donald Trump Jr. also weighed in. But Senate Democrats, including Biden\u2019s top allies in the upper chamber, said they were unbothered by the GOP\u2019s concerns regarding Hunter Biden. \u201cIf you look at boards of directors all over the world, you\u2019ll find all kinds of people connected to them,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has backed Biden\u2019s candidacy for president. \u201cI served on them, my husband has served on them.\u201d The California Democrat added: \u201cDid the last name Biden help? Sure, it helps everywhere, I think.\u201d Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said Hunter Biden did \u201cpretty well\u201d in responding to the questions surrounding his work overseas in his interview with ABC. \u201cIn hindsight, it was probably poor judgment but certainly nothing illegal,\u201d Jones said. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), meanwhile, called it a \u201cnon-story.\u201d \u201cMuch of what the Trump administration has said about Hunter Biden, according to the fact-checkers, is just completely false,\u201d he added.",

      "author": "Jessica Schulberg",
      "content": " During Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate, candidate Joe Biden was asked if it was a mistake for his son Hunter Biden to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while Biden was the vice president and working on Ukrainian corruption issues. Biden dodged the question: He insisted he and his son did \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment, that people should really be focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption, and something about George Washington. Trump\u2019s request in a July 25 phone call that the president of Ukraine investigate the Bidens is what prompted Democrats to officially open an impeachment inquiry. As the debate moderator noted in his question, there is no evidence that the Bidens had a corrupt arrangement in Ukraine. But both Joe and Hunter Biden seem aware of the poor optics. The former vice president has said he would ban his family and anyone associated with him from being \u201cinvolved in any foreign operation whatsoever\u201d if he were elected president. And Hunter acknowledged Tuesday, hours before the debate, that he used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in taking the job. So it was reasonable enough when CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Biden, \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?\u201d But Biden ignored the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d he started, even though Cooper had already said there was no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said multiple times before veering off on a tangent about Trump and the Founding Fathers: What I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th \u2015 look, the fact that George Washington worried, on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum. Cooper tried again. \u201cYour son Hunter today gave an interview and admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time,\u201d Cooper said. Biden again insisted he did nothing wrong \u2014 and said that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment. \u201cLook, my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made. I\u2019m proud of what he had to say. And let\u2019s focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d",

      "content": " More than two-thirds of the way into the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden took a casual swipe at his rivals without specifying whom he was speaking about exactly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d When a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d What happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms. Sanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Sanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage. Then it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. \u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d Warren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d Biden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.

The former vice president was at\u00a0a campaign stop in Columbus, Ohio, when he demanded of the president:\u00a0\u201cRelease your tax returns or shut up.\u201d The president, in a call on July 25 while military funds were being withheld, had asked Ukraine officials to investigate\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s past business connections in that country. The alleged quid pro quo request is now part of an\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00a0being conducted by House Democrats. Biden, speaking to reporters, suggested keeping the focus on what Trump claims is massive political corruption. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about corruption,\u201d Biden began. \u201d[Trump] is running the most corrupt government in the history of the United States of America, number one. Number two, he also is in a position where, as he talks about corruption, he is engaged in practices that, in fact, everyone around the world is looking and saying, \u2018How in God\u2019s name can this man be doing that while he\u2019s president?\u2019\u201d Biden then addressed the president directly: \u201cMr. President, you want to talk about corruption. I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns. I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress and as vice president. I made no money while I was in there other than my salary. \u201cMr. President, even Richard Nixon released his tax returns. Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.\u201d Biden then offered a theory on why the president has spent so much time going after him. \u201cThe reason why he is running after me is he knows I will beat him like a drum,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe understands that.\u201d Biden then pointed the finger at Trump team members including personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \u201cAs I said, Rudy Giuliani and the henchmen, and Trump\u2019s lawyers, how many of these folks are in jail?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cThese are the president\u2019s people, for God\u2019s sake! This is a corrupt, thoroughly corrupt outfit.\u201d",

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " Ukrainian officials knew for months that President Donald Trump was withholding key military aid to their country over demands that Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. The report, based on interviews and documents the Times obtained, directly contradicts Trump\u2019s claim that there could not have been an improper quid pro quo arrangement because Ukrainian officials did not know the United States was withholding $391 million in military aid. Instead, top Ukrainian officials reportedly knew of the aid freeze as early as the first week of August \u2015 just days after Trump requested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden during a July 25 phone call. If Ukraine\u2019s government knew of the delayed aid in August, it would blow a significant hole in the Trump administration\u2019s denial that the president engaged in misconduct. According to a whistleblower and testimony to Congress, Trump and his allies pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine as vice president and his son Hunter\u2019s business connections in the country. The report could also give more fuel to impeachment proceedings after a week that already included the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testifying that Trump had indeed held up aid to force Ukrainian officials to target the Bidens. Trump and Giuliani have been obsessed with Biden\u2019s role in Ukraine for some time \u2015 after it became a conservative\u00a0talking point\ufeff\u00a0that Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. (The prosecutor was, in fact, widely criticized for failing to stop corruption). Trump has also embraced a widely debunked conspiracy theory alleging a missing Democratic National Committee server being hidden in Ukraine. (There is no such server.) Trump brought up both on his July 25 call with Zelensky. Zelensky, a political outsider who won a landslide victory earlier this year, had worried about Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens even before he took office in May, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday. During a three-hour meeting on May 7, Zelensky and several of his advisers discussed how to handle Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. The Ukrainian leader\u2019s fears appeared to be well-founded. Only two days after Zelensky and his advisers\u2019 meeting, Giuliani told The New York Times that he would travel to Kyiv to push for an investigation into Biden and\u00a0Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. Although he canceled that trip over public backlash, Giuliani continued to lead an intense effort to force Ukraine to launch the investigation. Trump wanted Zelesnky to \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,\u201d ambassador Taylor told impeachment investigators on Tuesday. Taylor\u2019s statements contradicted those of the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who testified that he only recently learned that Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine may have related to pushing an investigation into Biden. Sondland\u2019s explanation was already hard to believe, given the plethora of media coverage of Giuliani\u2019s mission and Sondland\u2019s role as one of the administration\u2019s top diplomats. Following Taylor\u2019s testimony, House Democrats sent a letter to the State Department on Wednesday requesting diplomatic cables, emails and other communications related to Trump\u2019s attempts to get Ukraine to initiate investigations into the Bidens.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said Thursday it would welcome help from a super PAC, a total reversal from Biden\u2019s stance at the beginning of the campaign and a decision reflecting his diminished financial position in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Many Democrats view super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors for funding, as a malignant force that represents a big-money era of politics the party is nominally dedicated to ending. Democratic candidates for president in 2020 have largely avoided super PACs, but Biden\u2019s shift could lead more candidates to tacitly back outside groups. (Super PACs are not legally allowed to coordinate directly with campaigns, but an unkind word from a candidate is often all that\u2019s needed to deprive them of funding.) The Biden campaign said President Donald Trump\u2019s false attacks on the former vice president made it necessary for it to welcome the help of a super PAC. Trump, the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups have spent more than $10 million attacking Biden, with much of that money aimed at the four early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \u201cDonald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cHe and his allies are already spending massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u201d \u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Bedingfield said Biden would support a public campaign finance system and a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision. Biden\u2019s decision drew nearly immediate condemnation from his progressive rivals in the 2020 campaign. Adam Green, a top ally of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said Biden was putting his reputation as a longtime ally of the middle class at risk. \u201cBy making big-money corruption the center of how he funds his campaign, Biden severely jeopardizes his legacy as Common Man Joe that he spent decades cultivating,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf Biden cares about defeating Trump, he should not open the door to billionaires and corporations flooding the primary and should make clear he does not want his supporters to use big money to attack other Democrats.\u201d The campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who attacked Hillary Clinton over her support from super PACs during the 2016 presidential election, aimed a similar volley at Biden. \u201cThe former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,\u201d Sanders campaign manger Faiz Shakir said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we defeat Trump. It\u2019s a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision comes as he falls behind the other candidates in the money race, even though he still leads in much of the public polling. His campaign has just $9 million on hand, the fifth-highest total in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Sanders has $33.7 million in the bank, and Warren has $25.7 million. Even South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who are both well behind Biden in public polling, have more campaign funds than he does.\u00a0Biden has struggled to raise money online from small-dollar donors at the same pace as his competitors, and many of his donors have already given the federal maximum of $2,800. End Citizens United, a Democratic campaign finance reform group, criticized Biden for his reversal and said his fundraising struggles were no excuse. In a statement, it noted less than a month had passed since Biden last said he wouldn\u2019t welcome a super PAC. At that time, Trump\u2019s attacks on the former vice president had already begun. \u201cThe path forward for his campaign depends on Democratic primary voters trusting that they\u2019d have more say in a Biden administration than big money donors. It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,\u201d said Tiffany Muller, End Citizens United\u2019s president. \u201cThis is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.\u201d While Biden\u2019s campaign will dismiss much of the criticism aimed at his decision as coming from partisans who dislike his candidacy for ideological reasons or are backing his opponents, he can\u2019t say the same of End Citizens United. The group, which has pressured all of the campaigns to reject single-candidate super PACs, is neutral in the 2020 presidential primary and helped many moderate Democratic candidates win House seats during the 2018 midterms. If a super PAC forms to back Biden \u2015 and it would be shocking if one did not \u2015 he would become the second candidate in the field to welcome an outside group accepting massive donations. Businessman Andrew Yang welcomed the support of a super PAC earlier this week. A super PAC has formed to support New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, but he has said he doesn\u2019t want the group\u2019s help. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee embraced the support of a super PAC before he dropped out of the race in August. It\u2019s not clear if Biden will appear at fundraisers for a super PAC.\u00a0If a group begins raising and spending money during 2019, it will have to reveal its donors in January, before the first Democratic primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden has a long history as a campaign finance advocate, and has been fiercely critical of super PACs in the past. During an appearance on \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d in 2018, Biden said he told Sanders not to create a super PAC during his 2016 run. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.",

The former vice president has been at the center of the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged demand for a quid pro quo from the leader of Ukraine. Critics have accused the president of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from the country unless it opened an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing, although they have been subject to false political ads claiming as much. Biden said Sunday once more that he hadn\u2019t discussed Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. But he said that should he be elected in 2020, none of his children would have an office in the White House or \u201csit in on Cabinet meetings.\u201d The comments directly targeted Trump\u2019s children, including Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who hold senior roles in the administration. \u201cTheir actions speak for themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat you should make it clear to the American public is the idea that everything you\u2019re doing is for them.\u201d The Trump campaign defended Ivanka Trump and Kushner last week after Biden\u2019s remarks were first made public, saying the pair were \u201cinstrumental\u201d in major administration decisions. Despite the unfolding scandal over Ukraine, Biden said he was still on top of the 2020 Democratic field, saying the country needed \u201csomebody who on day one knows exactly what to do, can command the world stage.\u201d \u201cNo one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues in foreign policy and domestic policy. They\u2019re things I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cI know I\u2019m the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable couple exceptions. This is a marathon.\u201d Biden also levied harsh criticism at Trump, calling the president an \u201cidiot\u201d for refusing to admit that the Russian government was attempting to, once again, influence American elections. \u201cEverybody knows this, nobody doubts it,\u201d Biden said. O\u2019Donnell noted that Biden\u2019s campaign had just under $9 million cash on hand while some of his rivals were sitting on much bigger war chests, including Sen. Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million). But the former veep said he wasn\u2019t troubled by those figures, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re on course to do extremely well. I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign.\u201d Biden also noted that he has asked former President Barack Obama not to endorse him in the 2020 presidential race, saying he wanted to win the Democratic nomination on his own merits. \u201cI want to earn this on my own,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI asked him not to, he said okay. I think it\u2019s better, I think he thinks it\u2019s better for me.\u201d He continued: \u201cI have no doubt that when I\u2019m the nominee he\u2019ll be out on the campaign trail for me.\u201d",

Father Robert Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Florence told the local Morning News that during the 9 a.m. Mass, he refused to serve the Democratic presidential candidate because \u201cany public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d he added. Morey did not immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment and Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment. The presidential candidate declined to directly address the matter in an MSNBC interview. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just my personal life, and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d Biden, a practicing Catholic, emphasized that he does not seek to impose his \u201creligious beliefs which I accept based on church doctrine\u201d on others. He has said that he personally opposes abortion, but he has evolved politically on the issue. In 1982, Biden voted for an amendment that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. He has since reversed course, vowing to codify the ruling if elected and stating that \u201cwe must fight any and all attempts to overturn it.\u201d Similarly, Biden once backed the Hyde Amendment that prohibits federal funds from being spent on abortions but\u00a0announced his support for scrapping it earlier this year. \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without the health care they need,\u201d he said at a June gala hosted by the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support [the amendment].\u201d This has been updated to reflect that Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Bristling at Elizabeth Warren\u2019s suggestions that he\u2019s a milquetoast moderate with small ideas, presidential candidate Joe Biden countered Saturday that he offers a \u201cbold\u201d vision for the country and warned that Democratic primary voters should not get distracted by the party\u2019s increasingly tense battle over ideological labels. It was a departure from Biden\u2019s usual campaign speech and signaled perhaps a new phase of Democrats\u2019 search for a nominee to take on President Donald Trump, with Warren, the leading progressive candidate, and Biden, the top choice for most moderates and establishment liberals, ratcheting up the intensity three months ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cThe vision I have for this country, there\u2019s nothing small about it. It is like going to the moon,\u201d Biden told supporters in Des Moines, as he hit the high points of a policy slate that would increase the federal government\u2019s spending and scope on everything from health care to the climate crisis. Without naming Warren, the former vice president said his ideas \u2014 such as a \u201cpublic option\u201d to compete alongside private health insurance, as opposed to Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d plan run altogether by the government \u2014 actually set the progressive standard in 2020 for a simple reason: They\u2019re more achievable. \u201cI\u2019m not promising anything crazy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a vision \u2014 a vision of how we can get things done.\u201d With reporters afterward, Biden zeroed in on Warren\u2019s estimated $20 trillion price tag for the first decade of single-payer insurance. \u201cGetting that plan through, even in a Democratic Congress,\u201d Biden predicted, \u201cwould be difficult.\u201d Biden\u2019s latest volleys came barely 12 hours after Warren used Iowa Democrats\u2019 annual fundraising gala to draw sharp distinctions in the Democratic field, though she, like Biden, avoided naming opponents. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d the Massachusetts senator told thousands of voters sporting t-shirts and waving signs as their preferred candidates took turns on center stage at a downtown Des Moines arena Friday night. Even if \u201csome people in our party don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d Warren argued, the nation is in \u201ca time of crisis\u201d not just because of Trump\u2019s divisiveness but more so because of an economic and political system rigged against the working class. \u201cIf the most we can promise is \u2018business as usual\u2019 after Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said, \u201cthen Democrats will lose.\u201d The senator doubled-down Saturday, insisting in Vinson, Iowa, that sweeping plans are good politics and perhaps necessary to upend Trump. \u201cWe need big ideas to inspire people, to get them to turn out for the caucuses, to turn out and vote,\u201d Warren said. Asked hours later, after an event in Dubuque, if she was suggesting candidates like Biden weren\u2019t being ambitious enough, Warren responded: \u201cNope. I\u2019m just out here talking about what I\u2019m running on.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about my vision for what it means to build an America going forward that doesn\u2019t just work for a thin slice at the top, but an America that works for everyone,\u201d she said. Still, at the very least, Biden\u2019s reaction suggests frustration over Warren\u2019s apparent momentum, even as he and his aides maintain that his philosophical approach will be successful among both Democratic primary voters and the general electorate. Biden\u2019s proposals, to be clear, put him to the left of recent Democratic nominees, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. But on most points, he falls short of the proposals on the left flank that Warren and her fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, have set. Rather than obliterate private insurance, Biden touts a government plan to compete alongside private firms. Rather than government covering all four-year college tuition, Biden pushes two years a taxpayer-paid tuition. On climate, he backs most long-term goals of the left\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d but on a longer timeline and with an initially less aggressive crackdown on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIt\u2019s made to look like \u2018Well, Biden is coming off with some moderate proposal,\u2019\u201d Biden said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing moderate about making sure everyone has health care. There\u2019s nothing moderate about getting to net-zero emissions. There\u2019s nothing moderate about fundamentally changing the school system in America so we can effectively complete in the 20th century.\u201d The difference in his proposals, Biden argued: \u201cI tell you straight up how we\u2019re going to pay for it and how much it\u2019s going to cost and how it\u2019s going to get done.\u201d The dynamics Biden faces were crystallized as young climate activists interrupted him and chided him for not doing enough to take on the oil and gas industry. \u201cLet her speak,\u201d the candidate said as his supporters tried to drown out one of the activists. Yet as the small group chanted, sang and ultimately departed, Biden grew more frustrated. \u201cIf you\u2019ll notice, they left before I answered her question,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what is going on that\u2019s wrong with our party right now. Everything is taken in contexts that are not accurate.\u201d As his voice calmed, he sought again to widen his appeal. \u201cThe way we win is we unify, we come together as Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have basically the same hopes and dreams. The question is, practically, how we get there. But it\u2019s not a lack of vision.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Vinson and Dubuque, Iowa. ___ Follow Bill Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.",

If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Biden, who pitches himself as more able to win over moderate voters in crucial swing states than Warren or the other major contenders in the Democratic race, emphasized throughout the piece that Warren\u2019s comment \u201cis no way to bring the country together. This is no way for this party to beat Donald Trump\u201d in next year\u2019s presidential election. Warren\u2019s remarks came after Biden\u2019s campaign launched an attack on her Medicare for All plan, accusing her campaign of using \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d to hide that its $21 trillion cost would require tax increases on the middle class.

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying world on Wednesday, criticizing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being too aggressive and unwilling to give Republicans a chance. \u201cWith Donald Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to see a number of my Republican colleagues have an epiphany. Mark my words. Mark my words,\u201d Biden said. On the same day Biden made his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was just a few blocks away at the White House, boasting about how he blocked Merrick Garland from getting a seat on the Supreme Court. Garland, of course, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away. McConnell successfully blocked Garland from even getting a hearing \u2015 all long before Trump came into office. Biden spoke at Sidley Austin, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful law firms literally located on K Street (which has long been shorthand for Washington lobbying). Sidley Austin also has a lobbying practice. Biden, like the rest of the major 2020 Democratic candidates, is not taking money from federal lobbyists. Biden has been going after Warren in recent days after she said he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Her comments came in response to\u00a0Biden\u2019s criticism of how she will pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Biden said the next president is going to inherit a \u201cdivided nation,\u201d and he made the case that he, and not someone like Warren, can make it better. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take two things: One is somebody who in fact, knows how to reach across the aisle and get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the people that are running against me tell me I\u2019m na\u00efve, one said I should be in the Republican primary, God love her. That\u2019s not the way you get things done, man. You don\u2019t go in and tell people that they disagree there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with them.\u201d The attendees applauded at Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden has made these \u201cepiphany\u201d comments before. \u2033[T]he thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,\u201d he said in May. \u201cYou will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d This belief is central to Biden\u2019s pitch: Trump is so bad, and Biden is so good at working across the aisle that bipartisan comity will just suddenly break out if he\u2019s elected. Even in the Obama years, Biden was hopeful that Republicans would finally come around.\u00a0In November 2012, he predicted that if Obama won a decisive reelection, he could get Republicans to work alongside the administration and that people would see the \u201cfever break.\u201d Republicans showed little willingness to work with Obama after his reelection. On clean energy, Republicans used a failed green energy startup, Solyndra, to question all of the administration\u2019s energy initiatives and cast the president as corrupt. And Republican senators blocked Garland in 2016. Biden recently said he was open to a super PAC backing him. Those entities can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors. Many of Biden\u2019s opponents have shunned super PACs this cycle, and two of his progressive competitors \u2015 Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 also don\u2019t do high-dollar fundraisers.",

      "content": " Ukraine\u2019s president was preparing to announce a groundless investigation into Joe Biden on CNN \u2014 against his better judgment \u2014 but managed to duck out of it when Congress pressed Donald Trump to release military aid he was withholding, The New York Times reported. The last thing President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to do was become entangled in U.S. politics, the Times reported, but he was convinced that the only way he could finally get the appropriated $400 million in U.S. aid was to follow the president\u2019s instructions for announcing an investigation of Biden and his son, according to interviews with Kyiv government officials. If the money wasn\u2019t released by the end of the fiscal year in September, Ukraine risked losing it for good. Zelensky was determined to do what he had to do for the money, even though avoiding partisan U.S. politics was the \u201cfirst rule of Ukrainian foreign policy,\u201d the Times reported. Aides were arguing in favor of \u201cbowing to what was demanded,\u201d said Petro Burkovskiy, a senior fellow at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation with ties to Ukraine\u2019s government, according to the Times. But the \u201ccost was high,\u201d he added. Trump reportedly expected Zelensky to make a high-profile statement about launching an investigation of his 2020 presidential rival. A top U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,\u00a0William Taylor, testified before House members that Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s appointed ambassador to the European Union, told him the military aid was dependent on Zelensky making a \u201cpublic statement\u201d about initiating an investigation of Biden. Sondland said that \u201cPresident Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d Taylor testified. Zelensky agreed to an interview on CNN during which he was to reveal \u201cinvestigations that would have played into domestic political affairs,\u201d Taylor told lawmakers. But the military funds were released Sept. 11 after a congressional uproar, just two days before Zelensky was scheduled to appear on CNN. He quickly canceled, the Times reported. The Times story, as well as Taylor\u2019s \u2014 and others\u2019 \u2014 testimony sharply undercuts Trump\u2019s argument that there was no quid pro quo in his withholding of funds and his July 25 phone call pressing Zelensky for an investigation into Biden and his son. The president, however, is now saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with a quid pro quo using military aid to press Zelensky to investigate his political rival, which would predictably affect the 2020 U.S. presidential election. \u201cThe Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,\u201d Burkovskiy told the Times. \u201cThey were ready to do this.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, while testifying in an impeachment inquiry hearing Wednesday, revealed new information about President Donald Trump\u2019s conversations about Ukraine. In\u00a0his opening remarks\u00a0to the House Intelligence Committee, Taylor said one of his staff members told him just last week about a conversation he had with Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland the day after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor said the staff member was at a restaurant with Sondland, who had donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee and was appointed to his envoy role by the president, when Sondland called Trump on July 26. The staff member could hear Trump ask about \u201cthe investigations,\u201d according to Taylor. He said Sondland told Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. \u201cFollowing the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cAmbassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.\u201d Taylor suggested the House Intelligence Committee is following up on his staff member\u2019s revelation. The aide is David Holmes,\u00a0counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, according to\u00a0NBC News and CBS News. The Intelligence Committee on Wednesday announced that he is scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Friday. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off Taylor\u2019s new information about Trump\u2019s alleged call with Sondland, calling it \u201chearsay.\u201d \u201cThe latest \u2018evidence\u2019 is an anonymous staffer who told someone he overheard someone else talking to POTUS on the phone,\u201d Grisham said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cAll the \u2018evidence\u2019 in this case is hearsay.\u201d At a news conference later on Wednesday, Trump said he didn\u2019t recall speaking with Sondland after his call with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cI know nothing about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve heard it. ... I don\u2019t recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.\u201d Taylor\u2019s revelation about Trump\u2019s call with Sondland came during the first day of public hearings in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, specifically his efforts to get Zelensky to commit to investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, were the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed in August and are now the centerpiece of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Sondland, who had no foreign policy experience prior to becoming ambassador, initially testified on Oct. 17 during a closed-door session before House investigators that he couldn\u2019t recall having any discussions about Biden or taking part in any campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate him. But Sondland significantly altered his story on Nov. 5 after Taylor and Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman contradicted his claims in their depositions. In his amended testimony, Sondland acknowledged that he was involved in Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. He is slated to publicly testify in the impeachment inquiry on Nov. 20. This story has been updated with Trump comments. Antonia Blumberg contributed reporting.",

Virtually no progress has been made on the issue. On Thursday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency threatened the Democratic presidential candidate after he criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy and called Kim a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d \u201cAnyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea], can never spare the DPRK\u2019s merciless punishment whoever and wherever,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd he will be made to see even in a grave what horrible consequences will be brought about by his thoughtless utterances.\u201d The agency continued, \u201cRabid dogs like Biden can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,\u201d adding that the former vice president\u2019s demise would \u201cbe beneficial for the U.S. also.\u201d Hitting back at the remarks, Biden\u2019s campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates\u00a0told The Associated Press that it was a sign of Kim\u2019s fear of the 2020 hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and \u2018love\u2019 them, find Joe Biden threatening,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests and values at the heart of our foreign policy.\u201d Unlike North Korea\u2019s treatment of Biden, its regime has praised Trump, including after the ouster of former national security adviser John Bolton.

I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.\u201d The majority of marijuana users do not go on to use other, more dangerous substances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the agency said more research is needed to determine whether it is a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d Scientists\u00a0have not yet found solid evidence of marijuana leading people to harder drugs more so than other readily available substances like alcohol or tobacco. Support for legalizing marijuana has grown steadily over recent decades \u2015 according to a Gallup poll conducted last month, two-thirds of Americans favor such a policy. Medical use of the drug has been legalized in a majority of the 50 states, and in 11 of them and the District of Columbia recreational use is also permitted. But use and possession of marijuana remains illegal under federal law (even as enforcement of those prohibitions has become more lax). Biden said he supported marijuana use for medical purposes, as well as leaving it to individual states to decide whether to legalize recreational cannabis. \u201cStates should be able to make a judgment to legalize marijuana,\u201d Biden said at the town hall. Most of Biden\u2019s rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary race have said they would push to legalize marijuana on the federal level if elected president, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Bernie Sanders\u00a0(Vt.). Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who would become majority leader if Democrats win control of the chamber next year, also supports decriminalizing cannabis on the federal level. Biden has faced criticism over his record of advocating laws that helped fuel the war against drugs and mass incarceration, including the controversial 1994 crime bill. That measure led to much harsher sentences for use and possession of an array of drugs, including marijuana, causing the U.S. prison population to balloon. Minority communities were hit especially hard by the crackdown.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is threatening former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead with Latino voters in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with the winner set to potentially reap a huge collection of delegates that could prove crucial to deciding who emerges as the Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump. Both men held town halls in Las Vegas this weekend ahead of a Nevada Democratic Party dinner here on Sunday night, and both used the opportunity to highlight their support in the first state to vote with a significant Latino population. Biden is relying on support from Latino and Black voters to keep his campaign alive and collect large sums of delegates to the Democratic National Convention even if he struggles in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Sanders\u2019 strength with Latino voters is a direct threat to that strategy. \u201cI think the Latino vote will be the single most important part of the delegate map for any candidate this year,\u201d said Chuck Rocha, a top strategist for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve made [Latino voters] a part of the general strategy. In other campaigns, it\u2019s been an afterthought. We\u2019re not doing that to prove a point. We\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s smart politics.\u201d Rocha noted Latino voters are a growing presence in Iowa and South Carolina, and a key bloc in Nevada. But the real prize will come on Super Tuesday. Colorado, Texas and California \u2015 all of which are more than 20% Latino, according to census data \u2015 will combine for more than 700 delegates. And other Super Tuesday states, including Oklahoma, North Carolina and Virginia, are home to sizable Latino populations. Their electoral importance means basically every campaign is aggressively courting Latino voters. One of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s first campaign trips was to Puerto Rico, and her campaign has hired Latino state directors in California, Texas and Florida. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is struggling with voters of color, has hired a Latinx outreach director based in Las Vegas. Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who would be the first-ever Latino major-party nominee, has escorted an asylum-seeker to a check-in with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and is counting on Latinos to turn around his struggling campaign.\u00a0Despite these efforts, public polling of Latinos generally shows Biden and Sanders in the lead. A Noticias Telemundo poll conducted in late October found Biden earning the support of 26% of Hispanic Democrats nationally, while Sanders collected 18% and Warren was at 10%. Every other candidate was below 5%. A Latino Community Foundation poll of Latino voters in California found 31% planned to vote for Sanders, while 22% are planning to back Biden and 11% will back Warren. Here in Nevada, a Nevada Independent poll found 33% of Hispanic voters in the state backed Biden, 24% backed Sanders and just 11% backed Warren.\u00a0(One recent poll does break the Sanders vs. Biden duopoly: A Telemundo poll of Texas found Biden earning 33% of the vote of Hispanic Democrats in the state, with Warren at 16% and Sanders at 11%.) Sanders spent almost the entire weekend courting Latino voters, starting with a rally in East Los Angeles with the punk-funk band Ozomatli on Saturday, then with a candidate forum on Latino issues at a California Democratic Party event, and ending with a town hall on immigration at the East Las Vegas Community Center. The 400-person town hall, packed with college students and young adults, highlighted how Sanders\u2019 support among Latinos is driven by ideologically motivated young people, who have dubbed him \u201cTio Bernie.\u201d Sanders talked extensively about his new immigration plan, which includes the abolishment of both ICE and Customs and Border Protection in their current forms, a moratorium on deportations and the reversal of Trump\u2019s travel ban and policy requiring asylum-seekers to apply from Mexico. \u201cWe will stop the demonization of undocumented people in this country,\u201d Sanders told the crowd, calling both Trump a \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cxenophobe.\u201d \u201cWe will not have agents of the federal government ripping tiny babies from the arms of their mothers.\u201d Sanders has more than 80 Latino staffers across the early states and his Washington, D.C., headquarters, and both his political director and California state directors are Latino. Rocha said the staff diversity helps the campaign understand the differences between communicating with Latinos in Iowa, who are frequently recent immigrants, and Chicanos with a long history of activism in Los Angeles. And he noted young Latino staff members, including DACA recipients, helped Sanders craft his immigration plan. Will Lizarraga, a sales manager, was typical of the crowd at the town hall. Wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo of progressive YouTube show The Young Turks, Lizarraga cited Sanders\u2019 long-term support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and other liberal policies. \u201cIt\u2019s his track record,\u201d Lizarraga said. \u201cEven when I was a little kid, he was fighting for me.\u201d Lizarraga, a U.S. permanent resident, is scheduled to get his citizenship sometime in February. He hopes to become a citizen in time to cast a ballot for Sanders at the Feb. 22 caucus. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who has endorsed Biden, gave a simple reason for backing the former vice president: He trusts him. Biden was the first candidate to meet with the CHC after launching his campaign, Correa said, and promised to \u201cput his back into\u201d passing comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cHe said \u2018Absolutely, I\u2019m your person. I\u2019m going to put my political capital into backing immigration reform,\u2019\u201d Correa recalled. Biden is counting on that trust, formed over a long political career, to help him with Latinos. In his appearances both at a town hall and at the Nevada Democratic Party\u2019s First In The West dinner, Biden began by mentioning his long history of campaigning in the state, dating back to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s first campaign for the Senate in 1986, and running up to his work to elect the Senate\u2019s first-ever Latina, Catherine Cortez Masto, in 2016. \u201cHe has a record of being a consensus-builder,\u201d said Correa, a moderate Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy who represents putting politics aside, who represents putting the partisan labels aside, who wants to get work done for the American people.\u201d But Biden\u2019s diverse coalition requires tending. While Sanders was able to spend virtually the whole weekend focused on Latino voters, Biden\u2019s town hall took place at a majority-Black elementary school, and he flew to rural Elko for a town hall on Sunday afternoon. At the town hall in Las Vegas, Biden presented his more mainstream vision for immigration policy, promising to \u201cimmediately\u201d reunite families at the border and work to protect DACA recipients and attacking Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m running to get rid of those Mexican rapists,\u2019\u201d Biden said at the town hall. \u201cThe words presidents speak matter.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, implicitly criticized Biden earlier in the weekend, saying at a Univision forum it was not necessary for the Obama administration to deport more than 3 million people. Of course, Sanders\u2019 own record on immigration isn\u2019t flawless: He opposed a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill because he objected to guest worker programs that he \u2014 and his labor unions \u2014 worried would create an underclass of workers.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Kurt Volker, President Donald Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, testified that he was oblivious to the connection between President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and targeting former Vice President Joe Biden. Volker was trying to \u201cthread the needle\u201d between a Burisma investigation (which Trump desperately wanted and Volker believed could help convince him to continue supporting Ukraine) and a Biden investigation (which he says he knew would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d). \u201cI now understand most of the other people didn\u2019t see or consider this distinction,\u201d Volker said of investigating Burisma and investigating the Bidens. \u201cFor them it was synonymous.\u201d It\u2019s common for Trump administration officials to believe that they can advance broad policy goals without becoming complicit in anything improper. An anonymous administration official has insisted to the public that they are working diligently to \u201cpreserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses.\u201d Respected national security officials like John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, and Jim Mattis all thought they could serve as the adults in the room. They all resigned after realizing the futility of that goal. Before Trump was elected president, Volker and friends joked that none of them would want to work in the Trump administration \u2014 but they each wanted the other to do it and serve as the voice of reason. Volker felt committed to Ukraine\u2019s future and the fight against Russia, he said Tuesday. He hoped that he could get a skeptical Trump to support that effort by convincing the Ukrainians to give the president what he wanted. But Volker soon learned that the only way to get Trump on board was with what amounted to a demand that a country deeply dependent on U.S. military aid help advance the president\u2019s personal political ambitions. Volker claimed that he thought there was a distinction between \u201cBurisma\u201d and \u201cBiden,\u201d and that he saw investigating them as \u201cdifferent \u2015 the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable.\u201d When U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland brought up the investigations during a meeting with Ukrainian officials, it was an \u201ceye-roll moment,\u201d Volker said Tuesday. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,\u201d Volker told the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing on Tuesday afternoon. Volker later admitted that he \u201c knew that [Hunter Biden] had been a board member,\u201d but said that he believed that investigating Burisma and investigating former Vice President Biden were \u201cvery different things.\u201d Volker is the first of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d at the center of the Trump-Ukraine scandal to testify in the impeachment inquiry \u2015 Sondland will appear before the committee tomorrow, while Energy Secretary Rick Perry isn\u2019t scheduled to testify. Volker texted a Ukranian official that they would set up a White House meeting after \u201cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016.\u201d Tim Morrison, a White House National Security Council official who testified alongside Volker, told lawmakers that he was hoping that Trump would have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky more support in their phone call in July. Volker said that he didn\u2019t think that the United States foreign policy should be focused on pursuing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d he believed the Ukranians were floating. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians \u2015 particularly the former prosecutor general \u2015 they\u2019re not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d Volker said. This article has been updated with Volker\u2019s comment about Ambassador Gordon Sondland.",

Biden campaign officials met with reporters Wednesday ahead of the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta. Asked whether the former vice president has spent much time watching the impeachment hearings, a senior campaign official said no but that they\u2019ve been \u201chelpful.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve really reminded people of two things: One, that you have Trump administration officials testifying under oath that Vice President Biden did nothing wrong,\u201d the official said. The official continued: \u201cAnd two, you\u2019re fundamentally reminding voters every day that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to have to face Joe Biden at the ballot box and that\u2019s why he\u2019s being impeached in the first place.\u201d The House\u2019s impeachment inquiry centers on Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to launch a political investigation into Biden and his alleged decision to use U.S. military aid to the country as leverage. The Biden campaign declined to discuss internal polling that may have demonstrated how impeachment is benefiting the former vice president, pointing to public polling and news headlines generally to show the \u201cnet benefit\u201d to Biden\u2019s campaign. As other Democratic candidates like Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have seen their support in the polls climb and then dip in recent months, Biden has remained the steady front-runner. Americans remain split on whether Congress should impeach and vote to remove Trump from office, according to a PBSNewsHour, NPR and Marist poll released Tuesday. The poll shows little change in public attitudes since the public hearings began last week. A Quinnipiac University poll\u00a0of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina out this week showed Biden at 33% \u2015 a 20-point lead over the rest of the Democratic pack. Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) trail the former vice president with 13% and 11%, respectively.",

The question was in reference to a call at the center of the impeachment inquiry in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his political rival, while discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine. Sondland dodged Maloney\u2019s questions, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize who would have and who would not have.\u201d Maloney, growing visibly frustrated, asked him five more times to answer him until Sondland said:\u00a0\u201cI assume President Trump would benefit.\u201d \u201cThere we have it,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSee, didn\u2019t hurt a bit, did it?\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony Wednesday has been largely damning to Trump, with Sondland admitting that the primary focus for Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani was to leverage aid to Ukraine in order to get the country to investigate Biden, whose son once worked for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, along with other conspiracy theories. \u201cEveryone was in the loop. There were no secrets,\u201d Sondland said of Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky. Trump, meanwhile, attempted to characterize Sondland\u2019s testimony as a positive, claiming he had been vindicated and that the impeachment hearings should come to a close.",

Asked how the United States should respond to the brutal murder of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing war in Yemen, Biden said he would end arms supplies and turn the regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman into a global \u201cpariah.\u201d \u201cI would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell war weapons to them,\u201d Biden said in response to a question from moderator Andrea Mitchell. \u201cWe were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are.\u201d Biden said in May that he would end U.S. support for the Saudis\u2019 war in Yemen, which has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis in the country.\u00a0The war has caused thousands of civilian deaths as well as widespread disease outbreaks and starvation epidemics across Yemen. Obama was called upon to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia over the war, but he\u00a0never did. Some top former Obama officials also called for end to U.S. support last year. Scrutiny of Saudi Arabia further intensified after the U.S. intelligence community and Turkish officials deemed Salman\u2019s regime responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s murder last year. Khashoggi, who was born in Saudi Arabia and was a prominent critic of Salman, was killed and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October 2018. President Donald Trump has continued supporting the regime\u2019s war in Yemen, and he refused to condemn the Saudis for Khashoggi\u2019s murder. \u201cThere is very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I would also ... end subsidies we have, end sale of material to the Saudis who were going in and murdering children and murdering innocent people. They have to be held accountable.\u201d Although it represented a break with Obama, Biden\u2019s position is in line with those of congressional members of both parties, including the entire Senate Democratic caucus. The House and Senate have voted in favor of resolutions calling for an end to U.S. support for the war. Trump has blocked attempts to cut funding, and an effort to override his veto in May\u00a0failed in the Senate. The four senators on the stage with Biden \u2015 Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2015 have all voted in favor of ending aid to the Saudi regime. Sanders, a longtime critic of the Yemen war, sponsored the original legislation meant to curtail Saudi assistance.",

      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " When Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) highlighted former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s unpopular position on marijuana during Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, it was not a great moment for Biden. And it only got worse from there as the former vice president stumbled repeatedly over sensitive racial issues. Booker went after Biden for stating earlier this week that he would not initially support legalizing marijuana if he were to become president. Biden had said at a town hall in Nevada on Monday that he wants to see more data about the long-term effects of marijuana use before legalizing the drug at the federal level. Biden\u2019s response to Booker quickly got strange when he began touting the support he\u2019s received from the Black community. \u201cI come out of the Black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the Black community \u2015 who have vouched for me \u2015 because they know me,\u201d Biden said, adding that he\u2019s received support from three former chairs of the Black Caucus. Biden fumbled again when he said he\u2019s received support from the \u201conly\u201d African American woman elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true ... the other one is here,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) jumped in while throwing her hands up and laughing. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a top Biden supporter, shrugged off the former vice president\u2019s Harris flub, telling reporters after the debate that speaking in soundbites can be \u201cdifficult.\u201d \u201cHe was there when Kamala Harris was sworn in so clearly he knows that there\u2019s another African-American woman,\u201d Bottoms said. Biden\u2019s fumble came after a statement from Booker on how politicians often use Black voters as pawns in presidential elections. The New Jersey senator used a topic Black voters are passionate about to segue into the smackdown that left the former vice president tripping over his words. \u201cI have a lifetime of experience with Black voters; I\u2019ve been one since I was 18,\u201d Booker said to laughter. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried. They\u2019re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to really be paid attention to is when people are looking for their vote.\u201d One issue that disproportionally affects the Black community is the criminalization of marijuana, Booker said. \u201cThis week I hear [Biden] literally say that \u2018I don\u2019t think we should legalize marijuana.\u2019 I thought you might\u2019ve been high when you said it. Because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people \u2026 the war on drugs has been a war on Black and Brown people.\u201d Biden\u2019s botched response to Booker was one of many gaffes the former vice president made during Wednesday night\u2019s debate. He routinely stumbled over his words, fumbling several times throughout the two-hour event. Biden didn\u2019t rescind his opposition to marijuana legalization but did say he would decriminalize marijuana and expunge any records of people arrested on marijuana charges. \u201cI do think that it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is.\u201d At the town hall in Nevada, Biden did state that he supported medical marijuana and leaving it up to individual states to decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana. Asked about Biden\u2019s awkward exchange with Booker, Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser to Biden, said the former vice president has been \u201cclear on where he stands on the issue of marijuana.\u201d She suggested Booker had simply been looking for a \u201cmoment\u201d on the debate stage. \u201cIt\u2019s silly season out there,\u201d she told reporters after the debate.

      "content": " The second week of House impeachment hearings featured top diplomats and White House officials giving dramatic testimony about President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to coerce Ukraine\u2019s government into launching investigations that would damage political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden. But several key officials also gave contradictory or inconsistent accounts of events and their knowledge of the quid pro quo campaign, sometimes radically departing from their initial closed-door testimonies in what appeared to be attempts to limit their accountability in the scandal. United States Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony, for instance, was damning and implicated top Trump administration officials, but it was also self-serving with many glaring omissions. Sondland tried to maintain a veneer of innocence throughout the hearing, claiming that he acted in good faith at all times and didn\u2019t know Trump\u2019s push to investigate Ukrainian gas company Burisma had anything to do with Biden. (Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served on the board of Burisma.) House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was incredulous that Sondland, who has previously claimed Ukraine was an important part of his portfolio, had no idea about Burisma and the Bidens \u2015 especially given that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was publicly advocating for an investigation into the company. \u201cApparently, a lot of people did not make the connection,\u201d Sondland claimed. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker gave a similar excuse for not raising concerns about the quid pro quo effort toward Ukraine, claiming that he didn\u2019t know that Burisma was tied to Biden and saying he only found out about it in late September. \u201cI did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two,\u201d Volker said, claiming that in hindsight he should have made the connection. Former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison, too, claimed he had to Google what Burisma was due to his unfamiliarity with the company. But Morrison, Sondland and Volker\u2019s denials are questionable given that Giuliani\u2019s interest in Burisma and its link to Biden was front-page news in The New York Times as early as May 1, and for months Giuliani was openly calling on Ukraine to launch investigations that would damage Biden. The effort to pressure Ukraine over Burisma had been covered by numerous major media outlets, and had been floating around as a conservative talking point since at least early 2019. Sondland claiming he did not connect Biden to Burisma wasn\u2019t the only time his account appeared to downplay his involvement in the quid pro quo effort, as he also contradicted other officials\u2019 testimony regarding a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials at the White House. Sondland testified that his recollection of the meeting did not square with accounts from officials including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia Fiona Hill. Both stated that Sondland had talked about investigations with Ukrainian officials during the meeting, and Hill added that it was not credible Sondland could have been oblivious that investigating Burisma was essentially code for the Bidens. Hill testified again on Thursday that Ukrainian officials brought up their desire for a White House visit during a July 10 meeting. As national security adviser John Bolton tried to deflect from answering the Ukrainians, Sondland interjected with a reference to the quid pro quo arrangement. \u201cAmbassador Sondland leaned in, basically to say, \u2018Well we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put underway,\u2019\u201d Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen.\u201d Hill testified that Bolton then immediately excused himself from the meeting. Bolton later instructed Hill to go to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer John Eisenberg and tell him that Bolton was not involved in \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and [White House Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d Hill took the \u201cdrug deal\u201d to mean the exchange of investigations targeting Biden in exchange for a meeting with Trump. The July 10 meeting was an early source of discrepancies in the investigation, and Volker initially denied in his closed-door testimony last month that Sondland raised investigations in the July 10 meeting. But Volker changed his account this week after witnesses such as Hill brought up the meeting and evidence mounted that Volker, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry were part of a back channel to Ukraine that pushed for a quid pro quo. \u201cThe meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate,\u201d Volker said in his opening statement. \u201cWe asked you about that meeting during your deposition and you told us nothing about this,\u201d Schiff asked Volker later in the hearing. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us about this?\u201d",

      "content": " Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham\u00a0(R-S.C.) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documentation on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine on Thursday, as the week\u2019s public impeachment inquiry hearings in the House drew to a close. In his two-page letter, Graham asked for a number of call transcripts, notes and communications involving Joe Biden, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, former Secretary of State John Kerry, a former Ukrainian prosecutor and people connected to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. While the impeachment proceedings target President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump\u2019s Republican supporters have attempted to steer the discussion toward the Bidens, claiming that the father-son pair were involved in Ukrainian corruption. The anti-Biden theory may stem from the work of right-wing columnist John Solomon, who has used his writing to elevate questionable sources.\u00a0Although no evidence has emerged to support the theory, some Republicans are now loudly alleging that then-Vice President Biden pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, who may or may not really have been investigating Burisma, in order to shield Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma\u2019s board at the time. In fact,\u00a0many officials\u00a0back then \u2015 including Republicans\u00a0\u2015 thought that\u00a0the prosecutor in question was ineffective against corruption and that his office needed to be reformed. That was a view shared by the Obama administration and key European allies. Nevertheless, Graham made a tenuous connection between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption in his letter. On the same day in 2016 that Ukrainian officials raided the home of Burisma\u2019s founder, Graham wrote,\u00a0Hunter Biden began following a State Department official on Twitter. Graham suggested that fact indicated that \u201cthe two may have initiated conversations regarding Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin\u2019s investigation into Burisma.\u201d The date was Feb. 4, 2016. In the weeks afterward, Graham wrote, Joe Biden held several phone conversations with then-President Poroshenko to discuss removing Shokin over allegations that he himself was corrupt. The prosecutor was removed on March 29, 2016. Graham\u2019s request covers communications between the parties from the day Hunter Biden followed then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Twitter to the day of Shokin\u2019s ouster. The senator did not specify a deadline for the materials\u2019 delivery. In the ongoing impeachment inquiry, witnesses have bolstered allegations that Trump leveraged military aid and a coveted White House meeting to improperly pressure the current Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is among the many Democrats seeking to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election and several national polls have consistently shown Biden leading the president in hypothetical match-ups. Language has been adjusted to clarify allegations relating to Victor Shokin.",

Biden told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon that he believed Graham was being coerced into doing the investigation. They have Graham \u201cunder their thumb right now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey know he knows if he comes out against [Donald] Trump, he\u2019s got a real tough road for reelection.\u201d Biden didn\u2019t mince words about how being investigated by a friend who once called him \u201cas good a man as God ever created\u201d made him feel. \u201cNumber one. I am disappointed, and, quite frankly I\u2019m angered by the fact that he knows me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe knows my son. He knows there\u2019s nothing to this. Trump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t yield to.\u201d Biden predicts things aren\u2019t going to end well for Graham. \u201cLindsey is about to go down in a way I think he\u2019s going to regret his whole life,\u201d Biden said, before addressing his old friend from the Senate personally. \u201cLindsey, I\u2019m just embarrassed by what you\u2019re doing \u2015 for you! I mean, my lord,\u201d Biden said. You can see the exchange below. CNN analyst Gloria Borger speculated at the end of the clip that Biden feels especially \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Graham since one of his campaign arguments is that he will be able to work with Republicans.",

      "content": " Rudy Giuliani\u2019s indicted associate Lev Parnas is prepared to tell Congress that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor who was ousted over corruption concerns in a bid to get dirt on Joe Biden, CNN reported Friday. A lawyer for Parnas, a Soviet-born American who has been indicted on federal campaign finance violations, said his client found out about the European meeting directly from the Ukrainian official. \u201cMr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December,\u201d attorney Joseph Bondy told CNN. Shokin was forced out of office by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament in 2016 under pressure from the U.S. and other Western nations over concerns he was soft on corruption. As vice president at the time, Biden was active in pushing for Shokin\u2019s ouster. Bondy also told CNN that Parnas worked to connect Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, with other Ukrainians who allegedly could come up with negative information on former Vice President Biden and the Democrats. If true, Nunes would be the first member of Congress linked to gathering opposition research on President Donald Trump\u2019s political rival from a former foreign official, CNN noted \u2014 and one with a score to settle with Biden, who had pushed for Shokin\u2019s ouster. Nunes declined repeated requests from CNN to comment. The attorney told CNN that Parnas is willing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of its impeachment inquiry. Information could prove explosive for Nunes. Parnas worked with Shokin and Giuliani to peddle the baseless claims that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of the Democrats and that Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine were corrupt because his son was on the board of a Ukrainian company. Bondy indicated in a tweet that he is already talking to congressional leaders about Parnas\u2019s cooperation with the impeachment investigation.",
