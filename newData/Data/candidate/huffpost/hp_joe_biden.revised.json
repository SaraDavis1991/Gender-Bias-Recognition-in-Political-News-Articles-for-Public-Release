Conservative website The Bulwark, which often features anti-Trump commentary from the right, shared this clip from senior video editor Barry Rubin: The clip, of course, was a reference to a tweet Trump posted last week taunting former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. That photo showed the Bidens with someone identified as a \u201cUkrainian gas exec,\u201d but was actually Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime business partner Devon Archer. Archer and the former vice president\u2019s son were on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings. Trump\u2019s tweet was removed when Nickelback filed a copyright complaint.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump was given a chance Thursday to say whether his\u00a0suggestion\u00a0that China investigate his political rival Joe Biden was a joke \u2015 and he passed. Trump, asked by reporters on the White House lawn if he had meant his comments in jest, replied: \u201cChina has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d He added: \u201cFrankly, as far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too. That\u2019s up to China.\u201d Trump told reporters last week that China should start an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He made the comments amid impeachment proceedings prompted by his July 25 phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested that foreign government\u2019s aid in digging up dirt on Biden. Multiple Republican lawmakers, when asked if they believed Trump\u2019s China comments were appropriate,\u00a0defended them as being a joke, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.), Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cDo you really think he was serious about thinking that China is going to investigate the Biden family?\u201d Jordan said last week. McCarthy commented: \u201cYou watch what the president said, he\u2019s not saying China should investigate.\u201d The president\u2019s exact words were: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Trump\u2019s response on Thursday did not suggest he was joking about China. CNN reported last week that\u00a0Trump raised the topic of Biden\u2019s political prospects during a June 18 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to sources familiar with the call. The call record was stored on the same highly secure White House computer system used to house the summary of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Trump\u2019s entreaties to China followed GOP questions over Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of a Chinese private equity fund in 2013, while his father was the vice president. He accompanied his father on an official trip to China during that time.",

      "content": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday pressed his argument that the House impeachment inquiry is nothing more than a new attempt to overturn his election based on \u201ca lot of crap.\u201d Trump found a sympathetic audience in Louisiana, where an arena packed with his supporters roared at his profane denunciations of the proceedings hundreds of miles away in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to stop us for more than three years with a lot of crap,\u201d he said, referring to the investigation into Russian election interference that concluded earlier this year. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t win on Election Day so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bulls\u2015- impeachment,\u201d the president thundered at his second political rally in as many days. Trump also pressed his unproven claims against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Trump complained about a double standard in news media coverage. He said if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn\u2019t call the allegations unsubstantiated \u2014 \u201cThey would be saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the nearest cell?\u2019\u201d There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, in which he asked that country\u2019s president during a telephone call in July to investigate Biden. An intelligence community whistleblower complained that Trump was abusing his office for personal political gain. Trump insists he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and has called the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cperfect.\u201d Zelenskiy has said he was not pressured by Trump. Trump claimed Democrats are \u201crage filled\u201d and have opened the impeachment inquiry because they \u201chave gone completely insane\u201d in their \u201cnonstop battle\u201d to overturn the 2016 presidential election result. \u201cNancy Pelosi hates the United States of America, or she wouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Trump said of the Democratic speaker of the House, who had long resisted calls to initiate impeachment proceedings. Pelosi has said \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and Trump must be held accountable for actions that she says jeopardize U.S. national security, the integrity of American elections and the Constitution. Trump came to Louisiana to unite a squabbling Republican Party against the Deep South\u2019s only Democratic governor, hoping to keep John Bel Edwards from notching a primary win in Saturday\u2019s election. Republican loyalties are split between two major candidates: Ralph Abraham, a third-term congressman and physician from rural northeast Louisiana, and Eddie Rispone, a businessman and longtime political donor from Baton Rouge who is making his first bid for office. Both Republican candidates claim long-term support from Trump. \u201cTomorrow, you\u2019ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out,\u201d Trump said, criticizing the Democrat as bad for the state. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get 50%, then one of our two great candidates will win that.\u201d The president is not endorsing either GOP candidate to maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff, according to a White House aide and a campaign aide, both of whom asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy. Trump plans to endorse whichever GOP candidate makes it to a runoff against Edwards, the aides said. In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. With polls showing Edwards well in the lead, national Republicans have bombarded the state with millions in advertising and visits from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. to urge anti-Edwards votes and force a Nov. 16 runoff. Trump acknowledged the reality of college football season in the South and urged everyone to vote before they head to Saturday\u2019s big matchup between Louisiana State University and Florida State. He said people should vote before they go to the game, otherwise they will feel guilty and \u201cit will ruin your entire afternoon.\u201d Trump called Edwards \u201ca liberal Democrat who has sold you out,\u201d even though Edwards isn\u2019t the type of liberal with whom the president usually clashes. He described Abraham and Rispone, the two Republican candidates, as \u201cpro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-life, and they\u2019re pro-Louisiana energy if that\u2019s OK.\u201d Trump also kept up a sports theme by inviting the winners of the 2019 Little League World Series to the stage. Trump met in the Oval Office earlier Friday with members of the Eastbank All-Stars and invited them to fly home aboard Air Force One. The team is based in suburban New Orleans. Trump said he had become accustomed to watching Japan win the event. \u201cBut this year you have the world champions,\u201d he told the rally crowd before introducing the players one by one. ___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. __ Follow Darlene Superville and Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at:\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap and http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is taking advantage of Facebook\u2019s rules to prove a point about the social network\u2019s refusal to ban posting false ads and statements from politicians. The Democratic presidential candidate is running an ad that begins with \u201cbreaking news\u201d\u00a0that then goes on to make the (fake) claim that the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201cjust endorsed Donald Trump for re-election\u201d in 2020.

Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\u201d Facebook drew ire this week for refusing to pull an ad that makes false accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is one of Warren\u2019s opponents in the Democratic presidential nominating contest. The platform has also faced heavy scrutiny over the\u00a0role it played in the widespread dissemination of misinformation\u00a0about candidates including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. In audio that leaked last week, Zuckerberg said he was prepared to \u201cgo to the mat and ... fight\u201d lawmakers such as Warren who are keen to break up big technology companies.

We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines,\u201d he added. \u201cThis means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Democratic presidential race that had been largely static through the summer has tumbled into a chaotic fall, shaped by unpredictable events and the deepening impeachment crisis surrounding President Donald Trump. Less than four months before voting begins, front-running candidates are facing urgent questions about their ability to challenge Trump, prompted by a health scare for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an uneven response by Joe Biden to the president\u2019s efforts to tie him to the impeachment inquiry and nagging questions about liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2018s electability. Lower-tier candidates are struggling just to be heard. The uncertainty is heightening anxieties among Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020. Although impeachment could imperil Trump\u2019s presidency, the process has also highlighted Trump\u2019s skill at discrediting his opponents, sometimes with baseless conspiracy theories. And Democrats appear no closer to sorting out what tactics, what ideology and what person is best-suited to overcome that. Progressive candidates like Sanders and Warren are surging in fundraising and drawing support from a wide swath of voters, according to polls, but face opposition from moderates who question whether now is the time to start the kind of sweeping \u2014 and divisive \u2014 economic and societal reforms they are pushing. It\u2019s a concern some moderates say has only increased against the backdrop of impeachment. \u201cThe divisions we have in the country threaten the health and stability of our democracy. President Trump has fractured so many norms,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cLike a patient getting over an illness or injury, we have to first heal the nation\u2019s divisions and reestablish our norms before we have the needed strength to successfully embrace and implement an array of big ideas.\u201d Vilsack, a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 race. He\u2019s been courted by, and consulted with, numerous candidates, and has spoken regularly with Warren. The Massachusetts senator has energized voters with a menu of detailed policy proposals, a folksy, relatable way of explaining them and a swell of small-dollar donations that brought in more than $24.6 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s increasingly turning her into a target for candidates who see her calls for overhauling health care and rebalancing wealth in America as outside the mainstream. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is trying to break into the upper rung, has focused in particular on Warren\u2019s health care plan, the Sanders\u2019-authored \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer system that Buttigieg describes as a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d But it\u2019s more than the policy Buttigieg is arguing against. \u201cWe have to be able not only to thrill a debate audience or a Twitter following but actually make something happen, which tells us that having the smartest policy is only half the battle when it comes to what will actually make a difference,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview. For now, Warren advisers are happy to have Sanders still in the race to help absorb those blows rather than becoming the sole target of the attacks. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey bolster each other\u2019s ideas.\u201d The confidence Sanders\u2019 campaign felt last week after announcing a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter \u2014 the highest in the race \u2014 was lessened after the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack. He told reporters this week that he planned to scale back his campaign, then said he had misspoken. He\u2019ll return to the campaign on Tuesday for a debate in Ohio. His advisers privately acknowledge that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry was escalating \u2014 may have helped limit the political fallout because attention was focused elsewhere. But they also understand that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 chief strategist, dismissed any long-term concerns, noting that the 2020 contest includes several older candidates, including the 73-year-old Trump. \u201cThere are a number of older candidates in the race, including the sitting president of the United States, and I can tell you with confidence, there\u2019s only one we can say with assurance whose arteries are completely open,\u201d Weaver said, referencing the stent procedure designed to clear Sanders\u2019 clogged arteries. Biden, 76, stands as the strongest obstacle to Warren and Sanders, fundamentally opposed on policy and pitching a more conciliatory approach to governing. The former vice president was already facing questions about whether he was out of step with the party\u2019s activist liberal base and up for the challenge of taking on Trump before he got pulled into the impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son. Although Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden are so far without foundation, the president and his allies have aggressively pressed the charges. Biden responded forcefully this week, but only after days of hand-wringing among supporters and advisers who worried he appeared ill-prepared for combatting the kind of asymmetrical political warfare at which Trump excels. Still, Biden backers contend that the mere fact that Trump has appeared focused on trying to take down Biden allows the former vice president to strengthen his electability argument by previewing what a one-on-one race with the president would look like. \u201cHe\u2019s able to go out there every day and make this Biden vs. Trump argument,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for Biden. That\u2019s the fear for some lower-tier candidates \u2014 that the head-to-head fight between Trump and Biden, and the grassroots support of Warren and Sanders, block out their opportunities for a late surge. Everyone is at risk, including those who have had flashes of success in recent months but are now languishing in the single digits in many polls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Buttigieg said there is no secret strategy for those candidates seeking to break out during this intense fall stride toward the first votes other than engaging in a \u201crespectful and robust\u201d debate of ideas. \u201cWhere there\u2019s an important difference, people need to understand that,\u201d he said.",

Trump drew heated backlash from Democrats and some Republicans on Oct. 3 when he told reporters on the White House lawn that China \u201cshould start an investigation into the Bidens\u201d while discussing trade talks with the country. His comments echoed remarks he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call in which he urged the foreign leader to look into Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official and later the centerpiece of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump. Many of Trump\u2019s Republican defenders have claimed the president was only joking when he encouraged China to investigate the Bidens. But one of Trump\u2019s China advisers, Michael Pillsbury, told the Financial Times that he received \u201cquite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese\u201d following Trump\u2019s remarks. CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan continued to press Cruz on Sunday, asking whether it had been appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to get involved. \u201cDo you think that, say, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s been talking about China, who\u2019s been talking about Ukraine, do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy?\u201d she asked. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last week that he wants Giuliani, who has been urging foreign officials to investigate the Bidens at the behest of Trump, to testify before his committee. \u201cListen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections,\u201d Cruz, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Brennan. \u201cThat\u2019s true for Russia, that\u2019s true for Ukraine, that\u2019s true for China \u2015 that\u2019s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d He added that it would \u201cmake a lot of sense\u201d for Giuliani to testify. Watch Cruz\u2019s full interview with \u201cFace The Nation\u201d below. His comments about Trump\u2019s request to the Chinese begin around the 4:30 mark.",

      "content": " Presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday that no family member of his would have an office in the White House or act as a diplomat under his potential administration. The Democrat\u2019s comments at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) forum in Iowa were in response to an NBC reporter\u2019s question of what kind of ethical guidelines Biden would create if elected president. The reporter referenced the candidate\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, whose business dealings in China and Ukraine have been at the center of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption\u00a0against the Bidens. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d the former vice president told reporters. \u201cPeriod. End of story.\u201d Biden appeared to be drawing a contrast with Trump\u2019s children, some of whom have been involved either as senior advisers in the White House or as\u00a0diplomats with foreign nations. The Democrat\u2019s remarks came just hours after his son Hunter Biden announced his planned resignation\u00a0from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, George Mesires, released a statement earlier Sunday\u00a0that said the younger Biden intends to resign from the board of directors of BHR Partners by Oct. 31. The statement also said Hunter Biden promises to avoid conflicts of interest if his father is elected president, and will continue to keep the former vice president out of his business affairs. At the forum, Joe Biden continued to stress that he has not discussed his son\u2019s business affairs with him, adding that he was not aware of what was in Mesires\u2019 statement until he read it upon release. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is let you take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden told reporters at the UFCW forum. \u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I\u2019ve done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d Hunter Biden had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings when Joe Biden was vice president, and stepped down from the position in April. The younger Biden\u2019s attorney has maintained that no law enforcement agency has ever accused his client of wrongdoing during his time on the board. In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country while his father, now one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, was vice president. Trump\u2019s phone call, and his request that a foreign government interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, is part of what sparked the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president for abusing the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. Trump has repeatedly defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing, saying that the call was \u201cperfect.\u201d Biden announced last week that he believes Trump should be impeached. He was one of the last 2020 Democrats to say so.",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday it may not be necessary to have the whistleblower who first filed a complaint about President Donald Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine testify before Congress, saying there were still major concerns about the person\u2019s safety. Schiff, speaking to CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d told host Margaret Brennan that while his committee was initially interested in speaking with the whistleblower, who is still anonymous, he felt like lawmakers had now confirmed many of the details in from the call between Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky that set off the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry. \u201cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\u2019t need the whistleblower who wasn\u2019t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\u201d Schiff said during the interview Sunday. \u201cWe have the best evidence of that.\u201d \u201cI think initially, before the president started threatening the whistleblower, threatening others calling them traitors and spies and suggestion that you know, we used to give them the death penalty to traitors and spies, maybe we should think about that again... Yes we were interested in having the whistleblower come forward,\u201d Schiff said Sunday. \u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected.\u201d In the complaint, which was filed after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, the whistleblower said they became concerned after hearing from multiple White House aides that Trump repeatedly pressured his counterpart to investigate a main political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. The call took place shortly after the president ordered nearly $400 million in military aid that had been appropriated for Ukraine be put on hold. The White House released a reconstruction of the call last month which showed clear instance of Trump asking for the investigation, and critics have said the demand reflected a clear quid pro quo in exchange for a political favor. Trump has rejected those calls, however, and labeled the impeachment effort a \u201ccoup\u201d and another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to overturn the 2016 election. He has demanded to know the identity of his accuser, fueling worries that the person\u2019s identity could be leaked and their safety put in danger. Trump, in a Monday morning tweet blasting Schiff, said he wanted the whistleblower to testify. \u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA,\u201d the president wrote. Trump appears to be referring to Schiff\u2019s analysis of the phone call with Zelensky, which Schiff gave at a House hearing. \u201cIt reads like a classic organized crime shakedown,\u201d Schiff said. The chairman leads one of three House panels spearheading the impeachment inquiry, and Democrats have already sent out a flurry of subpoenas and requests for documents related to the Ukraine call. While the White House has been stonewalling many of those efforts, some former officials have already spoken to lawmakers, including the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cWe want to make sure that we uncover the full details about the conditionality of either the military aid of that meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president,\u201d Schiff said Sunday. \u201cIt may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity to do that.\u201d He continued: \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make sure we protect that whistleblower.\u201d This article has been updated to include Trump\u2019s tweets.",

      "content": " Federal prosecutors are looking into Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, reported The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Investigators probing President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer have looked into his bank records, meetings and work with a local mayor, according to the Journal, citing people \u201cfamiliar with the matter.\u201d Investigators in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York have questioned witnesses as far back as August. Giuliani denied any wrongdoing, telling the newspaper: \u201cThey can look at my Ukraine business all they want.\u201d The New York Times reported last week that investigators had also been looking into whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws meant to protect the U.S. government from covert foreign influence. Specifically they were investigating Giuliani\u2019s links to the sudden recall in May of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Prosecutors were also reportedly examining Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings with Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, who were arrested at Dulles International Airport on Thursday on campaign finance charges. The two associates, who helped Giuliani investigate allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, were indicted for allegedly making fraudulent straw donations and funneling foreign money to a super PAC to support Trump and Republican Party candidates. The investigations into Giuliani\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and other matters come as the president faces an impeachment inquiry over his dealings with the country. Last month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry in response to a whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint said the call revealed Trump \u201cpressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d According to the White House\u2019s summary of the call, Trump asked Zelensky to work with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, as well as Hunter, based on unfounded corruption allegations.",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " On a snowy day in Manchester, New Hampshire, Democratic Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie, the front-runner for the party\u2019s 1972 presidential nomination, stood before the offices of the conservative Union Leader newspaper and denounced the paper\u2019s publisher William Loeb for publishing smears against him. \u201cBy attacking me, by attacking my wife, he has proved himself to be a gutless coward,\u201d Muskie said in an angry and emotional voice. Some reports claimed tears ran down his cheeks. Muskie, and many historians today, argued those tears were actually the steadily falling snow melting upon impact. But at the time, the reports that Muskie cried fueled a media narrative that he was mentally unstable. He won the New Hampshire primary by a smaller margin than anticipated and rapidly faded in the following contests. Forty-five years later, former vice president Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, stood before a crowd in Las Vegas to give a very similar message as Muskie. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d Biden declared on Oct. 2. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d What was done to Muskie is precisely what is being done to Biden. The president of the United States orchestrated a secret campaign of smears and deceit meant to destroy the political opponent he perceived as the most threatening to his own reelection. For Muskie, that president was Richard Nixon. For Biden, it\u2019s Donald Trump. Muskie\u2019s downfall was part of a broad operation of illegality orchestrated by the Nixon White House to cover up leaks, spy on political opponents and fix the 1972 Democratic Party primary. It ultimately ended with Nixon\u2019s resignation and pardon. During his career as a California congressman, senator and failed gubernatorial candidate, Nixon was bedeviled by political tricks pulled on him by Democratic Party consultant Dick Tuck. Envious of the tricks deployed against him, Nixon decided to harness them himself. Ahead of the 1972 election, his campaign and the White House hired a host of characters to screw with his opponents in the Democratic Party. The ultimate goal was to get the party to nominate South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, an anti-war figure they believed to be the least electable. (They were right.) One of these characters was Donald Segretti, a University of Southern California frat boy, who was known for pulling political pranks to win student elections. Segretti and his buddies called these pranks \u201cratfucking.\u201d Segretti and his ratfuckers were given the task of sowing confusion among the Democratic Party presidential candidates Nixon feared the most: former vice president and 1968 presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey, Washington Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson and Muskie. Among the many things Segretti and his team did to the Democratic Party presidential field was to forge letters from one campaign making wild allegations against another. They stole Muskie campaign letterhead and sent letters out alleging that sexual misconduct by Humphrey and that Jackson had fathered an illegitimate child with a 17-year-old girl. Muskie had to deny sending the letters while both Jackson and Humphrey were forced to deny the allegations. But what got Muskie up in front of the Union Leader on that snowy day in 1972 was something called the \u201cCanuck Letter.\u201d One of the tricks Segretti and his team pulled was to forge a letter to the editor that purported to be from a Florida man who had asked how Muskie could understand problems faced by African Americans since he represented Maine, a state with a very small African-American population. The letter claimed that Muskie laughed after a staffer said, \u201cNot blacks, but we have Canucks.\u201d At the time, \u201cCanuck\u201d was viewed as a derogatory term for French-Canadians, of which there were many living in New Hampshire. Segretti ended up pleading guilty to three counts of distributing fraudulent campaign material and served four months of his six-month prison sentence. Trump\u2019s attempt to tar Biden with the stench of a Ukrainian corruption investigation is just a grander prank aimed at rigging the 2020 election to his perceived benefit. In a now-infamous July 25 phone call, Trump pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a natural gas company that had Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden on its board. So far, Biden has not suffered in the polls since the controversy erupted after the whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of malfeasance was revealed in September. This is the only way that Trump knows how to do politics. He fanned the flames of birtherism against President Barack Obama, a racist dirty trick aimed at confusing both the public and the press. He latched on to every conspiracy theory imaginable about Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2015 she was dying, she sold uranium to Russia and so on. He publicly praised the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee and called for, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d to hack some more. And now he\u2019s used the power of his office in an effort to manipulate a foreign country to manufacture a corruption investigation into the potential opponent he fears most. Trump learned these politics from two professional smear merchants. The first was Roy Cohn, the McCarthyite-turned-mob-lawyer with a speciality in character assassination. The second was Nixon\u2019s ultimate fanboy, Roger Stone. Cohn became Trump\u2019s first political adviser starting in the 1970s after the upcoming real estate developer and his father were facing charges of racial discrimination. Cohn taught Trump three key rules for dealing with challenges in business and politics, the author Sam Roberts told Vanity Fair\u2019s Maire Brenner: \u201c1. Never settle, never surrender. 2. Counter-attack, counter-sue immediately. 3. No matter what happens, no matter how deeply into the muck you get, claim victory and never admit defeat.\u201d Before dying of AIDS, Cohn passed off his Trump account to Stone, who had been loosely affiliated with Segretti\u2019s ratfuckers. Stone had pulled his share of dirty tricks as a Nixon hanger-on, including faking a donation from a made-up socialist group to Nixon\u2019s 1972 Republican primary opponent California Rep. Pete McCloskey. It was Stone who pushed Trump to think about a political career as early as 1987 and was one of three advisers who laid the groundwork for his 2016 campaign. The story of the Republican Party\u2019s resurgence in the second half of the 20th century often leapfrogs Nixon. The traditional tale is one of a \u201cremnant\u201d of activists and wealthy oligarchs holding tight through the New Deal. They helped Barry Goldwater, a true conservative ideologue, get the GOP presidential nod in 1964. Then Ronald Reagan, the former New Deal Democrat-turned-conservative reactionary, won their revolution in 1980. Nixon\u2019s transactional politics don\u2019t fit. But Nixon and his destructive politics are the real throughline from his 1972 landslide to Trump\u2019s presidency. The destruction of Muskie and the DNC break-in simply presaged Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to coerce a foreign country to intervene to help him win again \u2015 after a different country helped him the first time. The politics of personal destruction Nixon deployed ultimately destroyed him. But they\u2019ve fueled Trump\u2019s entire career and the party that elected him. As he heads toward his own impeachment, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll heed Nixon\u2019s final message from the White House. \u201c[A]lways remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don\u2019t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself,\u201d Nixon said in his farewell statement.",

      "content": " Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, denied doing anything \u201cimproper\u201d in his work with Ukrainian and Chinese companies as President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence. Biden told ABC News, in an interview that aired on Tuesday, that he never made a mistake \u201cbased on some ethical lapse,\u201d but acknowledged he exercised \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by getting involved in something he compared to a \u201cswamp.\u201d Hunter Biden on Sunday announced he was stepping down from his position as a director for Chinese investment company BHR Partners as Trump continues to accuse him and his father of corrupt activity in Ukraine and China. Trump has urged foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Chinese government, to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into the president after a whistleblower complaint alleged he repeatedly pressured Zelensky and may have withheld U.S. military aid as leverage. Trump claims Joe Biden, as vice president, called for the removal of a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. There\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden or Hunter Biden did anything illegal. Hunter Biden told ABC News repeatedly that he never discussed his business dealings in Ukraine and China with his father. Hunter Biden acknowledged that his last name helped him professionally, and that he likely wouldn\u2019t have been asked to serve on Burisma\u2019s board had he not been the vice president\u2019s son. \u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he told ABC News of his foreign business deals. \u201cWhen I look back on it, I know that [I] did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d He denied Trump\u2019s claim that he raked in $1.5 billion from an investment deal in China, saying it has \u201cno basis in fact in any way.\u201d In recent weeks, Trump has gone after Hunter Biden during his political rallies and in appearances to reporters, bashing him for avoiding the media while his business dealings have been thrust into the national spotlight. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Trump tweeted several times over the last week. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m working and living my life.\u201d Biden said he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in giving a \u201chook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d an apparent reference to Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push for foreign leaders to investigate his family. \u201cDid I do anything improper?\u201d Hunter Biden added. \u201cNo, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d Watch ABC\u2019s interview with Hunter Biden below:",

      "content": " Republicans \u2015 the party that elected a president who built his real estate empire thanks to his father\u2019s help, allowed his children to run his company and gave his daughter and son-in-law top White House jobs \u2015 are appalled by the nepotism going on in the Democratic Party, particularly in the Biden family. Taking their cues from President Donald Trump, Republicans have been hammering presidential candidate Joe Biden for his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China. Trump has pushed the conspiracy theory that as vice president, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the country\u2019s chief prosecutor to prevent him from investigating a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden recently announced that he will resign from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month amid the political maelstrom. He has insisted he never did anything illegal or improper, although he said in an interview with ABC that he probably showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in joining the ventures. While Trump\u2019s allegations about the Bidens are entirely baseless, Hunter Biden did seem to be taking advantage of his famous name to score lucrative positions with foreign companies. (There\u2019s no indication he had any expertise in the Ukrainian energy industry otherwise.) Many people sincerely believe that there should be less nepotism in politics and it should be easier for people without connections to get jobs in government and elsewhere. But some of the people criticizing Hunter Biden and acting shocked about what happened have benefited from the same system. Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, went after Hunter Biden on Tuesday. McDaniel is the niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). Her grandfather was governor of Michigan, and both her grandmother and mother ran for Senate. Her father ran for attorney general of Michigan. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is the son of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and garnered much of his early political experience working on his dad\u2019s campaigns, also felt like it would be \u201cfair\u201d to investigate Hunter Biden if Democrats wanted to go after Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who was running a shadow foreign policy operation to personally benefit the president. \u201cSo if we want to investigate Rudy Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings, by all means do it,\u201d he said on MSNBC Tuesday. \u201cBut at the same time, you should, if you want to be fair, investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s economic dealings in the Ukraine as well.\u201d When host Stephanie Ruhle pressed Paul on whether that meant Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner should also be scrutinized for how they got ahead, Paul went into how \u201cboth sides\u201d are doing it. \u201cIf we want to go down the road of the politics of self-destruction of everybody, criminalize all politicians on both sides of the aisle and go after their family, yes. We can do that. But both sides are doing that,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody should excuse themselves and say, \u2018We\u2019re holier than thou, Trump is evil.\u2019\u201d On \u201cThe View\u201d Tuesday, Meghan McCain and Abby Huntsman\u00a0did not feign indignation over Hunter Biden like McDaniel and Paul, but they did\u00a0debate\u00a0whether his interview on ABC helped his father\u2019s presidential campaign. McCain is the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Huntsman is the daughter of Jon Huntsman (R), the former governor of Utah. Fox News had Peter Doocy report on Hunter Biden Wednesday morning. Doocy is the son of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy. The young Doocy, not coincidentally, was immediately hired by the network upon his graduation from college. And then, there was the tweet by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. There\u2019s not much more that can be said about the absurdity of this outrage. And for the record (because I know I will get emails and messages about this), I am not \u2015 at least in any way I can tell \u2015 related to the writer Studs Terkel. This story has been updated with Doocy\u2019s segment.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday refused to say why the company of an indicted associate paid him $500,000 last year, while that associate was helping him dig up dirt in Ukraine against Democrats \u2015 other than to deny the two matters were connected. Giuliani, as Reuters first reported, was paid for consulting work he did for Fraud Guarantee, a Florida-based company run by Lev Parnas. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, and Igor Fruman, a native of Belarus, were indicted last week on charges that they fraudulently made straw campaign contributions and funneled foreign money to support Donald Trump and other Republican candidates. Parnas, Fruman and Giuliani also worked together to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed earlier this year. But Giuliani, who says he has been representing Trump for free since April 2018, said Tuesday that the $500,000 in work he did for Fraud Guarantee was unconnected to his work on behalf of the president, and that the money did not come from overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s totally domestic \u2015 100 percent domestic. ... That\u2019s all I can give you right now,\u201d Giuliani told HuffPost Tuesday. \u201cIt had nothing to with campaign finance. It has nothing to do with Ukraine.\u201d Giuliani said his Fraud Guarantee work involved consulting on two technologies he is familiar with, and called it \u201cunrelated 100 percent to anything\u201d he had been doing for Trump. He said he got the referral through a lawyer he knows. \u201cWe did an intense amount of work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re proprietary technologies, and I can\u2019t comment.\u201d Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport in Virginia last week as they waited to board a flight leaving the country. Hours earlier, they had lunched with Giuliani at Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, just five blocks from the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported that federal investigators in the Southern District of New York \u2015 the office Giuliani used to head in the 1980s \u2015 have examined Giuliani\u2019s bank records. Giuliani said he is aware of the report, but has no knowledge of an investigation. \u201cI have no idea if I am or I am not. I haven\u2019t gotten any calls,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are conducting any investigation and they are leaking it right at the beginning, I have to question the motives of their investigation.\u201d Giuliani has accused Biden\u2019s son Hunter of using that family relationship to make money from foreign sources that hoped to affect U.S. policy and advance their own business interests. Giuliani, though, denied there was any similarity between Hunter Biden\u2019s situation and his, even though Parnas appears to have been interested in Giuliani largely as a way to get close to Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison,\u201d Giuliani said, pointing to his years as New York City mayor and a prosecutor before that. \u201cI have a 55-year-long career of being one of the best lawyers in America. ... I am not someone without talent.\u201d The federal grand jury indictment alleges that Parnas and Fruman began making political donations \u201cwith the purpose of enhancing their influence in political circles and gaining access to politicians.\u201d In addition to cozying up to the president\u2019s personal attorney, Parnas met with former U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) just before Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking him to remove Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from her post this spring, and told House investigators \u2015 referring to Giuliani \u2015 that she was removed based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d Giuliani, 75, has become the focus of the impeachment inquiry into Trump by House Democrats, following the disclosure of his key role in pushing Ukraine to pursue two investigations \u2015 one of the former vice president, and the other into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while simultaneously making it appear that Russia had worked to help Trump. Biden is the 2020 Democratic candidate whom Trump most fears, and since his 2016 electoral victory, Trump has disputed the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia actively hurt Clinton\u2019s campaign and boosted Trump\u2019s. Fiona Hill, a former top Russia expert at the National Security Council in the White House, told House investigators this week that Giuliani \u201cran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented U.S. officials and career diplomats in order to personally benefit President Trump,\u201d The Washington Post reported. Giuliani\u2019s central role in U.S. policy toward Ukraine reportedly led former national security adviser John Bolton to declare that he had no part in the \u201cdrug deal being cooked up\u201d by Giuliani and others, according to a deposition Hill provided to the House on Monday. Bolton called Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d who would \u201cblow everybody up,\u201d according to The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he meant,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI am disappointed in John. I\u2019m not sure he realizes I received all this evidence as part of my representation of the president. It was all part of the evidence, and suppression of evidence, involving Ukrainian collusion and the origin of some of the false information against the president.\u201d During a recent appearance on ABC News, former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert also dismissed the Ukraine 2016 election conspiracy that has become increasingly popular on right-wing websites and AM talk radio. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy, it is completely debunked,\u201d Bossert said, adding that if Trump \u201ccontinues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d On Tuesday, though, Giuliani continued pushing the theory, which involves the emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, the California cybersecurity company that investigated the theft and even George Soros, the Hungarian billionaire whose support of progressive causes has made him a boogeyman for far-right conspiracists. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Giuliani said of Bossert. \u201cI don\u2019t think Bossert knows about the extent of Ukrainian involvement in getting dirty information to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\u201d Giuliani on Tuesday also sent a letter to the House committees pursuing the impeachment inquiry, refusing to comply with their subpoena for documents. \u201cThis appears to be an unconstitutional, baseless and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry,\u2019\u201d said the letter, written by Jon Sale, Giuliani\u2019s lawyer. \u201cIn addition, the subpoena is overbroad, unduly burdensome and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate gives the three Democratic front-runners a chance to answer recent doubts about their campaigns, while nine other candidates \u2014 the largest political lineup on a single stage \u2014 get a new shot at the political spotlight in hopes of rising or at least remaining relevant. Former Vice President Joe Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months but will have to answer persistent though baseless allegations by Republican President Donald Trump of overseas wrongdoing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has climbed to co-front runner but faces new questions about her biography. And Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is out to prove he has the stamina for hours on stage, less than two weeks after a heart attack forced him to temporarily suspend campaigning. The other candidates will be struggling just to get noticed \u2014 trying to make up ground in a race that kicks officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. The debate marks the first time the candidates meet since the House moved forward with the Trump impeachment inquiry. While they are united on that issue, the debate again exposes a political party that\u2019s yet to coalesce around a unifying message or messenger. The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years. The White House hopefuls represent the political and personal diversity that has come to define the Democratic Party of 2019, including four women, four people of color, an openly gay man and an age range that spans four decades. Age was already a concern for the 78-year-old Sanders, the oldest presidential hopeful, even before he was taken to a Nevada hospital earlier this month and had two stents put in to clear a clogged artery. Sanders and his allies insist the health scare has only strengthened his commitment to the 2020 contest \u2014 and his case for his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan. \u201cBernie is a political marathon runner,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 confidante RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of National Nurses United. \u201cI think the debate is going to be a great reassurance to the public.\u201d In an email to supporters, Sanders wrote, \u201cTonight\u2019s debate is important, no doubt about it, and I am ready.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign said she went for a walk as part of her usual debate day routine \u2014 but the senator was likely to face far more scrutiny than in previous intraparty face-offs. Biden, 76, and others have jabbed at Warren\u2019s intense focus on detailed liberal policies that may be difficult to implement with a divided Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has highlighted the absence of a specific Warren health care plan. She has embraced Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan instead. Republicans, meanwhile, have raised questions about whether Warren, 70, was actually forced from her teaching job because of a pregnancy nearly a half century ago, a claim that has become a core part of her personal message. Critics have pointed to past speeches and documents that suggest she left on her own. Warren is standing by her story. The issue is particularly threatening because it\u2019s not the first time she has been accused of embellishing her biography. Warren has already apologized for claiming Native American heritage decades ago. While it showed distant tribal ancestry, it also sparked a rebuke from some Native Americans. \u201cThe good news is that most attempts to attack Warren actually make her stronger,\u201d said Adam Green, a Warren supporter and co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Biden enters the fourth round of Democratic debates under the weight of intensifying questions from Trump about his family\u2019s work overseas. Without providing evidence, Trump has repeatedly said that Biden\u2019s 49-year-old son, Hunter, improperly profited from work in Ukraine and China while the elder Biden was vice president. The president also insists that Biden used his office to protect his son from allegations of wrongdoing. Hunter Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday morning he did nothing wrong while engaging in foreign work as a Washington lawyer specializing in corporate governance. But he also noted he failed to take into account the potential implications for his father\u2019s political career. Joe Biden has promised to bar family members from occupying any office within the White House if elected \u2014 a departure from Trump. Many other candidates, meanwhile, are fighting for political survival. Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris are trying to crack the top tier. Also debating are New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Making his debate debut \u2014 and likely angling for a splash \u2014 is billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party\u2019s rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate. Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September\u2019s debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday\u2019s a record. Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights. Buttigieg further sharpened his critique of Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All on Tuesday by releasing an online ad naming Warren and Sanders. Buttigieg has described Warren as \u201cevasive\u201d in how she would finance her health care vision and suggests in the new ad that Medicare for All would force millions of Americans, including workers covered by union contracts, off private insurance. \u201cI\u2019m not pushing Medicare for All whether you want it or not,\u201d says the 37-year-old mayor \u2014 the kind of critique Warren may face more of on the debate stage. ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Democrats say they aren\u2019t troubled by Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings overseas despite allegations that he cashed in on his father\u2019s name while Joe Biden was vice president. \u201cIt\u2019s the height of hypocrisy for any Republican right now \u2015 given what the Trump family is doing \u2015 to raise concerns about this,\u201d Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said Tuesday. Republicans have been hammering the younger Biden over his business dealings in Ukraine and China, where he served on several corporate boards, earning tens of thousands of dollars a month. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to compel Ukraine to help investigate the Bidens were uncovered by a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president. Hunter Biden insisted he never did anything illegal or improper, even though he acknowledged in an interview with ABC that it was \u201cpoor judgment\u201d on his part to join the businesses and that it was likely that his last name helped him professionally. He also announced that he will resign from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month amid the controversy that appears designed to target his father\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. That didn\u2019t stop people like Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and the niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), from calling out Hunter Biden for nepotism on Tuesday. But she wasn\u2019t the only GOP official with famous relations who\u00a0took umbrage about nepotism in Washington. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), and Donald Trump Jr. also weighed in. But Senate Democrats, including Biden\u2019s top allies in the upper chamber, said they were unbothered by the GOP\u2019s concerns regarding Hunter Biden. \u201cIf you look at boards of directors all over the world, you\u2019ll find all kinds of people connected to them,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has backed Biden\u2019s candidacy for president. \u201cI served on them, my husband has served on them.\u201d The California Democrat added: \u201cDid the last name Biden help? Sure, it helps everywhere, I think.\u201d Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said Hunter Biden did \u201cpretty well\u201d in responding to the questions surrounding his work overseas in his interview with ABC. \u201cIn hindsight, it was probably poor judgment but certainly nothing illegal,\u201d Jones said. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), meanwhile, called it a \u201cnon-story.\u201d \u201cMuch of what the Trump administration has said about Hunter Biden, according to the fact-checkers, is just completely false,\u201d he added.",

      "author": "Jessica Schulberg",
      "content": " During Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate, candidate Joe Biden was asked if it was a mistake for his son Hunter Biden to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while Biden was the vice president and working on Ukrainian corruption issues. Biden dodged the question: He insisted he and his son did \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment, that people should really be focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption, and something about George Washington. Trump\u2019s request in a July 25 phone call that the president of Ukraine investigate the Bidens is what prompted Democrats to officially open an impeachment inquiry. As the debate moderator noted in his question, there is no evidence that the Bidens had a corrupt arrangement in Ukraine. But both Joe and Hunter Biden seem aware of the poor optics. The former vice president has said he would ban his family and anyone associated with him from being \u201cinvolved in any foreign operation whatsoever\u201d if he were elected president. And Hunter acknowledged Tuesday, hours before the debate, that he used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in taking the job. So it was reasonable enough when CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Biden, \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?\u201d But Biden ignored the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d he started, even though Cooper had already said there was no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said multiple times before veering off on a tangent about Trump and the Founding Fathers: What I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th \u2015 look, the fact that George Washington worried, on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum. Cooper tried again. \u201cYour son Hunter today gave an interview and admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time,\u201d Cooper said. Biden again insisted he did nothing wrong \u2014 and said that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment. \u201cLook, my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made. I\u2019m proud of what he had to say. And let\u2019s focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d",

      "content": " More than two-thirds of the way into the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden took a casual swipe at his rivals without specifying whom he was speaking about exactly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d When a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d What happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms. Sanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Sanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage. Then it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. \u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d Warren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d Biden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.

      "content": " The fourth\u00a0Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night confirmed what has been evident in the polls for some time: Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) has overtaken former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden as the front-runner in the race for the party\u2019s nomination. The other candidates on stage in Westerville, Ohio, treated the senator from Massachusetts as the new favorite, hammering her repeatedly over her evasiveness when confronted with questions about her health care and wealth inequality plans. Biden, in contrast to the previous debates, often seemed like more of an after-thought. The former vice president still got in his hits against President Donald Trump, but his rivals mostly ignored him. Here are some key takeaways from the debate. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang all took shots at Warren. Buttigieg and Klobuchar got that bandwagon going early when they criticized Warren for\u00a0not giving a straight answer to a question about whether middle-class taxes would go up under \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government-sponsored health care proposal she has backed. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d Klobuchar quickly piled on:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but ... the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d Warren responded by repeating her usual answer when challenged on this point, focusing on the bottom-line effect the plan would have on middle-class families and pledging she wouldn\u2019t support a proposal that raised overall costs for them. Republicans have also attacked Warren over not being willing to address the question, which she has dismissed as \u201cRepublican framing.\u201d Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke also went after Warren over her proposal to levy a 2% wealth tax on the super-rich. \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth; nobody on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said. In a nod to Tom Steyer, the wealthy hedge fund manager who just recently entered the presidential race and was participating in his first debate, Klobuchar wryly added, \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect the billionaires.\u201d O\u2019Rourke joined in by accusing Warren of being \u201cmore focused on being punitive or pitting one part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up.\u201d Yang called out Warren for not addressing the threat automation poses to U.S. workers. That prompted several other candidates to address his signature universal basic income proposal \u2015 perhaps the biggest coup for his campaign so far. Biden didn\u2019t directly answer if it was wrong that during his tenure as vice president, his son Hunter served as a board member for the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings \u2015 which spurred Trump\u2019s controversial phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president, which in turn could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything to do with Ukraine. ... We always kept everything separate,\u201d Biden said about his son\u2019s work overseas. \u201cThere would be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made ... the fact of the matter is this is about Trump\u2019s corruption.\u201d Hunter Biden acknowledged in an interview with ABC airing Tuesday that it was \u201cpoor judgment\u201d on his part to join the venture, and conceded it was likely that his last name helped him professionally. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker actually gave a more succinct answer in defense of Biden, noting the hypocrisy of Trump and Republicans seeking to attempt to make hay of the matter, given the financial conflicts of interest that cloud the Trump administration. \u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies, and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman,\u201d Booker said, referring to Joe Biden. Buttigieg and Klobuchar may have delivered their best debate performances yet. Buttigieg, in particular, seemed to put more sustained effort into positioning himself as an alternative for centrists to Biden. He played up his small-town roots by recalling driving past closed factories while growing up in the post-industrial Midwest. The 37-year-old also repeatedly expressed his aversion to Washington elites, calling out \u201csenators\u201d and \u201ccongressmen\u201d who have not gotten many things done during his \u201centire adult life.\u201d During a conversation on foreign policy and Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw troops in Syria, Buttigieg drew applause after he called for the U.S. to stand by its allies. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. Buttigieg made another nod to more moderate voters when he called out O\u2019Rourke for not giving more details on how the Texan\u2019s proposed mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns would work. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage \u2015 political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg, a military veteran, told O\u2019Rourke in one sharp exchange. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t look or sound like a guy who had a heart attack two weeks ago. He was as animated as ever,\u00a0landing sharp blows against Trump and other Democrats on stage. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d the 78-year-old said when asked about his health and age. After Booker jokingly interjected that Sanders supports medical marijuana, Sanders quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d The line elicited laughter and applause from the audience. But Sanders\u2019 best moment may have been a fast-ball at Biden after the former vice president asserted that he knew how to \u201cget stuff done,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t simply offer plans about how to do so. \u201cYou know what else you got done? You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill that\u2019s hurting middle-class Americans all over the country,\u201d Sanders retorted, referring to positions Biden took as a senator from Delaware. Steyer, whose focus is on combating climate change, started strong in the debate\u2019s opening act, saying that \u201cevery candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.\u201d That may have been his only good line of the night, however, as the debate hummed along and he barely made his presence felt. California Sen. Kamala Harris also needed a breakout moment \u2015 similar to the one she enjoyed in the first debate in June \u2015 to reverse her struggling poll numbers. She won applause and good marks from women\u2019s rights groups when she noted that none of the previous encounters had featured any direct questions about reproductive rights, calling the omission \u201coutrageous.\u201d Ultimately, this debate did feature such a query. But Harris, meanwhile, had nothing that would qualify as a standout remark or exchange.",

      "content": " Joe Biden lashed out at Donald Trump on Wednesday and demanded the president stop smearing him and his son\u00a0Hunter. The former vice president was at\u00a0a campaign stop in Columbus, Ohio, when he demanded of the president:\u00a0\u201cRelease your tax returns or shut up.\u201d The president, in a call on July 25 while military funds were being withheld, had asked Ukraine officials to investigate\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s past business connections in that country. The alleged quid pro quo request is now part of an\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00a0being conducted by House Democrats. Biden, speaking to reporters, suggested keeping the focus on what Trump claims is massive political corruption. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about corruption,\u201d Biden began. \u201d[Trump] is running the most corrupt government in the history of the United States of America, number one. Number two, he also is in a position where, as he talks about corruption, he is engaged in practices that, in fact, everyone around the world is looking and saying, \u2018How in God\u2019s name can this man be doing that while he\u2019s president?\u2019\u201d Biden then addressed the president directly: \u201cMr. President, you want to talk about corruption. I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns. I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress and as vice president. I made no money while I was in there other than my salary. \u201cMr. President, even Richard Nixon released his tax returns. Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.\u201d Biden then offered a theory on why the president has spent so much time going after him. \u201cThe reason why he is running after me is he knows I will beat him like a drum,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe understands that.\u201d Biden then pointed the finger at Trump team members including personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \u201cAs I said, Rudy Giuliani and the henchmen, and Trump\u2019s lawyers, how many of these folks are in jail?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cThese are the president\u2019s people, for God\u2019s sake! This is a corrupt, thoroughly corrupt outfit.\u201d",

      "content": " Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted on Thursday that President Donald Trump withheld foreign aid in order to get Ukraine\u2019s help in the U.S. election. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney responded when ABC News reporter Jon Karl pointed out that withholding funding from Ukraine \u201cunless the investigation into the Democrats\u2019 server happens\u201d is a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d \u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney added later. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. ... That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d Foreign policy negotiations often demand trading a move by one country with a policy change by the other. President John F. Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union by agreeing to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the USSR pulling its nuclear missiles from Cuba. What makes Trump\u2019s exchange different is that the \u201cfavor\u201d he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a personal, political benefit. The insertion of personal gain is what makes it corrupt. Mulvaney claimed that the Trump administration was withholding aid from Ukraine to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged \u201ccorruption\u201d in the 2016 election \u2015 not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top political rivals heading into 2020.\u00a0(Mulvaney\u2019s claim is incomplete and misleading: Trump brought up both the DNC server and Biden in his call with Ukraine\u2019s president.) When Karl asked why the U.S. stopped the aid, Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn\u2019t doing more to help Ukraine. Then Mulvaney referenced a debunked conspiracy theory that claims the DNC\u2019s physical \u201cserver\u201d is missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia\u2019s hack of the DNC\u2019s servers, is framing Russia for election interference. \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,\u201d Mulvaney told the reporter. \u201cBut that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we hung up the money.\u201d As The Daily Beast reported last year, the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cserver\u201d is actually a system of 140 servers and none of the DNC\u2019s machines are missing. Speaking to reporters, Republican Sen.\u00a0Lisa Murkowski of Alaska denounced efforts to \u201chold up\u201d foreign aid for political reasons. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d Murkowski said in response to questions about Mulvaney\u2019s press conference. Hours after the news conference, Mulvaney walked back his admission that the U.S. withheld Ukranian aid for political gain. In a lengthy statement, he said the opposite of his earlier remarks: \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukranian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d Mulvaney also wrongly blamed the media for \u201cmisconstruing\u201d and putting a spin on the comments he made during the news conference, which was televised and streamed live to the public. Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting. This article has been updated with Mulvaney\u2019s later comments denying he had said there was a quid pro quo over political help.",

Nevertheless, his comments appear to acknowledge that a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d did occur with respect to aid to Ukraine, despite many Republicans and Trump allies insisting otherwise. The House of Representatives\u00a0launched a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0last month following a whistleblower complaint concerning a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine\u2019s president to initiate an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. Trump did so while holding up U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, also broke with Trump on Thursday, telling House impeachment investigators that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the president\u2019s efforts to have his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, interfere in foreign affairs. Sondland also testified that Giuliani sought to link to a White House visit for Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to demands that Ukraine prioritize investigations targeting Trump\u2019s political rivals, including the Bidens. \u201cWithholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d Sondland said in prepared testimony. \u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\u201d",

      "content": " Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00a0told House impeachment investigators on Thursday that he didn\u2019t know President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine had anything to do with 2020 rival Joe Biden.\u00a0Sondland\u2019s explanation is hard to believe. In his\u00a0opening statement, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union said he only recently learned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani may have tried to get Ukrainian officials to probe the former vice president\u2019s dealings in the country. But it would have been almost impossible for someone working at the highest levels of diplomacy, who claimed Ukraine was an important part of his portfolio,\u00a0to ignore the signs \u2015 or the headlines. Even before Trump\u2019s now-infamous\u00a0July 25 phone call\u00a0in which he requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launch an investigation into Biden, there was a deluge of press coverage about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work at gas company Burisma Holdings, and Trump\u2019s interest in it. If that weren\u2019t enough, Giuliani and other Trump associates had spent months openly pushing conspiracy theories involving Biden and Ukraine. In Sondland\u2019s account of events, Trump held a meeting with him, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and then-special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker on May 23 in which it became clear that Giuliani would be the president\u2019s point person on Ukraine. \u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\u201d Sondland stated. But it shouldn\u2019t have been hard for Sondland to guess Trump and Giuliani\u2019s interest in Ukraine: Giuliani\u00a0openly told The New York Times\u00a0on May 9 that he was traveling to Kyiv to push for an investigation into Biden and Burisma. Giuliani was then forced to cancel his trip amid a public backlash and allegations he was seeking to influence the 2020 election. He blamed the cancellation on \u201cenemies of the president\u201d he\u00a0claimed\u00a0were in the current Ukrainian administration. Days before Giuliani canceled his trip, it was also\u00a0front-page news in The New York Times\u00a0that Trump and his associates were focused on the Bidens\u2019 history in Ukraine as they looked at Joe Biden as a potential opponent in 2020. The May 2 report specifically highlighted Giuliani\u2019s role in the effort, pointing out that he had met with both current and former top prosecutors in Ukraine to ask about the Burisma investigation. \u201cMr. Giuliani has spearheaded the effort among conservatives to publicize and encourage the new investigation in Ukraine,\u201d the Times reported. Allegations that Biden had sought to quash an investigation into Burisma had been swirling around conservative media for months after John Solomon, an opinion columnist for The Hill, promoted a series of\u00a0dubious and poorly fact-checked claims\u00a0from a former Ukrainian prosecutor. His piece on Biden was shared over 37,000 times and prompted far-right outlets such as The Gateway Pundit to run with the story in multiple follow-up articles. Solomon, now a contributor for Fox News, was also a frequent guest of Trump favorites on the network such as Sean Hannity. Trump even tweeted out, \u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges,\u201d following one of Hannity\u2019s shows in March \u2014 the title of a column claiming a conspiracy between Democrats and Ukrainian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. The scrutiny of the Bidens in Ukraine and Giuliani\u2019s role in pushing for an investigation intensified in the months after The New York Times story, with\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0The New Yorker, The Washington Times,\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0and others all publishing substantial reports on the subject. Beyond the media coverage, Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters and advisers had made Biden and Ukraine a frequent talking point. Trump 2020 communications director\u00a0Tim Murtaugh, senior adviser\u00a0Katrina Pierson\u00a0and rapid response director\u00a0Andrew Clark\u00a0all tweeted about the accusations against Biden, as did various other conservative figures and far-right activists. Despite the wealth of information on Ukraine, the Bidens, and Guiliani\u2019s rabid pursuit of conspiracy theories related to them, Sondland supposedly missed this entire part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts.\u00a0He even told Congress that although Giuliani directly mentioned Burisma to him in August, the company\u2019s name didn\u2019t stand out as worth noticing. His carefully worded statement also neglected to mention exactly when he finally did come to understand that Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine included pushing for an investigation. If you believe his account, it\u2019s a wonder he ever learned about it at all.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The\u00a0impeachment investigation\u00a0into President Donald Trump has thrust Washington into a political crisis. And Trump keeps adding to the chaos. In the four weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., launched the investigation, Trump has taken steps that have drawn more criticism, not less, repeatedly testing the loyalty of his stalwart Republican allies. His actions have both intensified the questions at the center of the inquiry and opened new areas of concern. Trump angered GOP leaders and U.S. allies by clearing the way for\u00a0Turkish attacks\u00a0on Syrian Kurdish fighters, key American partners in the fight against the Islamic State group. He brazenly announced plans to hold\u00a0next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit\u00a0at one of his own Florida properties, prompting an outcry from ethics experts and members of both parties. And Trump and his advisers have repeatedly\u00a0muddied their defense\u00a0on the Democratic-led impeachment, initially denying some of the central allegations against the president only to acknowledge them, out loud and on camera. \u201cIt is his persona to surround himself with chaos,\u201d said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who advised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Chaos has indeed been a hallmark of Trump\u2019s presidency. Each controversy bleeds into the next \u2014 often so fast that the public doesn\u2019t have time to absorb the details of any one issue. Whether that is a deliberate Trump strategy or simply the consequence of Americans electing a highly unconventional, nonpolitician as commander in chief remains one of the fundamental questions of his presidency. The most pressing question now is how the cascading controversies will impact Trump at one of his most vulnerable moments since taking office. Already saddled by low approval ratings, he could face reelection with the dubious distinction of being just the third American president ever impeached. Though conviction and removal from office by the Republican-controlled Senate seems virtually impossible, Trump\u2019s handling of the coming weeks could linger with some of the voters he needs to hold in order to win in 2020. His response thus far has been pulled from the\u00a0standard Trump playbook\u00a0: hurling deeply personal, sometimes vulgar, insults at his opponents,\u00a0questioning the legitimacy\u00a0of the investigations into his actions and distracting with other jarring decisions. For example, there was his\u00a0public call for China to investigate baseless corruption claims\u00a0against Democrat Joe Biden just days after Democrats launched impeachment proceedings to probe Trump\u2019s similar request of Ukraine. There are some signs that Trump\u2019s words and actions are being received differently, both in Washington and across the country, from other points in his presidency. Polls\u00a0now show more Americans in favor of opening the impeachment inquiry than those who are opposed, a shift since earlier this year. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 54% of Americans approved of the House decision to conduct an inquiry, while 44% disapproved. In a Pew poll conducted a few weeks earlier, the public was evenly divided on the question. A few prominent Republicans have moved in favor of the investigation, which centers in part on whether Trump used his office for personal political gain by asking Ukraine to investigate the unfounded accusations against former Vice President Biden. John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, is among the Republicans who now back an impeachment inquiry, though he told The Associated Press in an interview that he isn\u2019t ready to call for Trump\u2019s removal from office. \u201cThis is an extremely serious matter,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI wrestled with it for a very long time.\u201d Kasich was persuaded by the White House\u2019s shifting story on why Trump withheld $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, one of the issues under investigation by the House. After insisting there was no quid pro quo at play \u2014 and allowing Republicans to use that as a rationale for opposing the impeachment inquiry \u2014 acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that one of the reasons the aid was held up was that Trump wanted Ukrainian officials to investigate a debunked conspiracy involving the Democratic National Committee. Mulvaney later tried to back away from that statement. His televised news conference left some Republicans flabbergasted. Many in the party were already reeling from Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, allowing Turkey to move into the country and attack Kurdish forces aligned with Washington. Reliable Trump allies such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., panned the president\u2019s move as dangerous and deeply flawed. And Mulvaney opened his news conference by announcing another controversial decision: Trump plans to host world leaders next year at his golf resort near Miami, putting him in position to personally profit from his office. Some Republicans found the move difficult to defend as well. \u201cI am not surprised at all that the president wanted to hold the G-7 at Doral. Never occurred to me that he would want to do anything different,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI am surprised there\u2019s no one in there who would advise him against doing that.\u201d For now, the Republican frustration with Trump\u2019s actions over the past few weeks isn\u2019t affecting the party\u2019s views on the impeachment investigation, which is opposed by the majority of GOP lawmakers and voters. \u201cRepublicans have already shown that they\u2019re compartmentalizing this,\u201d said Brendan Buck, an adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \u201cThey\u2019re able to be very upset about Syria in the morning and rationalize the other issues in the afternoon.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Alexandra Jaffe in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for The Associated Press since 2007.

The four-page document accused the Trump administration of three stages of wrongdoing related to the president\u2019s controversial July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015 a call that ultimately prompted Pelosi to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The fact sheet dubbed the three stages \u201cthe shakedown,\u201d \u201cthe pressure campaign\u201d and \u201cthe cover-up.\u201d The document cited the White House\u2019s transcript of the phone call as evidence that Trump was \u201cabusing his office by pressing a foreign government\u201d to meddle in the 2020 elections. According to the rough transcript \u2015\u00a0which current and former officials doubt is complete \u2015 Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by digging up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The fact sheet then cited text messages between State Department officials as evidence the White House launched a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d on Ukraine regarding this request. The Trump administration has been accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate the Bidens; Trump has repeatedly insisted, however, that there was \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d One text exchange cited in the fact sheet\u00a0\ufeffinvolved William Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine, who\u2019d expressed concerns about withholding \u201csecurity assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Taylor told Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in September.

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " The United States\u2019 top diplomat in Ukraine reportedly testified to House lawmakers on Tuesday that President Donald Trump held up military aid to Ukraine until its president agreed to investigate Joe Biden \u2015 effectively confirming a quid pro quo demand on the part of the White House. Acting Ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s private testimony for the House impeachment inquiry said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to make the military aid contingent on investigations of Trump\u2019s political rivals, according to The Washington Post. Democrats who were in the room said Taylor\u2019s testimony described a clear connection between U.S. foreign policy and Trump\u2019s political goals, and called it the most damaging account yet for the president, The New York Times reported. \u201cI recognize that this is a rather lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months told from my vantage point in Kyiv,\u201d Taylor said in his opening statement, obtained by the Post. \u201cBut I also recognize the importance of the matters your Committees are investigating, and I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions.\u201d Taylor was called to testify in the impeachment probe earlier this month, after Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine until his recent resignation, revealed text messages\u00a0between himself, Taylor and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. In a Sept. 1 text, Taylor expressed concern about a possible quid pro quo between the U.S. and Ukraine. Sondland responded by telling Taylor to \u201ccall me.\u201d \u201cDuring that phone call, Amb. Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor said Tuesday in his statement, using an alternative spelling of Zelensky\u2019s name. Biden, who was vice president to Barack Obama,\u00a0is running for president in 2020, and until recently was leading in the Democratic primary. Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma until earlier this year. \u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIn fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\u201d \u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d Taylor continued. The question of a quid pro quo is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, relating to a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky in which the U.S. president pressured the Ukrainian leader to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate the Biden family. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed earlier this month that he was on the call, which came soon after Trump suspended nearly $400 million in already approved military aid to Ukraine. Taylor was informed on July 19 that Volker had met with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to discuss Ukraine. \u201cThis caught me by surprise. The next day I asked Ambassador Volker about that meeting, but received no response,\u201d Taylor said in the statement. \u201cI began to sense that the two decision making channels \u2015 the regular and irregular \u2015 were separate and at odds.\u201d Taylor described himself as part of the \u201cregular\u201d channel from the U.S. to Ukraine, while Volker, Sondland and Giuliani were part of the \u201cirregular\u201d channel. \u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d Taylor said in his opening statement. \u201cIt was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\u201d Democrats on Tuesday said that Taylor\u2019s testimony vastly contrasted with Sondland\u2019s, who appeared last week before the House and recalled \u201cno discussions\u201d with anyone at the State Department or the White House about the Bidens. But Taylor, according to his statement, said Sondland directly heard about Biden from Trump himself. \u201cPresident Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a \u2018quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut President Trump did insist that President Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself.\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) told reporters on Tuesday that Taylor \u201cdrew a direct line\u201d with the hearing, which she said included documents, timelines and records of individual conversations. \u201cI do not know how you would listen to today\u2019s testimony from Ambassador Taylor and come to any other [conclusion] except that the president abused his power and withheld foreign aid,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. Republicans reportedly declined to share details of Taylor\u2019s testimony, but said Democrats are exaggerating about the level of damaging information provided. \u201cI don\u2019t know that any of us, if we are being intellectually honest, are hearing revelations that we were not aware of,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said, according to the Times. \u201cThe bottom line is no one has yet to make the case for why the aid was withheld or even if the Ukrainians knew about it.\u201d The White House responded later Tuesday denying a quid pro quo and calling the impeachment inquiry an unconstitutional \u201ccoordinated smear campaign\u201d from Democratic lawmakers. \u201cToday was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed door, secretive hearings,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \u201cEvery day this nonsense continues more taxpayer time and money is wasted.\u201d Last week, Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged a quid pro quo in Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine, telling reporters to \u201cget over it.\u201d Mulvaney later tried to walk back his statement, but the comments already resulted in some Republicans growing concerned with the Trump administration\u2019s defense against the impeachment inquiry.

      "author": "Ariel Edwards-Levy",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are both largely seen by their party as capable of pulling out a win next year against President Donald Trump, according to a national HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after last week\u2019s primary debate. Sixty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden is capable of winning the general election, with a virtually identical 59% saying the same of Warren. Polls taken after the previous three debates had given Biden an edge of between 6 points and 13 points\u00a0on that metric. Roughly half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters currently think Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is capable of winning, with a third or fewer saying the same of any of the other candidates included in the survey. Overall, 71% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters name two or more candidates as capable of beating Trump, with 53% saying there are three or more viable options. There are a few different ways for pollsters to ask questions about electability \u2015 and when the question is about who has the highest chance of winning, Biden generally continues to dominate. In Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent survey, for instance, 48% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say Biden has the best chance of beating Trump, with just 21% saying the same of Warren. But other polling also suggests that Biden is no longer the only candidate that most Democrats think is capable of pulling out a win. In last week\u2019s Economist/YouGov poll, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters thought Biden would probably beat Trump, with 55% saying Warren would probably win and 54% saying the same of\u00a0 Sanders. Overall, 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say they have a least a good idea of whom they\u2019ll vote for, up from 52% who said the same in September. About a third say they\u2019re still making up their minds. An 83% majority currently say they\u2019re at least satisfied with the 2020 Democratic field, with 45% describing themselves as enthusiastic. As in previous surveys, Warren stands out as a potential consensus candidate, both garnering the broadest enthusiasm and causing the least consternation among members of her party. About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters pick her as someone they\u2019d be enthusiastic to see nominated, with just 9% saying they\u2019d be upset. She\u2019s trailed most closely on this metric by Sanders (37% enthusiastic, 19% upset), Buttigieg (30% enthusiastic, 15% upset) and Biden (37% enthusiastic, 25% upset). Gabbard attracts the most resistance among the candidates included in the survey, with about a third saying they\u2019d be upset to have her as the nominee. Thirty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the primary debate last Tuesday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, with an equal number saying the same of Buttigieg, and a quarter saying they\u2019d left with an improved view of Sanders.

      "content": " President Donald Trump is the subject of an ongoing impeachment inquiry for allegedly abusing his presidential power by seeking the help of a foreign government to further his own political agenda. But Matt Whitaker, Trump\u2019s former acting attorney general, made a case for his ex-boss\u2019 innocence during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday night. \u201cWhat evidence of a crime do you have? ... Abuse of power is not a crime,\u201d Whitaker told host Laura Ingraham. Whitaker added the U.S. Constitution is \u201cvery clear that this has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) disseminated a \u201cfact sheet\u201d on Monday detailing some of the evidence Democrats have seen showing how Trump \u2015 in Pelosi\u2019s words \u2015 \u201cbetrayed his oath of office\u201d and \u201cbetrayed the integrity of our elections for his own personal political gain\u201d in his dealings with the Ukrainian government. The evidence cited in the document included a rough\u00a0transcript of a July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president in which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by digging up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The transcript \u201cpaints a damning picture of Trump abusing his office by pressing a foreign government to interfere in our 2020 elections,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAbuse of power\u201d is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of behaviors and actions, not all of them necessarily illegal. But according to legal scholars, Trump can still be impeached even if his conduct is not ultimately considered criminal. Under the Constitution, a president can be impeached for treason and bribery, or \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2015 a definition that is, on its own, hard to define. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to convey the idea that the person has badly flouted the terms of office. Even if he didn\u2019t commit a criminal offense, did he do something that constitutes an abuse of power?\u201d Corey Brettschneider, a political science professor at Brown University, told AP\u00a0of the phrase. Experts have also pointed out that Trump could be found guilty of a crime including bribery and extortion if it\u2019s determined that he did have a quid pro quo with Ukraine \u2015 something the president has vehemently denied. Speaking to Ingraham about the impeachment probe, Whitaker suggested President Trump was \u201cbeing punished\u201d for upsetting \u201cthe apple cart\u201d of the \u201cworld establishment.\u201d Ingraham agreed with this assessment. \u201cThis is a revenge of the global elites,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " Ukrainian officials knew for months that President Donald Trump was withholding key military aid to their country over demands that Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. The report, based on interviews and documents the Times obtained, directly contradicts Trump\u2019s claim that there could not have been an improper quid pro quo arrangement because Ukrainian officials did not know the United States was withholding $391 million in military aid. Instead, top Ukrainian officials reportedly knew of the aid freeze as early as the first week of August \u2015 just days after Trump requested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden during a July 25 phone call. If Ukraine\u2019s government knew of the delayed aid in August, it would blow a significant hole in the Trump administration\u2019s denial that the president engaged in misconduct. According to a whistleblower and testimony to Congress, Trump and his allies pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine as vice president and his son Hunter\u2019s business connections in the country. The report could also give more fuel to impeachment proceedings after a week that already included the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testifying that Trump had indeed held up aid to force Ukrainian officials to target the Bidens. Trump and Giuliani have been obsessed with Biden\u2019s role in Ukraine for some time \u2015 after it became a conservative\u00a0talking point\ufeff\u00a0that Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. (The prosecutor was, in fact, widely criticized for failing to stop corruption). Trump has also embraced a widely debunked conspiracy theory alleging a missing Democratic National Committee server being hidden in Ukraine. (There is no such server.) Trump brought up both on his July 25 call with Zelensky. Zelensky, a political outsider who won a landslide victory earlier this year, had worried about Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens even before he took office in May, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday. During a three-hour meeting on May 7, Zelensky and several of his advisers discussed how to handle Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. The Ukrainian leader\u2019s fears appeared to be well-founded. Only two days after Zelensky and his advisers\u2019 meeting, Giuliani told The New York Times that he would travel to Kyiv to push for an investigation into Biden and\u00a0Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. Although he canceled that trip over public backlash, Giuliani continued to lead an intense effort to force Ukraine to launch the investigation. Trump wanted Zelesnky to \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,\u201d ambassador Taylor told impeachment investigators on Tuesday. Taylor\u2019s statements contradicted those of the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who testified that he only recently learned that Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine may have related to pushing an investigation into Biden. Sondland\u2019s explanation was already hard to believe, given the plethora of media coverage of Giuliani\u2019s mission and Sondland\u2019s role as one of the administration\u2019s top diplomats. Following Taylor\u2019s testimony, House Democrats sent a letter to the State Department on Wednesday requesting diplomatic cables, emails and other communications related to Trump\u2019s attempts to get Ukraine to initiate investigations into the Bidens.",

      "content": " A lawyer for Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told The Washington Post his client \u201cdid not recall\u201d a conversation where he allegedly communicated to Ukrainian officials that President Donald Trump would need a quid pro quo to release nearly $400 million in military aid to the country. Sondland\u2019s claim contradicts\u00a0a series of bombshell claims made by the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, on Tuesday. During his closed-door testimony, Taylor gave a detailed account of how multiple senior administration officials were involved in the president\u2019s decision to block the security aid to Ukraine, directly linking the decision to Trump\u2019s demand that the country investigates former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. As part of his opening remarks, Taylor stated that Sondland knew directly of the quid pro quo campaign and personally communicated it to one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s aides. During his testimony this month, however, Sondland claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of the White House linking the release of the security funding to the Biden probes. Sondland\u2019s attorney, Robert Luskin, reaffirmed to the Post in an email that his client didn\u2019t recall any such communication. \u201cSondland does not recall any conversation in Warsaw concerning the aid cutoff, although he understood that the Ukrainians were, by then, certainly aware of the cutoff and raised the issue directly with Pence,\u201d the lawyer told the paper. Luskin did not immediately reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. The testimony by Taylor, a highly respected career diplomat, painted a different picture. In his remarks, Taylor said he was \u201calarmed\u201d when he was informed Sondland told one of Zelensky\u2019s advisers that congressionally appropriated \u201csecurity assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue\u201d an investigation of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma for five years, and Trump has publicly accused him of impropriety, without evidence. Neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing, but an investigation could hurt the former vice president politically. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance \u2014 not just the White House meeting \u2014 was conditioned on the investigations,\u201d Taylor told lawmakers. He later said: \u201cAmbassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d The New York Times also reported Wednesday that Ukraine knew Trump had frozen the military aid in an attempt to bully the country into the investigations, directly undercutting White House claims that there was no quid pro quo. The Post notes some lawmakers have already floated having Sondland return to provide more details about his involvement following Taylor\u2019s testimony. As the House impeachment inquiry grows more complex, the chamber\u2019s Democrats are mulling when they should take the matter public. Lawmakers are considering doing so sometime next month, worried that Republicans will continue to try and distract from the revelations gathered during a parade of testimonies from former and current administration officials, the Post reported.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 More than two months before the phone call that launched\u00a0the impeachment inquiry\u00a0into President Donald Trump, Ukraine\u2019s newly elected leader was already worried about pressure from the U.S. president to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Volodymyr Zelensky gathered a small group of advisers on May 7 in Kyiv for a meeting that was supposed to be about his nation\u2019s energy needs. Instead, the group spent most of the three-hour discussion talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for a probe and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, which has roiled U.S.-Ukrainian relations. The meeting came before Zelensky was inaugurated but about two weeks after Trump called to offer his congratulations on the night of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s April 21 election. The full details of what the two leaders discussed in that Easter Sunday phone call have never been publicly disclosed, and it is not clear whether Trump explicitly asked for an investigation of the Bidens. The three people\u2019s recollections differ on whether Zelensky specifically cited that first call with Trump as the source of his unease. But their accounts all show the Ukrainian president-elect was wary of Trump\u2019s push for an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings. Either way, the newly elected leader of a country wedged between Russia and the U.S.-aligned NATO democracies knew early on that vital military support might depend on whether he was willing to choose a side in an American political tussle. A former comedian who won office on promises to clean up corruption, Zelensky\u2019s first major foreign policy test came not from his enemy Russia, but rather from the country\u2019s most important ally, the United States. The May 7 meeting included two of his top aides, Andriy Yermak and Andriy Bogdan, the people said. Also in the room was Andriy Kobolyev, head of the state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, and Amos Hochstein, an American who sits on the Ukrainian company\u2019s supervisory board. Hochstein is a former diplomat who advised Biden on Ukraine matters during the Obama administration. Zelensky\u2019s office in Kyiv did not respond to messages on Wednesday seeking comment. The White House would not comment on whether Trump demanded an investigation in the April 21 call. The White House has offered only a bare-bones public readout on the April call, saying Trump urged Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms, increase prosperity and \u201croot out corruption.\u201d In the intervening months, Trump and his proxies have frequently used the word \u201ccorruption\u201d to reference the monthslong efforts to get the Ukrainians to investigate Democrats. Trump has said he would release a transcript of the first call, but the White House had no comment Wednesday on when, or if, that might happen. After news broke that a White House whistleblower had filed a complaint about his July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump said the conversation was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he had asked his Ukrainian counterpart to do \u201cwhatever he can in terms of corruption because the corruption is massive.\u201d During the call, Trump asked Zelensky for \u201ca favor,\u201d requesting an investigation into a conspiracy theory related to a Democratic computer server hacked during the 2016 election campaign. Trump also pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son. Trump then advised Zelensky that Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr would be contacting him about the request, according to a summary of the called released by the White House. Within days, Giuliani flew to Madrid to meet privately with Yermak, Zelensky\u2019s aide who was in the May 7 meeting. Trump has denied that an investigation of Biden was a condition for releasing military aid as a quid pro quo. But on Tuesday, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine at the time, Ambassador William Taylor, starkly contradicted the president, saying that Trump had demanded that everything Zelensky wanted, including the aid and a White House meeting, was conditional on a public vow that he would open an investigation. Taylor also detailed multiple previously undisclosed diplomatic interactions between Trump\u2019s envoys and senior Ukrainian officials in which the president\u2019s demand to investigate the Bidens in exchange for American aid was clear. The continued flow of high-tech U.S. weaponry is seen as essential to the survival of the Ukrainian government, which has been mired in a long-running civil war with Russian-aligned separatists in the east of the county. In 2014, masked Russian troops took control of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. Russia later annexed it, provoking Western sanctions against Moscow. In a joint Sept. 25 news conference with Trump at the United Nations in New York, Zelensky denied he felt pressured to investigate the Bidens. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved, to democratic, open elections of U.S.A.,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said. \u201cWe had, I think, good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I think, and you read it, that nobody push it. Push me.\u201d Trump then chimed in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d Before Zelensky was elected, however, a public campaign to initiate investigations into the Bidens was already underway. For weeks, conservative media outlets in the U.S. had trumpeted unfounded accusations that Biden, the Obama administration\u2019s top envoy to the war-torn former Soviet republic, had sought the removal of the country\u2019s top prosecutor in order to stymie an investigation in Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that later hired his son to serve on its board. Both Trump and Giuliani made public comments and tweets referencing the Biden accusations, with the president\u2019s lawyer suggesting in a Fox News interview on April 7 that the U.S. Justice Department should investigate the matter. One day before Zelensky\u2019s May 7 meeting with his advisers, the U.S. State Department recalled Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat with a reputation for combating corruption. Yovanovitch had been the target of a sustained\u00a0yearlong smear campaign\u00a0by Giuliani and his associates. When Trump called Zelensky on July 25 to congratulate the Ukrainian president on \u201ca great victory\u201d after his Servant of the People party won control of Ukrainian parliament, Zelensky downplayed his discomfort. \u201cThe first time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election,\u201d Zelensky said, according to the rough transcript. \u201cI think I should run more often so you can call me more often, and we can talk over the phone more often.\u201d ___ Biesecker reported from Washington. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporters Desmond Butler at\u00a0http://twitter.com/desmondbutler\u00a0and Michael Biesecker at\u00a0http://twitter.com/mbieseck ___ Contact AP\u2019s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said Thursday it would welcome help from a super PAC, a total reversal from Biden\u2019s stance at the beginning of the campaign and a decision reflecting his diminished financial position in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Many Democrats view super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors for funding, as a malignant force that represents a big-money era of politics the party is nominally dedicated to ending. Democratic candidates for president in 2020 have largely avoided super PACs, but Biden\u2019s shift could lead more candidates to tacitly back outside groups. (Super PACs are not legally allowed to coordinate directly with campaigns, but an unkind word from a candidate is often all that\u2019s needed to deprive them of funding.) The Biden campaign said President Donald Trump\u2019s false attacks on the former vice president made it necessary for it to welcome the help of a super PAC. Trump, the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups have spent more than $10 million attacking Biden, with much of that money aimed at the four early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \u201cDonald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cHe and his allies are already spending massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u201d \u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Bedingfield said Biden would support a public campaign finance system and a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision. Biden\u2019s decision drew nearly immediate condemnation from his progressive rivals in the 2020 campaign. Adam Green, a top ally of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said Biden was putting his reputation as a longtime ally of the middle class at risk. \u201cBy making big-money corruption the center of how he funds his campaign, Biden severely jeopardizes his legacy as Common Man Joe that he spent decades cultivating,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf Biden cares about defeating Trump, he should not open the door to billionaires and corporations flooding the primary and should make clear he does not want his supporters to use big money to attack other Democrats.\u201d The campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who attacked Hillary Clinton over her support from super PACs during the 2016 presidential election, aimed a similar volley at Biden. \u201cThe former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,\u201d Sanders campaign manger Faiz Shakir said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we defeat Trump. It\u2019s a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision comes as he falls behind the other candidates in the money race, even though he still leads in much of the public polling. His campaign has just $9 million on hand, the fifth-highest total in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Sanders has $33.7 million in the bank, and Warren has $25.7 million. Even South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who are both well behind Biden in public polling, have more campaign funds than he does.\u00a0Biden has struggled to raise money online from small-dollar donors at the same pace as his competitors, and many of his donors have already given the federal maximum of $2,800. End Citizens United, a Democratic campaign finance reform group, criticized Biden for his reversal and said his fundraising struggles were no excuse. In a statement, it noted less than a month had passed since Biden last said he wouldn\u2019t welcome a super PAC. At that time, Trump\u2019s attacks on the former vice president had already begun. \u201cThe path forward for his campaign depends on Democratic primary voters trusting that they\u2019d have more say in a Biden administration than big money donors. It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,\u201d said Tiffany Muller, End Citizens United\u2019s president. \u201cThis is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.\u201d While Biden\u2019s campaign will dismiss much of the criticism aimed at his decision as coming from partisans who dislike his candidacy for ideological reasons or are backing his opponents, he can\u2019t say the same of End Citizens United. The group, which has pressured all of the campaigns to reject single-candidate super PACs, is neutral in the 2020 presidential primary and helped many moderate Democratic candidates win House seats during the 2018 midterms. If a super PAC forms to back Biden \u2015 and it would be shocking if one did not \u2015 he would become the second candidate in the field to welcome an outside group accepting massive donations. Businessman Andrew Yang welcomed the support of a super PAC earlier this week. A super PAC has formed to support New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, but he has said he doesn\u2019t want the group\u2019s help. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee embraced the support of a super PAC before he dropped out of the race in August. It\u2019s not clear if Biden will appear at fundraisers for a super PAC.\u00a0If a group begins raising and spending money during 2019, it will have to reveal its donors in January, before the first Democratic primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden has a long history as a campaign finance advocate, and has been fiercely critical of super PACs in the past. During an appearance on \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d in 2018, Biden said he told Sanders not to create a super PAC during his 2016 run. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.",

      "content": " Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, left an NBC investigative reporter a three-minute voicemail without realizing it earlier this month, NBC reported Friday. He did the same thing 18 days earlier, leaving another three-minute message. In the accidental recordings, known as butt dials, Giuliani could be heard speaking about needing cash and ranting against former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top rivals in the 2020 election, according to NBC. The reporter, Rich Schapiro, had recently spoken to Giuliani for stories he was working on before both calls. Giuliani had served as the Trump administration\u2019s cybersecurity adviser during the presidential transition in 2017. The attorney runs a private cybersecurity consulting firm. Schapiro was asleep when Giuliani\u2019s most recent voice message came through at 11 p.m. Oct. 16. Giuliani\u2019s call went to Schapiro\u2019s voicemail. In the message recording, according to NBC, \u201cthe words tumbling out of Giuliani\u2019s mouth were not directed at the reporter.\u201d In Schapiro\u2019s reporting of the message, Giuliani could be heard talking to someone about needing more money (\u201ca few hundred thousand\u201d), the Kingdom of Bahrain and a man named Charles who would \u201chave a hard time with a fraud case \u2019cause he didn\u2019t do any due diligence.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get back to business ... I gotta get you to get on Bahrain,\u201d Giuliani also said. In his report, Schapiro said it wasn\u2019t clear what the exact context of Giuliani\u2019s conversation was but noted that the attorney had visited Bahrain\u2019s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa last December. The second voice message was mostly about Biden and his family, according to NBC. Schapiro said it was delivered while he attended a family birthday party. According to the reporter, Giuliani complained about being targeted by journalists for publicly accusing Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukranian gas company, of carrying out corrupt deals in Ukraine \u2015 an unfounded accusation. \u201cI expected it would happen,\u201d Giuliani said during the recording. \u201cThe minute you touch on one of the protected people, they go crazy. They come after you.\u201d Giuliani is being investigated as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s apparent efforts to coerce Ukraine to investigate Biden, thus illegally seeking foreign influence in a U.S. election. Amid the investigation, Giuliani has appeared on numerous television news shows, arguing with news hosts and angrily ranting about Biden conspiracy theories which revolve around a claim that Biden stopped Ukraine from investigating the gas company when his son was a board member. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in September, for example, Giuliani admitted that he did ask Ukraine to investigate the former vice president as the attorney and CNN host yelled at each other. Trump appeared to joke about Giuliani\u2019s accidental voice messages, suggesting to Apple CEO Tim Cook that the iPhone\u2019s old models, which featured a circular button, were to blame.",

The former vice president has been at the center of the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged demand for a quid pro quo from the leader of Ukraine. Critics have accused the president of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from the country unless it opened an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing, although they have been subject to false political ads claiming as much. Biden said Sunday once more that he hadn\u2019t discussed Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. But he said that should he be elected in 2020, none of his children would have an office in the White House or \u201csit in on Cabinet meetings.\u201d The comments directly targeted Trump\u2019s children, including Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who hold senior roles in the administration. \u201cTheir actions speak for themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat you should make it clear to the American public is the idea that everything you\u2019re doing is for them.\u201d The Trump campaign defended Ivanka Trump and Kushner last week after Biden\u2019s remarks were first made public, saying the pair were \u201cinstrumental\u201d in major administration decisions. Despite the unfolding scandal over Ukraine, Biden said he was still on top of the 2020 Democratic field, saying the country needed \u201csomebody who on day one knows exactly what to do, can command the world stage.\u201d \u201cNo one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues in foreign policy and domestic policy.

This is a marathon.\u201d Biden also levied harsh criticism at Trump, calling the president an \u201cidiot\u201d for refusing to admit that the Russian government was attempting to, once again, influence American elections. \u201cEverybody knows this, nobody doubts it,\u201d Biden said. O\u2019Donnell noted that Biden\u2019s campaign had just under $9 million cash on hand while some of his rivals were sitting on much bigger war chests, including Sen. Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million). But the former veep said he wasn\u2019t troubled by those figures, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re on course to do extremely well. I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign.\u201d Biden also noted that he has asked former President Barack Obama not to endorse him in the 2020 presidential race, saying he wanted to win the Democratic nomination on his own merits. \u201cI want to earn this on my own,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI asked him not to, he said okay. I think it\u2019s better, I think he thinks it\u2019s better for me.\u201d He continued: \u201cI have no doubt that when I\u2019m the nominee he\u2019ll be out on the campaign trail for me.\u201d",

      "content": " The top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council was so concerned about President Donald Trump\u2019s demands that the country investigate former Vice President Joe Biden that he repeatedly reported his objections to a superior, he will tell lawmakers on Tuesday, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by HuffPost. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a veteran of the Iraq War, plans to share his concerns when he speaks to lawmakers as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Vindman is notably the first administration official to testify who listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which sparked a whistleblower complaint that set off the impeachment inquiry. The New York Times was the first to report the details of the prepared remarks. \u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman,\u00a0a Ukrainian American who is highly decorated, will say in his opening statement. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d The officer said he was troubled by Trump\u2019s insistence that Ukraine open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, saying it would \u201clikely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, for five years, until earlier this year, but neither Biden has been accused of any official wrongdoing. Vindman\u2019s prepared remarks contradict the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who spoke to House lawmakers earlier this month. The Army officer said during a meeting Sondland \u201cemphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.\u201d Vindman said he confronted Sondland at the time, saying such remarks were \u201cinappropriate.\u201d But Sondland told lawmakers he could recall \u201cno discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d The difference in testimony prompted some concern among lawmakers, and House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said Monday evening he believed the ambassador committed \u201cperjury.\u201d Vindman will also tell lawmakers that he is not the whistleblower who filed the complaint and that he does not know who the person is. \u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command,\u201d Vindman will say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cAs an active duty military officer, the command structure is extremely important to me.\u201d Vindman reported to Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former senior director for European and Russian affairs, when he first joined the National Security Council. Hill testified before lawmakers earlier this month as well, telling investigators that her own boss, former national security adviser John Bolton, was also deeply alarmed by Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The lieutenant colonel said he never had direct contact with Trump. Vindman\u2019s testimony comes as House Democrats continue their whirlwind effort to investigate the president\u2019s behavior and bat off Republican criticism of the effort. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Monday that the chamber will vote on a resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, saying that, though the vote wasn\u2019t necessary, it would \u201celiminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d The president and his Republican allies have been complaining for weeks about the transparency of the inquiry, which has largely been conducted during closed-door interviews. Dozens of GOP lawmakers sit on the panels that have heard from current and former administration officials, but they\u2019ve lambasted the effort regardless, even storming a secure room to voice their discontent. Pelosi had largely resisted calls for the vote, and it\u2019s unclear what has changed. A district court also ruled last week that the House didn\u2019t need to formally vote to enter an impeachment inquiry, although that ruling is being appealed by the Justice Department. Trump has continued to rage against the inquiry, calling it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and likening it to a \u201clynching\u201d in a Twitter outburst. The White House has also tried to stymie officials from testifying. Vindman is expected to tell lawmakers Tuesday that he felt it was his duty to report his concerns. \u201cOn many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities,\u201d he will say, according to the draft remarks. \u201cI believe that any good military officer should and would do the same.\u201d His prepared opening statement can be read here:  This article has been updated with remarks from Rep. Joaquin Castro.",

Father Robert Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Florence told the local Morning News that during the 9 a.m. Mass, he refused to serve the Democratic presidential candidate because \u201cany public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d he added. Morey did not immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment and Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment. The presidential candidate declined to directly address the matter in an MSNBC interview. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just my personal life, and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d Biden, a practicing Catholic, emphasized that he does not seek to impose his \u201creligious beliefs which I accept based on church doctrine\u201d on others. He has said that he personally opposes abortion, but he has evolved politically on the issue. In 1982, Biden voted for an amendment that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. He has since reversed course, vowing to codify the ruling if elected and stating that \u201cwe must fight any and all attempts to overturn it.\u201d Similarly, Biden once backed the Hyde Amendment that prohibits federal funds from being spent on abortions but\u00a0announced his support for scrapping it earlier this year. \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without the health care they need,\u201d he said at a June gala hosted by the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support [the amendment].\u201d This has been updated to reflect that Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment.",

Alexander Vindman, the first person to testify as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry who personally listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, told House lawmakers that the White House reconstruction of the discussion had key omissions, The New York Times reported. Vindman, a decorated Army officer and the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, appeared in front of lawmakers for more than 10 hours on Tuesday, the latest official to defy White House orders to share their direct knowledge of the call that set off the impeachment inquiry. According to his prepared remarks, which were obtained by HuffPost, he said he twice reported his concerns about the call and about President Donald Trump\u2019s demands for a quid pro quo involving military aid and political dirt to one of his superiors, worrying that the exchange could affect national security. Trump reportedly sought a probe of political rival Joe Biden and his son, along with investigations based on conspiracy theories about 2016 campaign manipulation. But Vindman, who testified before members of three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, also shed new light on the White House reconstruction of the call, which was released last month. Vindman reportedly told the lawmakers that the document omitted crucial words and phrases that he attempted to see put back in the readout: Some of the changes were ultimately made, but others were not. He did not speculate on the reasoning behind the omissions. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed the Times\u2019 reporting. Vindman\u2019s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment. The Times noted that the missing words do not change the basic contents of the document and there are several other examples of Trump pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for politically motivated investigations. But the Times reported that they provide more context about a number of questionable ellipses in the readout and raise further questions about how the White House handled the transcript of the call, which was stored on a secure server usually reserved for highly classified material. Vindman, a decorated Iraq War veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart, also told lawmakers on Tuesday he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cproper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,\u201d saying he was troubled that any investigation would \u201clikely be interpreted as a partisan play.\u201d He said he reported his concerns several times to a superior on the National Security Council and defended his actions, saying \u201cany good military officer should and would do the same.\u201d His lengthy testimony on Tuesday drew praise from Democratic leaders. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he hoped Vindman\u2019s \u201cexample of patriotism will be emulated by others.\u201d \u201cI want to say also how deeply appalled I was at the pernicious attacks on him last night on Fox,\u201d Schiff said, according to The Washington Post. \u201cThe suggestion that because he\u2019s of Ukrainian origin he has some kind of dual loyalty \u2014 this Purple Heart recipient deserved better than that scandalous attack.\u201d But Trump allies spent most of the day attempting to smear Vindman and his potentially damning testimony, which echoed that of other senior administration officials who voiced their concerns about the president\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The Army officer\u2019s history in the military, however, was hard for some Republicans to ignore. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to \u201cquestion the patriotism of any of the people coming forward,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called Vindman a \u201cdecorated American soldier,\u201d and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said that attacks were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and called the man \u201chonorable.\u201d Democratic leaders said this week that they will vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry on Thursday amid blistering criticism from Republicans who have accused the party of holding the hearings in secret. GOP lawmakers have been involved in every hearing thus far.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A State Department Foreign Service officer is telling House impeachment investigators that former national security adviser John Bolton cautioned him that Rudy Giuliani \u201cwas a key voice with the president on Ukraine\u201d and could complicate U.S. goals in the Eastern European country. The testimony on Wednesday from Christopher Anderson makes clear that administration officials were concerned about Giuliani\u2019s back-channel involvement in Ukraine policy and his push for investigations of Democrats, even before the July phone call between President Donald Trump and his Ukraine counterpart that\u2019s now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry. Anderson describes a June meeting in which he said Bolton expressed support for the administration\u2019s goals of strengthening energy cooperation between the U.S. and Ukraine and getting new Ukraine leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to undertake anti-corruption reforms. \u201cHowever, he cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement,\u201d Anderson will say, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press. Giuliani is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Anderson, scheduled to appear in private late Wednesday, is a career Foreign Service officer who was special adviser for Ukraine negotiations until this past June. Anderson also says that senior White House officials blocked an effort by the State Department to release a November 2018 statement condemning Russia\u2019s attack on Ukrainian military vessels. Another Foreign Service officer testifying Wednesday, Catherine Croft, says that during her time at the National Security Council, she received multiple phone calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston telling her that the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, should be fired. \u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros. It was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d she will say. Both witnesses were instructed by the administration to not testify but appeared in response to subpoenas from the House, according to a statement from their attorney Mark MacDougall. The lawyer cautioned lawmakers that neither of his clients is the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry and that he would object to any questions aimed at identifying that person. Their testimony follows that of Alexander Vindman, an Army officer with the National Security Council who testified that he twice raised concerns over the administration\u2019s push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden. Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, was the first official to testify who actually heard Trump\u2019s\u00a0July 25 call\u00a0with Zelenskiy. He reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel. Vindman also told investigators Tuesday that he tried to change\u00a0the White House\u2019s rough transcript of the call\u00a0by filling in at least one of the omitted words, \u201cBurisma,\u201d a reference to the company linked to Biden and his son, according to people familiar with his testimony. But Vindman was unsuccessful. His concerns, though, were far bigger than the transcript. And lawmakers said his failed effort to edit it didn\u2019t significantly change their understanding of what transpired during Trump\u2019s call that sparked the impeachment inquiry. Vindman\u2019s arrival\u00a0in military blue, with medals,\u00a0created a striking image at the Capitol as\u00a0the impeachment inquiry\u00a0reached deeper into the White House. He testified for more than 10 hours. \u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said, according to\u00a0prepared remarks\u00a0. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d Vindman, a 20-year military officer, added to the mounting evidence from other witnesses \u2014 diplomats, defense and former administration officials \u2014 who are corroborating the initial whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump and providing new details\u00a0ahead of a House vote in the impeachment\u00a0inquiry. The inquiry is looking into Trump\u2019s call, in which he asked Zelenskiy for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense. Vindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his \u201csacred duty\u201d to defend the United States. Some Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel\u2019s loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to criticize his patriotism, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who called the slams on Vindman \u201cabsurd, disgusting and way off the mark.\u201d The testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on\u00a0a resolution\u00a0to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment. Thursday\u2019s vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.\u201d The session with Vindman Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is. Vindman testified that in spring of this year he became aware of \u201coutside influencers\u201d promoting a \u201cfalse narrative of Ukraine\u201d that undermined U.S. efforts, a reference in particular to Giuliani. He first reported his concerns after a July 10 meeting in which U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Vindman says he told Sondland that \u201chis statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\u201d That differs from the account of Sondland, a wealthy businessman who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration and\u00a0testified before the impeachment investigators\u00a0that no one from the NSC \u201cever expressed any concerns.\u201d Sondland also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A former top White House official who raised concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rivals confirmed some aspects of earlier reports but contradicted others during testimony Thursday before House\u00a0impeachment investigators\u00a0. Tim Morrison, who stepped down from the National Security Council the day before his appearance, is the first White House political appointee to testify and could be central to the effort to remove Trump from office. Morrison largely confirmed much of what a top diplomat, William Taylor, said in earlier testimony, as the two had multiple phone conversations raising concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s approach toward Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the closed-door testimony. The person, who was not authorized to discuss the proceedings, spoke on condition of anonymity. Morrison also said he warned Taylor of Trump\u2019s plan to withhold security aid and a White House visit from Ukraine unless the country investigated the Bidens and a 2016 election conspiracy theory, according to a source who spoke to the Washington Post. Republican lawmakers portrayed Morrison\u2019s opening remarks as shifting the debate favorably toward Trump. They said Morrison, in his opening statement, contradicted another key witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Army officer who handled Ukraine issues at the National Security Council. Vindman testified Tuesday that he twice sounded the alarm over the Trump administration actions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very compelling witness today that is giving testimony that contradicts some of the testimony we heard from Mr. Vindman,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. Morrison\u2019s opening remarks were not publicly released. \u201cMr. Morrison\u2019s testimony is very damaging to the Democrat narrative,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all of a sudden gotten quiet today because this particular witness is very credible and has given evidence that suggests some of the other witnesses have been less than candid.\u201d Another Republican, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, said, \u201cWhen you all see what he had to say, it will be interesting.\u201d Morrison, a defense hawk well known in GOP policy circles, was the National Security Council\u2019s top adviser for Russian and European affairs until he stepped down Wednesday. A senior administration official said he had \u201cdecided to pursue other opportunities.\u201d The official, who was not authorized to discuss Morrison\u2019s job and spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said Morrison has been considering leaving the administration for \u201csome time.\u201d Morrison was expected to be asked to explain the \u201csinking feeling\u201d that he reportedly got when Trump demanded that Ukraine\u2019s president investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and interfere in the 2016 election. The national security hawk, brought on board by\u00a0then-national security adviser John Bolton\u00a0, has been featured prominently in previous\u00a0testimony from diplomat Taylor\u00a0. It was Morrison who first alerted Taylor to concerns over Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In fact, Morrison\u2019s name appeared more than a dozen times in testimony by Taylor, who told impeachment investigators that Trump was\u00a0withholding military aid\u00a0unless Zelenskiy went public with a promise to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Taylor\u2019s testimony contradicted Trump\u2019s repeated denials that there was any quid pro quo. Morrison and Taylor spoke at least five times in the weeks following the July phone call as the defense expert and the diplomat discussed the Trump administration\u2019s actions toward Ukraine, according to Taylor\u2019s testimony. As the security funds for Ukraine were being withheld, Morrison told the diplomat, \u201cPresident doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d Their concerns deepened when Morrison relayed on Sept. 7 the conversation he had with Ambassador Gordon Sondland a day earlier that gave him that \u201csinking feeling.\u201d In it, Sondland explained that Trump said he was not asking for a quid pro quo but insisted that Zelenskiy \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,\u201d Taylor testified last week. Morrison told Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this call between Trump and Sondland, according to Taylor\u2019s testimony. The spotlight has been on Morrison since August, when\u00a0a government whistleblower\u00a0said multiple U.S. officials had said Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d Morrison was brought on board to address arms control matters and later shifted into a role as a top Russia and Europe adviser. It was then that he stepped into the thick of an in-house squabble about the activities of Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who had been conversing with Ukrainian leaders outside of traditional U.S. diplomatic circles. The impeachment probe has been denounced by the Republican president, who has directed his staff not to testify. Regardless of what he says, GOP lawmakers will be hard-pressed to dismiss Morrison, formerly a longtime Republican staffer at the House Armed Services Committee. He\u2019s been bouncing around Washington in Republican positions for two decades, having worked for Rep. Mark Kennedy, R-Minn., Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and as a GOP senior staffer on the House Armed Services Committee, including nearly four years when it was chaired by Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas. Morrison told people after\u00a0Bolton was forced out of his job\u00a0that the national security adviser had tried to stop Giuliani\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine and that Morrison agreed, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss Morrison\u2019s role in the impeachment inquiry and spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The official said Morrison told people that with the appointment of Robert O\u2019Brien as Bolton\u2019s successor, his own future work at the NSC was in a \u201cholding pattern.\u201d Bolton brought Morrison into the NSC in July 2018 as senior director for weapons of mass destruction and biodefence.",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter behind \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d published a scathing open letter to Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday that rebuked the Facebook founder for allowing misleading and false political ads on the site. \u201cThat\u2019s not defending free speech, Mark, that\u2019s assaulting truth,\u201d Sorkin wrote in his letter, published as a New York Times editorial. \u201cYou and I want speech protections to make sure no one gets imprisoned or killed for saying or writing something unpopular, not to ensure that lies have unfettered access to the American electorate,\u201d he continued. The screenwriter, whose 2010 film depicts the early days of Facebook, took particular issue with an attack ad from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. The ad, which Facebook has refused to take down despite widespread outcry from Democrats, claims former Vice President Joe Biden tried bribing Ukraine\u2019s attorney general on behalf of his son. \u201cEvery square inch of that is a lie and it\u2019s under your logo,\u201d Sorkin said. Zuckerberg responded indirectly through his Facebook page, where he posted a quote from 1995\u2032s \u201cThe American President\u201d \u2015 which Sorkin wrote \u2015 that appears at odds with the values the screenwriter was espousing. \u201cLet\u2019s see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who\u2019s standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours,\u201d read the quote in part. The feud stems from Facebook\u2019s decision not to scrutinize political advertising on the site except in extreme cases. Zuckerberg has cloaked the policy with the First Amendment, arguing that corporations such as his should not police what politicians say even if their statements are demonstrably false. He presented his argument in a winding, 35-minute speech at Georgetown University earlier this month, and again during a congressional hearing last week. The Facebook exec has stuck by his position even after Democratic politicians began highlighting what the policy means in practice by running false ads about Zuckerberg and his platform. He again stood firm after Twitter founder Jack Dorsey announced his site would no longer accept political ads of any kind \u2015 with a not-so-veiled message to Zuckerberg, who pushed back in a Facebook earnings call. In his letter, Sorkin also acknowledged that \u201cThe Social Network\u201d was not well received by the company\u2019s leadership in 2010. When Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg saw an early cut, she said to producers, according to Sorkin, \u201cHow can you do this to a kid?\u201d \u201cI hope your C.O.O. walks into your office, leans in (as she suggested we do in her best selling book), and says, \u2018How can we do this to tens of millions of kids?\u2019\u201d Sorkin retorted.",

Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s name \u201cshould have never been raised in the call because he\u2019s a political opponent of the president; he\u2019s running for office,\u201d Ruddy told Al Jazeera\u00a0news host Mehdi Hasan\u00a0on Friday. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no evidence that the Bidens committed a crime.\u201d \u201cI believe that it\u2019s inappropriate ... absolutely,\u201d said Ruddy, who frequently speaks to the president. \u201cWe should not be asking foreign governments to be involved in any political campaign or anything related to a political campaign.\u201d He called the president\u2019s call \u201ca mistake.\u201d Yet Ruddy also said he does not believe Trump\u2019s conversation was an impeachable offense. \u201cI do believe that as the chief law enforcement officer in the nation, he [Trump] can make a request like that,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cI also believe it\u2019s not a criminal act. ... And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impeachable act.\u201d Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressing him to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, has become the focus of a House impeachment inquiry. Trump, who has provided no evidence that Biden or his son were involved in any wrongdoing, was withholding millions of dollars of U.S. military aid from Ukraine at the time of the call. Ambassador William Taylor testified to House lawmakers last month that he was told by U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland that Trump was demanding that Zelensky make a public announcement \u2014 possibly on CNN \u2014 that he was launching an investigation into the Bidens. Hunter Biden, who was sitting on the board of the Burisma gas company in Ukraine when his father was vice president, has been attacked by Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr. as being unqualified for the job. The Trump brothers themselves are involved in several international business operations launched by their father, and are reaping benefits from his position. Ruddy, referring to Hunter Biden, emphasized that simply being on the board of a company is not a crime. If it were, \u201cyou\u2019d have to start investigating half the Congress,\u201d he quipped.",

In August, Biden jokingly told an audience in New Hampshire that he was \u201cnot going nuts\u201d as the foot-in-mouth moments piled up. Now, he\u2019s telling the public to discern for itself whether he\u2019s fit for office. \u201cThis is for the voters to decide,\u201d he told Woodruff. \u201cTake a look. Look at me.

It\u2019s as simple and as complicated as that.\u201d Though Biden is still leading the crowded pack of Democrats in most 2020 polls, his repeated fumbles, whether on the debate stage or elsewhere, haven\u2019t gone unnoticed. Last month, Biden raised eyebrows during a CNN town hall on LGBTQ issues where he spoke about \u201cgay bathhouses\u201d and \u201cround-the-clock sex\u201d when attempting highlight how conversations on homosexuality have evolved within the past 15 years. When addressing America\u2019s slaveholding past at the third Democratic presidential debate in September, which some candidates have considered rectifying with modern-day reparations, Biden talked about the importance of keeping \u201cthe record player on at night\u201d to\u00a0\u201cmake sure that kids hear words.\u201d During that debate, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro\u00a0appeared to take a shot at Biden\u2019s age as the two sparred over health care reform, asking whether he was\u00a0\u201cforgetting already what you said just two minutes ago.\u201d At least two other candidates \u2015 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0\u2015 later commented that Castro\u2019s remark was a low blow. Still, Biden isn\u2019t the oldest candidate in the race. Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.) is 78.",

      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 The leading Democrats vying for their party\u2019s presidential nomination clashed over the critical issue of health care while offering starkly contrasting visions for the nation\u2019s ideological direction before thousands of cheering Iowa activists at a raucous event kicking off the three-month sprint to the first-in-the-nation caucuses. Former Vice President Joe Biden opened the state Democratic Party\u2019s marquee annual fundraiser, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, by swiping at the candidate who has largely caught him atop the Democratic primary polls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pledged generational change, trying to take up the mantle of another young, upstart candidate, Barack Obama, who pulled off a 2008 upset in Iowa on his way to the presidency. The jabs were relatively gentle but previewed arguments that are likely to increasingly dominate the race. Biden said he would overhaul health care nationwide without \u201cincreases in taxes for the middle class. None. None. None.\u201d While not mentioning Warren by name, his pronouncement came hours after she unveiled a much-anticipated proposal to spend $20-plus trillion over the next decade on a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d universal health care plan that she vowed wouldn\u2019t require a middle-class tax increase. Biden\u2019s campaign had already panned that as requiring \u201cmathematic gymnastics\u201d to cover its huge costs. The former vice president has promised not to \u201cabandon\u201d Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The issue has created a stark policy divide between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom back Medicare for All, and more moderate candidates like Biden and Buttigieg, who say the country isn\u2019t ready to do away with private insurance. Biden also called for party unity and tried to cast himself as immediately able to rise to international challenges: \u201cThe next president is going to be commander in chief of a world in disarray. There\u2019s going to be no time for on-the-job training.\u201d Taking the stage a short time later, Warren made an unwavering appeal for sweeping change, saying, \u201cIf the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then we will lose.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on a big idea, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by that big idea,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory.\u201d In all, more than a dozen presidential candidates addressed 13,000-plus Democratic activists, party volunteers and campaign supporters at a basketball arena in downtown Des Moines. The event amounts to the largest gathering of Democrats in an early voting state \u2014 and was something of a dress rehearsal for the Feb. 3 caucuses. Candidates must now move beyond simply introducing themselves to voters and activists and focus on perfecting a grassroots strategy to ensure they mobilize strong support. For White House hopefuls in the top tier, the event was a key test of momentum, while lagging contenders will face further questions about why they\u2019re staying in the race. That was on full display even before Friday\u2019s festivities began, with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke abruptly announcing he was abandoning his campaign. Like Biden, Buttigieg didn\u2019t mention Warren by name but said he supported \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d and promised to honor the decisions of those who aren\u2019t willing to sign up for fully government-sponsored health care. The 37-year-old also offered a veiled swipe at Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 by chiding candidates for being content to \u201cwait for action.\u201d \u201cI am running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us to real action to do right by Americans who have waited far too long,\u201d Buttigieg said. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Friday found Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden bunched together at the top of the field in Iowa, though Biden and Warren have generally been co-front-runners elsewhere. Sanders struck his familiar, defiant tone Friday night, telling the crowd, \u201cWe will pass, whether the insurance companies like it or not, Medicare for All.\u201d The event really started hours before the formal program. The damp, chilly streets outside the arena buzzed all afternoon with campaigns hoping to exhibit strong organization and enthusiasm. Supporters and campaign volunteers waved signs at busy street corners and congregated in chanting droves. Sanders led a pre-event march that his campaign said drew 1,500 people. Warren supporters erected a giant likeness of Bailey, the senator\u2019s golden retriever. Inside the arena, Biden bought tickets for members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed him, while Buttigieg had the largest presence, snapping up thousands of seats for supporters that included an overflow room. Candidates who have traditionally wowed at the gathering have seen it pay big dividends. In 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore effectively blocked former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley\u2019s advance with the chant during his speech \u201cStay and fight,\u201d a nudge at Bradley for leaving the Senate. Four years later, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used it to hold off a dire challenge from Howard Dean. \u201cWe need answers, not just anger,\u201d Kerry said in a hit at the anti-war Vermont governor who had stirred passions on the left but worried others for challenging President George W. Bush during wartime. \u201cIowa, don\u2019t just send them a message. Send them a president.\u201d More recently, Obama, then an Illinois senator, threw down the gauntlet against national Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in 2007, declaring, \u201cTriangulating and poll-driven positions, because we\u2019re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us, just won\u2019t do.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Bristling at Elizabeth Warren\u2019s suggestions that he\u2019s a milquetoast moderate with small ideas, presidential candidate Joe Biden countered Saturday that he offers a \u201cbold\u201d vision for the country and warned that Democratic primary voters should not get distracted by the party\u2019s increasingly tense battle over ideological labels. It was a departure from Biden\u2019s usual campaign speech and signaled perhaps a new phase of Democrats\u2019 search for a nominee to take on President Donald Trump, with Warren, the leading progressive candidate, and Biden, the top choice for most moderates and establishment liberals, ratcheting up the intensity three months ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cThe vision I have for this country, there\u2019s nothing small about it. It is like going to the moon,\u201d Biden told supporters in Des Moines, as he hit the high points of a policy slate that would increase the federal government\u2019s spending and scope on everything from health care to the climate crisis. Without naming Warren, the former vice president said his ideas \u2014 such as a \u201cpublic option\u201d to compete alongside private health insurance, as opposed to Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d plan run altogether by the government \u2014 actually set the progressive standard in 2020 for a simple reason: They\u2019re more achievable. \u201cI\u2019m not promising anything crazy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a vision \u2014 a vision of how we can get things done.\u201d With reporters afterward, Biden zeroed in on Warren\u2019s estimated $20 trillion price tag for the first decade of single-payer insurance. \u201cGetting that plan through, even in a Democratic Congress,\u201d Biden predicted, \u201cwould be difficult.\u201d Biden\u2019s latest volleys came barely 12 hours after Warren used Iowa Democrats\u2019 annual fundraising gala to draw sharp distinctions in the Democratic field, though she, like Biden, avoided naming opponents. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d the Massachusetts senator told thousands of voters sporting t-shirts and waving signs as their preferred candidates took turns on center stage at a downtown Des Moines arena Friday night. Even if \u201csome people in our party don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d Warren argued, the nation is in \u201ca time of crisis\u201d not just because of Trump\u2019s divisiveness but more so because of an economic and political system rigged against the working class. \u201cIf the most we can promise is \u2018business as usual\u2019 after Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said, \u201cthen Democrats will lose.\u201d The senator doubled-down Saturday, insisting in Vinson, Iowa, that sweeping plans are good politics and perhaps necessary to upend Trump. \u201cWe need big ideas to inspire people, to get them to turn out for the caucuses, to turn out and vote,\u201d Warren said. Asked hours later, after an event in Dubuque, if she was suggesting candidates like Biden weren\u2019t being ambitious enough, Warren responded: \u201cNope. I\u2019m just out here talking about what I\u2019m running on.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about my vision for what it means to build an America going forward that doesn\u2019t just work for a thin slice at the top, but an America that works for everyone,\u201d she said. Still, at the very least, Biden\u2019s reaction suggests frustration over Warren\u2019s apparent momentum, even as he and his aides maintain that his philosophical approach will be successful among both Democratic primary voters and the general electorate. Biden\u2019s proposals, to be clear, put him to the left of recent Democratic nominees, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. But on most points, he falls short of the proposals on the left flank that Warren and her fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, have set. Rather than obliterate private insurance, Biden touts a government plan to compete alongside private firms. Rather than government covering all four-year college tuition, Biden pushes two years a taxpayer-paid tuition. On climate, he backs most long-term goals of the left\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d but on a longer timeline and with an initially less aggressive crackdown on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIt\u2019s made to look like \u2018Well, Biden is coming off with some moderate proposal,\u2019\u201d Biden said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing moderate about making sure everyone has health care. There\u2019s nothing moderate about getting to net-zero emissions. There\u2019s nothing moderate about fundamentally changing the school system in America so we can effectively complete in the 20th century.\u201d The difference in his proposals, Biden argued: \u201cI tell you straight up how we\u2019re going to pay for it and how much it\u2019s going to cost and how it\u2019s going to get done.\u201d The dynamics Biden faces were crystallized as young climate activists interrupted him and chided him for not doing enough to take on the oil and gas industry. \u201cLet her speak,\u201d the candidate said as his supporters tried to drown out one of the activists. Yet as the small group chanted, sang and ultimately departed, Biden grew more frustrated. \u201cIf you\u2019ll notice, they left before I answered her question,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what is going on that\u2019s wrong with our party right now. Everything is taken in contexts that are not accurate.\u201d As his voice calmed, he sought again to widen his appeal. \u201cThe way we win is we unify, we come together as Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have basically the same hopes and dreams. The question is, practically, how we get there. But it\u2019s not a lack of vision.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Vinson and Dubuque, Iowa. ___ Follow Bill Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.",

      "content": " White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Sunday that she does not know whether U.S. military aid was withheld from Ukraine\u00a0to solicit help in an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, refusing to guarantee that there was no quid pro quo at any time. Asked directly on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d whether there was \u201ca time when military aid was held up because the president wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens,\u201d Conway replied that she was unsure. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know they\u2019ve got their aid,\u201d she said. Pivoting, Conway repeatedly emphasized that the funds were ultimately sent after being delayed over the summer. \u201cI feel confident about the fact that Ukraine has that aid and is using it right now, that it\u2019s because of this president that they have it,\u201d she said. Pressed by host Dana Bash, who pointed out that Conway \u201cvery notably won\u2019t say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019\u201d on the question of whether President Donald Trump was seeking to make a deal, Conway said she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether aid was being held and for how long,\u201d she said. The question has become central to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe of Trump following the release of a summary of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the document, Trump urged Zelensky to assist his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with an investigation of Biden and his son based on unsubstantiated corruption allegations. At the time of the conversation, the aid was being withheld. Last month,\u00a0The New York Times reported\u00a0that high-level Ukrainian officials were aware by the first week in August that the assistance had been frozen, contradicting Trump\u2019s claim that they were in the dark on the situation. However, it appears the GOP may be shifting its messaging on the potential quid pro quo in order to bolster their defense of Trump. On Friday, The Washington Post reported\u00a0that Senate Republicans are gearing up to acknowledge that Trump used the aid as leverage and that while it was not legal, it is not an impeachable act. Last week,\u00a0Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, testified before congressional investigators, and is thought to have provided firsthand information about Trump\u2019s call. According to Vindman\u2019s prepared remarks\u00a0obtained by HuffPost, he \u201cwas concerned by the call\u201d and \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\u201d He decided to report the discussion, he said, because he felt Trump\u2019s actions could \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d",

The Fox polls have always been lousy; I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\u201d A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday found that 49% of U.S. citizens are in favor of Trump\u2019s ouster. On Sunday, Fox News released a poll with the same number, as did NBC and The Wall Street Journal\u00a0in a joint survey. All three polls were conducted at the end of October. But Trump scoffed at the idea that the public wants him out, claiming that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want anything to do with impeachment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a phony scam. It\u2019s a hoax,\u201d he said, again arguing that \u201cthe whistleblower should be revealed because the whistleblower gave false information.\u201d Trump has repeatedly demanded that the member of the intelligence community who flagged his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky be revealed. Andrew Bakaj, one of the lawyers for the still-anonymous individual, has contended that his client is \u201centitled to anonymity.\u201d The conversation between the two presidents is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. A summary of the call showed that Trump pressed Zelensky for assistance with a corruption probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son based on unfounded allegations. At the same time, American military aid was being withheld from Ukraine, raising alarm over the possibility of a quid pro quo. However, the whistleblower isn\u2019t the only one who reported Trump\u2019s call. Last week, the National Security Council\u2019s leading Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, appeared before congressional investigators with firsthand information about the discussion, according to his prepared statement obtained by HuffPost. Vindman reported the call, he said, because he was concerned that it could \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d While Americans are split fairly evenly on whether impeachment is the right move, the divide is far more stark along partisan lines. According to the Post/ABC poll, 82% of Republicans oppose impeachment and removal, while the same percentage of Democrats support it. Similarly, the NBC/WSJ poll found that 90% of Republicans oppose impeachment and removal while 88% of Democrats support it.",

Andrew Bakaj, one of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, has argued that his client is entitled to remain anonymous. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from continuing to ask for the whistleblower\u2019s name. On Sunday, he claimed that \u201cthe whistleblower should be revealed because the whistleblower gave [a] false story,\u201d also questioning the whereabouts of a second whistleblower whose identity remains unknown. The White House\u2019s own account of the Trump-Zelensky conversation does not contradict the whistleblower\u2019s story. Trump followed up his remarks with a tweet, claiming that the media is \u201cworking hard\u201d to hide information on the whistleblower\u2019s identity from the public. Last week, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, testified before House impeachment investigators about Trump\u2019s call, according to Vindman\u2019s prepared statement obtained by HuffPost. In his remarks, Vindman said he is not the whistleblower who filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s call, but that he reported the conversation out of concern that it could \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump seemed to suggest Sunday night that while he personally didn\u2019t do so, asking a foreign government for a quid pro quo in exchange for a political favor is not an impeachable offense. \u201cFalse stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo, but it doesn\u2019t matter, there is nothing wrong with that, it is not an impeachable event,\u201d Trump tweeted in the midst of a particularly busy night on the social media platform. \u201cPerhaps so, but read the transcript, there is no quid pro quo!\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for clarification about the president\u2019s remarks. The remarkable messaging reflects a swift change in strategy among Republicans who have been scrambling to respond to the parade of current and former administration officials testifying before lawmakers conducting the impeachment inquiry. The Washington Post reported Sunday that a growing number of Trump\u2019s stalwart GOP allies have begun to acknowledge the existence of a quid pro quo, but moved to characterize the demand as a legitimate power of the president. The demand is the central feature of the ongoing impeachment probe, which arose after a whistleblower first filed a complaint about a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the discussion \u2014 details of which emerged from a reconstruction released by the White House and dozens of hours of testimony from senior aides \u2015 Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. The call took place shortly after Trump ordered a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid that was supposed to be sent to the country. Trump has repeatedly denied a quid pro quo, referring to the call as \u201cperfect\u201d and claiming he has done nothing worthy of impeachment. But House Democrats are deepening their investigation into the discussion and the chamber voted largely along party lines to formalize the inquiry on Thursday, hoping to capitalize on\u00a0growing public support for the probe. Officials with direct knowledge of the call have spoken to lawmakers. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, said he twice reported his concerns about Trump\u2019s call to a superior. He also detailed the unusual decision to store the transcript of the call on a secure server usually reserved for state secrets after those concerns were raised. Republicans, however, have largely remained unified in their support of the president and moved to delegitimize any witnesses who speak to lawmakers while accusing Democrats of conducting their probe in secret (the GOP has many members on each of the three committees spearheading the inquiry). The Post reported that GOP senators met for a lunch last week, when several lawmakers argued that a quid pro quo may have happened, but the government often attaches conditions to foreign aid. A recent attempt to acknowledge Trump\u2019s quid pro quo demand drew widespread rebuke from within the party. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney repeatedly admitted Trump did demand a political favor in exchange for the military aid during an extraordinary press conference last month. But he was forced to walk back those claims mere hours later, blaming the media for misconstruing his recorded remarks.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Few objects symbolize America\u2019s unique place in the world better than the automobile. Residents of the United States drive more than 37 miles per day, nearly twice as much as the average Swede or Norwegian. America has 1.16 cars for every licensed driver and spends roughly $534 per person each year building and maintaining its road network.\u00a0Three out of four\u00a0U.S. workers drive to work alone; fewer than 1 in 20 walk or bicycle. America\u2019s unique enthusiasm for the automobile has become one of the greatest challenges to solving climate change. Transportation is now the greatest source of greenhouse gases in the United States. And while utility companies are phasing out coal in favor of renewable energy, the auto industry is moving in the opposite direction. In March, the International Energy Agency\u00a0reported that America\u2019s oil use was rising more quickly than any other nation. In 2016, the average American drove 1,300 more miles\u00a0than they did in 1992. Nearly every advance in fuel economy has been wiped out by more driving, bigger cars \u2014 or deliberate sabotage by the Trump administration. And yet, no prominent Democrats have proposed policies to reverse this trend. The 2020 presidential candidates have put forward ambitious targets for weaning power plants off of fossil fuels, closing federal lands to drilling and dramatically increasing subsidies to electric vehicles. None of them, however, has acknowledged the urgent necessity for America to kick its driving habit. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine addressing the climate crisis in any meaningful way without taking on automobiles,\u201d said Clayton Nall, a political science professor at Stanford University who specializes in infrastructure spending. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to convert vehicles to electric. And even if it was, it\u2019s not likely to happen on a timeline that will address the carbon emissions problem. It\u2019s a real blind spot.\u201d The absence of meaningful plans to reduce car use is conspicuous. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections show that the United States needs to electrify its vehicle fleet and significantly reduce driving by 2030 to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. In 2018, the California Air Resources Board estimated that even a tenfold increase in electric vehicle sales would still require residents to drive 25 percent fewer miles each year to reach the state\u2019s emissions targets. Both reports suggest taking drastic action to reduce car use. This could include raising gas taxes, increasing investment in public transit or implementing \u201cdecongestion pricing,\u201d a toll for drivers to access heavily trafficked urban neighborhoods. Other countries have begun removing parking spots and\u00a0closing down urban highways in major cities. Some have banned cars from entering their urban cores altogether. Last year, the EU committed to a 35 percent reduction in car emissions by 2030. So far, these ambitious commitments haven\u2019t been taken up by the Democratic Party. In July, the $287 billion highway bill\u00a0passed out of the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee with the support of Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). The transportation spending package, the largest in history, will primarily fund the construction of new roads. Numerous studies have shown that building new roads does not reduce congestion and simply encourages Americans to drive. Despite a\u00a0$420 billion maintenance backlog, the bill dedicates just $6 billion to helping states fix existing roads. \u201cEven if you look at the most ambitious figures in the Democratic Party, there\u2019s less ambition to reduce driving than there needs to be,\u201d said Nall. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the only issues where they\u2019re taking the safe route.\u201d Most Democratic presidential candidates have kept their commitments to reducing transportation emissions undefined. Former Vice President Joe Biden, for example,\u00a0says he\u2019ll help local governments fund \u201calternative and cleaner transportation options,\u201d but doesn\u2019t specify further. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a climate plan that includes a section on \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d but doesn\u2019t set any targets or policies. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), the only candidate to include the phrase \u201creduce car usage\u201d in any published plan, offers no specifics on how such a reduction would happen. Other candidates are strangely unambitious. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has no aversion to laying out bold visions when it comes to health care and education, has set a target of increasing public transit ridership by just 65 percent over the next decade \u2014 an increase that would still see\u00a0fewer than 1 in 10 Americans taking a bus or train to work. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s plan proposes $10 billion in new public transportation spending per year, an amount that could cover\u00a0as little as 11 miles of new urban subways. Leah Stokes, a University of California, Santa Barbara, professor who specializes in climate politics, said that while the Democrats\u2019 plans are modest improvements over the current reality, they don\u2019t go very far in addressing climate change. \u201cNo one is proposing the radical reduction in driving that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if these plans were implemented, they wouldn\u2019t dramatically change the energy demands of the transportation system.\u201d Electric vehicles are the only area of climate policy where Democrats are comfortable being ambitious. Sanders says he\u2019ll electrify the entire transportation sector by 2030. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Warren have committed to converting all new vehicles to electric power by 2030. Buttigieg and Harris set the target at 2035. Stokes says that all of these plans make the same mistake, however: \u201cThey stick to status quo density and they do nothing about the fact that the vast majority of Americans drive to work by themselves.\u201d Americans\u2019 carbon footprint depends more on where they live than what they drive. Residents of lower Manhattan, for example,\u00a0emit less than half as much carbon as residents of Nassau County, New York, a commuter suburb with larger homes and higher rates of car ownership. Providing Nassau residents with electric vehicles would have some effect on their carbon footprint, but the effect would be much larger if they simply moved closer to jobs, services and shopping. There is also the problem of time. Americans own roughly\u00a0272 million cars. Only around\u00a017 million, or 6%, are purchased new each year. Even if the candidates\u2019 plans to reach 100% of new vehicles running on electric power by 2030 came true, it could take another decade before they reached the penetration necessary to significantly reduce emissions. Sanders\u2019 plan aims to speed up this process by offering a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d-style grant program that would purchase electric vehicles for low- and medium-income drivers. Over 10 years, the plan would cost $2.1 trillion, enough for roughly 54 million EVs at today\u2019s average price of $36,600 each. It is the largest single expenditure in Sanders\u2019 $16.3 billion climate plan. Matthew Lewis, a climate and urban policy consultant in Berkeley, said Sanders\u2019 plan is an inefficient way to spend such a large outlay. \u201cEven as a symbolic victory, it\u2019s not much of a victory,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Congratulations, you just threw away enough money to build a great public transit system in every city in the country.\u2019\u201d Rapidly expanding America\u2019s electric vehicle fleet has implications for the climate. Stokes estimates that meeting the Democrats\u2019 targets would require roughly doubling America\u2019s electrical capacity. Studies have found that if this additional capacity came from coal-fired power plants, the resulting rides wouldn\u2019t be much better for the climate than hybrid vehicles. Plus, the production of electric vehicles is itself a carbon-intensive process that involves mining cobalt and lithium for the battery and smelting steel for the frame. \u201cDepending on how much you drive, a car that\u2019s 10 to 12 years old might actually be better for the environment than replacing it with an electric vehicle,\u201d Lewis said. Then there are all the knock-on effects. One of the most reliable statistics in urban planning is that when gas prices fall, Americans drive more. Buying electric vehicles for millions of Americans could encourage them to spend more time on the road, worsening congestion and encouraging even more emissions. And electric cars are still cars: All of the other negative impacts of driving \u2014 from pedestrian deaths to the health effects of long commutes to the harmful \u201cmicroplastics\u201d shed by rubber tires \u2014 would remain firmly in place. \u201cNo matter what, transitioning to clean energy has to involve a systematic reduction of energy demand,\u201d said Daniel Aldana Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who runs a\u00a0research project on Americans\u2019 carbon footprints. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cyou solve one problem and end up with a bunch of new ones.\u201d The most obvious explanation for Democrats\u2019 four-wheeled blind spot is that reducing car use is politically unpopular. \u201cCampaigning against cars is like campaigning against hamburgers,\u201d Cohen said. Densifying cities is\u00a0controversial and public transit is stigmatized throughout most of the country. There are also more complicated incentives at play. Electric vehicle subsidies enrich automakers, whose unionized workers tend to lean left. The first two states to vote in the Democratic primary, Iowa and New Hampshire, are full of rural voters unlikely to find gas taxes and bike lanes appealing. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a dense city, then it\u2019s a viable conversation,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about anywhere else, it\u2019s a chicken or egg paradox\u201d \u2014 before politicians can propose denser housing or better public transport, they need a base of constituents who want them. In most of the United States, however, decades of disinvestment and sprawl have made it all but impossible for those constituencies to form. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live in a place where anything other than driving is a viable option,\u201d Cohen said, \u201cthen the specter of losing your car or cheap gas is pretty terrifying.\u201d The features of the Democratic base also play a role. A senior climate adviser who has worked in both politics and civil society (and declined to be identified because her views could jeopardize her current position) said environmental advocacy groups generally don\u2019t lobby Democrats to include reductions in car use in their platforms. Donors and civil society groups simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s an efficient use of their resources. \u201cThe theory in climate advocacy has always been to go after the gettable tons first,\u201d she said. That means prioritizing areas where federal regulations can reduce carbon emissions quickly and painlessly. At the federal level, that means tightening regulations on power plants. Promoting urban density, public transport and reductions in driving just aren\u2019t worth the political capital it would cost to achieve them. Policies to reduce driving also pose a communication challenge. It\u2019s hard to connect seemingly unrelated policy areas like housing density to carbon emissions. Many Americans think of climate change as a problem caused by fossil fuel companies, not their own commuting habits. \u201cPoliticians are good at talking about how to spread around goodies, but it\u2019s much harder to talk about everyone sharing in the pain of conservation,\u201d Nall said. But perhaps the greatest challenge is how few voters can imagine living in places that don\u2019t require driving. \u201cAmericans struggle to understand what public transit would do for their lives,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBecause the transit is shitty in so many places, they assume it will always be shitty and will make it harder for them to get around.\u201d On the bright side, international experience indicates that a future with less driving may not be the dystopia voters and politicians fear. Restrictions on cars in European cities have been\u00a0overwhelmingly popular.\u00a0Decongestion charges in Stockholm and London were loathed before they were implemented but beloved soon after. In 2016, Barcelona closed streets to cars in a single neighborhood. Now, after citywide demand, it is replicating the\u00a0\u201csuperblock\u201d program in five more. Things may even be changing in the United States. After a yearslong legal battle, New York City finally banned cars from a\u00a0heavily trafficked east-west thoroughfare to clear the way for buses. The plan has earned\u00a0rave reviews from transit riders. Opponents\u2019 predictions that extra traffic would spill over into nearby streets have not come to fruition \u2014 cutting off the roadway seems to have incentivized New Yorkers to get where they\u2019re going some other way. Reducing transportation emissions and battling climate change, Lewis said, will require doing a lot more projects like New York City\u2019s. \u201cWe need to do the reverse of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cRight now I have to drive a car because the transit is such a mess. We have to make it so I have to take the bus because driving is a mess.\u201d Illustration: Doug Chayka for HuffPost If it matters to you, it matters to us. Support HuffPost\u2019s journalism here.",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 While both the president\u2019s defenders and critics have settled on the phrase \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to describe President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, some former federal prosecutors have an even simpler description for it: extortion. Federal law makes it a crime for an official to demand or threaten another party to obtain something of value \u2014 a definition that appears to cover Trump\u2019s decision to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to the country unless its leader agreed to launch investigations advantageous to Trump\u2019s reelection efforts. The relevant law is known as the Hobbs Act, said Danya Perry, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in New York City. Its definition of \u201cextortion\u201d includes obtaining property using \u201cthreatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,\u201d meaning using one\u2019s official capacity. The crime is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. \u201cThe statute is often applied to a demand or a threat made by a public official in order to obtain something of value in exchange for his or her performance of an official act. The House is examining, among other things, whether the Ukrainian government felt under pressure to investigate the Bidens as a prerequisite to receiving potentially life-saving military assistance,\u201d she said, referring to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. \u201cTo be clear, we do not yet know how the evidence will play out and certainly there may be valid available defenses, but it is certainly possible to make out a prima facie case.\u201d The White House did not respond to queries about the withheld funds. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Sunday that the whole question was moot because Ukraine ultimately received the $391 million in military aid \u2014 but failed to note that it was released only after a whistleblower had filed a complaint about the matter. (The whistleblower first raised concern within the administration.) Bill Weld, who ran the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division under President Ronald Reagan and is now running against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, said Trump could also be charged with bribery. \u201cThe Hobbs Act is an extortion statute, and the same facts can constitute extortion and bribery, as here,\u201d he said. The House of Representatives moved to open impeachment proceedings against Trump after the White House released a summary of a July 25 phone call showing that, when the Ukrainian president asked about military aid, Trump responded: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d Trump and his allies have claimed that his requests for an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian gas company and Ukraine\u2019s role in the origins of the FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign are all about his interest in ending \u201ccorruption.\u201d Yet the White House has been unable to provide examples of Trump\u2019s interest in ending alleged \u201ccorruption\u201d except in those two cases, both of which happen to benefit him personally. Trump has long seen the former vice president as the most potent threat to his reelection, and Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have been trying to get Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens since early this year, according to testimony emerging from the impeachment inquiry. Further, Trump\u2019s insistence on a probe into Ukraine\u2019s supposed role in the 2016 election is, in reality, an attempt to undermine the conclusion reached by both the U.S. intelligence community and former special counsel Robert Mueller that Russia helped Trump win the presidency. Indeed, the\u00a0conspiracy theory\u00a0that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election \u2014 which Trump\u2019s former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert called \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d \u2014 appears to have been spread by Russian intelligence, according to newly released documents from Mueller\u2019s investigation. Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor from Illinois, said that prosecuting Trump is unlikely, particularly with impeachment well under way. \u201cIt looks like extortion, and it is certainly corrupt, but I don\u2019t believe this is the sort of activity that would actually be prosecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing presidential power in this way is not the sort of thing our criminal justice system is equipped to handle.\u201d Republican senators, who would serve as jurors in an impeachment trial, are now turning to the argument that while Trump did, in fact, make military aid conditional on Ukraine conducting these investigations, such an act is not impeachable \u2014 essentially arguing that presidents are permitted to shape American foreign policy to their own personal benefit. Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who is also running against Trump, said that the need to defend Trump will constantly bring his party ever lower. \u201cEvery single GOP senator who says it was an \u2018OK\u2019 quid pro quo are lying because they know it\u2019s not OK,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBy not impeaching and removing Trump for what he did, they are telling future presidents that foreign powers can now decide American elections. Like Trump, that\u2019s a despicably disloyal thing for GOP senators to say and do.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It started with a warning to watch her back, that people were \u201clooking to hurt\u201d her. From there, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House investigators, it escalated into a chilling campaign to fire her as President Donald Trump and his allies angled in Eastern Europe for political advantage at home. Testimony from Yovanovitch, released Monday, offered a first word-for-word look at the closed-door House impeachment hearings. Inside, Democrats and Republicans are waging a pitched battle over what to make of Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine\u2019s leaders to investigate political rival Joe Biden, Biden\u2019s son and Democratic activities in the 2016 election. The transcript came out on the same day that four Trump administration officials defied subpoenas to testify, acting on orders from a White House that is fighting the impeachment investigation with all its might. Among those refusing to testify: John Eisenberg, the lead lawyer at the National Security Council and, by some accounts, the man who ordered a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader moved to a highly restricted computer system. During nine hours of sometimes emotional testimony, Yovanovitch detailed efforts led by Rudy Giuliani and other Trump allies to push her out of her post. The career diplomat, who was recalled from her job in May on Trump\u2019s orders, testified that a senior Ukrainian official told her that \u201cI really needed to watch my back.\u201d While the major thrust of Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony was revealed in her opening statement, Monday\u2019s 317-page transcript provided new details. Yovanovitch offered significant threads of information including the possibility that Trump was directly involved in a phone call with Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and the Ukrainians dating back to January 2018. And she pushed back on Republican suggestions that she harbored opposition to Trump. She had been recalled from Kyiv before the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that\u2019s at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Later, she was \u201csurprised and dismayed\u201d by what she saw in the transcript of the call \u2014 including that Trump had called her \u201cbad news.\u201d He also said that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Yovanovitch said, to see \u201cthat the president would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart.\u201d Asked about her as he left on a campaign trip Monday, Trump had a more equivocal comment: \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s a very fine woman. I just don\u2019t know much about her.\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said transcripts from the hearings are being released so \u201cthe American public will begin to see for themselves.\u201d Two were released Monday, and more are coming. Republicans have accused Democrats of conducting a one-sided process behind closed doors. But the transcripts show GOP lawmakers were given time for questioning, which they used to poke at different aspects of the impeachment inquiry. Some Republicans criticized the process as unfair, while others tried to redirect witnesses to their own questions about Biden\u2019s work on Ukraine corruption issues while he was vice president. In public, some Republicans say the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine, though not ideal, are certainly not impeachable. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight committee, defended Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster as clearly within the president\u2019s prerogative. \u201cPresident Trump has the authority to name who he wants in any ambassador position. That\u2019s a call solely for the president of the United States as the commander in chief,\u201d Jordan said. Yovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv as Giuliani pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with Burisma, a gas company there. Giuliani\u2019s role in Ukraine was central to Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony. She said she was aware of an interest by the Trump lawyer and his associates in investigating Biden and Burisma \u201cwith a view to finding things that could be possibly damaging to a presidential run,\u201d as well as investigating the 2016 election and theories that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that interfered. However, asked directly if Giuliani was promoting investigations on Burisma and Biden, Yovanovitch said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t entirely clear to me what was going on.\u201d More directly, she drew a link between Giuliani and two businessmen \u2015 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have been indicted in the U.S. on charges stemming from campaign donations \u2015 as part of the campaign to oust her. She understood they were looking to expand their business interests in Ukraine \u201cand that they needed a better ambassador to sort of facilitate their business\u2019 efforts here.\u201d Yovanovitch said was told by Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani was in touch with Ukraine\u2019s former top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, \u201cand that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.\u201d She said she was told Lutsenko \u201cwas looking to hurt me in the U.S.\u201d The diplomat said she sought advice from Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, after an article appeared in The Hill newspaper about Giuliani\u2019s complaints against her. Sondland told her, \u201d\u2019You need to go big or go home,\u201d advising her to \u201ctweet out there that you support the president.\u201d Yovanovitch said she felt she could not follow that advice as a nonpartisan government official. The former envoy stressed to investigators that she was not disloyal to the president. She answered \u201cno\u201d when asked point blank if she\u2019d ever \u201cbadmouthed\u201d Trump in Ukraine, and said she felt U.S. policy in Ukraine \u201cactually got stronger\u201d because of Trump\u2019s decision to provide lethal assistance to the country \u2014 military aid that later was held up by the White House as it pushed for investigations into Trump\u2019s political foes. Long hours into her testimony, Yovanovitch was asked why she was such \u201ca thorn in their side\u201d that Giuliani and others wanted her fired. \u201cHonestly,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d Yovanovitch, still employed by the State Department, is in a fellowship at Georgetown University. She told the investigators that the campaign against her, which included an article that was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., undermined her ability to serve as a credible ambassador and she wanted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement defending her. But no statement was issued. The impeachment panels also released testimony Monday from Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo. McKinley, a 37-year career diplomat, testified that he decided to resign from his post as a senior adviser to Pompeo after his repeated efforts to get the State Department to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch after the transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call was released. \u201cTo see the impugning of somebody I know to be a serious, committed colleague in the manner that it was done raised alarm bells for me,\u201d he said. McKinley said he was already concerned about politicization at the State Department, and that the refusal to publicly back Yovanovitch convinced him it was time to leave. ___ AP writers Eric Tucker, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Ben Fox, Padmananda Rama and Matthew Lee contributed to this report",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Senate Republicans ducked for cover on Tuesday after a top Trump administration diplomat revised his testimony in the House impeachment inquiry to acknowledge that U.S. aid to Ukraine was being withheld until the country promised to investigate a company tied to former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. Gordon Sondland, a top donor to President Donald Trump who then picked him to serve as ambassador to the European Union,\u00a0confirmed in an addendum\u00a0on Monday to his testimony last month that he was involved in Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine\u2019s government after previously claiming he could not recall the details. Sondland said his memory had been \u201crefreshed,\u201d and that he now recalled telling an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 1 that \u201cresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement.\u201d The statement, the Ukrainians were advised, ought to include Burisma, the company on whose corporate board Hunter Biden served while his father was vice president. Sondland\u2019s reversal, which only came after several other top Trump administration officials contradicted his initial testimony and put him in legal jeopardy, is likely to undercut Republican messaging about the impeachment inquiry. GOP lawmakers have steadily denied the existence of a quid pro quo involving the Bidens ever since Trump released a July 25 summary of his call with Zelensky during which the U.S. president requested an investigation into the Bidens. Several Senate Republicans declined on Tuesday to respond directly to questions about Sondland\u2019s revised testimony, as well as the president\u2019s attacks against the whistleblower whose complaint helped ignite the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until we get the case from the House and withhold judgment on the daily revelations, charges, witnesses and all the rest ... that\u2019s really all I have to say about that,\u201d\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said at his weekly press conference at the Capitol. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia similarly declined to comment when asked if she believed it was appropriate to condition aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens, \u201cThese are judgments that we\u2019re obviously going to have to make when it comes over here,\u201d Capito told reporters, referring to the prospect of a Senate impeachment trial. But some Republicans continued to express skepticism about the House impeachment inquiry even when pressed about Sondland\u2019s new admission. \u201cIs it against the law? Is it a crime? I don\u2019t know that it is,\u201d Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said, adding he would reserve judgment until and if the House drafts articles of impeachment. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa insisted that Tuesday\u2019s bombshell admission from a top Trump diplomat and backer that a quid pro quo involving Ukraine aid was sought did not, in fact, confirm a quid pro quo. \u201cWhat difference does it make? This was all out with the document the president put out two months ago,\u201d he said, referring to the July 25 call summary of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was refusing to read any deposition transcripts released by House impeachment investigators. The top Trump ally and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman dismissed the process as \u201ca bunch of B.S.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Graham told reporters that he found Sondland\u2019s new testimony \u201cunpersuasive\u201d\u00a0because the diplomat told House investigators he \u201cpresumed\u201d aid to Ukraine was linked to a statement about investigations. However, Sondland also is now testifying that he told a top Ukrainian official the resumption of aid would \u201clikely not occur\u201d until the government issued such a statement. Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, meanwhile, said he was skeptical any new testimony brought against the president would change the minds of Senate Republicans. \u201cRegardless of how many people you bring out to make the point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to do the job for most of us to change our opinion,\u201d Braun said, urging a focus on the summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Zelensky. This story has been updated with comments from Sens. Graham and Braun.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden escalated his skirmish with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over their competing health care plans, writing in an essay Tuesday that she was taking a dangerous \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to the issue. In a post on Medium, the Democratic presidential hopeful also zeroed in on comments his rival made last week that he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary\u201d and \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d by criticizing her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. Warren\u2019s proposal is bolder and more progressive than Biden\u2019s, but also more expensive. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cBut at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Biden, who pitches himself as more able to win over moderate voters in crucial swing states than Warren or the other major contenders in the Democratic race, emphasized throughout the piece that Warren\u2019s comment \u201cis no way to bring the country together. This is no way for this party to beat Donald Trump\u201d in next year\u2019s presidential election. Warren\u2019s remarks came after Biden\u2019s campaign launched an attack on her Medicare for All plan, accusing her campaign of using \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d to hide that its $21 trillion cost would require tax increases on the middle class. Biden, by contrast, is proposing an expansion of former President\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and allowing people to keep their private insurance if they want to. The two will face off over health care and other issues more at a Nov. 20 debate alongside that also will feature at least seven other candidates.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying world on Wednesday, criticizing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being too aggressive and unwilling to give Republicans a chance. \u201cWith Donald Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to see a number of my Republican colleagues have an epiphany. Mark my words. Mark my words,\u201d Biden said. On the same day Biden made his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was just a few blocks away at the White House, boasting about how he blocked Merrick Garland from getting a seat on the Supreme Court. Garland, of course, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away. McConnell successfully blocked Garland from even getting a hearing \u2015 all long before Trump came into office. Biden spoke at Sidley Austin, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful law firms literally located on K Street (which has long been shorthand for Washington lobbying). Sidley Austin also has a lobbying practice. Biden, like the rest of the major 2020 Democratic candidates, is not taking money from federal lobbyists. Biden has been going after Warren in recent days after she said he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Her comments came in response to\u00a0Biden\u2019s criticism of how she will pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Biden said the next president is going to inherit a \u201cdivided nation,\u201d and he made the case that he, and not someone like Warren, can make it better. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take two things: One is somebody who in fact, knows how to reach across the aisle and get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the people that are running against me tell me I\u2019m na\u00efve, one said I should be in the Republican primary, God love her. That\u2019s not the way you get things done, man. You don\u2019t go in and tell people that they disagree there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with them.\u201d The attendees applauded at Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden has made these \u201cepiphany\u201d comments before. \u2033[T]he thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,\u201d he said in May. \u201cYou will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d This belief is central to Biden\u2019s pitch: Trump is so bad, and Biden is so good at working across the aisle that bipartisan comity will just suddenly break out if he\u2019s elected. Even in the Obama years, Biden was hopeful that Republicans would finally come around.\u00a0In November 2012, he predicted that if Obama won a decisive reelection, he could get Republicans to work alongside the administration and that people would see the \u201cfever break.\u201d Republicans showed little willingness to work with Obama after his reelection. On clean energy, Republicans used a failed green energy startup, Solyndra, to question all of the administration\u2019s energy initiatives and cast the president as corrupt. And Republican senators blocked Garland in 2016. Biden recently said he was open to a super PAC backing him. Those entities can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors. Many of Biden\u2019s opponents have shunned super PACs this cycle, and two of his progressive competitors \u2015 Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 also don\u2019t do high-dollar fundraisers.",

      "content": " Attorney General William Barr\u00a0declined to hold a press conference to clear President Donald Trump of wrongdoing in his phone call with the president of Ukraine, The Washington Post reported\u00a0Wednesday. People familiar with the matter told the Post that Trump wanted Barr to publicly state he had broken no laws when he pressured Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son during the July 25 phone call. According to the Post, Trump put in a request for the press conference around Sept. 25. Around the same time, the White House released a summary of the call\u2019s transcript that shows the president asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a favor. During the call, Trump urged Zelensky to further discuss an investigation into the Bidens with Barr. The Justice Department ultimately decided not to investigate Trump over his phone call with Zelensky, announcing in a Sept. 25 statement that it did not find any campaign finance violations and had \u201cconcluded the matter.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division \u201creviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted,\u201d a spokesperson said at the time. HuffPost has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Trump denied the report in several tweets Thursday morning, calling The Washington Post \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cdegenerate.\u201d The president also said that Barr is denying the paper\u2019s reporting, too. In response, the Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, said the paper \u201cfully stands behind\u201d its reporting and reporters \u201cwho are among the finest journalists anywhere\u201d and accused Trump of making \u201cfalse accusations\u201d as part of his ongoing attacks on the free press. \u201cDespite his repugnant attempt to intimidate and harass The Post and its staff, we will continue to do the work that democracy demands of a free and independent press,\u201d he said.

The revision acknowledged Sondland was involved in President Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine\u2019s government, which involved the release of military aid in exchange for a Ukrainian investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden. Sondland had previously said he could not recall the details but then said that subsequent testimonies\u00a0(which contradicted portions of his original testimony) refreshed his recollection of conversations involving the suspension of U.S. aid. Speaking to Fox News presenter Martha McCallum, Graham threw out a baseless theory that Sondland\u2019s decision to revise his testimony was the work of Democrats. Sondland, a wealthy Seattle hotelier who was appointed to the diplomat role by Trump last June, notably donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, fundraised for former President George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and John McCain, and has been a major GOP donor for many years. \u201cWhy did Sunderland change his testimony,\u201d Graham speculated, referring to Sondland. \u201cWas there a connection between Sunderland and Democratic operatives on the committee?\u201d Graham suggested perhaps House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff or his staffers had spoken to Sondland. \u201cI\u2019ve been a lawyer for a very long time, and when somebody changes their testimony, they suddenly recall something they didn\u2019t know before, it makes me incredibly suspicious.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " DECORAH, Iowa \u2015 When Pete Buttigieg begins his stump speeches to the throngs of voters who gather to hear him at town halls across Iowa, he doesn\u2019t start with his plan for a particular policy or elucidate a specific critique of President Donald Trump. Instead, with a pastoral touch drawn from his liberal Episcopalian faith, the 37-year-old Democratic presidential contender, who\u2019s also the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asks his audience to imagine the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cI want to ask you to really visualize the first day when the sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told a flock of about 1,000 voters on Saturday night in the college town of Decorah, about 15 miles south of the Minnesota border. Unlike rivals to his left, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg does not ask voters to recognize the supremacy of corporate power and political corruption as much as he wants them to confront the difficulty of healing a country polarized along partisan lines. Uniting the country, he argues, is a prerequisite to expanding health care coverage, tackling climate change, boosting wages and narrowing the racial wealth gap. But for such a monumental challenge, the request Buttigieg issues to his audience is relatively modest. He wants people to summon the patience and courage that they bring to discussions with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table. The day after the election, he wants them to call their friends and relatives who voted for a different presidential candidate and discuss something non-political. And most of all, he wants them to put their trust in him as the person most capable of leading Americans toward these solutions while easing the rancor of the current political moment. \u201cI believe that the right president, the president that I seek to be, can gather together an American majority to get these things done,\u201d he said in Decorah on Saturday. \u201cThe good news is the American people are ready \u2015 you can feel it. Not everybody. But most of us are ready for solutions to these problems.\u201d If the pitch sounds familiar, that\u2019s because like virtually every element of the latest iteration of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s designed to emulate the rhetoric, tactics and spirit of former President Barack Obama. During Obama\u2019s first run, he paired a progressive policy platform with soaring descriptions of the United States\u2019 common fabric and appeals to overcome the partisan divisions that separated \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states.\u201d He preached an optimistic faith in the power of the country to renew itself that was just vague enough for moderates and progressives alike to see their values in his platform. And he too was a young, relative political newcomer and would-be barrier-breaking minority, who took his articulate stump speech to the rural-most corners of the first-in-the-nation caucus state. (Where Obama was the country\u2019s first Black president, Buttigieg would be the country\u2019s first openly gay president.) Where Obama preached \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d Buttigieg is calling for \u201chope\u201d and \u201cbelonging.\u201d Where Obama joked about an end to \u201cScooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence and Karl Rove politics,\u201d Buttigieg relishes an \u201cend to this chaos and corruption and the tweets.\u201d In his barnburner speech at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s massive Liberty and Justice rally and dinner in the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday night, Buttigieg made the comparison explicit to an audience of 13,000, at least a few thousand of whom were his most dedicated supporters. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock doors for a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said, referencing Obama. \u201cAnd we knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d he continued, prompting roars of approval from his blue-and-yellow-clad fans. But the differences between Buttigieg and Obama are just as obvious. Buttigieg has only served as mayor of a city of just over 100,000 people, and he lost both times he sought higher office. (He ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017). And though over one-quarter of the population of South Bend is Black, Buttigieg\u2019s tenure has been rocked by\u00a0race-related scandals, including the July police killing of a Black man accused of trying to steal cars, which sparked heated protests. His support among non-white Democratic primary voters is in the low single digits, according to public polls. He\u2019s also more popular with older voters, despite being the only candidate who is a millennial. Obama, of course, had a strong base of young people who fueled the excitement and energy of his run. What\u2019s more, while Obama courted voters on the activist left, Buttigieg has by turns confused them and spurned them outright.\u00a0Early on, he called for the aggressive measure of adding more justices to the Supreme Court, but more recently, he said that his vision of an expanded bench would encourage the confirmation of \u201cswing\u201d justices like Anthony Kennedy or David Souter \u2015 two men who were chosen by Republican presidents. The comments were widely interpreted as endorsements of Kennedy and Souter, though that did not appear to be his intention. He\u2019s also been especially hard on Warren and Sanders\u00a0for backing a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan that would effectively end the vast majority of private health care coverage. In September and October when Warren declined to say how she would finance Medicare for All \u2014 and whether it would require tax increases \u2014 Buttigieg effectively called her a hypocrite. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d he said in a CNN interview in September.\u00a0(Warren subsequently released a detailed financing plan that did not raise middle-class taxes.) When HuffPost asked him in Iowa last weekend whether his pugnacious rhetoric marked a break with his previous comments, Buttigieg insisted that he has been consistent. \u201cI continue to believe that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what. I think I\u2019ll be better at fending that off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I hold my views on health care policy is because I think it\u2019s the right answer.\u201d In another discussion with reporters in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg also reiterated that his comments about Kennedy and Souter were in reference to a hypothetical scenario in which the Supreme Court is expanded.\u00a0He believes that a larger court could be capable of accommodating swing justices and could transcend the \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d of the present bench. \u201cI was not saying that in the current Supreme Court structure, I would appoint people with the judicial philosophy like Kennedy or Souter,\u201d he said. \u201cA better example would probably be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of a justice whose judicial philosophy largely matches my own.\u201d Notwithstanding Buttigieg\u2019s glaring differences with Obama, he is trying to cultivate the kinds of voters who remain enamored of the former president\u2019s eloquence and sunny disposition. Call it the \u201cWest Wing\u201d lane. He is the kind of candidate that Democrats of varied ideological leanings can see as the personification of their ideal of politics \u2015 a place where intelligence, uplifting rhetoric and an inspiring personal story are enough to vanquish the demons of division that plague the country. Many attendees of Buttigieg\u2019s town halls volunteered comparisons to Obama unprompted, while some cited other iconic Democratic presidents. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of his charisma,\u201d said Barb Neal, a retired banker from Mount Vernon, who attended the Decorah town hall, by way of explaining the Obama comparison. \u201cHe just gives me hope. He\u2019s so positive. So many of them are so negative \u2015 just bashing the other side, and he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Mary Thomsen, Neal\u2019s sister, who still works as a banker, chimed into agree. \u201cHe reminds me of Obama. For some reason he also reminds me of John F. Kennedy,\u201d she said. Of course, former Vice President Joe Biden has, more than any other candidate, sought to capitalize on his direct ties to Obama. He frequently references \u201cmy friend Barack\u201d in his stump speeches. And his strong support among Black voters in the early primary state of South Carolina is widely attributed to positive memories of his partnership with the country\u2019s first Black president. In trying to channel Obama \u2014 rather than generate good will by association with him \u2014 Buttigieg appears to be having success with many of the Iowa voters who are looking for a more moderate contender, but may be underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s performance on the trail. Buttigieg trounced the former vice president in third quarter fundraising (though the mayor\u2019s haul still fell short of Warren and Sanders\u2019 totals). And he has been rising in Iowa\u2019s polls even as Biden has continued to drop. Several Iowa Democrats at Buttigieg\u2019s events in small towns across the northern part of the state over the weekend described concerns about either the effect of Biden\u2019s age on his public speaking abilities, or the negative publicity surrounding his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine. Laura Swalve, a former school psychologist from Swea City who came to see Buttigieg at the VFW hall in Algona on Monday, described herself as a \u201cfan\u201d of Biden\u2019s. But while clarifying that she does not think he is senile, Swalve worries that he\u2019s \u201cjust not as quick\u201d as he used to be. \u201cI honestly think his age sometimes comes through, like in the debates, when he kind of didn\u2019t know how to say things,\u201d she said. For Bill Paup, a retired schoolteacher from Cedar Falls who came to a Buttigieg town hall in Waverly on Sunday, the appearance of wrongdoing related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine was enough to push him toward other options. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not valid concerns, but just like in 2016, it doesn\u2019t take a valid concern to bury somebody,\u201d Paup said. \u201cIt just takes a lot of noise. And he\u2019s got that.\u201d The Liberty and Justice Celebration is the last of several Iowa political confabs that punctuate the six-month period of campaigning leading up to the Iowa caucuses, which are due to take place this year on Feb. 3. Only candidates who purchase the state party\u2019s voter file or have field offices in the state are permitted to speak. They are also welcome to purchase tickets for their supporters to attend and cheer them on in the stands. (In other words, raucous applause is often less spontaneous, and more sponsored.) In November 2007, Obama\u2019s memorable speech at the fundraiser \u2015 then known as the Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2015 set the tone for the homestretch of Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign, which culminated in his historic victory on caucus day. Buttigieg sought to make his speech \u2015 and delegation \u2015 at Friday\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration a similarly impressive turning point. Festivities began with a rally in downtown Des Moines and a march to the dinner that the Buttigieg campaign said included 2,300 people. Although the campaign \u2015 like other campaigns \u2015 coordinated the participation of many Iowa activists, there was also a delegation of some 1,000 members of the ad hoc, internet-based, grassroots group, \u201cBarnstomers 4 Pete,\u201d who attended the event on their own dime. Ariana Wyndham, an undocumented immigrant who can remain in the country thanks to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and who lives in Warren, Ohio, is a leader of the group. She drove to Des Moines with her husband Peter, a crane operator, for the dinner festivities and a few days of canvassing and bonding with fellow activists. Speaking to HuffPost on the concourse of the Wells Fargo arena, Wyndham, covered in Buttigieg swag, described suffering from anxiety and depression after Trump\u2019s election. Without the right to vote, she felt powerless to get involved in politics until she found out about Buttigieg. She was particularly drawn to the account Buttigieg gives in his book, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d of reviving South Bend, a struggling post-industrial city that reminded her of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it can be done everywhere and it should be done everywhere.\u201d The following days were a show of force from Buttigieg designed to capitalize on his strong reception at the Liberty and Justice Celebration. On Saturday, after answering the questions of building trades union leaders at a multi-candidate fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg embarked on a three-day bus tour across rural northern Iowa, welcoming reporters onto his bus for extended group interviews in between campaign stops. Over the course of six town halls, Buttigieg spoke to crowds ranging from 275 people on the low end to upwards of 1,000, according to estimates provided to the campaign by building managers. The turnout was significant considering that all but one of the events took place in towns with a few thousand people. (His fourth stop was in Mason City, which has a population just under 28,000.) The campaign has one of the most extensive field presences in Iowa with over 100 staff on the ground and some 20 offices. Buttigieg has ramped up his investment in digital advertisements in the state as well, spending over $48,000 on Facebook ads targeting Iowans in the past week alone \u2014 more than any other Democrat running for president \u201cIn a lot of the towns that not just campaigns but a lot of economists have written off, Mayor Pete\u2019s team has shown up,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat running to represent several of the towns Buttigieg visited in the U.S. House and who has not endorsed in the presidential primary. \u201cFor months it was Warren. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve switched strategy or something. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m now seeing Pete more.\u201d For Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who tagged along with Buttigieg for a tour of an ethanol plant in Mason City, Buttigieg\u2019s itinerary was still more evidence that he was walking in the footsteps of Obama, who won Iowa twice. All but one of Buttigieg\u2019s bus tour stops was in a county that Obama won at least once and then went for Trump in 2016. \u201cObama was the model. He was everywhere,\u201d Judge said. Buttigieg has not shied away from the obvious differences between himself and Obama. At a town hall in Mason City on Sunday night that was attended by about 500 people, nearly all of whom were white, a voter asked Buttigieg how he planned to increase his support with Black voters. \u201cThe way to win any vote is to deserve to win it. My job is to make sure there is no confusion about where we stand,\u201d he said. To that end, he has unveiled a multi-pronged plan, named after the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, tailored to address the particular challenges facing Black communities \u2015 from difficulty obtaining credit to start a business or buy a home to encountering racial bias in the job market or the health care system. He also devoted a segment of his stump speech each stop in rural Iowa to confronting the country\u2019s legacy of anti-Black racism. The impact of racism \u201cis as important to discuss with mostly white audiences as it was with the NAACP gathering I was at early today,\u201d he told another predominantly white audience in Decorah on Saturday night. \u201cThis could wreck the entire American project \u2026 as long as we allow it to be the case that this is two different countries in your health and your access to housing or ability to get a job,\u201d depending on whether you are white or Black. And when Buttigieg lists mayoral peers to whom he looks for inspiration and guidance, two of the first names to come up are Michael Tubbs and Randall Woodfin, the young Black leaders of Stockton, California, and Birmingham, Alabama, respectively. For the most progressive voters in the Democratic primary, however, Obama\u2019s presidency is a cautionary tale, rather than a model. For example, they see a president whose embrace of corporate-friendly international trade agreements was wrongheaded and politically damaging, and whose Wall Street-cozy cabinet prevented him from adequately addressing the post-2008 housing crisis. But when asked to make the case that he would deliver on his progressive economic promises despite the support he enjoys from corporate America, Buttigieg again turns to Obama. \u201cThese same criticisms were leveled against President Obama,\u201d said Buttigieg, noting that Obama received campaign contributions from corporate leaders, including many Wall Street executives. \u201cIf you think about with respect to Wall Street, he delivered the strongest regulations and accountability that there had been there in a generation.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, Buttigieg\u2019s embrace of conciliatory politics of the kind Obama employed in his first term risks turning off voters disappointed in the Republican-driven gridlock of the Obama era. HuffPost asked Buttigieg on Monday how he would navigate shepherding policy priorities through Congress even in an optimistic scenario where Democrats control the Senate thanks to conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u201cThis is the interesting thing \u2015 you look at a Joe Manchin, some of these kind of swing-state senators, their orientation may be moderate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pro-corporate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have trouble with a lot of moderate senators on the idea of paid family leave, for example, or making sure that the tax code is more beneficial to the working- and middle-class versus the very wealthy.\u201d Later that day, Buttigieg fielded a similar question from a voter at a town hall in Algona about how he would defend his policies from Republican attacks. He addressed the less favorable \u2015 and arguably more likely \u2015 scenario of a Congress that is at least partly controlled by Republicans. Buttigieg\u2019s proposed solution: Holding political rallies in the states and districts of lawmakers obstructing the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right? And when we\u2019re talking about a measure, that\u2019s not just a new policy and something that people support, even in a conservative area, I believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures \u2015 it would be good for their constituents and reminding their constituents what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. Perhaps fittingly, it was a tactic that Obama also tried. And notably, it didn\u2019t work.",

      "content": " Ukraine\u2019s president was preparing to announce a groundless investigation into Joe Biden on CNN \u2014 against his better judgment \u2014 but managed to duck out of it when Congress pressed Donald Trump to release military aid he was withholding, The New York Times reported. The last thing President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to do was become entangled in U.S. politics, the Times reported, but he was convinced that the only way he could finally get the appropriated $400 million in U.S. aid was to follow the president\u2019s instructions for announcing an investigation of Biden and his son, according to interviews with Kyiv government officials. If the money wasn\u2019t released by the end of the fiscal year in September, Ukraine risked losing it for good. Zelensky was determined to do what he had to do for the money, even though avoiding partisan U.S. politics was the \u201cfirst rule of Ukrainian foreign policy,\u201d the Times reported. Aides were arguing in favor of \u201cbowing to what was demanded,\u201d said Petro Burkovskiy, a senior fellow at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation with ties to Ukraine\u2019s government, according to the Times. But the \u201ccost was high,\u201d he added. Trump reportedly expected Zelensky to make a high-profile statement about launching an investigation of his 2020 presidential rival. A top U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,\u00a0William Taylor, testified before House members that Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s appointed ambassador to the European Union, told him the military aid was dependent on Zelensky making a \u201cpublic statement\u201d about initiating an investigation of Biden. Sondland said that \u201cPresident Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d Taylor testified. Zelensky agreed to an interview on CNN during which he was to reveal \u201cinvestigations that would have played into domestic political affairs,\u201d Taylor told lawmakers. But the military funds were released Sept. 11 after a congressional uproar, just two days before Zelensky was scheduled to appear on CNN. He quickly canceled, the Times reported. The Times story, as well as Taylor\u2019s \u2014 and others\u2019 \u2014 testimony sharply undercuts Trump\u2019s argument that there was no quid pro quo in his withholding of funds and his July 25 phone call pressing Zelensky for an investigation into Biden and his son. The president, however, is now saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with a quid pro quo using military aid to press Zelensky to investigate his political rival, which would predictably affect the 2020 U.S. presidential election. \u201cThe Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,\u201d Burkovskiy told the Times. \u201cThey were ready to do this.\u201d",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " House leaders on Friday released the closed-door testimony of Fiona Hill, the former White House foreign policy adviser, and Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who spoke to investigators last month as part of the impeachment\u00a0inquiry against President Donald Trump. Both Hill and Vindman raised concerns about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, saying that officials conditioned a White House meeting with Ukrainian leadership on whether or not the country launched an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. They specifically implicated acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. There was \u201cno ambiguity\u201d about what the Ukrainians would have to do to secure the meeting, Vindman said. Hill served as the White House\u2019s chief Russia adviser for about two years before quitting in July. Vindman is currently the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert and has firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that kicked off the impeachment proceedings. The transcripts are the seventh and eighth to be released as the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees\u00a0prepare to host the inquiry\u2019s first public hearings\u00a0next week with three State Department officials who have already spoken with investigators privately. In a statement, committee chairs Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said Hill and Vindman\u2019s \u201csuperiors in the White House have declined to cooperate with the inquiry, but transcripts released today show clearly that individuals close to the president were alarmed by a presidential scheme as illicit and corrupt as a \u2018drug deal.\u2019\u201d Following her deposition, Hill said she has been flooded with \u201chateful calls and conspiracy theories.\u201d Hill and her boss, Bolton, were reportedly so alarmed by Trump insiders\u2019 attempts to enact a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine that she alerted White House lawyers. Vindman, who previously reported to Hill, testified that he had also raised his concerns about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine internally. Additionally, Hill told investigators that she considered Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, to be a security risk. Sondland has emerged as a key figure in the impeachment proceedings as investigators exposed his role in Trump\u2019s apparent effort to convince Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. He acknowledged in his testimony \u2015 albeit through an addendum \u2015 that the pitch included a quid pro quo: In exchange for announcing an investigation into Trump\u2019s political rivals, Ukraine would receive nearly $400 million in military aid. Both officials also said Mulvaney helped coordinate the quid pro quo efforts. \u201cAmbassador Sondland, in front of the Ukrainians, as I came in, was talking about how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with investigations,\u201d Hill said. \u201c[Sondland] just said that he had had a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney, and this is what was required to get a meeting,\u201d Vindman said, according to the transcript. Text messages between Sondland, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor revealed tension surrounding relations with the country. Ukraine is considered essential to American national security due to its proximity to Russia. Although the president has denied that a quid pro quo was ever on the table, Taylor told House investigators during his private testimony that it undoubtedly was. The entire mess between Trump and Ukraine was brought to light thanks to a bombshell whistleblower report filed back in August. The whistleblower, who has remained anonymous, was alarmed by a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating the Bidens, saying his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani would be in touch. Details of Giuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy have\u00a0prompted deep concerns\u00a0on both sides of the aisle.\u00a0In private and on national news, Giuliani has pushed\u00a0unsubstantiated allegations that Hunter Biden was involved in corruption in Ukraine, and that Joe Biden pushed for a Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s firing in order to block an investigation into the corruption. Read Fiona Hill\u2019s and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s complete testimony below.\u00a0Highlights can be found here and here. Marina Fang contributed reporting.",

In a preview of an interview with CBS News, Haley, who served under Trump, said the president does not deserve impeachment, which she called \u201cthe death penalty for a public official.\u201d She pointed to the rough transcript of the phone call with\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s president in which Trump pressured him to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son while Trump was withholding military aid. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president,\u201d Haley insisted. Comparing the loss of a life to the loss of a job for corruption apparently got to Legend, who responded on Twitter that Haley seemed like a \u201cvery bright person.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cnot the death penalty,\u201d Legend wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s firing him [Trump] from the most important job in the country because he can\u2019t be trusted with it. Real people are actually sentenced to death. This is not that.\u201d He called on Haley to own up to the fact that Trump is not \u201cmorally or intellectually fit for office.\u201d It was a big political day for Legend. He also took a stand in a Miami-Dade County courtroom Friday where he celebrated with 18 people with past felony convictions whose voting rights were restored. It was also a big day for Haley, who was trending on Twitter because of attacks by critics for both her death penalty stumble and assertions on CBS that Trump shouldn\u2019t be impeached because he failed get what he wanted: Ukraine didn\u2019t launch a Biden investigation because Trump couldn\u2019t pull it off. The New York Times reported Thursday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had actually scheduled an interview on CNN to announce the Biden investigation \u2014 though he was opposed to the baseless probe \u2014 because it was the only way he believed he could get the military aid that Trump was withholding. He was saved from making that announcement because Congress learned of the undelivered funds and pressed the White House to provide them, the Times reported. Critics got a charge out of Haley\u2019s definition of innocence.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded to critics characterizing her presidential campaign as \u201cangry\u201d by saying they\u2019re right. \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,\u201d she said in a campaign fundraising email sent Friday. \u201cIt makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d The 2020 hopeful appeared to be hitting back at one of her Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden, who asserted in a recent Medium post\u00a0that Warren is emblematic of \u201can angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.\u201d \u201cWell, I am angry and I own it,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cI\u2019m angry on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump\u2019s government, our rigged economy, and business as usual.\u201d The skirmish began at the start of the month when Warren said in Iowa that Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d The remark was spurred by his skepticism of her more than $20 trillion \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. In Biden\u2019s essay published online Tuesday, he did not name Warren, but made clear he was responding to her remark. \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.\u201d Biden, who has proposed expanding the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, went on to make his case for the plan, stating it is among \u201cthe most progressive, transformational ideas in this campaign \u2015 and I can get them done.\u201d \u201cMy health care plan expands coverage, lowers costs, lowers drug costs, allows people to keep their private insurance and won\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best plan.\u201d When his plan was unveiled in July, Biden noted that it would cover\u00a0\u201cmore than an estimated 97 percent of Americans,\u201d meaning roughly 10 million people could end up without insurance. Warren says her universal coverage proposal would be funded through hiking taxes on businesses and the rich, though its enormous price tag has raised doubts over her assurance that it won\u2019t impact the middle class. Biden\u2019s campaign has dismissed the plan as a work of \u201cmathematical gymnastics.\u201d",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " It wasn\u2019t Donald Trump who released the promised military aid to Ukraine, but the State Department, after lawyers determined that the White House freeze on the funds was illegal, several sources have told Bloomberg. Trump has claimed he released the aid on September 11. But five sources told Bloomberg that $141 million of the money was actually authorized to be released several days earlier after lawyers determined that the White House Office of Management and Budget and, therefore, the president, had no legal standing to block the funds. The decision was outlined in a classified memo to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to Bloomberg. The information severely undercuts Trump\u2019s insistence that there was no quid pro quo for military aid when he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Trump has pointed to the fact that he released the aid before a probe was begun. But Bloomberg now reports that Trump was no longer in control of disbursement when the money was released. Officials have testified before House lawmakers that the aid \u2014 amounting to a total of some $400 million \u2014 was linked to Zelensky bowing to Trump\u2019s demands. The New York Times has reported\u00a0that Zelensky had already scheduled an interview on CNN in September to announce the launch of the investigation \u2014 even though he was opposed to it \u2014 in order to obtain the much needed funding. When the money was released, Zelensky quickly dropped the CNN appearance and did not begin a probe, according to the Times. The OMB \u2014 headed by Mick Mulvaney, who is also the acting White House chief of staff \u2014 continues to argue that distribution of the funds, which had been approved by Congress, was up to the agency.\u00a0\u201cAt no point was this pause inappropriate, let alone illegal,\u201d OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel told Bloomberg Saturday. Officials supporting Ukraine feared that if the money was not disbursed by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, it would likely no longer be available. Trump has claimed he was the one who decided to release the money after a plea from Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor testified that it was the legal offices at the both the State and Defense departments that decided they were \u201cgoing to move forward with this assistance \u2014 OMB notwithstanding.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve ever done that before,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis was a big decision for them.\u201d Mulvaney has emerged in testimony as a key player in Trump\u2019s strategy to involve Ukraine in American politics by pressing the nation to launch an investigation into the president\u2019s rival, which would likely impact the 2020 election. Last month Mulvaney said at a press conference that the military aid was part of a quid pro quo for Ukraine\u2019s investigation, and that such negotiations are done all the time. \u201cGet over it,\u201d he told reporters. But such foreign policy negotiations are supposed to benefit the nation \u2014 and not to mobilize a foreign power to help a president win an American election.",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " The House Intelligence Committee has evidence that shows that President Donald Trump engaged in an \u201cextortion scheme\u201d to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a Democratic member of the committee said Sunday. The committee member, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d that the impeachment inquiry into Trump warrants advancement following the private testimonies of multiple witnesses. \u201cWe have enough evidence from the depositions that we\u2019ve done to warrant bringing this forward \u2015 evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president\u2019s opponent,\u201d Swalwell said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced last week that the first of several public hearings in the impeachment inquiry will take place Nov. 13 and Nov. 15. The first three people scheduled to testify publicly are Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; Marie Yovanovitch, whom Taylor replaced after Trump recalled her; and George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the president has due process,\u201d Swalwell said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both Republicans and Democrats. The president is going to get that.\u201d \u201cThis is America and we don\u2019t just have railroading of justice,\u201d he continued. \u201cThese witnesses should come public and, you know, the American people should judge for themselves, as well as we will, as to what happened here.\u201d Like Swalwell, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, used the term \u201cextortion\u201d rather than \u201cquid pro quo\u201d on Sunday to describe Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cI have two problems with \u2018quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Himes told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cNumber one: When you are trying to persuade the American people of something really pretty simple, which is that the president acted criminally and extorted \u2014 in the way a mob boss would extort somebody \u2014 a vulnerable foreign country, it\u2019s probably best not to use Latin words to explain it,\u201d he said. The second point, he added, is that \u201cextortion doesn\u2019t require a \u2018you give me this and I\u2019ll give you that\u2019 kind of quid pro quo. It simply requires using your muscle to get something that you don\u2019t have a right to.\u201d Though Republicans are united in defending Trump against the ongoing impeachment inquiry, their strategies for doing so have differed.\u00a0Some are saying there wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo. Others, like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), say it doesn\u2019t matter, even if there was. On Sunday, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he believes it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d but \u201cnot impeachable\u201d for Trump to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley echoed that sentiment in an interview published Sunday in The Washington Post. She said she opposes Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine but said she doesn\u2019t believe his actions were impeachable. Trump appeared to take issue with the latest Republican talking point about impeachment, tweeting Sunday that members of his party shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe led into the fools trap\u201d of describing his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cnot perfect\u201d but also \u201cnot impeachable.\u201d \u201cNOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!\u201d he wrote. This story has been updated with comments from additional lawmakers as well as Trump\u2019s tweet.",

      "content": " Cindy McCain, wife of late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said that her husband would have been deeply troubled by the current state of American politics as Republicans continue to defend President Donald Trump against a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. \u201cI think he would be disgusted with some of the stuff that\u2019s going on,\u201d she\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Axelrod in an interview that aired Saturday. \u201cI really do. I think he\u2019d be, he\u2019d be railing against what\u2019s going on.\u201d When the senator was alive, she argued, he made it possible for other GOP lawmakers to stand up to Trump rather than having to stay in line for fear of losing support back home. \u201cI think John provided a lot of cover for other members, and when he would do it, they could get behind him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing a real rudder in the Senate right now in all this.\u201d John McCain died at age 81 in 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Though a staunch critic of Trump, the so-called maverick was known for his friendships on both sides of the aisle, and was often able to overcome partisanship in an effort to get things done. At times, that included breaking with his own party, a seemingly unthinkable act for today\u2019s GOP hardliners. In August \u2015 weeks before Democrats launched their impeachment probe \u2015 Cindy McCain told CNN that before her husband died, he expressed that \u201che was very frustrated with what was going on,\u201d regarding the overall division in Washington. In her latest interview, she took issue with Trump\u2019s effort to push unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son, calling the former vice president a \u201clovely man\u201d and saying that it\u2019s unnecessary \u201cto disparage anyone that\u2019s running just because you disagree with them.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to malign Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has become central to impeachment proceedings as Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to launch an investigation into the Bidens. Meanwhile, American military aid to the country was being withheld, raising concerns of a quid pro quo. However, Trump and his Republican allies have vehemently denied any shady dealings. While Cindy McCain sympathized with politicians\u2019 concerns about getting reelected if they go against Trump, \u201cat some point, you have to do what you were elected to do and that is represent the country as well as your local people,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he would be terribly upset by this whole thing,\u201d she added, referring to her husband. \u201cHe was upset before he died, he saw what was going on. ...\u00a0Like all of us, I wish he were here. We need him more than ever.\u201d",

      "content": " Anthony Scaramucci is pulling no punches as the House prepares to open its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s behavior to the public, calling his former boss a \u201ctraitor\u201d in his latest break with the administration. The short-lived White House communications director spoke with CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter on Sunday, issuing a prediction that the American people would soon see Trump with a whole new light as the impeachment inquiry moves into the public domain later this week. \u201cThere will be other elements of this story that unfold where people say: \u2018OK, wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Scaramucci said on Stelter\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d program. \u201cThere\u2019s a combination of incompetence, there\u2019s a combination of the destruction of the executive branch of the United States, in addition to the lawlessness and traitorous like behavior.\u201d \u201cTraitorous-like behavior?\u201d Stelter asked. \u201cOh there\u2019s no question,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong word,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cWhat word would you use?\u201d Scaramucci replied. \u201cYou\u2019re on the phone with the president of the Ukraine and you\u2019re strongarming him to go after your political opponent. You become a traitor to the Constitution and a traitor to the laws of the United States. You want to pretend that it\u2019s not traitorous behavior? We can pretend that it isn\u2019t and we can continue to gaslight.\u201d The House voted late last month, largely along party lines, to formalize the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine. During the discussion on July 25, the president repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. A parade of former and current administration officials have linked the demand to the release of military aid to Ukraine, painting it as a clear push for a quid pro quo. Trump has rejected the notion that his behavior was untoward, repeatedly calling the call \u201cperfect\u201d while lambasting his Democratic critics. Republicans, on the other hand, have largely stayed silent or gone on the airwaves to vocally defend Trump and cast the probe as yet another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d meant to overturn the results of the 2016 election. Scaramucci served just 11 days in the administration before he was fired in July 2017, but spent the intervening years vocally defending Trump on television and supporting his controversial policies. That changed earlier this year as the pair began exchanging barbs, with Scaramucci calling the president a \u201cjackass\u201d and a \u201cpaper tiger.\u201d \u201cThe negatives of Trump\u2019s demagoguery now clearly outweigh the positives of his leadership, and it is imperative that Americans unite to prevent him from serving another four years in office,\u201d Scaramucci wrote in a blistering op-ed in August. He continued that criticism on Sunday, and said he was \u201cjust shocked that [Republicans] would put their partisan interest and their self-preservation to stay in power over the law.\u201d \u201cAs he continues to gaslight, we have to call him into account for what is actually going on,\u201d Scaramucci said of Trump. \u201cNo, this is full-blown traitorous activity, and once it gets exposed, then it\u2019ll be up to the American people.\u201d",

In\u00a0his opening remarks\u00a0to the House Intelligence Committee, Taylor said one of his staff members told him just last week about a conversation he had with Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland the day after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor said the staff member was at a restaurant with Sondland, who had donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee and was appointed to his envoy role by the president, when Sondland called Trump on July 26. The staff member could hear Trump ask about \u201cthe investigations,\u201d according to Taylor. He said Sondland told Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. \u201cFollowing the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cAmbassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.\u201d Taylor suggested the House Intelligence Committee is following up on his staff member\u2019s revelation. The aide is David Holmes,\u00a0counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, according to\u00a0NBC News and CBS News. The Intelligence Committee on Wednesday announced that he is scheduled to testify behind closed doors on Friday. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham shrugged off Taylor\u2019s new information about Trump\u2019s alleged call with Sondland, calling it \u201chearsay.\u201d \u201cThe latest \u2018evidence\u2019 is an anonymous staffer who told someone he overheard someone else talking to POTUS on the phone,\u201d Grisham said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cAll the \u2018evidence\u2019 in this case is hearsay.\u201d At a news conference later on Wednesday, Trump said he didn\u2019t recall speaking with Sondland after his call with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cI know nothing about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve heard it. ... I don\u2019t recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.\u201d Taylor\u2019s revelation about Trump\u2019s call with Sondland came during the first day of public hearings in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, specifically his efforts to get Zelensky to commit to investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, were the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed in August and are now the centerpiece of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Sondland, who had no foreign policy experience prior to becoming ambassador, initially testified on Oct. 17 during a closed-door session before House investigators that he couldn\u2019t recall having any discussions about Biden or taking part in any campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate him. But Sondland significantly altered his story on Nov. 5 after Taylor and Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman contradicted his claims in their depositions. In his amended testimony, Sondland acknowledged that he was involved in Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government. He is slated to publicly testify in the impeachment inquiry on Nov. 20. This story has been updated with Trump comments. Antonia Blumberg contributed reporting.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in\u00a0the House impeachment hearings\u00a0over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as\u00a0the U.S. withheld military aid\u00a0from the country. What\u2019s ahead on the impeachment schedule:  More Witnesses The House intelligence committee, which is conducting the impeachment hearings, has set a packed schedule of open hearings over the next week. On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch,\u00a0who was ousted in May at Trump\u2019s direction. She\u00a0told lawmakers\u00a0in a closed-door deposition last month that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d against her as Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed for probes of Democrat Joe Biden and other political opponents. Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who said he raised concerns in the White House about Trump\u2019s push for investigations; Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s European Union ambassador, who spoke to the president about the Ukraine policy; and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s concerns about Ukraine. All witnesses testifying this week and next have already spoken to investigators in closed depositions, some of them for 10 hours or more.  Back Behind Closed Doors Though those private depositions are largely done, Democrats have scheduled two more for this week \u2014 at the same time they are conducting the open hearings. Democrats have scheduled a closed-door session with David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, for Friday. An official familiar with the matter said Holmes is the person Taylor referred to in his testimony on Wednesday when he said an aide had overheard a conversation between Sondland and Trump in July about Ukraine conducting investigations. They have also scheduled a Saturday deposition with Mark Sandy, an official at the Office of Management and Budget. Sandy is one of several OMB officials who have been invited by the committee to appear as lawmakers try to find out more about the military aid that was withheld. So far, none of those officials has shown up for their depositions as Trump has instructed his administration not to cooperate. While the open hearings are being conducted by the intelligence panel, the closed-door hearings have been held by the intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees.  Headed To Judiciary The public hearings are expected to last at least another week. After that, the three committees will submit a report to the Judiciary panel, which will oversee the impeachment process. Judiciary is expected to hold its own hearings and, eventually, vote on articles of impeachment. Democrats say they are still deciding whether to write them. Next would come a floor vote, and if articles of impeachment are approved by the House, there would then be a Senate trial. House Democrats are hoping to finish the process by the end of the year. A Senate trial, if called for, would likely come in 2020. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 If there\u2019s one thing Democrats and Republicans both agree on with the impeachment hearings, it\u2019s this: There\u2019s a certain inevitability to them. Democrats will bring forward many of the same witnesses they have already deposed for hours, to repeat testimony they already took, only to have Republicans focus only on the most exculpatory details while disregarding the mountains of incriminating evidence that President Donald Trump sought to influence U.S. elections with foreign help \u2015 even dangling nearly $400 million in security aid to entice the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his son. And at the end of these hearings, after we\u2019ve heard hours of testimony that is obviously damning, the House will hold a vote it already held, to a similar, near-party-line result. The inevitability doesn\u2019t mean the hearings aren\u2019t important. We may have a really strong idea of what will come out in these televised inquisitions, and that none of it will matter with Republicans, but Democrats see the hearings as a chance to educate the public. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that, in a jury trial, you don\u2019t just hand the jurors transcripts, right?\u201d Democrat Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told HuffPost. \u201cYou get to see the person. So much of our language is communicated nonverbally.\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said the more voters see these public hearings, the better it would be for Democrats to make the case to impeach Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s value in actually having these folks tell the story to the American people,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cThere\u2019s value in having the country tune in and see these preposterous Republican claims contrasted by these unimpeachable witnesses who are just doing their patriotic duty and telling the truth.\u201d And Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said the hearings would be an opportunity for normal people to contrast serious-minded witnesses with \u201cthe conspiracy theories that the Trump defenders are offering.\u201d He added that voters would see \u201ccareer professionals, who obviously know what they\u2019re talking about, who are not political, who are not arm-waving \u2018Never Trumpers,\u2019 but just speaking the truth.\u201d While Republicans certainly don\u2019t see these hearings moving the needle on public opinion the same way Democrats anticipate, they were happy to charge that the hearings were more about putting on a show than finding new facts. Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), who sits on the Intelligence Committee and was also once Trump\u2019s pick to be director of national intelligence before Ratcliffe withdrew from consideration, said he didn\u2019t mind telling HuffPost that \u201cthe House Democrats already made up their mind.\u201d \u201cI think they had before all this started that they plan to impeach this president,\u201d Ratcliffe continued. When we countered that Republicans also seemed to have made up their minds that they wouldn\u2019t impeach Trump, Ratcliffe agreed. \u201cYeah, I think so, because we\u2019ve seen all the evidence,\u201d he said. And when you confront Republicans like Ratcliffe with the evidence, that Trump clearly pressured a foreign government to open an investigation into a political opponent, they will argue there is nothing wrong with that. \u201cHe is the unitary executive, so he is vested with that authority to open or close investigations where there is a prima facie case of anything,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cAnd so, if he believes there\u2019s a prima facie case of corruption, he has the ability to pursue that.\u201d (Ratcliffe kept using the Latin term \u201cprima facie,\u201d a legal term that literally translates to \u201cat first face.\u201d) For the record, as the Federal Election Commission chairwoman recently reminded all candidates, it is illegal to solicit campaign help from foreign governments. And Trump conditioning security aid appropriated by Congress on Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden actually borders on extortion, former federal prosecutors note. Republicans were also happy to charge that, if the hearings were a show, it was a bad one for Democrats. \u201cI saw a lot of the reporters yawning and looking at the ceiling,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who watched the hearing from the audience section, said Wednesday. \u201cTalk about laying an egg,\u201d Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said of Democrats. And fellow Arizona Republican Paul Gosar told HuffPost that Democrats hadn\u2019t \u201cmoved anybody\u201d on the Republican side. \u201cAnd with that kind of testimony, that was hardly compelling for the other side,\u201d he said. The word \u201cboring\u201d got tossed around a lot on conservative Twitter feeds, with Eric Trump tweeting that it was a #SnoozeFest. That prompted \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah to facetiously quote-tweet Trump with, \u201cGood point. Article 6, Section 2 of the Constitution clearly states that a President can\u2019t be impeached for crimes that don\u2019t excite his third-favorite child.\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) recounted that Noah tweet to reporters Wednesday night when he was asked about the right-wing charges that the hearing was \u201cboring.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry if, you know, we didn\u2019t entertain them, but that wasn\u2019t the goal for today,\u201d Swalwell said. Still, for a hearing that was largely for the edification of the American people rather than to discover new facts, the entertainment value of these hearings isn\u2019t an entirely unfair measure. In a normal world, it would be stunning news that an ambassador was told that \u201ceverything\u201d \u2015 meaning a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president, as well as the $400 million in military aid \u2015 was contingent on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing an investigation into the energy company that once employed Hunter Biden. More to the point, the hearing actually did include a new bombshell not included in the released transcripts. William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said an aide had recently told him he overheard Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on the phone with Trump. The president was heard asking about \u201cthe investigations,\u201d Taylor said. The implication is that Trump was even more actively involved in the quid pro quo than previously known \u2015 and that Sondland was even less truthful in his already-amended testimony. In a fit of congressional drama \u2015 where \u201cdrama\u201d is usually measured by someone using a swear on the House floor \u2015 the Intelligence Committee announced during the hearing Wednesday that it would hear directly from that aide who overheard the conversation. Swalwell pointed to those new discoveries when HuffPost asked if Democrats were just forced to \u201cplay out the string\u201d with these impeachment hearings, and he thought the display could move polling and put pressure on Republicans. \u201cTheir job title is \u2018representative,\u2019 right?\u201d he asked. \u201cTheir constituents will be watching.\u201d And yet, the developments seemed to barely register in a new media landscape where Trump can make headlines with tweets before breakfast. NBC News claimed\u00a0the hearing lacked \u201cpizazz.\u201d Reuters summed it up\u00a0as \u201cconsequential, but dull.\u201d One of the most moderate Republicans left in Congress, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, didn\u2019t seem to be feeling any new pressure after the first day of hearings. In fact, he thought it would be moderate Democrats who would be struggling more than the few moderates on his side. \u201cFor some of the Democrats, the inquiry vote was easier than impeachment,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. The only Independent in Congress, Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party in July partly over the GOP\u2019s fealty to Trump, told HuffPost that Democrats needed to steer these hearings more toward the damning facts and less toward partisan policy disputes. He was particularly concerned with how much time Democrats spent on establishing how important the security aid was for Ukraine. \u201cThat plays into the Republican argument that it\u2019s just a policy dispute, there are just some bureaucrats who disagree with the president on policy and that\u2019s all it is,\u201d Amash said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s not what actually happened. But Democrats sort of played into that with the testimony, or at least the order of the questioning.\u201d Part of the reason Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spent so much time on the importance of the aid was because the two witnesses underscored it themselves in their opening statements \u2015 and because Taylor actually suggested at one point that Ukrainians might have died because the United States had delayed that aid. Taylor eventually walked that claim back a bit, ultimately noting that the aid helped Ukraine fight Russia and that Ukrainian soldiers were dying each week in that conflict, but the discussion eventually led to Republicans noting the lack of aid under President Barack Obama. Democrats understand they are in a different world, where Republicans can make bad-faith arguments, or mislead, or simply bring up conspiracy theories as a response to a clear case of the president breaking the law. But they don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any novel way to respond, other than to just proceed with their hearings and their impeachment vote. When we asked Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who sits on the Intelligence Committee and perhaps had the most viral moment of the first day, whether Democrats should consider using more of the GOP playbook, he became thoughtful. \u201cThis actually is a very serious question, it\u2019s not just a tactical question,\u201d Welch said. \u201cShould we imitate their approach? The serious dilemma we face in a democracy is that there is a shattering of norms. And you need norms, and you need some mutual respect, in order to sustain a democracy.\u201d Welch said one of the clearest examples of the \u201cshattering of norms\u201d on impeachment was when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference in which he essentially admitted there was a quid pro quo and advised Democrats to \u201cget over it.\u201d \u201cIf we go to those tactics, a) we lose. But, b) we will be accelerating the deterioration of the norms and trust that we need to sustain a democracy,\u201d Welch said.",

The newly released memorandum of the call contradicts the official White House readout released to the press\u00a0at the time, which said that Trump urged Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to \u201cto implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.\u201d The April 21 conversation was instead short and mostly congratulatory; Zelensky said he was grateful for the call and accepted Trump\u2019s invitation to visit the White House. It is strikingly different from the following July 25 call between the two leaders that has become the focus of the House impeachment inquiry, in which Trump repeatedly brought up the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden, his political rival. \u201cI think you will do a great job. I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you,\u201d Trump told Zelensky on the April call. There was no mention of eliminating corruption in Ukraine in their conversation, even though Trump and his allies have frequently cited the president\u2019s supposed concern about corruption as one of the reasons he held up military aid to the country. Trump did, however, tout his former ownership of the international Miss Universe beauty pageant. \u201cWhen I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine was always very well represented,\u201d he told Zelensky. The April 21 conversation took place shortly before Biden announced his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on April 25. The first call was marked unclassified by the White House. The second call, however, was marked classified and, in an unusual move, its summary transcript was moved to a highly classified server with restricted access. During the second public impeachment hearing on Friday, Rep.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Transcripts released Saturday in the impeachment inquiry show Ambassador Gordon Sondland playing a central role in President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to push Ukraine to conduct political investigations as a condition for receiving needed military aid. The fresh details come from hundreds of pages of testimony released by House investigators from Tim Morrison, a former top official at the National Security Council. They contradict much of the ambassador\u2019s own testimony behind closed doors. Both Morrison and Sondland are expected to testify publicly before the House next week. While some, including Trump himself, have begun to question Sondland\u2019s knowledge of events, Morrison said the ambassador \u201crelated to me he was acting \u2014 he was discussing these matters with the President.\u201d Morrison, a longtime Republican defense hawk in Washington, largely confirmed testimony from current and former officials testifying in the impeachment inquiry. But his account also provided new insight on what others have called a shadow diplomacy being run by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, often at odds with U.S. national security interests. As Sondland, Giuliani and others tried to persuade new Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch the investigations Trump wanted of his Democratic rivals, Morrison said he \u201ctried to stay away.\u201d Morrison called this the Burisma \u201cbucket,\u201d and it included investigations into the family of one of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic rivals, Joe Biden, and the role of Democrats in the 2016 election. It\u2019s a reference to the gas company in Ukraine where Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board In particular Morrison described a meeting Sondland held with a top Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, on the sidelines of a summit in Warsaw. Morrison said he witnessed the exchange and that afterward Sondland bounded across the room to tell him what was said. Sondland told him that \u201cwhat could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,\u201d Morrison testified. The prosecutor general is Ukraine\u2019s top legal official. \u201cMy concern was what Gordon was proposing about getting the Ukrainians pulled into our politics,\u201d Morrison said. He added: \u201cIt was the first time something like this had been injected as a condition on the release of the assistance.\u201d Morrison, who announced Oct. 30 he would be stepping down from the NSC, was brought to the White House by then-national security adviser John Bolton. Testimony from Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, also raised new questions about how much Pence knew about the alleged trade-off that\u2019s central to the impeachment inquiry. Impeachment investigators met Saturday with a White House official directly connected to Trump\u2019s block on military aid to Ukraine, the first budget office witness to testify in the historic inquiry. In the rare weekend session, lawmakers drilled into Trump\u2019s decision, against the advice of national security advisers, including Bolton, to withhold funding from the ally, a young democracy bordering hostile Russia. \u201cIt seems clear to me from everything that I\u2019ve seen that the president had no interest in the defense of the Ukraine and the security of the Ukrainian people,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., during a break in the closed-door proceedings. Raskin said it\u2019s important for lawmakers \u201cto trace the bureaucratic steps\u201d that allowed money Congress had already approved to be held up by the executive branch. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of chasing that down,\u201d he said. The witness Saturday was Mark Sandy, a little-known career official at the Office of Management and Budget who was involved in key meetings about the nearly $400 million aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine. Sandy\u2019s name had barely come up in previous testimony. But it did on one particular date: July 25, the day of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy. That day, a legal document with Sandy\u2019s signature directed a freeze of the security funds, according to testimony from Defense Department official Laura Cooper. Investigators had shown her a document as evidence. Trump on the call had asked Zelenskiy for a \u201cfavor,\u201d to conduct an investigation into Biden and his son. The link between Trump\u2019s call and the White House\u2019s holding back of security aid is the central question in the impeachment inquiry. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it \u201cbribery.\u201d Trump, who says he only wanted to root out corruption in Ukraine, says he did nothing wrong. The weeks that followed sent officials in the U.S. national security and foreign service apparatus scrambling to understand why the aid was being blocked, despite their consensus view that Zelenskiy needed the money as a show of U.S. support for his new government facing down President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. \u201cWe were trying to get to the bottom of why this hold was in place, why OMB was applying this hold,\u201d Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, told investigators. He is scheduled to testify publicly on Tuesday. Bolton derided the swap as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d he wanted no part of, according to closed-door testimony from Fiona Hill, the former White House Russia expert. She is set to appear Thursday. Sharpening the arguments, both sides are preparing for an intense lineup of public hearings in the coming week. Americans are deeply split over impeachment, much as they are over the president himself. For Ukraine, a former Soviet republic situated between NATO-allies and Russia, the $391 million in aid is its lifeline to the West. The money is symbolic, the ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified this week, but also substantial. It includes $250 million in Pentagon funding for military hardware: sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection, secure communications, night vision capabilities and military medical aid. An additional $141 million in State Department funding covers many of those systems as well as about $10 million to increase maritime awareness and $16.5 million for maritime security in the Black Sea, aimed at identifying and tracking Russian ships and aircraft. \u201cSupporting Ukraine is the right thing to do,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cIf Russia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its territory and influence.\u201d Sandy was the first official from the Office of Management and Budget to defy Trump\u2019s instructions not to testify. Like others, he received a subpoena to appear. \u201cWhen people come in, we learn more,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swawell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, as he arrived for Saturday\u2019s session. Rep. Mark Meadows, a top Trump ally, said he did not expect to hear much from Sandy, a career budget official. \u201cAll I expect him to say is he doesn\u2019t know why the aid was held and wished that he did,\u201d said Meadows, R-N.C. \u201cBut I may be surprised.\u201d In a speech Friday night, Attorney General William Barr said congressional Democrats were pursuing \u201cscores of parallel investigations through an avalanche of subpoenas\u201d that are \u201cdesigned to incapacitate the executive branch.\u201d Barr, who favors an expansive view of executive power, said \u201cthe cost of this constant harassment is real.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the impeachment panel, returned home Saturday to California where thousands of Democratic activists greeted him like a rock star at the state party\u2019s fall convention. \u201cIt\u2019s been an eventful week,\u201d he told the crowd before saying that his remarks about impeachment were no cause for celebration. \u201cThere is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who thinks that he is above the law,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is a time of great peril.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Kathleen Ronayne in Long Beach, California, contributed to this report.",

      "content": " South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has gained 16 percentage points since September to rocket to the top of a new Iowa poll, making him the current front-runner ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely encouraging,\u201d Buttigieg told reporters Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve felt a lot of momentum on the ground. At the same time, there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Among likely Democratic Iowa caucus participants, Buttigieg is the first choice for president, taking 25%, according to the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey.\u00a0Rivals Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are all in contention for second place, about 10 percentage points behind Buttigieg. Warren was in first place in September with 22% backing her, but has slipped to 16%, according to the Des Moines Register. Biden and Sanders currently both stand at 15%. \u201cThis is the first poll that shows Buttigieg as a stand-alone front-runner,\u201d J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll, told the Register. \u201cThere have been four candidates that have sort of jostled around in a pack together, but he has a sizable lead over the nearest contender \u2014\u00a09 points. So this is a new status for him.\u201d Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0(D-Minn.) is next closest to the top group in the latest poll with 6% backing. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang all scored 3%. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who only recently expressed an interest in running, has 2%. Among those surveyed, 5% are not sure who they\u2019ll pick. The front-runner in Iowa has switched a number of times in the poll in the past months. It\u2019s the first time Buttigieg has led the survey. But just 30% of likely caucus participants \u2014 compared to 20% in September \u2014 now say they\u2019ve made up their mind and are unlikely to switch their selection. A Monmouth poll earlier this week found Buttigieg rising into the state\u2019s crowded top tier of front-runners. The Feb. 3 caucuses, the first of the Democratic contests, can serve as an early kingmaker by rocketing a candidate ahead of the pack for extra exposure before state primaries. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucus participants was conducted Nov. 8-13 using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cellphones, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart at the center of Congress\u2019 impeachment investigation was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d an aide to Vice President Mike Pence told lawmakers, according to a transcript released on Saturday. Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy aide to Pence who was listening to the call on July 25, testified that Trump\u2019s insistence that Ukraine carry out politically sensitive investigations \u201cstruck me as unusual and inappropriate.\u201d She said the discussion was \u201cmore political in nature\u201d than phone calls with other foreign leaders, and included what she viewed as specific references to the president\u2019s \u201cpersonal political agenda.\u201d Trump\u2019s call is at the heart of the Democratic-led inquiry into whether the Republican president misused U.S. foreign policy to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his potential opponents in the 2020 election. The House of Representatives on Saturday also released a transcript of an earlier closed-door deposition by Tim Morrison, a former White House aide with the National Security Council focusing on Europe and Russia policy, who was also on the call. Morrison, who resigned a day before his deposition last month, and Williams both expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Williams and Morrison are scheduled to testify publicly next week. \u201cI was not comfortable with any idea that President Zelenskiy should allow himself to be involved in our politics,\u201d Morrison told lawmakers. He also said found Zelenskiy\u2019s tone in the call with Trump to be \u201cobsequious.\u201d Morrison declined to say he thought the call was illegal or improper, stressing instead that he thought it would leak, damaging relations with Ukraine. He said he only learned later that the aid to Ukraine was conditioned on the investigations. In the first public hearing last week, acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor pointed to Trump\u2019s keen interest in getting the eastern European ally to investigate Biden and reiterated his understanding that $391 million in U.S. security aid was withheld from Kiev unless it cooperated. Morrison said he had reviewed Taylor\u2019s testimony and did not dispute it on any significant points. House investigators on Saturday also heard closed-door testimony from a White House budget official about the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy, a career official of the Office of Management and Budget, was the first person from OMB to testify before the inquiry after three political appointees defied congressional subpoenas to appear. Sandy spoke about how unusual it was to have a political appointee come in and place a hold on military aid to Ukraine, CNN quoted a source familiar with the testimony as saying. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judiciary and Oversight Committees, said Sandy was brought in to shed light on whether military aid was held up for political reasons. \u201cThis is a technical part of our investigation,\u201d Raskin told reporters outside the interview room. \u201cWe want to know exactly how the president translated his political objective to shake down the Ukrainian government for the favors he wanted (into) the budget process.\u201d  On Friday, Trump used Twitter to criticize a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, while she was testifying to an impeachment hearing, an extraordinary moment that Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation. Trump defended his attack on Yovanovitch, saying he had the right to free speech. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, testified on the second day of televised impeachment hearings, which will resume next week. While Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony dominated headlines on Friday, a closed-door deposition later in the day with David Holmes, a U.S. embassy official in Kiev, could prove more consequential. Holmes told lawmakers he overheard a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about Ukraine\u2019s willingness to carry out investigations of Biden and his son. The phone call occurred on July 26, one day after the now-infamous phone conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy. \u201cSo, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u201d Trump asked Sondland, referring to Zelenskiy, according to Holmes\u2019 testimony. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d replied Sondland, adding the Ukrainian president would do \u201canything you ask him to,\u201d according to Holmes. The testimony by Holmes, an aide to Taylor, ties Trump more directly to a pressure campaign in Ukraine to investigate the Bidens led by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Holmes\u2019 statement appears to contradict Sondland\u2019s previous sworn testimony about his interactions with Trump, in which he did not mention his July 26 phone call with the president. Sondland, who has already revised his testimony once, is scheduled to testify publicly on Wednesday. Morrison said he understood that Sondland and Trump had spoken \u201chalf a dozen times\u201d between mid-July and mid-September, adding that he, National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials viewed Sondland\u2019s involvement as \u201ca problem.\u201d Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Saturday that House leaders were considering bringing Holmes in for a public hearing.

Virtually no progress has been made on the issue. On Thursday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency threatened the Democratic presidential candidate after he criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy and called Kim a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d \u201cAnyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea], can never spare the DPRK\u2019s merciless punishment whoever and wherever,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd he will be made to see even in a grave what horrible consequences will be brought about by his thoughtless utterances.\u201d The agency continued, \u201cRabid dogs like Biden can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,\u201d adding that the former vice president\u2019s demise would \u201cbe beneficial for the U.S. also.\u201d Hitting back at the remarks, Biden\u2019s campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates\u00a0told The Associated Press that it was a sign of Kim\u2019s fear of the 2020 hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and \u2018love\u2019 them, find Joe Biden threatening,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests and values at the heart of our foreign policy.\u201d Unlike North Korea\u2019s treatment of Biden, its regime has praised Trump, including after the ouster of former national security adviser John Bolton. Following Bolton\u2019s departure in September, Kim Myong Gil, North Korea\u2019s chief negotiator for denuclearization talks, reportedly applauded Trump\u2019s \u201cmore practical point of view\u201d in pushing out the \u201ctroublemaker who used to face everything out of his anachronistic way of thinking.\u201d Trump has also spoken highly of Kim in the past, referring to the dictator as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d whose country has \u201ca tremendous future.\u201d",

I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.\u201d The majority of marijuana users do not go on to use other, more dangerous substances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the agency said more research is needed to determine whether it is a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d Scientists\u00a0have not yet found solid evidence of marijuana leading people to harder drugs more so than other readily available substances like alcohol or tobacco. Support for legalizing marijuana has grown steadily over recent decades \u2015 according to a Gallup poll conducted last month, two-thirds of Americans favor such a policy. Medical use of the drug has been legalized in a majority of the 50 states, and in 11 of them and the District of Columbia recreational use is also permitted. But use and possession of marijuana remains illegal under federal law (even as enforcement of those prohibitions has become more lax). Biden said he supported marijuana use for medical purposes, as well as leaving it to individual states to decide whether to legalize recreational cannabis. \u201cStates should be able to make a judgment to legalize marijuana,\u201d Biden said at the town hall. Most of Biden\u2019s rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary race have said they would push to legalize marijuana on the federal level if elected president, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Bernie Sanders\u00a0(Vt.). Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who would become majority leader if Democrats win control of the chamber next year, also supports decriminalizing cannabis on the federal level. Biden has faced criticism over his record of advocating laws that helped fuel the war against drugs and mass incarceration, including the controversial 1994 crime bill. That measure led to much harsher sentences for use and possession of an array of drugs, including marijuana, causing the U.S. prison population to balloon. Minority communities were hit especially hard by the crackdown.",

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " In seeking to deny the existence of a quid pro quo that\u2019s become the center of an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump is relying on the testimony of Gordon Sondland, a hotel magnate who secured his position as ambassador after giving $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Sondland is set to publicly testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in what has the potential to be the most consequential day of the impeachment saga thus far. Sondland, other officials have testified, was a key figure in the apparent plot to condition the release of U.S. military aid on the Ukrainians announcing an investigation into 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The first week of hearings in the impeachment inquiry largely featured testimony from cooperative witnesses. As the White House blocked certain primary witnesses from testifying, Republicans complained that the witnesses who did appear lacked firsthand knowledge of the alleged scheme. Sondland does have firsthand knowledge of key facts, and his testimony could be combative. The self-described lifelong Republican already had to correct the record following closed-door testimony on Oct. 17, and several other government officials have offered accounts that contrast with Sondland\u2019s. Sondland, whom Trump named U.S. ambassador to the European Union, took on a major role in Ukrainian policy. He was in communication with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was working with two indicted Ukrainian Americans who sought the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Sondland, in his testimony last month, sought to portray himself as disappointed by Giuliani\u2019s involvement in foreign relations.\u00a0Sondland told lawmakers that Trump was \u201cskeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption\u201d and that it was \u201capparent\u201d that Giuliani was \u201cthe key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine.\u201d He claimed he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s instructions to involve Giuliani but that he \u201cdid not understand until much later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate [former] Vice President Biden or his son, or to involve Ukrainians directly or indirectly in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d Sondland, who said he believed he spoke to Trump five or six times since becoming ambassador, claimed he had \u201cno idea\u201d that Trump had brought up the Bidens in the call until the White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But testimony from other officials raised doubts about Sondland\u2019s story.\u00a0One key scene took place at a restaurant in Kyiv over the summer, when Sondland called up the president after Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Trump asked, according to testimony from State Department official David Holmes, who will testify publicly on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Sondland told Trump, according to Holmes. After the Sondland-Trump calls, Holmes said Sondland agreed that Trump didn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit about Ukraine\u201d and cared only about the \u201cbig stuff.\u201d Holmes said he\u2019d \u201cnever seen anything like\u201d what he witnessed: someone calling the president from a cellphone in a restaurant in a foreign country and having such a candid conversation. Holmes said he was surprised that the sensitive conversation took place on a non-secure cellphone call in the middle of a restaurant. \u201cWe generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0that Sondland kept White House officials informed of his activities, and Sondland emailed acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry ahead of a call between Zelensky and Trump and said the Ukrainian president would assure Trump \u201cthat he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone.\u2019\u201d For Democrats, Sondland is a compelling antagonist in the impeachment drama. They can portray him as an unqualified political appointee who had no diplomatic experience before he essentially bought a key position in the Trump administration and acted as Trump\u2019s yes man as he tried to use U.S. military aid for political gain.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 They heard the July 25 phone call for themselves. And now, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and adviser Jennifer Williams are set to tell Americans and the world about its content and their concerns as the lead witnesses in perhaps the most consequential week of the impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump. They are the first two of nine witnesses called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee this week. The procession includes officials closest to Trump as lawmakers grind through their investigation of the 45th president. Vindman and Williams were listening with others in the White House Situation Room and heard Trump pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to do him the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigating Joe Biden and his son, all while the U.S. had placed a hold on aid to Ukraine. What to watch as the marathon week of hearings opens at 9 a.m. EST Tuesday: ___ Vindman is a Soviet-era immigrant who came to the U.S. as a toddler and grew up to become a decorated soldier and a White House aide. Now, he is a 20-year Army officer assigned to the National Security Council at the white-hot center of the inquiry. Vindman, 44, testified last month in closed session that he twice raised concerns about Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushing Ukrainian leaders to investigate the former vice president and his son. \u201cI have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman said in written remarks. He earned the Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq in 2004 leading infantrymen. In October, Vindman attended his closed-door testimony wearing his Army service uniform, with a chest full of military ribbons and other commendations. The visual underscored Trump\u2019s conflict with the military and national security establishment. Republicans are expressing concern about Vindman\u2019s \u201cjudgment\u201d in handling his concern about the call. ___ Trump and the world are about to find out. Williams is Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s special adviser for Europe and Russia, on detail from the State Department. On July 25, she was in the Situation Room taking notes as Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about potential 2020 rival Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cIt was President Trump who raised Burisma,\u201d Williams testified on Nov. 7. Later, she says that \u201cI believed those references to be more political in nature and so that struck me as unusual.\u201d The word Burisma does not appear in the rough transcript of the call released by the White House. \u201cTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls,\u201d Trump tweeted in part over the weekend. He called her a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d ___ The president and his allies have pointed to Zelenskiy\u2019s statement during a September press conference, shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump, in which the Ukrainian president said he didn\u2019t feel any pressure in the July 25 call. But even before that call, Zelenskiy had reported feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden, The Associated Press reported. Zelenskiy was concerned Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 election, two individuals said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue. State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Zelenskiy\u2019s concerns at least three times, the two individuals said, and notes summarizing his worries were circulated within the department. ___ He did last week, castigating the ambassador he fired, Marie Yovanovich, on Twitter and giving weight to her account of being bullied out of her job by members of the administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi several times over the past few days has suggested that if Trump wants to testify \u2014 she mockingly explained the word \u201cexculpatory\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s welcome to do so in person or in writing. He hasn\u2019t said he will do so. But Trump did tweet: \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d ___ The administration is confident about the testimony of all the impeachment witnesses this week except for that of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland on Wednesday, according to two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Like all the witnesses, Sondland will testify under oath and penalty of perjury. Sondland already has had to amend his earlier account after contradicting testimony from others. The White House is happy with the role of Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as the committee\u2019s Republican bulldog questioner. But privately these officials pointed to concerns in the White House about the performance of GOP counsel Steve Castor. ___ The president\u2019s allies have mostly stayed together so far during the hearings, but they are hopping between strategies for pushing back. One argument against the inquiry is that witnesses, including the whistleblower and charge d\u2019affaires William Taylor last week, are reporting the goings-on second- or third-hand. Look for whether they abandon that argument when Vindman and Williams testify. Republicans now say the president is innocent because the military money was eventually released. In fact, it was released Sept. 11 after Congress began looking into the holdup. ___ Testifying in a second session Tuesday are Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide who oversaw Europe and Russia Policy. ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is threatening former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead with Latino voters in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with the winner set to potentially reap a huge collection of delegates that could prove crucial to deciding who emerges as the Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump. Both men held town halls in Las Vegas this weekend ahead of a Nevada Democratic Party dinner here on Sunday night, and both used the opportunity to highlight their support in the first state to vote with a significant Latino population. Biden is relying on support from Latino and Black voters to keep his campaign alive and collect large sums of delegates to the Democratic National Convention even if he struggles in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Sanders\u2019 strength with Latino voters is a direct threat to that strategy. \u201cI think the Latino vote will be the single most important part of the delegate map for any candidate this year,\u201d said Chuck Rocha, a top strategist for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve made [Latino voters] a part of the general strategy. In other campaigns, it\u2019s been an afterthought. We\u2019re not doing that to prove a point. We\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s smart politics.\u201d Rocha noted Latino voters are a growing presence in Iowa and South Carolina, and a key bloc in Nevada. But the real prize will come on Super Tuesday. Colorado, Texas and California \u2015 all of which are more than 20% Latino, according to census data \u2015 will combine for more than 700 delegates. And other Super Tuesday states, including Oklahoma, North Carolina and Virginia, are home to sizable Latino populations. Their electoral importance means basically every campaign is aggressively courting Latino voters. One of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s first campaign trips was to Puerto Rico, and her campaign has hired Latino state directors in California, Texas and Florida. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is struggling with voters of color, has hired a Latinx outreach director based in Las Vegas. Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who would be the first-ever Latino major-party nominee, has escorted an asylum-seeker to a check-in with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and is counting on Latinos to turn around his struggling campaign.\u00a0Despite these efforts, public polling of Latinos generally shows Biden and Sanders in the lead. A Noticias Telemundo poll conducted in late October found Biden earning the support of 26% of Hispanic Democrats nationally, while Sanders collected 18% and Warren was at 10%. Every other candidate was below 5%. A Latino Community Foundation poll of Latino voters in California found 31% planned to vote for Sanders, while 22% are planning to back Biden and 11% will back Warren. Here in Nevada, a Nevada Independent poll found 33% of Hispanic voters in the state backed Biden, 24% backed Sanders and just 11% backed Warren.\u00a0(One recent poll does break the Sanders vs. Biden duopoly: A Telemundo poll of Texas found Biden earning 33% of the vote of Hispanic Democrats in the state, with Warren at 16% and Sanders at 11%.) Sanders spent almost the entire weekend courting Latino voters, starting with a rally in East Los Angeles with the punk-funk band Ozomatli on Saturday, then with a candidate forum on Latino issues at a California Democratic Party event, and ending with a town hall on immigration at the East Las Vegas Community Center. The 400-person town hall, packed with college students and young adults, highlighted how Sanders\u2019 support among Latinos is driven by ideologically motivated young people, who have dubbed him \u201cTio Bernie.\u201d Sanders talked extensively about his new immigration plan, which includes the abolishment of both ICE and Customs and Border Protection in their current forms, a moratorium on deportations and the reversal of Trump\u2019s travel ban and policy requiring asylum-seekers to apply from Mexico. \u201cWe will stop the demonization of undocumented people in this country,\u201d Sanders told the crowd, calling both Trump a \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cxenophobe.\u201d \u201cWe will not have agents of the federal government ripping tiny babies from the arms of their mothers.\u201d Sanders has more than 80 Latino staffers across the early states and his Washington, D.C., headquarters, and both his political director and California state directors are Latino. Rocha said the staff diversity helps the campaign understand the differences between communicating with Latinos in Iowa, who are frequently recent immigrants, and Chicanos with a long history of activism in Los Angeles. And he noted young Latino staff members, including DACA recipients, helped Sanders craft his immigration plan. Will Lizarraga, a sales manager, was typical of the crowd at the town hall. Wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo of progressive YouTube show The Young Turks, Lizarraga cited Sanders\u2019 long-term support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and other liberal policies. \u201cIt\u2019s his track record,\u201d Lizarraga said. \u201cEven when I was a little kid, he was fighting for me.\u201d Lizarraga, a U.S. permanent resident, is scheduled to get his citizenship sometime in February. He hopes to become a citizen in time to cast a ballot for Sanders at the Feb. 22 caucus. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who has endorsed Biden, gave a simple reason for backing the former vice president: He trusts him. Biden was the first candidate to meet with the CHC after launching his campaign, Correa said, and promised to \u201cput his back into\u201d passing comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cHe said \u2018Absolutely, I\u2019m your person. I\u2019m going to put my political capital into backing immigration reform,\u2019\u201d Correa recalled. Biden is counting on that trust, formed over a long political career, to help him with Latinos. In his appearances both at a town hall and at the Nevada Democratic Party\u2019s First In The West dinner, Biden began by mentioning his long history of campaigning in the state, dating back to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s first campaign for the Senate in 1986, and running up to his work to elect the Senate\u2019s first-ever Latina, Catherine Cortez Masto, in 2016. \u201cHe has a record of being a consensus-builder,\u201d said Correa, a moderate Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy who represents putting politics aside, who represents putting the partisan labels aside, who wants to get work done for the American people.\u201d But Biden\u2019s diverse coalition requires tending. While Sanders was able to spend virtually the whole weekend focused on Latino voters, Biden\u2019s town hall took place at a majority-Black elementary school, and he flew to rural Elko for a town hall on Sunday afternoon. At the town hall in Las Vegas, Biden presented his more mainstream vision for immigration policy, promising to \u201cimmediately\u201d reunite families at the border and work to protect DACA recipients and attacking Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m running to get rid of those Mexican rapists,\u2019\u201d Biden said at the town hall. \u201cThe words presidents speak matter.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, implicitly criticized Biden earlier in the weekend, saying at a Univision forum it was not necessary for the Obama administration to deport more than 3 million people. Of course, Sanders\u2019 own record on immigration isn\u2019t flawless: He opposed a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill because he objected to guest worker programs that he \u2014 and his labor unions \u2014 worried would create an underclass of workers.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Kurt Volker, President Donald Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, testified that he was oblivious to the connection between President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and targeting former Vice President Joe Biden. Volker was trying to \u201cthread the needle\u201d between a Burisma investigation (which Trump desperately wanted and Volker believed could help convince him to continue supporting Ukraine) and a Biden investigation (which he says he knew would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d). \u201cI now understand most of the other people didn\u2019t see or consider this distinction,\u201d Volker said of investigating Burisma and investigating the Bidens. \u201cFor them it was synonymous.\u201d It\u2019s common for Trump administration officials to believe that they can advance broad policy goals without becoming complicit in anything improper. An anonymous administration official has insisted to the public that they are working diligently to \u201cpreserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses.\u201d Respected national security officials like John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, and Jim Mattis all thought they could serve as the adults in the room. They all resigned after realizing the futility of that goal. Before Trump was elected president, Volker and friends joked that none of them would want to work in the Trump administration \u2014 but they each wanted the other to do it and serve as the voice of reason. Volker felt committed to Ukraine\u2019s future and the fight against Russia, he said Tuesday. He hoped that he could get a skeptical Trump to support that effort by convincing the Ukrainians to give the president what he wanted. But Volker soon learned that the only way to get Trump on board was with what amounted to a demand that a country deeply dependent on U.S. military aid help advance the president\u2019s personal political ambitions. Volker claimed that he thought there was a distinction between \u201cBurisma\u201d and \u201cBiden,\u201d and that he saw investigating them as \u201cdifferent \u2015 the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable.\u201d When U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland brought up the investigations during a meeting with Ukrainian officials, it was an \u201ceye-roll moment,\u201d Volker said Tuesday. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,\u201d Volker told the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing on Tuesday afternoon. Volker later admitted that he \u201c knew that [Hunter Biden] had been a board member,\u201d but said that he believed that investigating Burisma and investigating former Vice President Biden were \u201cvery different things.\u201d Volker is the first of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d at the center of the Trump-Ukraine scandal to testify in the impeachment inquiry \u2015 Sondland will appear before the committee tomorrow, while Energy Secretary Rick Perry isn\u2019t scheduled to testify. Volker texted a Ukranian official that they would set up a White House meeting after \u201cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016.\u201d Tim Morrison, a White House National Security Council official who testified alongside Volker, told lawmakers that he was hoping that Trump would have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky more support in their phone call in July. Volker said that he didn\u2019t think that the United States foreign policy should be focused on pursuing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d he believed the Ukranians were floating. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians \u2015 particularly the former prosecutor general \u2015 they\u2019re not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d Volker said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sought by Republicans to testify, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine spoke up instead for Democrat Joe Biden in Tuesday\u2019s impeachment hearings, rejecting \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d embraced by President Donald Trump and some of his allies. Kurt Volker said he has known Biden as an honorable man for more than two decades, rebuffing debunked corruption allegations that Trump is said to have wanted the Ukrainians to investigate in exchange for military aid to hold off Russian aggression. \u201cThe allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and non-credible,\u201d Volker declared. Broader corruption in Ukraine was \u201cplausible,\u201d but corruption by Biden wasn\u2019t, he said. Volker testified alongside former White House national security official Tim Morrison in the second hearing of the day in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, only the fourth in history against a U.S. president. Morrison, also requested by GOP members on the House Intelligence Committee, said at the outset that he was not there to question the \u201ccharacter or integrity\u201d of any of his colleagues, though earlier Tuesday Republican lawmakers used his prior comments to try to discredit another witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The White House even circulated a tweet that was an earlier quote by Morrison questioning Vindman\u2019s judgment. Democrats say there may be grounds for impeachment in Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine\u2019s new leadership to investigate his Democratic rival and the 2016 U.S. election as he withheld military assistance approved by Congress. Trump says he did nothing wrong and dismissed the hearings as a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d Volker was the first person to come behind closed doors in the inquiry that started in September, resigning his position shortly before he did so. Since then, a parade of witnesses has testified publicly and privately about what they recalled about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Many of those statements cast doubt on Volker\u2019s account that he didn\u2019t know the Ukraine gas company Burisma was tied to Biden, and that he wasn\u2019t aware of a possible quid pro quo offered by Trump. A number of White House and State Department officials were listening to the call, but Volker was not. On Tuesday, he said he opposed any hold on security assistance. And he said, \u201cI did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two.\u201d Even though, he said, he understood that Biden\u2019s son Hunter had been a board member \u2015 and he himself had been deeply involved with Ukrainian officials on a statement, never released, that would have committed the country to investigating Burisma and the 2016 U.S. election. Volker himself requested a meeting on July 19 with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, at which Giuliani mentioned accusations about the Bidens as well as the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. He said he believes now, thanks to hindsight and the testimony of other witnesses, that Trump was using the aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden and his role on the company\u2019s board. \u201cIn retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,\u201d Volker testified. Yet he also acknowledged that Trump never told him he was withholding aid for Ukraine unless there were investigations. He also said Ukrainians never told him that they wouldn\u2019t get a White House visit or military aid without committing to investigations. He said he would have objected had the president asked him to get Ukraine to do investigations. Morrison, who stepped down from Trump\u2019s National Security Council shortly before he appeared behind closed doors last month, said he was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, testimony that Republicans have repeatedly highlighted. \u201cAs I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington\u2019s political climate,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cMy fears have been realized.\u201d He told lawmakers Tuesday that the transcript of the call was incorrectly placed in a highly secure location. Democrats have seen ill intent in that action, but he said, \u201cIt was a mistake ... an administrative error.\u201d Morrison has confirmed to investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and a Ukrainian official. Sondland told the official that U.S. aid might be freed if the country\u2019s top prosecutor \u201cwould go to the mike and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,\u201d Morrison said in previous closed-door testimony. Volker shifted his account of a pivotal July 10 interaction at the White House. In his closed-door interview last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine or investigations sought by the president. But on Tuesday, he said the meeting was essentially over when Sondland made a \u201cgeneral\u201d comment about investigations. \u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,\u201d Volker said. A series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and another envoy in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma. Volker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani \u201craised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.\u201d Volker also said a senior aide to Zelenskiy approached him last summer to ask to be connected to Giuliani. He said he made clear to the Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, that Giuliani was a private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government. He testified he wasn\u2019t part of an irregular foreign policy channel led Giuliani, as others have testified. He also rejected the idea that Trump dubbed him, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry the \u201cthree amigos\u201d in charge of Ukraine policy. \u201cMy role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\u201d Volker said. ___ Associated Press Writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Lisa Mascaro and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Democrats are skeptical that their leading 2020 presidential candidates will be able to accomplish much of their stated agendas, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night. Just 41% of Democrats think former Vice President Joe Biden will be able to accomplish all or most of his policy goals, and the numbers are lower for other candidates: Only 33% say the same of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s agenda, while 30% of Democrats are confident in Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 ability to enact his political revolution and just 28% believe South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg can enact most of his plans. The lack of confidence comes as each of the three leading candidates doubles down on their own personal theories of how to enact the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda \u2015 and as each of those theories runs into stark challenges. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who wants to change Washington\u2019s internal rules to make progressive change easier, might not have support among Democrats to get rid of the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster threshold. Biden is continuing to tout his ability to work with Republicans amid widespread skepticism. And Sanders, a Vermont independent who is counting on popular support to pressure a Congress reluctant to embrace his ambitious policies, has seen support for his signature policy fall as the campaign advances. Meanwhile, Buttigieg \u2015 who trails the other three in national polling but is running strong in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 is still articulating how his plans to pass legislation would differ from unsuccessful tactics used by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found a plurality of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (43%) thought a reform approach, including weakening the power of lobbyists and corporations to influence policy, was the most effective way for Democrats to pass laws if they win the presidency in 2020. That approach, typically associated with Warren, was more popular than Biden\u2019s preferred method of finding common ground with Republicans. Thirty percent of Democrats supported a compromise approach. The least popular was Sanders\u2019 preferred method of enlisting ordinary people to pressure elected officials to support progressive goals. Only 12% supported this method. There are ideological differences: 51% of liberals preferred a reform approach, and just 25% want to find common ground with Republicans. Among moderates and conservatives, 44% prefer looking for common ground with Republicans, while 28% want to weaken lobbyists and corporations. There\u2019s also a significant age gap: Democrats older than 65 have a strong preference for working with Republicans. These divides were clear at a Warren rally Sunday in Las Vegas. The candidate ran through her ambitious agenda: a wealth tax on fortunes of more than $50 million, substantial investments in early childhood education, an elimination of student debt, a sweeping anti-corruption law. But audience members varied wildly in how much of her agenda they expected her to accomplish and whether her plan to win political victories was the best. Dylan Jaramillo, an electrical engineer who said he\u2019s likely to support businessman Andrew Yang in the primary, said he liked Yang\u2019s (and Biden\u2019s) emphasis on working with Republicans to get things done. \u201cJoe Biden is probably the most realistic one,\u201d he said, predicting Warren would achieve \u201cmaybe 30%\u201d of her goals. Jenna Wurtzberger, an adjunct professor, attended the rally with Byron McDonald, a delivery driver. Both supported Warren\u2019s push to get rid of the filibuster and thought Biden\u2019s hopes to work with Republicans were far-fetched. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk sense with Republicans at this point,\u201d Wurtzberger said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched enough of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d McDonald said in agreement. \u201cFor Biden, that seems a little pie in the sky.\u201d But McDonald still wasn\u2019t totally sold on voting for Warren. \u201cI support big ideas. But I worry not everyone likes big ideas as much as I do.\u201d Warren\u2019s pitch on how she would transform her famous plans into reality has shifted slightly. In her stump speech, she no longer mentions her work with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids. She also now spends more time invoking famous social movements of the past, suggesting a similar movement can push Congress to adopt her ambitious liberal agenda. And some of the roadblocks for Warren\u2019s theory have reappeared. Three Democratic senators \u2015 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2015 recently reiterated their opposition to ending the filibuster, which would force Warren to somehow court GOP support for her plans. (In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters were ambivalent about the filibuster: 29% said it was a good rule, 25% said it was a bad rule and 46% were unsure. Among Democrats, however, 27% said it was a good rule and 33% said it was bad.) Sanders and Biden, meanwhile, have stuck to their guns. Biden, who was widely mocked for predicting Republicans would have an \u201cepiphany\u201d after Trump\u2019s presidency, repeated the line at a fundraiser at K Street law firm in Washington, D.C. Sanders remains committed to a broad political revolution. The new entrant into the top-tier of the race, Buttigieg, has expressed elements of each theory of change put forward by the other leading candidates. Like Warren, he supports eliminating the filibuster. Like Biden, he emphasizes reuniting the country and working with Republicans. And like Sanders, he talks about applying public pressure on reluctant politicians. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right?,\u201d Buttigieg said at a town hall in Iowa earlier this month. \u201cI believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures.\u201d But when asked how his approach would differ from that of Obama, who saw his agenda curtailed significantly by both Republicans and intra-party opposition, Buttigieg struggled to answer. \u201cHe operated under the constraints of being the last Democrat of the Reagan era. And he also faced constraints of a Congress that was not acting in good faith,\u201d Buttigieg said during his bus tour in Iowa. \u201cAnd the part about Congress acting in bad faith has only gotten worse among Republicans.\u201d \u201cI think the dynamics of the country have become more favorable,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, just 12 years \u2015 I don\u2019t know what percent of the country is different over a 12-year period. But just 12 years\u2019 worth of people who have arrived and left. That means that this country has shifted \u2015 plus 12 years of experience as a country on what works and what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Ultimately, Buttigieg concluded, he would have a mandate if he won the election. \u201cYou look at how the New Deal came about, it\u2019s not that FDR promised something even bigger than the New Deal and then he got there and that was the compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a much more kind of dynamic set of things that happened. On health care, in modern times, you could look at the example of the [Affordable Care Act]. You could also look at the example of the Clinton health care reform agenda in the \u201990s. And the biggest lesson I draw is that if we\u2019re really explicit about what we want to do now, then you arrive in office with a mandate to do it.\u201d Daniel Marans and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.

      "content": " Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified on Wednesday that President Donald Trump cared most that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky publicly announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and the company that employed his son, not that Ukraine actually conduct the probe. \u201cHe had to announce the investigations,\u201d Sondland said during the House impeachment inquiry, referring to Zelensky. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually have to do them, as I understood it.\u201d The point is essential in that it reveals that Trump did not care about corruption in Ukraine, as his GOP allies in Congress have attempted to argue\ufeff. Instead the president simply wanted a television clip that could be used to implicate a potential 2020 Democratic presidential opponent in a criminal investigation. \u201cI never heard ... anyone say the investigations had to start or had to be completed,\u201d Sondland said. He noted the only information he was provided was that Trump wanted Zelensky to make a public statement announcing investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Hunter Biden, and whether Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. The only reason that Sondland said he was given for this was that Ukrainian officials had previously made promises in private that they did not deliver. Sondland\u2019s statements fit with other testimony from witnesses and evidence from call records that Trump never raised broader issues of corruption in Ukraine or actual anti-corruption policy in his conversations with Zelensky. Instead, he focused on specific investigations; one that could help him win the 2020 election, and another that could cloud the stain of how he won the 2016 election. A televised announcement by Ukraine could be extremely useful for the Trump campaign if Biden were to win the Democratic presidential primary to face the president in 2020. It could be referred to at rallies, used in television and internet advertisements, and Trump-friendly news organizations could use it in clips to make claims of corruption against Biden. This could allow Trump to rerun his 2016 playbook, where he used the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server to make broad claims of criminal corruption against her. The New York Times claimed at the time that the then-FBI director James Comey\u2019s first announcement in July 2016 about the Clinton investigation provided a \u201cready-made attack ad\u201d for Trump.",

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union,\u00a0delivered a bombshell opening statement at the House impeachment hearing on Wednesday, testifying that a clear understanding existed among top administration officials that President Donald Trump sought to extort Ukraine\u2019s government for personal political gain. \u201cEveryone knew. It was no secret,\u201d Sondland said, referring to leading White House, State Department and National Security Council officials, as well as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Sondland then provided numerous examples of the effort to get Ukraine to open an investigation that would damage Trump\u2019s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in exchange for a meeting with Trump and $391 million in military aid that was being withheld. Sondland\u2019s abrupt turn from playing dumb in the early stages of the scandal \u2015 to the point where it defied belief \u2015 to implicating those at the highest levels of government in a sprawling quid pro quo scheme is the most dramatic development so far in the impeachment inquiry. It puts immense pressure on top White House officials and diplomats, most of which have refused to testify, to explain themselves. Here\u2019s a rundown of who Sondland implicated in his testimony on Wednesday: \u2015\u00a0Trump, who Sondland suggested was directing the quid pro quo effort and had tasked Giuliani with seeing it through. On Trump\u2019s behalf, Giuliani \u201cdemanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations\u201d related to Biden, according to Sondland, as well as a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Although Sondland did not say that Trump directly instructed him to seek such a quid pro quo, he testified that Giuliani was \u201cexpressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president.\u201d \u2015 Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who Sondland said became the president\u2019s go-between on the quid pro quo push with Ukraine. Sondland and other officials \u201cdid not want to work with Mr. Giuliani,\u201d but were compelled to follow Trump\u2019s orders, Sondland testified. Sondland added that Giuliani\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine into launching investigations were a quid pro quo to secure a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and that he also suspected military aid was being withheld as part of that effort. Sondland also testified that Giuliani emphasized that Trump wanted Zelensky to make a public statement about launching corruption investigations, specifically mentioning the 2016 election conspiracy and the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter served. Giuliani was also communicating directly with Ukrainian officials without U.S. diplomats\u2019 knowledge, according to Sondland. \u2015 Vice President Mike Pence, who attended a meeting with Sondland and Zelensky on Sept. 1 in Warsaw, Poland. Sondland testified that before the meeting he directly raised concerns with Pence that the delayed military aid \u201chad become tied to the issue of investigations.\u201d\u00a0Zelensky also raised the issue of aid in the meeting, according to Sondland, and Pence said he would ask Trump about it. Pence\u2019s office said in a statement issued while Sondland was still testifying that\u00a0 the vice president \u201cnever had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations.\u201d \u2015 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who Sondland said was kept informed of the efforts concerning Ukraine. Pompeo was included on a July 19 email from Sondland which mentioned that Zelensky would tell Trump \u201che intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone\u2019.\u201d Pompeo was also on several other emails that indirectly referenced Ukraine announcing the investigations Trump demanded. Sondland also said he communicated with Pompeo\u2019s counselor,\u00a0Ulrich Brechbuehl,\u00a0and the State Department\u2019s executive secretary,\u00a0\u00a0Lisa Kenna. \u201cThey knew what we were doing and why,\u201d Sondland testified. \u2015 White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was also included on the July 19 email referencing the investigations, as was Mulvaney\u2019s senior adviser,\u00a0Robert Blair. Both have refused to testify in impeachment hearings. \u2015 Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who Sondland said made up, along with himself, the backchannel with Ukraine to push for investigations. Giuliani expressed to Perry, Volker and Sondland that Trump wanted Ukraine to launch investigations. Perry\u2019s chief of staff,\u00a0Brian McCormack,\u00a0was also included in the July 19 email about Zelensky investigations. Volker testified on Monday that he did not know at the time there was a quid pro quo effort, but that in hindsight he should have seen the connection with Biden and would have raised an objection. Perry has refused to testify. \u2015 Former national security adviser John Bolton, who Sondland said was kept informed of the U.S. diplomatic activities involving Ukraine. Bolton also emailed Sondland to request Giuliani\u2019s contact information on Aug. 26. \u2015 Sen.\u00a0Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), with whom Sondland raised concerns about security aid being withheld as part of a potential quid pro quo arrangement, Sondland said. \u201cAgain, everyone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said. During the hearing, Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman told Sondland that Mulvaney, Bolton, McCormack, Blair and Perry had all been asked to come testify, but refused. \u201cWould you include them, as well as Secretary Pompeo, as key witnesses that would be able to provide some additional information on this inquiry?\u201d Goldman asked. \u201cI think they would,\u201d Sondland said.",

Biden campaign officials met with reporters Wednesday ahead of the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta. Asked whether the former vice president has spent much time watching the impeachment hearings, a senior campaign official said no but that they\u2019ve been \u201chelpful.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve really reminded people of two things: One, that you have Trump administration officials testifying under oath that Vice President Biden did nothing wrong,\u201d the official said. The official continued: \u201cAnd two, you\u2019re fundamentally reminding voters every day that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to have to face Joe Biden at the ballot box and that\u2019s why he\u2019s being impeached in the first place.\u201d The House\u2019s impeachment inquiry centers on Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to launch a political investigation into Biden and his alleged decision to use U.S. military aid to the country as leverage. The Biden campaign declined to discuss internal polling that may have demonstrated how impeachment is benefiting the former vice president, pointing to public polling and news headlines generally to show the \u201cnet benefit\u201d to Biden\u2019s campaign. As other Democratic candidates like Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have seen their support in the polls climb and then dip in recent months, Biden has remained the steady front-runner. Americans remain split on whether Congress should impeach and vote to remove Trump from office, according to a PBSNewsHour, NPR and Marist poll released Tuesday. The poll shows little change in public attitudes since the public hearings began last week. A Quinnipiac University poll\u00a0of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina out this week showed Biden at 33% \u2015 a 20-point lead over the rest of the Democratic pack. Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) trail the former vice president with 13% and 11%, respectively.",

Sondland dodged Maloney\u2019s questions, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize who would have and who would not have.\u201d Maloney, growing visibly frustrated, asked him five more times to answer him until Sondland said:\u00a0\u201cI assume President Trump would benefit.\u201d \u201cThere we have it,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSee, didn\u2019t hurt a bit, did it?\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony Wednesday has been largely damning to Trump, with Sondland admitting that the primary focus for Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani was to leverage aid to Ukraine in order to get the country to investigate Biden, whose son once worked for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, along with other conspiracy theories. \u201cEveryone was in the loop. There were no secrets,\u201d Sondland said of Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky.

      "content": " Ukrainian embassy staffers were aware something was holding up U.S. military aid to their country as early as July 25, the day President Donald Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Defense Department official Laura Cooper testified Wednesday evening. Cooper told the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump that her staff received emails from Ukrainian officials based in Washington on July 25 asking what was going on with the $391 million in military and security aid. The emails came five hours after the phone call where Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating the Bidens business activities in Ukraine. Previous reports had put early August as the earliest date Ukraine officials were aware that the military aid was being blocked. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordan Sondland testified earlier on Wednesday that Trump directed a quid pro quo where Zelensky could obtain a White House meeting if he were to announce investigations into possible Ukraine interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Burisma, the gas company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member. Sondland also said he later came to believe that the military aid was part of the quid pro quo. National Security Council staffer Alexander Vindman first learned that a hold was placed on the aid on July 3. The Office of Management and Budget issued an agency memorandum officially blocking release of the aid on July 18 on Trump\u2019s order. This came despite Department of Defense officials telling Congress in February and again in May that Ukraine met conditions to receive the aid. The hold on the aid was first reported publicly by Politico on August 28. Cooper had previously testified behind closed doors that she first learned that Ukrainians knew that something had snagged delivery of the military aid on Sept. 5. After her testimony was released to the public, her staff approached her with the July 25 emails from the Ukrainian embassy officials. In desperation to secure the aid, Zelensky and his team had planned to announce investigations into the 2016 election issue and the Bidens on CNN. But on Sept. 9, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general told the House Intelligence Committee about a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump\u2019s comments in his July 25 phonecall with Zelensky. Three House committees responded by announcing an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine. Two days later, the White House released the aid.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union and the\u00a0man at the center of the Ukraine controversy, testified before Congress on Wednesday that President Donald Trump conditioned security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president at the White House upon on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, giving Democrats their most potent sound bite yet. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d Sondland asked himself. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d But for Republicans, somehow, Sondland\u2019s testimony exonerated Trump. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201ca nothing-burger.\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), while admitting he didn\u2019t see any of Sondland\u2019s testimony, said it was \u201call hearsay.\u201d And House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) described Sondland\u2019s testimony as \u201cscrambled eggs.\u201d \u201cA yolk for them, a yolk for us,\u201d Biggs said. Like many Republicans Wednesday night, Biggs disregarded Sondland\u2019s claim that aid and a White House meeting were conditional on the Ukrainian president announcing an investigation into Biden,\u00a0because Sondland also testified that Trump never directly said that it was a quid pro quo \u2014 the existence of one was Sondland\u2019s impression. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence anywhere else around,\u201d Biggs said of the quid pro quo. That, of course, ignores a lot of evidence. For starters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn\u2019t get his White House meeting, and the U.S. security aid for Ukraine was held up. Even if you believe the GOP line that Trump delayed the aid because he was doing due diligence, that doesn\u2019t explain why he wouldn\u2019t agree to meeting Zelensky at the White House. And, even more damning, the aid was only released after the existence of a whistleblower complaint about the situation became public. In the words of former Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan \u2015 now an Independent \u2015 Republicans are relying on simply confusing the public. \u201cThey talk about it like we\u2019re all stupid, like we can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on,\u201d Amash told HuffPost, in an elevator full of his former Republican colleagues. \u201cSondland testified to a quid pro quo. He testified to significant details and facts. He testified that he thought it was wrong. So the inference is obvious that the president was withholding security assistance.\u201d When we pressed Amash on what he would say to GOP legislators \u2015 like the ones standing beside him in the elevator \u2015 who say it\u2019s not obvious, Amash was not sympathetic. \u201cIt just is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this were any grand jury proceeding, it would be obvious to everyone.\u201d Predictably, that is not how Republicans see it. Despite Trump freezing the aid and not acquiescing to a White House meeting, Republicans are focused on the fact that the aid was eventually released. \u201cMy biggest problem with the whole thing is that it\u2019s like an armed robbery without a weapon, without a product that\u2019s been stolen and without a victim that\u2019s been robbed,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Wednesday. \u201cAll of this planning that was apparently going on that didn\u2019t come to pass.\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who was in the elevator during Amash\u2019s interview, suggested the comparisons to a grand jury aren\u2019t apt because the federal standards of evidence weren\u2019t being used for the impeachment hearings. \u201cIf it were, almost all of this information, almost every single shred of it, would be inadmissible,\u201d he said. Generally, Republicans were all over the place in their defense of Trump Wednesday night. Some of it was muted and general \u2015 Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that \u201cnothing stands out to me that\u2019s troubling,\u201d before insisting we get in touch with his communications director \u2015 while other defenses were animated and extremely specific. Diaz-Balart said foreign aid gets tied up all the time. He offered the defense that everyone was misinterpreting the president. He went on an extended rant about how the press wasn\u2019t adequately arguing for transparency in the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation. (While the Intelligence Committee did initially depose witnesses behind closed doors, it has been releasing transcripts of those depositions and holding public hearings for the last week.) Other Republicans offered a smorgasbord of defenses. Perry was particularly concerned that Democrats were blocking an investigation into Hunter Biden. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said even the \u201cworst interpretation\u201d was still acceptable. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing impeachable,\u201d King said. \u201c[Trump] has a constitutional right to ask that corruption be eliminated.\u201d And Biggs complained about the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert, Alexander Vindman, deviating from the chain of command to report his concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. \u201cNow see, here\u2019s the problem, you get me going on this stuff,\u201d Biggs said. But if there was one consistent part of Sondland\u2019s testimony Wednesday that Republicans homed in on, it was the president saying \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d In his deposition last month, Sondland described a September 9 phone call with the president during which he asked Trump what he wanted from Zelensky. \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,\u201d Trump said, according to Sondland. \u201cI want Zelensky to do the right thing.\u201d Trump is so convinced that the September call vindicates him that he held an impromptu press conference on the White House lawn on Wednesday with notes that mirrored those quotes from the call. Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) \u2015 perhaps the president\u2019s biggest defender in Congress \u2015 castigated Sondland for omitting the September call from his Wednesday testimony, calling the call \u201cthe best direct evidence\u201d about the president\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine scandal. The entire thrust of Sondland\u2019s testimony was that the president had, in fact, demanded a quid pro quo. At the time of the call, Sondland said Wednesday, he still believed that, contrary to what the president said, Trump still wanted Zelensky to announce investigations in order to get the military assistance and the White House visit that had been promised. After the hearing, HuffPost asked Jordan if he was just insisting that everyone take the president at his word. \u201cThe president said \u2018no quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe wants Zelensky to do what he campaigned on, plain and simple, speaks for itself. And oh, by the way, that matches the facts, because he never announced that there was going to be an investigation.\u201d Republicans \u2015 who initially settled on the defense that, as long as there was no quid pro quo, there was nothing improper about wanting a foreign government to investigate the Bidens \u2015 have now moved to a new stage: As long as Trump denied the quid pro or didn\u2019t make it explicit, it\u2019s fine. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement Wednesday where she clung to the idea that President Trump \u201cclearly stated that he \u2018wanted nothing\u2019 from Ukraine and repeated \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 over and over again.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. aid to Ukraine flowed, no investigation was launched, and President Trump has met and spoken with President Zelensky,\u201d Grisham continued. \u201cDemocrats are chasing ghosts.\u201d That statement ignores a number of facts. For one, as Trump was saying he \u201cwanted nothing,\u201d he was also saying he wanted Ukraine to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d According to the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate Ukraine\u2019s role in 2016 election interference. He also brought up \u201cthe other thing:\u201d investigating the Bidens. Sondland said that a White House meeting and the security aid were conditioned on Ukraine announcing an investigation. Explaining his deductive reasoning on determining that it was a quid pro quo, Sondland said it was simply \u201c2+2.\u201d The aid only \u201cflowed\u201d to Ukraine after the existence of whistleblower\u2019s complaint was made public. (You can read all about the timeline of when the aid was released here.) Furthermore, with questions about a quid pro quo already cropping up in the media, and the aid now headed to Ukraine, Zelensky canceled an interview with CNN where he planned to announce the investigations. Once there were reports of a whistleblower complaint, CNN host Fareed Zakaria said, \u201cit became clear to us that the interview was off.\u201d And finally, while Trump has met and spoken with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president didn\u2019t get the meeting at the White House that he desired. Still, Republicans continue to pretend there could not have been a quid pro quo because the aid was eventually released, Zelensky met with Trump, and there have been no investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s not 2+2,\u201d Jordan said during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s 0 for 3.\u201d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Presidential candidates opened the fifth Democratic debate on Wednesday by addressing the public impeachment hearings that have gripped Washington this week with new revelations about President Donald Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. But even as they cheered the House impeachment inquiry and argued that Trump needed to be removed from office, most Democrats on the debate stage in Atlanta, Georgia, used the question about impeachment to pivot to their core campaign message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, deftly tied the hearings to her recently released plan to tackle corruption. \u201cHe wrote a check for a million dollars and that tells us what is happening in Washington... We are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder,\u201d Warren said, referring to bombshell testimony from Trump donor turned European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00a0earlier in the day. Sondland, who was appointed in 2017 after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0delivered devastating testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday morning that implicated Trump and a number of top administration officials in what he acknowledged was a \u201cclear quid pro quo\u201d scheme to exchange official acts for millions of dollars in U.S. government funds. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Democrats need to move forward with the impeachment inquiry, but he also said they must be ready to bring the country together after Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe must confront Donald Trump for his wrongdoings. That means impeachment. But we must do more. I\u2019m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble of his presidency, pick up the pieces, and unify a divided nation,\u201d Buttigieg said. He continued on that theme by noting that each Democratic presidential candidate is \u201crunning to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden used the moment to tout his strength among people who view him as most able to beat Trump in 2020. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee, that\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his family. He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin also \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to be president.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tied impeachment hearings to her \u201cjustice\u201d campaign platform and her biography as a former prosecutor in California. \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Harris said, before taking a swipe at Buttigieg, over his \u201ctender moment\u201d comment seconds earlier. \u201cUntil we get to that tender moment, justice is on the ballot.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), meanwhile, argued that Trump\u2019s presidency is putting democracy at risk. \u201cThis is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests, in front of our country\u2019s interests, and this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man,\u201d Klobuchar said.",

      "content": " Joe Biden escalated his calls to end support for Saudi Arabia during Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate, further separating himself from policies of former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, in which he served as vice president. Asked how the United States should respond to the brutal murder of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing war in Yemen, Biden said he would end arms supplies and turn the regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman into a global \u201cpariah.\u201d \u201cI would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell war weapons to them,\u201d Biden said in response to a question from moderator Andrea Mitchell. \u201cWe were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are.\u201d Biden said in May that he would end U.S. support for the Saudis\u2019 war in Yemen, which has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis in the country.\u00a0The war has caused thousands of civilian deaths as well as widespread disease outbreaks and starvation epidemics across Yemen. Obama was called upon to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia over the war, but he\u00a0never did. Some top former Obama officials also called for end to U.S. support last year. Scrutiny of Saudi Arabia further intensified after the U.S. intelligence community and Turkish officials deemed Salman\u2019s regime responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s murder last year. Khashoggi, who was born in Saudi Arabia and was a prominent critic of Salman, was killed and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October 2018. President Donald Trump has continued supporting the regime\u2019s war in Yemen, and he refused to condemn the Saudis for Khashoggi\u2019s murder. \u201cThere is very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I would also ... end subsidies we have, end sale of material to the Saudis who were going in and murdering children and murdering innocent people. They have to be held accountable.\u201d Although it represented a break with Obama, Biden\u2019s position is in line with those of congressional members of both parties, including the entire Senate Democratic caucus. The House and Senate have voted in favor of resolutions calling for an end to U.S. support for the war. Trump has blocked attempts to cut funding, and an effort to override his veto in May\u00a0failed in the Senate. The four senators on the stage with Biden \u2015 Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2015 have all voted in favor of ending aid to the Saudi regime. Sanders, a longtime critic of the Yemen war, sponsored the original legislation meant to curtail Saudi assistance.",

      "subtitle": "The senator may have had the line of Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate while criticizing Biden for his opposition to legalizing marijuana.",
      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " When Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) highlighted former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s unpopular position on marijuana during Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, it was not a great moment for Biden. And it only got worse from there as the former vice president stumbled repeatedly over sensitive racial issues. Booker went after Biden for stating earlier this week that he would not initially support legalizing marijuana if he were to become president. Biden had said at a town hall in Nevada on Monday that he wants to see more data about the long-term effects of marijuana use before legalizing the drug at the federal level. Biden\u2019s response to Booker quickly got strange when he began touting the support he\u2019s received from the Black community. \u201cI come out of the Black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the Black community \u2015 who have vouched for me \u2015 because they know me,\u201d Biden said, adding that he\u2019s received support from three former chairs of the Black Caucus. Biden fumbled again when he said he\u2019s received support from the \u201conly\u201d African American woman elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true ... the other one is here,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) jumped in while throwing her hands up and laughing. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a top Biden supporter, shrugged off the former vice president\u2019s Harris flub, telling reporters after the debate that speaking in soundbites can be \u201cdifficult.\u201d \u201cHe was there when Kamala Harris was sworn in so clearly he knows that there\u2019s another African-American woman,\u201d Bottoms said. Biden\u2019s fumble came after a statement from Booker on how politicians often use Black voters as pawns in presidential elections. The New Jersey senator used a topic Black voters are passionate about to segue into the smackdown that left the former vice president tripping over his words. \u201cI have a lifetime of experience with Black voters; I\u2019ve been one since I was 18,\u201d Booker said to laughter. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried. They\u2019re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to really be paid attention to is when people are looking for their vote.\u201d One issue that disproportionally affects the Black community is the criminalization of marijuana, Booker said. \u201cThis week I hear [Biden] literally say that \u2018I don\u2019t think we should legalize marijuana.\u2019 I thought you might\u2019ve been high when you said it. Because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people \u2026 the war on drugs has been a war on Black and Brown people.\u201d Biden\u2019s botched response to Booker was one of many gaffes the former vice president made during Wednesday night\u2019s debate. He routinely stumbled over his words, fumbling several times throughout the two-hour event. Biden didn\u2019t rescind his opposition to marijuana legalization but did say he would decriminalize marijuana and expunge any records of people arrested on marijuana charges. \u201cI do think that it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is.\u201d At the town hall in Nevada, Biden did state that he supported medical marijuana and leaving it up to individual states to decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana. Asked about Biden\u2019s awkward exchange with Booker, Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser to Biden, said the former vice president has been \u201cclear on where he stands on the issue of marijuana.\u201d She suggested Booker had simply been looking for a \u201cmoment\u201d on the debate stage. \u201cIt\u2019s silly season out there,\u201d she told reporters after the debate.

      "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
      "content": " The second week of House impeachment hearings featured top diplomats and White House officials giving dramatic testimony about President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to coerce Ukraine\u2019s government into launching investigations that would damage political rival and 2020 candidate Joe Biden. But several key officials also gave contradictory or inconsistent accounts of events and their knowledge of the quid pro quo campaign, sometimes radically departing from their initial closed-door testimonies in what appeared to be attempts to limit their accountability in the scandal. United States Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony, for instance, was damning and implicated top Trump administration officials, but it was also self-serving with many glaring omissions. Sondland tried to maintain a veneer of innocence throughout the hearing, claiming that he acted in good faith at all times and didn\u2019t know Trump\u2019s push to investigate Ukrainian gas company Burisma had anything to do with Biden. (Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served on the board of Burisma.) House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was incredulous that Sondland, who has previously claimed Ukraine was an important part of his portfolio, had no idea about Burisma and the Bidens \u2015 especially given that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was publicly advocating for an investigation into the company. \u201cApparently, a lot of people did not make the connection,\u201d Sondland claimed. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker gave a similar excuse for not raising concerns about the quid pro quo effort toward Ukraine, claiming that he didn\u2019t know that Burisma was tied to Biden and saying he only found out about it in late September. \u201cI did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a distinction between the two,\u201d Volker said, claiming that in hindsight he should have made the connection. Former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison, too, claimed he had to Google what Burisma was due to his unfamiliarity with the company. But Morrison, Sondland and Volker\u2019s denials are questionable given that Giuliani\u2019s interest in Burisma and its link to Biden was front-page news in The New York Times as early as May 1, and for months Giuliani was openly calling on Ukraine to launch investigations that would damage Biden. The effort to pressure Ukraine over Burisma had been covered by numerous major media outlets, and had been floating around as a conservative talking point since at least early 2019. Sondland claiming he did not connect Biden to Burisma wasn\u2019t the only time his account appeared to downplay his involvement in the quid pro quo effort, as he also contradicted other officials\u2019 testimony regarding a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials at the White House. Sondland testified that his recollection of the meeting did not square with accounts from officials including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and former top National Security Council official for Europe and Russia Fiona Hill. Both stated that Sondland had talked about investigations with Ukrainian officials during the meeting, and Hill added that it was not credible Sondland could have been oblivious that investigating Burisma was essentially code for the Bidens. Hill testified again on Thursday that Ukrainian officials brought up their desire for a White House visit during a July 10 meeting. As national security adviser John Bolton tried to deflect from answering the Ukrainians, Sondland interjected with a reference to the quid pro quo arrangement. \u201cAmbassador Sondland leaned in, basically to say, \u2018Well we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put underway,\u2019\u201d Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen.\u201d Hill testified that Bolton then immediately excused himself from the meeting. Bolton later instructed Hill to go to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer John Eisenberg and tell him that Bolton was not involved in \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and [White House Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d Hill took the \u201cdrug deal\u201d to mean the exchange of investigations targeting Biden in exchange for a meeting with Trump. The July 10 meeting was an early source of discrepancies in the investigation, and Volker initially denied in his closed-door testimony last month that Sondland raised investigations in the July 10 meeting. But Volker changed his account this week after witnesses such as Hill brought up the meeting and evidence mounted that Volker, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry were part of a back channel to Ukraine that pushed for a quid pro quo. \u201cThe meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate,\u201d Volker said in his opening statement. \u201cWe asked you about that meeting during your deposition and you told us nothing about this,\u201d Schiff asked Volker later in the hearing. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us about this?\u201d",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham\u00a0(R-S.C.) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documentation on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine on Thursday, as the week\u2019s public impeachment inquiry hearings in the House drew to a close. In his two-page letter, Graham asked for a number of call transcripts, notes and communications involving Joe Biden, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, former Secretary of State John Kerry, a former Ukrainian prosecutor and people connected to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. While the impeachment proceedings target President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump\u2019s Republican supporters have attempted to steer the discussion toward the Bidens, claiming that the father-son pair were involved in Ukrainian corruption. The anti-Biden theory may stem from the work of right-wing columnist John Solomon, who has used his writing to elevate questionable sources.\u00a0Although no evidence has emerged to support the theory, some Republicans are now loudly alleging that then-Vice President Biden pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, who may or may not really have been investigating Burisma, in order to shield Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma\u2019s board at the time. In fact,\u00a0many officials\u00a0back then \u2015 including Republicans\u00a0\u2015 thought that\u00a0the prosecutor in question was ineffective against corruption and that his office needed to be reformed. That was a view shared by the Obama administration and key European allies. Nevertheless, Graham made a tenuous connection between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption in his letter. On the same day in 2016 that Ukrainian officials raided the home of Burisma\u2019s founder, Graham wrote,\u00a0Hunter Biden began following a State Department official on Twitter. Graham suggested that fact indicated that \u201cthe two may have initiated conversations regarding Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin\u2019s investigation into Burisma.\u201d The date was Feb. 4, 2016. In the weeks afterward, Graham wrote, Joe Biden held several phone conversations with then-President Poroshenko to discuss removing Shokin over allegations that he himself was corrupt. The prosecutor was removed on March 29, 2016. Graham\u2019s request covers communications between the parties from the day Hunter Biden followed then-Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Twitter to the day of Shokin\u2019s ouster. The senator did not specify a deadline for the materials\u2019 delivery. In the ongoing impeachment inquiry, witnesses have bolstered allegations that Trump leveraged military aid and a coveted White House meeting to improperly pressure the current Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is among the many Democrats seeking to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election and several national polls have consistently shown Biden leading the president in hypothetical match-ups. Language has been adjusted to clarify allegations relating to Victor Shokin.",

      "content": " Rudy Giuliani\u2019s indicted associate Lev Parnas is prepared to tell Congress that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor who was ousted over corruption concerns in a bid to get dirt on Joe Biden, CNN reported Friday. A lawyer for Parnas, a Soviet-born American who has been indicted on federal campaign finance violations, said his client found out about the European meeting directly from the Ukrainian official. \u201cMr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December,\u201d attorney Joseph Bondy told CNN. Shokin was forced out of office by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament in 2016 under pressure from the U.S. and other Western nations over concerns he was soft on corruption. As vice president at the time, Biden was active in pushing for Shokin\u2019s ouster. Bondy also told CNN that Parnas worked to connect Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, with other Ukrainians who allegedly could come up with negative information on former Vice President Biden and the Democrats. If true, Nunes would be the first member of Congress linked to gathering opposition research on President Donald Trump\u2019s political rival from a former foreign official, CNN noted \u2014 and one with a score to settle with Biden, who had pushed for Shokin\u2019s ouster. Nunes declined repeated requests from CNN to comment. The attorney told CNN that Parnas is willing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of its impeachment inquiry. Information could prove explosive for Nunes. Parnas worked with Shokin and Giuliani to peddle the baseless claims that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of the Democrats and that Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine were corrupt because his son was on the board of a Ukrainian company. Bondy indicated in a tweet that he is already talking to congressional leaders about Parnas\u2019s cooperation with the impeachment investigation.",

      "content": " Congressional records show that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) flew to Europe at the same time that Rudy Giuliani\u2019s\u00a0indicted crony Lev Parnas says the congressman met with an ousted Ukrainian prosecutor in a hunt for dirt on Joe Biden. Nunes and three aides flew to Europe last year on Nov. 30 and retuned Dec. 3 at a cost to taxpayers of $63,000, according to congressional records, which were unearthed by the Daily Beast. According to Parnas, Nunes met in Vienna last December with controversial former Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, CNN reported Friday. Shokin was forced out of office by the Ukrainian Parliament over corruption concerns in 2016 under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies. Biden was a key part of the effort to drive him out when he was vice president. Shokin himself informed Parnas \u2014 who has been indicted on federal campaign finance violations \u2014 about the meeting with Nunes, according to CNN. The meeting could turn out to be explosive for Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, who lambasted Democrats and the media at impeachment hearings. Former federal prosecutor Elie Honig noted in a CNN interview Saturday that Nunes may have done exactly what Trump is being accused of: using his office to solicit something of value (dirt on Biden) from a foreign national \u2014 a \u201ccorrupt prosecutor\u201d \u2014 to use in a political campaign. \u201cIt is really bad news for Devin Nunes,\u201d said Honig, who noted the \u201csheer hypocrisy\u201d of Nunes \u201cup on his high horse ... preaching about what\u2019s right and wrong\u201d at House impeachment hearings. His actions are \u201carguably a crime,\u201d said Honig. \u201cIt\u2019s a federal crime for a person to try to solicit something of value to a political campaign from a foreign national.\u201d High-ranking House Democrat Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said on MSNBC that it was \u201cquite likely\u201d that Nunes will now face an ethics investigation\u00a0linked to the meeting allegation. Giuliani said on Fox New that he doesn\u2019t believe Nunes met with Shokin. But \u201cif he did, there would\u2019ve been nothing wrong with it,\u201d he insisted. Donald Trump and his supporters have argued that Biden as vice president tried to stop Shokin from investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board included Biden\u2019s son Hunter. In fact, Biden was working on behalf of the U.S. and other European nations to drive Shokin out because he was soft on corruption. Nunes called reports of Parnas\u2019s claim \u201cdemonstrably false,\u201d but offered no specifics. He told Breitbart Friday that he planned to sue CNN and the Daily Beast, which were the first to report Parnas\u2019s allegations.",
