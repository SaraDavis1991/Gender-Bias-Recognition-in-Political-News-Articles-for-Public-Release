      "content": " In conjunction with their 4th annual conference in Oakland, California on October 14-15, the Network for Public Education is releasing a series of eight video \u201cvoices\u201d defending public education in the United States. The initial video, \u201cWhy are Betsy DeVos and Bill Gates so Afraid of this Grandmother?\u201d features Diane Ravitch, author, historian, teacher, and co-founder of NPE. In a 3-minute clip, Ravitch warns that Betsy DeVos\u2019 agenda is a thinly veiled attempt to privatize schools and redefine citizens into consumers. Ravitch is especially concerned that charters, vouchers and so-called educational choice proposals will undermine American democracy. In the video Ravitch calls DeVos \u201cthe first Secretary of Education in our history who is actively hostile to public education.\u201d In Michigan, where DeVos was able to use her family\u2019s wealth in campaigns to reshape the school system, \u201cthe charter sector is an unaccountable industry that costs the state of Michigan, that costs the taxpayers a billion dollars a year and performs worse than the public schools.\u201d The charter schools have \u201chigh attrition rates, they keep out the kids who have disabilities that need extra care, they push out the kids who are English language learners they push out the kids who are behavior problems.\u201d Ravitch is worried that \u201ccorporate charter chains\u201d will push out public schools leaving families with no options and seriously weakening a national democratic community. According to Ravitch\u2019s educational vision, \u201cpublic school is all about... building a sense of community, having a sense of democracy at the local level, having people from different backgrounds coming together to solve problems and learn how to be citizens.\u201d Ravitch is also critical of the \u201cvoucher system in DC which is held up now as a model,\u201d but \u201ccauses kids to actually lose ground. They enter low performing and they become even lower performing. The achievement gaps there are the largest of any city in the country.\u201d The Ravitch video is a call to action in defense of public education. \u201cThe privatization movement, charters and vouchers is moving forward full speed ahead, defunding public schools, using test scores to say public schools aren\u2019t good enough. The question before us is how can we stop this steamroller that\u2019s destroying the public sector, that wants to privatize everything, that wants to turn us from citizens into consumers.\u201d Ravitch and the Network for Public Education advocate \u201corganized and dedicated and passionate resistance.\u201d Future videos in the series feature Johanna Garcia, an educational advocate from New York City; Jeanette Deutermann, a founding member of Long Island Opt Out and New York State Allies for Public Education; John Kuhn, Superintendent of the Perrin-Whitt School District in Texas; Jesse Hagopian, a Seattle-based high school teacher and editor of Rethinking Schools; Jitu Brown, National director of Journey for Justice (J4J) Alliance; Kymberley Walcott, an undergraduate student at Hunter College-CUNY; and Linda Lyon, a retired Air Force colonel, is president-elect of the Arizona School Boards Association.

      "content": " A few years ago, while in my late 40s, I was trying to impress upon my students the importance of \u201cliving in the moment.\u201d In the attempt to convey that nugget of wisdom I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little different for me, I\u2019m on other side of the hill, and I\u2019ve lived more life than I have life in front of me.\u201d The kids freaked out. I hadn\u2019t meant it to be some sort of morbid commentary on my life situation, but they immediately wanted to come to my aid in my time of need. I realized that, while I was simply pointing out that time passes quickly, my students suddenly wanted to have a discussion about the fleeting nature of mortality. Things move fast when you\u2019re in front of a 200 piece marching band. I turn 50 this week. I wear my greying hair as a badge of honor. Among the changes that have come with age is the belief that the world is really about shades of grey. In my 20s I believed that the world was very black and white, but it turns greyer with each changing hair on my head. Yet, there are 3 things I believe at 50 years old that I thought I would share. 1. I am not always optimistic, but I am hopeful. The last year or so has made me less optimistic about the future of public schools. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t believe that our public schools are America\u2019s most important resource, but there are forces that are actively seeking to weaken them. Betsy DeVos and Koch Brothers (among others) are using their billions of dollars and influence to chip away at the fabric of our public schools. Those of us who are advocates for the important work of our schools don\u2019t have billions of dollars; we simply have our voices and the ability to shape our schools from the inside. It\u2019s an uphill battle, but it\u2019s worth fighting. I am hopeful because the young people who are entering the education profession are doing it at a time when the work is challenging and they are changing lives regardless of what outside forces are doing. I am also hopeful because there are fierce veteran teachers in every building who have generations of students in the world who can attest to the power that one great teacher can make. Ms. DeVos and the Koch brothers will ultimately lose their war to demean the work of public school teachers because it\u2019s a losing proposition. Public schools may lose some battles against these people, but we\u2019re going to win the war for no other reason than we are right. We know that EVERY student can learn, and we know that public schools must exist to make that happen. 2. There is a cost. My home state of Iowa just provided Apple with $208 million in tax benefits to built a data facility in our state. I love Apple. I have the computer, I have the phone, the whole nine yards. Presumably Apple took the $208 million in benefits because it costs a lot of money to open the doors to a successful enterprise. Yet, legislators in Iowa have made it quite clear that they believe schools should be more successful with fewer resources. Because Iowa continues to give away hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to businesses already making gigantic profits, the result is that there is less money for schools and other public services such as mental health and clean water. Class sizes are getting bigger, programming for students is being cut, and this is happening while those same legislators have been systematically taking away the right for teachers to bargain collectively with their school boards. I\u2019m not opposed to creating conditions for companies to want to come to my state; I am opposed to doing it at the expense of our schools and other public services. Our communities want schools with great technology, great curricular and extra-curricular programs, and they want great teachers. Those things require resources. It\u2019s that simple and the people in Kansas can attest to what a system of corporate giveaways leads to. I often wonder if my state and my country are dumb enough to make the same mistakes that Kansas made. The simple answer is, oh yes, we are that dumb. 3. I believe that children are our future (with apologies to Whitney Houston). My school district has recently embarked on work that established some key dispositions we want every student to demonstrate. We are doing all we can to make sure our students are creative, communicators, critical thinkers, collaborators, flexible, adaptable, productive, accountable, and globally and community minded. Who wouldn\u2019t want their young people to have those skills? I am lucky to see great teachers giving young people the chance to demonstrate these dispositions each and every day. Don\u2019t believe the narrative that schools aren\u2019t changing. Schools are adapting in order to face the challenges of the 21st century. In a world where the White House is filled almost entirely with white guys over 50, I am throwing in my lot with young people. If I were a young person, I would be dubious of us old guys; we haven\u2019t always done a very good job. The old guys in government are doing all they can to help the rich get richer and punish those who weren\u2019t born with a silver spoon in their mouths, but I promise there are still a few of us old codgers who want to empower everyone to make a better life for the next generation. I have a son who is going into education and I am confident he is going to make a huge impact on America\u2019s next Great Generation. I may be 50, I may feel 60, but I\u2019m young at heart because I spend my days around smart, passionate, and compassionate young people. My son and his friends are going to get it right, you just wait.",

      "author": "Sebastian Murdock",
      "content": " An Obama-era policy that aimed to better protect victims of sexual assault on campus has been rescinded by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The announcement, made Friday by the Department of Education, rolled back guidance under Title IX on how colleges and universities should handle complaints of sexual harassment and assault.\u00a0Among other recommendations, the guidance had set forth a lower \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard for finding that students had committed sexual assault and thus could be punished. Under DeVos, schools can now raise that standard. \u201cSchools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,\u201d DeVos said in a statement. \u201cThere will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.\u201d In just her first six months, the secretary has also\u00a0rolled back protections for transgender students and seriously scaled down campus rape investigations\u00a0by the Education Department. Know Your IX, a national youth-led campaign to end sexual violence, called the latest decision a betrayal of survivors of sexual assault. \u201cToday\u2019s guidance allows schools to systematically stack campus investigations against survivors and push survivors out of school,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe Department of Education is sending the message that they value survivors\u2019 access to education less than that of the students who assault and abuse them.\u201d The department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has\u00a0360 open sexual assault investigations, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. DeVos is ignoring the \u201cterrifying reality\u201d that 1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted while on campus, according to Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the national women\u2019s advocacy group UltraViolet. \u201cBetsy DeVos and Donald Trump are more concerned with protecting the rights of predators and abusers over the rights of survivors of sexual assault,\u201d Chaudhary said in a statement. \u201cSadly, given President Trump\u2019s history of bragging about sexual assault, this isn\u2019t that surprising.\u201d",

      "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy Devos says that students in the US attend schools that are a \u201cmundane malaise that dampens dreams, dims horizons and denies futures.\u201d She accuses public schools of being stuck in the past. She claims to want innovation. Miriam-Webster defines innovation as follows; 1: the introduction of something new 2: a new idea, method, or device: novelty DeVos and her allies want to give public funds to parents to send their children to any public, charter or private schools, whether or not they are religious and whether or not they discriminate by race, religion or sexual orientation. If enacted, her policies would mean returning to a time when schools were more segregated by race, religion, and class. That is not new or novel. In fact, it is stuck in the past. Segregation is not innovative. It is old school. DeVos believes that individual parents are in the best position to choose a school that is best for their child, rather than democratically elected representatives. That unlimited choice would return us to a time when individual parents\u2019 inclinations and, yes, their prejudices were prioritized over the needs of the communities in which they live and over the needs of the nation. For several decades after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court Decision in 1954 public schools in the US became more integrated. However, that trend has reversed. Public schools are becoming more segregated, not just by race but by socioeconomic status as well. In other words, it is becoming more likely that student will attend schools with children who are more similar to one another than not. That trend may satisfy the narrow interests and proclivities of some, but it is destructive to the nation. Segregated schools are destructive to the nation not just because the inherent inequality of separate education shortchanges particular categories of individual students, but because it deprives all students of the benefit of learning to live across differences in our unalterably diverse country. Integrated schools are not only a moral and democratic imperative but an economic one too. Research indicates that diverse groups are more productive and creative and make better decisions. Learning to participate in diverse groups should start in school not on the job. The idea of mediating racial and socioeconomic school segregation is not new. But, doing something substantive about it would be innovative. Here are several policies that promote the old, but still vital idea and value of diversity and equity. Isolated boutique enactments are not innovative. Widespread systemic implementation would be. None of these ideas are new. However, as a nation, we have only tinkered at designing solutions. We are a nation of interdependent communities and states. Systemic efforts to address inequity have always been limited not by what is possible, but by the political constraints driven by economic elites. The self-proclaimed realists among the empowered condescendingly claim, \u201cWe cannot afford all that.\u201d What they really mean is, \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d It\u2019s time to give priority to the needs of the majority of Americans. More integrated, well-funded schools would benefit everyone. That would be innovative. Arthur H. Camins is a lifelong educator.

      "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who has blatantly abandoned federal protections for students and taxpayers in swiftly enacting the agenda of the predatory for-profit college industry, added insult to injury on Friday, declaring that under the rules adopted by the Obama administration, \u201call one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\u201d DeVos, speaking at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in Michigan, was, based on the Detroit News account of the speech, referencing the Obama Department of Education\u2019s \u201cborrower defense\u201d rule, which implements a long-standing federal law giving defrauded students the right to have their federal loans cancelled. DeVos has put that Obama rule on hold, along with other reforms implemented after revelations of shocking abuses by for-profit colleges \u2015 using deceptive and coercive recruiting tactics, overcharging, underspending on instruction, lying to government oversight agencies, and defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars. Numerous for-profit colleges have faced federal and state law enforcement probes for fraud and other abuses. Yet DeVos, pushed by paid for-profit college lobbyist and early Trump supporter Newt Gingrich, has become the industry\u2019s full-time advocate. DeVos\u2019s Friday remark is false and utterly contemptuous of the hard-working students \u2015 veterans, single moms, and others \u2015 who typically attend for-profit colleges. The rule required much more than that a student raise a hand; the Department had to find that a college had engaged in serious misconduct before any student had loans forgiven. Students who attended honest, quality schools wouldn\u2019t be eligible. In addition, no student would get actual money under the rule, just cancellation of debt incurred by predatory practices. Finally, even such loan cancellation would not be \u201cfree\u201d: The former student would not get their expensive private loans, which many for-profit students are forced to take out to pay the astronomical tuition, cancelled; in most cases they would not get renewed eligibility for grants or scholarships already used; and they already would have put in countless hours studying, commuting, and attending classes, often with no useful degree to show for all their precious time. But perhaps none of that occurred to sheltered billionaire Betsy DeVos, speaking to wealthy Republicans at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan. These defrauded students are not seeking free money, but a chance to start again with nothing after being ripped off by cruel scam artists. Free money would be something like running a fraudulent college that gets millions, even billions, from taxpayers and students without providing a decent education. Or operating deceptive Trump University.\u00a0Or being born the daughter of Edgar Prince, who became a billionaire industrialist. Betsy DeVos is a disgrace.

      "author": "",
      "content": "By\u00a0Niki Kelly FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2015\u00a0Reyna Rodriguez is a poster child for school choice. From a family of six children and two hard-working parents \u2015 a nurse and a firefighter \u2015 she used a tax-paid voucher to graduate from Bishop Luers High School last year in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She is now a freshman at Indiana University. \u201cWithout the continued support from all those in favor of the school choice program, I would not be where I am today academically and spiritually,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in a speech she gave at a school choice rally in January. \u201cI firmly believe that the school choice program and Bishop Luers forever changed my life and will continue to help my family and many other families that are financially burdened.\u201d That speech garnered attention nationally and Rodriguez was soon standing beside U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as a special guest at an Indianapolis conference in May. That\u2019s because Indiana\u2019s voucher program, the largest in the nation after just six years, could be a guide for a national initiative. But not everyone is on board with using tax dollars to pay for religious education at a private school.\u00a0Republican state lawmakers implemented the program and have tweaked it little by little to expand its reach and possibly its entire premise. \u201cThe way it was rolled out was perceived to be more of a focus on our most at-risk students \u2015 to get them out of situations where public schools weren\u2019t performing,\u201d said Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick. She is a Republican, but this is one area in which she disagrees with her political colleagues. \u201cNow when you look at the data, it has become clear that the largest growing area is suburban white students who have never been to public school,\u201d\u00a0McCormick said. The latest report on the Indiana\u2019s Choice Scholarship Program shows that less than 1 percent of those with vouchers came from a failing public school. And most of those using vouchers have never attended an Indiana public school. It is not clear what metrics should be used to gauge whether Indiana\u2019s experiment has been a success. Yet the program has exploded \u2015 from 3,900 students in the first academic year to more than 34,000 in 2016-17. Then-Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) pushed the program at the beginning and said his first goal was social justice \u2015 \u201csimply to rectify the inequity that says wealthy people can choose their kids\u2019 school and low-income people couldn\u2019t.\u201d But Daniels, now in his fifth year as president of Purdue University, said the program was never solely about the academic performance of public schools. \u201cValues and safety are other reasons parents can make that choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI always look at parental satisfaction as a starting point. It\u2019s not just about SAT scores.\u201d Carl Loesch, secretary for Catholic education at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, said that \u201chow we define success can\u2019t be measured by a test. It\u2019s if our kids get to heaven. At the end of our day, the Lord\u2019s going to ask us, \u2018I sent 5,000 kids your way. What\u2019d you do with them?\u2019\u201d He clarified that\u2019s the big picture but academic achievement and artistic growth are also important. Loesch\u2019s focus on God goes to the point that all but a handful of the private schools accepting vouchers are faith-based. Some people criticize the idea of state money going to religious programs, but early on, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the program as constitutional. Betsy Burdick, president of the Institute for Quality Education, said academic success is an obvious metric but it\u2019s not the only one. The group has pushed heavily for choice in Indiana. \u201cI don\u2019t think parents choose a school because they want their kids to fail academically,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cI think that\u2019s inherent in their choice.\u201d But she added there are other measures, including class size, safety and values. An initial study of data from Indiana\u2019s Choice showed students using a voucher saw their math achievement fall on average, although students who remained in private school for four years improved to match or outperform public school students in math and English. Not exactly a resounding victory for voucher supporters. \u201cThe piece used to sell it was all about academics and now they aren\u2019t interested in those comparisons,\u201d said Teresa Meredith, president of the Indiana State Teachers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s now an opportunity for a middle-class white family who might live in an urban area to remove themselves from any challenges that they\u2019re uncomfortable with or take them away from any classes where they might not like the makeup of the class,\u201d she said. The allegation of segregation is showing up as a growing number of those receiving vouchers are white. In the first year, 24 percent of voucher participants were black and now that percentage is 12 percent. Meanwhile, the percentage of voucher students who are white started at 46 percent and has grown to 60 percent. Hispanic involvement has increased in raw numbers but remained relatively steady as a percentage of the total. State Rep. Robert Behning (R-Indianapolis), a choice stalwart, said vouchers are available to all financially eligible children regardless of race. And Robert Enlow, president and CEO of EdChoice, said vouchers serve more children of color than the public schools serve in an average year. He also said that in the 2015-16 academic year, 68 percent of kids taking vouchers were on free and reduced lunch compared to 47 percent in public schools. \u201cI think the thing that bothers me the most in the press is how this program is portrayed as taking significant funding away from the public school system, when in reality it\u2019s about 1.5 percent of their total funding,\u201d said Loesch. He said only 3 percent of students in the state are on vouchers.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t see that number dramatically increasing,\u201d Loesch said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public schools should feel threatened about a huge exodus.\u201d But the impact on public schools is at the heart of the debate as lawmakers provide a pot of money that has to be split among traditional public, charter and private voucher schools. McCormick noted that while lawmakers have increased the dollars, there are also more schools vying for the cash. \u201cWe are all after the same resources so when resources are scarce it becomes difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just money \u2015 it\u2019s teachers, administrators, buildings, support staff, bus drivers.\u201d Students at both public and voucher schools must take the state\u2019s standardized tests and those scores largely make up the A-to-F grades every school receives. The similarities stop there: All private schools in Indiana can choose to have unlicensed teachers, they can discriminate based on sexual orientation, they don\u2019t have a public budget, their board meetings aren\u2019t open to the public, and they can deny admission to students because of grades, disruptive behavior and a child\u2019s special needs. Meredith noted that voucher money has eased financial strains at some churches, which can now use donations to build chapels and other facilities rather than support their schools. Jenny Andorfer, director of admissions for Bishop Luers, said that is simply not true and pointed to the school\u2019s new media center as the latest improvement to an aging facility that was paid for by a fund drive. She said vouchers don\u2019t cover the full cost of tuition and the church still provides financial assistance, especially to families just above the income cutoff. State Rep. Martin Carbaugh (R-Fort Wayne) filed a bill last year to require voucher schools to submit reports showing how money received for each choice scholarship student was used by the school. Behning refused to hold a hearing on the bill, noting that the state provides millions in financial assistance for Hoosier kids to go to college. They can take those scholarships to public or private colleges,\u00a0he said, and no one is asking the University of Notre Dame what they are doing with the money. Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS) has perhaps been hit the hardest by the expanding use of vouchers.\u00a0In an urban center known as the \u201ccity of churches,\u201d there was already a vast network of faith-based schools. FWCS Superintendent Wendy Robinson is passionate when she says lawmakers have created a business of education. And she called out voucher schools for recruiting not just for athletes but for transcripts. One local private school sent an acceptance gift basket with balloons and treats to an eighth-grader at a FWCS magnet school to welcome the student to the private school. After a few of those arrived, FWCS started turning the baskets away. \u201cIt\u2019s now down to a business and how can I attract your students away, but they only want certain ones,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s morally wrong to turn children into the objects of a business model. The kids they want are the ones that they don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money on, \u2019cause then they can make a profit.\u201d Andorfer and the diocese denied cherry picking. And perhaps Daniels offered the best response to all the criticism. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd,\u201d\u00a0the former governor said. \u201cStop blaming the parents because they chose a different place. Provide a safe and effective school and you\u2019ll have no problems.\u201d Robinson has seen almost 4,700 students leave FWCS on vouchers \u2015 and many are leaving A- and B-graded public schools. Dozens return every year too, but there is still a net loss. Overall, the retention rate for voucher students during the school year is 95 percent. It drops to 80 percent from year-to-year as either students are not invited back, parents can\u2019t afford their share of the cost or the family simply decides another option is better. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as whining because it\u2019s the law of the state and, God help us, it could be the law of the land,\u201d\u00a0Robinson said. \u201cBut let\u2019s not play games. Don\u2019t say this is the best thing because you\u2019re taking kids from failing schools. That\u2019s not what we see. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the whole country is going to be sold a bill of goods.\u201d So far,\u00a0DeVos and President Donald Trump have touted a historic education choice proposal but given no details. Meredith said the thought of a national program modeled after Indiana makes her \u201cwant to throw up.\u201d Even Burdick and Enlow \u2015 who have worked for years for choice \u2015 caution against some sort of national voucher, noting that several states have their own system and it isn\u2019t clear how everything would work together. Another option would be to provide a school choice tax credit, which might be folded into the still-under-construction federal tax reform bill. Daniels doesn\u2019t think there should be a national program at all, noting that states now have the power to define their own programs. \u201cI\u2019d be very dubious about anything that added cost to the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be another injustice to dump a pile of debt on these kids.\u201d By Rebecca Klein FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2015\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until the late 1980s, when a group of parents sued, that Fort Wayne desegregated its public elementary schools. At the time, even decades after Brown v. Board of Education made state-sanctioned school segregation illegal, black and white children were mostly siloed into their own facilities within the city\u2019s largest school district. White children received the bulk of the community\u2019s resources, while black students got what was left. Years later, Fort Wayne Community Schools has become a rare bright spot in a country that has largely turned its back on desegregation. The community has been generally supportive as well, and unlike in other places that attempted to desegregate, white families never fled the area in droves. But community stakeholders are now questioning whether Indiana\u2019s voucher program, adopted in 2011,\u00a0may be starting to undo some of these achievements. The state program, which uses public funding to help students afford private schools, is supposed to provide low-income children with the same access to educational opportunities as their more affluent peers.\u00a0Local and national critics of the program say they worry that it actually allows middle-class students to escape diverse public schools in favor of more homogeneous private schools. In Indiana, where the median household income is $49,255, the income eligibility requirement to receive vouchers is liberal compared to that of other state programs. A family of four that earns up to $91,020 is eligible to receive a partial publicly funded scholarship. This means wealthier white families can take advantage of scholarships and potentially self-segregate,\u00a0said Halley Potter, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a public policy research group. These fears did not arise in a vacuum. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, pointed to the racial history of voucher programs as a warning sign. On the heels of Brown v. Board of Education, some Southern officials closed their public schools to avoid admitting students of color. Private school tuition grants were provided to white students so they could attend their own separate academies. To determine whether voucher schools in Fort Wayne could be facilitating a more modern form of white flight, HuffPost examined demographic data for public and private schools between 2011 and 2017, collected by the Indiana Department of Education. Of the 27 out of 28 private schools for which we had data, only four increased their percentage enrollment of white students over that time. Private schools in Fort Wayne overall went from 84 percent white in 2011 to 74 percent white in 2017. Public schools went from 58 percent white to 55 percent white. These numbers suggest that widespread white flight has not occurred since the voucher program went into effect in Fort Wayne. But local critics note there are more subtle forms of segregation. The voucher system, according to teachers and advocates involved with FWCS, has created a two-tiered system consisting of the haves and the have-nots. FWCS Superintendent Wendy Robinson said she has witnessed local private schools actively working to recruit the best and brightest students away from public schools. \u201c[They\u2019re] going after the kids who are the best football players, going after the kids who can help you get [to] state in show choir, going after the speech kids,\u201d said Robinson, whose district boasts a nearly 90 percent graduation rate, higher than the state average. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like college athletic recruiting, that is almost what this has turned into.\u201d Robinson described receiving elaborate gift baskets with balloons from a local private school for some of her students as a recruiting tactic. She also noted that as the income eligibility requirements for vouchers have broadened, the program no longer targets only the poorest students. \u201cVouchers have changed the complexities of parochial schools because now you\u2019re chasing the dollar so you have more diversity. But the voucher doesn\u2019t cover all the expenses in a private school,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI think racial diversity may be something people focus on. The financial diversity is where this is coming down. It has created haves and have-nots.\u201d Meanwhile, private schools do not have to provide the same services for students with special needs as public schools do, leaving public institutions with the responsibility of serving some of the hardest-to-reach students, Robinson said. Mark GiaQuinta, an attorney and former president of the FWCS board, echoed those criticisms. \u201cUnfortunately my belief is that parochial schools are using young adults of color to bolster their athletics. Then they boast about the fact that they\u2019re integrating their schools, but to what extent?\u201d GiaQuinta said. Robert Enlow,\u00a0president and CEO of EdChoice, disagrees. He said there is no available data to support such anecdotes. GiaQuinta and Enlow both said they wish such data were collected,\u00a0even as they diverge on what they think such a study would show. To try to discredit the claims that private schools are cherry-picking students, Enlow pointed to the early results of a study from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Kentucky. The study, currently in the peer review process, shows students on vouchers initially experience dips in math scores, but catch up to their public school peers after four years. \u201cIf the private schools were recruiting the best students, then you would not see a drop-off in the test scores,\u201d Enlow said. Robinson said she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll live to see the end of Indiana\u2019s voucher program, but she will continue fighting for the thousands of kids who remain in her schools. With vouchers, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just desegregation \u2015 it\u2019s economic, it\u2019s social, it\u2019s all kinds of levels. We are using public dollars to have boutique schools.\u201d By Rosa Salter Rodriguez FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2015\u00a0Part of Kelly Pence\u2019s job is counseling parents of children with autism on their educational options, and lately she\u2019s noticed a change in the questions that parents ask. Few want to know whether they should use the Indiana\u2019s Choice Scholarship Program\u2019s vouchers to send their children to a private school. \u201cA lot of our parents just aren\u2019t using them,\u201d said Pence, a mother of two high-school-age children with autism from Garrett, Indiana. \u201cA part of that is just because we have such a difficult time getting services in the first place that wherever you\u2019re getting the services you need, you tend to stay there because moving requires starting over. It\u2019s a hassle,\u201d Pence said. Since 2011, Indiana\u2019s voucher program, touted by supporters as a model for the nation, has allowed parents who meet certain income guidelines to use government money to educate their children outside public schools.\u00a0But relatively few students with special educational needs appear to be using vouchers. That has led critics to charge that private schools are discriminating against such students and that the program is concentrating students with more complicated diagnoses and more expensive needs in public schools, draining them of resources. Indiana Department of Education enrollment statistics show that since the 2011-12 academic year, the statewide percentage of special education students enrolled in nonpublic schools has increased \u2015 from 2.9 percent that first year to 3.5 percent in 2016-17.\u00a0But that is smaller than the increase of about 10 percentage points in special education students enrolled in public schools over the same period. And unlike public schools, which must provide a free and appropriate education to all eligible children or run afoul of disability law,\u00a0private schools can refuse admission to students, including those with special needs. Fort Wayne Community Schools Superintendent Wendy Robinson said that amounts to discrimination based on disability. \u201cIt\u2019s now down to a business \u2015 \u00a0how can I attract your students away, but I only want certain ones,\u201d she said. \u201cWe even have examples of there are four kids in a family \u2015 three of them are gen[eral] ed[ucation] and one is special ed. They actually say to people, \u2018Fort Wayne does such a better job with special education students. The other three we can help you with, but we really don\u2019t have services for your special education student,\u2019\u201d said Robinson. Mark GiaQuinta, former president of the board of FWCS, said local enrollment numbers reflect the situation. In fact, since the voucher program began, FWCS has consistently had between 14.5 and 15.5 percent of its students in special education, for a total of 4,514 students last school year. But several area parochial schools willing to accept students with vouchers \u2015 Central Lutheran School in New Haven, Bishop Dwenger and Bishop Luers high schools in Fort Wayne, and Aboite Christian School in Roanoke \u2015 had far fewer students in special education. Together, they had a total of 104 students in special education last year \u2015 with individual shares ranging from zero\u00a0(Aboite Christian)\u00a0to 6.2 percent (Luers). State statistics don\u2019t reveal how many of those students used vouchers. \u201cWe [public schools] don\u2019t have the choice not to accept them [students with special needs], and we don\u2019t avoid them,\u201d\u00a0GiaQuinta said. \u201cAll children are entitled to a quality education. It\u2019s just that private schools can pick pretty much who they want.\u201d Jon Mielke, superintendent of the Lutheran Schools of Indiana, which is affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, doesn\u2019t see it that way. The law allows parents to make a decision to use a private school they might not otherwise be able to afford, he said in an emailed statement. According to Mielke, area Lutheran schools \u201cwork closely with public school leaders and teachers in efforts to help identify and agree on the types of services that are needed and provided. We willingly collaborate to serve the best interests of students. \u201cNo special-needs resources would flow from the public schools to the nonpublic schools unless there were children enrolled that required those services,\u201d\u00a0he added. \u201cThe legislative intent is that those resources would serve the child.\u201d Phil Downs, superintendent of Southwest Allen County Schools,\u00a0said that his district willingly serves the special needs students at private schools, who can elect to have the public school provide specialized services and therapies. Specialists even go to nonpublic schools if they don\u2019t have an appropriate staff member. \u201cIt\u2019s just unwieldy,\u201d he said. Every year, two or three students with special needs who have vouchers leave private schools for the Southwest Allen public schools, according to Downs. Emelie Workman of Fort Wayne, a parent of two students with special needs,\u00a0did just that with her children.\u00a0Workman said she would have preferred her children be educated in a religious environment, and she liked the small class size and the individualized attention in the smaller religious school they attended for a time. But she found no guarantee that their needs would be met. Even though the Individualized Education Program for a child with special needs is a legal document and presumably binding, only public schools have procedures in place if things don\u2019t go well,\u00a0Workman said. In a nonpublic school, there may be no other recourse than to remove the child if the child has behavioral issues stemming from a disability or a parent is told the child\u2019s needs can\u2019t be met,\u00a0she said. With too few therapists to go around, children in nonpublic schools may also be last on the list to get services,\u00a0said Workman, who has been affiliated with About Special Kids, a statewide parent support organization. Workman recommends that any parent of a student with special needs talk with other parents and educators at prospective schools before making a decision \u2015 and then stay on top of their students\u2019 progress. Her children are both back in public schools. \u201cAcademically, I don\u2019t see much of a difference,\u201d Workman said. \u201cBehaviorally, I feel their needs are being met, and I feel a little more that staff are trained so they can be met. \u201cThey\u2019re doing OK for what they need to be doing.\u201d Pence said many parents of students with special needs are trying to find alternatives to vouchers and to public schools.\u00a0Homeschooling is one, she said, and online schooling is booming. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a huge shift in our population on the autism spectrum that way, said Pence, who also works as a parent ally for the Autism Society of Indiana. Students in one online school, the Indiana Connections Academy, can still access the sports and extracurricular activities of public schools and have the same curriculum, testing and graduation requirements,\u00a0Pence said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s forget the dumb voucher system and go with what these kids need, which is more training and resources [for teachers],\u201d she said. \u201cI just think there are so many of us who have struggled to make it work. ... We\u2019re tired.\u201d By Ashley Sloboda FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2015\u00a0Beth and Heath Bearman come from a family of public school teachers and enrolled their children in public schools. Over time, however, their satisfaction with Fort Wayne Community Schools waned as classes became more disruptive and less like a learning environment, Beth Bearman said. The difference between public and parochial school environments became especially clear, the parents said, after son Enzo\u2019s first day as a third-grader at Saint John the Baptist Catholic School. When asked whether anyone got into trouble, they recalled, the now fifth-grader said yes \u2015 but nobody threw a desk. Vouchers made it possible for the Catholic family of eight to send their children to parochial schools, with one currently attending Bishop Luers High School and two at Saint John the Baptist. Three of their children are in college. Their story is typical of families using the Indiana\u2019s Choice Scholarship Program, said Jenny Andorfer, Luers\u2019 director of admissions. Founded in 1958, the Catholic high school in south Fort Wayne has received\u00a0$6.97 million in voucher payments since 2011-12, with last year bringing about $1.89 million and covering nearly two-thirds of the school\u2019s 617 enrollment. Vouchers don\u2019t pay the full tuition cost, which varies depending on the number of children from a family who are enrolled and whether the family is registered in a diocesan parish. The 2017-18 tuition for one student is $5,775 for registered families and $7,008 for non-registered families, plus $1,220 in fees for every student. Luers, which is owned and operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, also offers financial aid and scholarships. \u201cWe want to make private school education affordable for all families,\u201d Andorfer said. With a maximum capacity of 720 students, Luers aims for 600 students and started this academic year with 587, she said. Since 2010, its student body has become more diverse, racially and economically. Seven years ago, 81 percent of its students were white; last year, 57 percent were. The Hispanic population has grown from 6 percent to 19 percent, and the black population has nearly doubled, from 9 percent to 17 percent. In 2010, 15 percent of Luers students were on free or reduced lunch; last year, 37.5 percent were. The special education population has remained steady at about 6 percent in recent years. Luers\u2019 graduation rate has consistently surpassed 95 percent in recent years, and its overall school A-to-F grade fell from an A to a B only last year. The state\u2019s accountability system considers multiple factors in grading schools, including graduation rates and student performance in math and English. It has faced criticism from school leaders, who have said the grades aren\u2019t an accurate reflection of what happens in classrooms. With more voucher students, Andorfer conceded there has been a slight negative impact on Luers\u2019 overall academic performance. But she said the school makes its expectations clear to students and doesn\u2019t pick and choose only the best. \u201cIf we look at a student\u2019s application and we feel that they have failing test scores, failing grades, we take into account the middle school they attended, and if we feel it\u2019s not in that student\u2019s best interest to be here or that they cannot be successful here, then we do reserve the right to not accept them,\u201d Andorfer said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t just pick the highest of the high, the best of the best students. We have a lot of average-level students. We feel there is opportunity for improvement in every child,\u201d she added. Andorfer, who guided reporters on a brief tour at the start of the school year, noted that the building itself doesn\u2019t have many frills. Analogue clocks hung in the hallways, and chalkboards were visible in classrooms. A window-lined hallway provided a courtyard view, where Andorfer commented on the school\u2019s size.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the whole building, almost,\u201d she said. Like any high school, flyers dotted the walls to promote various programs, a trophy case boasted of students\u2019 accomplishments, and athletes\u2019 lockers were decorated. But this clearly is a parochial school. Students wore uniforms \u2015 generally, red or black polo shirts paired with khakis or black pants \u2015 and in one hallway there was a wooden cross draped in rosary beads.\u00a0A chapel greets students in the entryway. On its website, Luers said it offers a \u201cfaith-based, college preparatory curriculum\u201d that educates students spiritually, academically and socially.\u00a0The religious education is an aspect that both students and parents said they value. Rica Rodriguez, a junior, likes that students can talk about religion any time with any teacher, she said. Camille King, a senior whose parochial school experience began with neighboring Lutheran South Unity School, isn\u2019t Catholic but said she isn\u2019t treated any differently. \u201cA community isn\u2019t meant to be the same,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have picked a better school, honestly.\u201d Her younger sister, junior Ani King, said she appreciates teachers\u2019 willingness to help students. After trying everything to stay in FWCS, the Bearmans said their children have found success at Luers. They pointed to its small classes \u2015 the school website boasts of a 16:1 student-teacher ratio \u2015 and students\u2019 behavior. \u201cThey were there to learn,\u201d Heath Bearman said. \u201cIt has everything here.\u201d The Journal Gazette teamed up with HuffPost for an in-depth look at the Indiana\u2019s Choice Scholarship Program, commonly referred to as the voucher program. Stories by Journal Gazette reporters Niki Kelly, Ashley Sloboda and Rosa Salter Rodriguez and HuffPost reporter Rebecca Klein examine how the initial concept in Indiana expanded, the faith-based curriculum some schools use, whether vouchers are affecting the demographics of schools, where students with special educational needs attend, and the effect on home school enrollment.

      "subtitle": "The legislation was written in response to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rolling back Title IX protections.",
      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " A group of Democratic lawmakers\u00a0unveiled legislation at a press conference\u00a0in Washington, D.C., on Thursday afternoon that would protect Title IX after recent rollbacks by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The new legislation, named the Title IX Protection Act, would codify into law three Title IX guidances that were created during the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton administrations. These guidances \u2015 the 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX document, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and the 2001 Guidance on Title IX\u00a0(originally issued by the Clinton administration and then re-issued by the Bush administration)\u00a0\u2015 were designed to help all parties involved in sexual assault cases navigate the campus reporting process. \u201cStudents should be chasing dreams, not running from sexual predators,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Lois Frankel\u00a0(D-Fla.)\u00a0said at the press conference. In the beginning of September, DeVos announced that she would\u00a0begin rolling back guidances like those named above.\u00a0She called the current campus reporting process a \u201cfailed system\u201d that is \u201cincreasingly elaborate and confusing.\u201d Rep.\u00a0Jackie Speier\u00a0(D-Calif.) has spearheaded the proposed legislation with help from the Democratic Women\u2019s Working Group. Speier was joined at the press conference at the Capitol Visitors Center by other congressional lawmakers,\u00a0including House Minority Leader\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0(D-Calif.), Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D-N.H.). Anti-sexual violence and advocacy groups including End Rape On Campus, Know Your IX, the National Women\u2019s Law Center and the American Association of University Women\u00a0were also in attendance. \u201cThe Title IX Protection Act is very important because Secretary DeVos\u2019 decision to roll back vital protections for victims of campus sexual assault is an alarming reminder of the White House\u2019 dismissive and cruel attitude towards survivors and students,\u201d Pelosi said during the press conference. Speier told HuffPost that this bill is key to ensuring that all parties involved in sexual assault accusations handled under Title IX are treated fairly. \u201cThe most important element of this legislation is that we create a standard that cannot be changed,\u201d Speier said.\u00a0\u201cWe have a secretary of education who is trying to take us back in time and we\u2019re not going back in time. We\u2019re not going back to a period of time when a woman who is raped is not believed or her case is swept under the rug.\u201d Jess Davidson, managing director of End Rape On Campus, told HuffPost that this bill will send a strong message to survivors that they are not alone. \u201cA few weeks ago, Secretary DeVos sent survivors of sexual assault a terrible leadership signal, one that clearly told survivors the United States government is not with them, and that survivors are on their own when it comes to the enforcement of their own civil rights. But advocates and survivors know we can\u2019t go back,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThe Title IX Protection Act sends the opposite message to survivors, and to all who want fairness in Title IX processes, as it reiterates the importance of strong Title IX enforcement and of fair, impartial and trauma-informed processes.\u201d During the presser, Speier and other speakers addressed an argument often used against the Title IX reporting process. In Title IX cases, the accused must be found guilty by only a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d That\u2019s the standard of proof usually used in civil rights cases and other civil court matters. It is lower than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal cases, where the punishment could be prison time. Preponderance of the evidence means simply that it is more likely than not that the accused did the alleged deed. The standard is used in Title IX cases where the potential punishments relate to the accused\u2019s status at school \u2015 suspension, expulsion, etc. \u2015 and do not threaten a loss of liberty, like prison. Critics of the Title IX reporting process often contend that the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard makes it too easy to wrongly convict the innocent.\u00a0But Speier and others at the press conference argued for the standard by putting sexual violence on college campuses in the larger context of civil rights. \u201cThe law is clear, women have the right to an education free from discrimination and sexual violence,\u201d Speier said. \u201cBecause\u00a0[preponderance of the evidence]\u00a0is what is used in all civil rights cases, and isn\u2019t this a civil right\u00a0\u2015 to be able to go to school and not be subjected to violence?\u201d Watch the full press conference below. CORRECTION:\u00a0An earlier version of this story mistakenly said that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d is the same as \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d It is, in fact, a third standard of proof that falls between \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d and \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d",

      "content": " Segregation and the evil twins\u2013racism and inequity\u2013are the divide and conquer gifts that keep on giving\u00ad to the rich and taking from everyone else. Over the decades, the wealthy and empowered have found ways to dress up their barely concealed essential messages: We deserve what we have. Inequality is the natural order of the world. Caring about others is for losers. Winners care about themselves. If you are unhappy with your station in life, blame yourself. Some of you would be better off if was it not for Them. The latest incarnation of message obfuscation is the vaguely democratic-sounding term, school choice. The push for expansion of charter schools- publicly funded, but privately controlled\u2013 and for vouchers to offset a portion of the tuition for private schools is the old wolf in new sheep\u2019s clothing. Equity and universal high quality have never been the goals of school choice, the roots of which are resistance to desegregation. Its latest advocates do not suggest vouchers so that the poor can attend elite, expensive private schools. They do not demand adequate funding for all schools. They do not want to give students experience interacting with one another across class or race. They certainly do not want to end the defining characteristic of the status quo, rationing of quality by socioeconomic status. Their rhetoric notwithstanding, they have other goals: Undermine public sector unions to reduce their political power, as well as members\u2019 pay and health and retirement benefits; Pander to subgroups to undermine political unity; Undercut the power of unified organizing by offering an escape hatch for the so-called \u201cdeserving poor.\u201d Advance the advantages of privilege. Segregation is the simple enabling strategy. Contrary to popular mythology, post-Brown v. Board of education segregation was not so much the product of individual choices, but rather intentionally segregative transportation, zoning, housing and employment policies. Policy and preexisting bias were mutually reinforcing. Increased isolation was the inevitable result. People naturally trust folks they know and interact with regularly. Economic and racial isolation turns the distant \u201cthem\u201d into an abstraction, easily stereotyped in the absence of countervailing evidence informed by direct contact and shared struggle. It is the empowered\u2019s Tower of Babel tactic. Sow distrust and hatred, so that even when diverse citizens speak the same language, building for the common good becomes too challenging and threatening. However, unequal education in the United States is not new. Historically, schooling has been inequitable and divided between a free take-all comers public system and selective, tuition-based secular and religious institutions. Expensive private schools provide an alternative for the children of the wealthy to get an exclusive education. Religiously affiliated schools offer another choice, again at parent expense. Historically, these schools have operated mostly outside the public sphere and without significant public oversight. By definition, private schools serve the needs and values of a subset of the population, rather than the common good. Nonetheless, public schools were designed to meet and be accountable for societal purposes. However, because of the tradition of local control and funding, US public schools have never been equitable. In New York for example, while the 100 wealthiest districts spent on average more than $28,000 in state and local funding per kid in 2012, the 100 poorest districts in the state spent closer to $20,000 per student. As long as the bulk of school funding comes from property taxes, education will never be equitable. Schools that are the most well endowed get enriched education and the less well off scrape by\u2013 reinforcing existing inequities. Schools do not provide the mythical latter of opportunity but rather reinforce a fixed caste system. Even within public schools, tracking and some special programs facilitate in-school segregation and rationing of education opportunities. During the term of President Obama, there was a push to expand funding for charter schools, despite evidence that they increased racial and socioeconomic segregation and were on average no more effective. The election of Donald Trump and his selection of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education has energized demands for tuition vouchers for private schools. Taken together, these efforts represent a profound bipartisan shift in how we think about the purpose of public support for education and school governance, from meeting community needs and values to attending to the demands and proclivities of individual shoppers in a marketplace. Shopping for an increasing variety of products does not lead to equity. My neighbor has a Porsche roadster. They are available in showrooms. It sure would be fun to drive one, but alas it\u2019s not in my budget. Its availability does not provide choice. More to the point, online shopping provides an infinite variety of products. But more money stills buys higher quality food, clothing, and shelter. The availability of high-quality product choices does not produce equity. In fact, differential quality is an essential feature of a competitive marketplace. Rather than addressing the structural causes of growing inequity, appeals to market-based education play on parents\u2019 anxieties about their children losing out in the intense competition for well-paying jobs. Similarly, school choice rhetoric reinforces some parents\u2019 bias that going to school with certain others will hurt their children. It encourages parents to take a belligerent, you can\u2019t-make-me, stance. Born in 1950, I grew up during the civil rights movement. I remember hearing, \u201cYou can\u2019t legislate morality. You can\u2019t force people to like each other,\u201d in opposition to desegregation legislation. With characteristic eloquence, Martin Luther King had an apt response to such arguments: \u2026.we must go on to say that while it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated. It may be true that the law cannot change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless. That is that sentiment that provided the moral justification for emancipation, anti-trust, child labor and voting rights laws, as well as employment insurance, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, occupational health and safety and environmental regulations. The current crop of Republicans in control of so many local, state and federal legislative and executive branches want to turn the clock back on it all. President Trump, rather than to urging moral behavior and for people to care more about one another, uses his pulpit to bully and to worship selfishness-driven tribalism. Each generation brings a new Them, but the strategic ideology is clear and consistent: Do not question the structure of the economic and social order. We get the lion\u2019s share. Fight amongst yourselves for the leftovers. Coupled with the exaltation of selfishness, segregation is a time-tested way for the privileged to remain in control. School choice is the latest euphemism for leaving everyone to fend for themselves in a dystopian world of ruthless competition. When centrists Democrats adopt choice rhetoric, they abet conservative ideology. They enable labeling of legislative solutions to help people as being about Them, not us. If the last presidential election is any indication, Democratic politicians are reluctant to take on the rhetoric of choice and the segregation and inequity it supports. That will only change when voters demand that candidates adopt a different, explicitly pro-integration, stance. It is time to bring back the old labor slogan: An injury to one is an injury to all.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Cabinet secretaries are rarely household names. For every Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton, there are 10 Ann Venemans and Anthony Foxxes. If an official does gain wider name recognition, it\u2019s usually someone in a higher position like the attorney general or secretary of state. Under President Donald Trump, however, something different is happening: Everyone hates the education secretary, the person who is 16th in line to the presidency and controls only 3 percent of the federal budget. Lawmakers and activists say they\u2019ve heard more about Betsy DeVos than any other Cabinet secretary ever \u2015 often from people who aren\u2019t usually politically engaged. \u201cAll the time,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThis is true in town halls, when I\u2019m walking down the sidewalk in my neighborhood, when I go into the grocery store. People come up to me to talk about Betsy DeVos. There\u2019s just no comparison. I\u2019ve never had this happen with any other Cabinet secretary.\u201d \u201cThere is no one in America more unpopular than Betsy DeVos,\u201d\u00a0said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). \u201cTo have somebody who scorns public education, who never went to a public school, her children never went to a public school... to be in charge of public education is an outrage.\u201d A\u00a0HuffPost/YouGov poll\u00a0conducted Oct. 9-10 found that, indeed, DeVos is Trump\u2019s most unpopular Cabinet official, alongside Jeff Sessions, the much more visible attorney general.\u00a0DeVos and Sessions both have a 42 percent unfavorability rating in that poll. When asked which Cabinet members are doing a \u201cbad job,\u201d 32 percent of respondents picked Sessions and 32 percent picked DeVos. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said DeVos is doing a worse job than her predecessors, with just 20 percent saying she\u2019s doing better and 12 percent saying she\u2019s doing about the same. A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll had similar results: DeVos was Trump\u2019s most unpopular Cabinet secretary, with a net favorability rating of -12 percent, followed by Sessions, who was at -4 percent. And in June, New York Times columnist Gail Collins conducted a reader poll for worst Trump Cabinet member.\u00a0DeVos won. DeVos is now a household name for many Democrats \u2015 so much so that she has essentially become a new boogeyman for 2018. Democratic candidates nationwide are mentioning her in their fundraising emails. A Democratic operative who works on Senate races said that emails and communications about DeVos \u201ctend to perform very strongly.\u201d Democratic groups certainly mounted a determined campaign against DeVos\u2019 confirmation, and they continue to hammer her today. But they did that for a number of nominees, most of whom didn\u2019t become as despised as the education secretary. What\u2019s so different about DeVos? In the Trump Cabinet, it turns out, you can more or less get away with being a plutocrat, a dilettante or a saboteur hostile to the very mission of the agency you mean to lead. You just can\u2019t get away with being all three at once. The Department of Education did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Spend any time talking to people about DeVos, and what you\u2019ll hear over and over is that she has no experience in public education. She never went to public school, never sent her kids to public school and never worked in a public school. (She did volunteer in one, however.) What DeVos had was political connections, thanks to her family\u2019s fortune. She\u2019s a billionaire, the daughter-in-law of the co-founder of Amway, the multilevel marketing corporation. She\u2019s long been active in the Michigan Republican Party and is a major donor. \u201cMy family is the biggest contributor of soft money to the Republican National Committee,\u201d she wrote in Roll Call in 1997. \u201cI have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect something in return. We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues. We expect a return on our investment.\u201d DeVos\u2019 driving cause has been \u201cschool choice.\u201d In Michigan, she led the push to use public dollars to pay for private school tuition through vouchers and other means. That experiment has been a success for banks and hedge funds, and a resounding failure for many students. A 2016 report by the Education Trust-Midwest, a nonprofit, concluded that under the model shaped by DeVos, \u201cMichigan\u2019s K-12 system is among the weakest in the country and getting worse. In little more than a decade, Michigan has gone from being a fairly average state in elementary reading and math achievement to the bottom 10 states. It\u2019s a devastating fall.\u201d DeVos wasn\u2019t an education expert. She was, as The Washington Post pointed out, essentially a lobbyist who used her money to push an agenda that didn\u2019t have much evidence of success to back it up. Her defenders, however, say she is a passionate advocate\u00a0of returning control of education to parents, so that they can decide how their money is used. She has used her money to commit herself to education, these defenders say, and she\u2019s dedicated to helping children. Democrats and education experts in certain circles knew about DeVos before Trump nominated her for education secretary. But she wasn\u2019t widely recognizable \u2015 until her confirmation hearing, that is. DeVos\u2019\u00a0performance at her January hearing may have been one of the worst ever for a Cabinet nominee. She didn\u2019t know about a key federal law that protects students with disabilities. She tried to argue that guns may be acceptable in schools,\u00a0saying a school out West, for example, might need to protect against grizzly bears. She confused two different ways to measure student achievement \u2014 by proficiency or by growth \u2014 even though they\u2019re hot topics of debate in education circles. And she refused to commit to enforcing federal regulations meant to protect student borrowers from programs that leave them buried in debt with few employable skills. \u201cShe seemed to know very little about public education,\u201d said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who was a member of the committee that questioned DeVos. \u201cAnd of course, her office is one where someone should know an incredible amount about public education.\u201d DeVos\u2019 disastrous performance translated to internet gold for the activists opposing her. Clips of DeVos struggling to answer questions from Democratic senators quickly went viral. \u201cTo be honest, she just did all the work for us at the hearing,\u201d said one Democratic congressional staffer who requested anonymity to speak openly. \u201cShe was so good at explaining how unqualified she was for the job.\u201d Franken was the one who questioned DeVos about the difference between the \u201cproficiency\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d approaches to measuring student achievement \u2015 a difference that DeVos eventually admitted she didn\u2019t know about. \u201cIn the aftermath of her hearing, I did hear a tremendous amount about my questioning of her and the whole hearing in general,\u201d Franken said. About a week after the hearing, Franken was out to dinner with former Vice President Walter Mondale at a restaurant in Minneapolis. Mondale took the senator to the back of the restaurant to meet the staff. \u201cThere was a guy who was carrying plates to wash, and he just said to me, \u2018Thanks for your questions to DeVos. Please vote against her,\u2019\u201d Franken said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t someone who was a member of the teachers\u2019 union, at least as far as I can tell. He was working in the kitchen. That happened a lot. It was people from all walks of life who were just taken with how bad that hearing was.\u201d Josh Nelson is deputy political director at the progressive activist group Credo, which mobilized against DeVos\u2019 nomination. His group has done thousands of petitions over the past decade, but they\u2019ve never seen anything like the response to DeVos. \u201cCREDO has fought to block the confirmation of more than a dozen Trump nominees and the campaign opposing Betsy DeVos resonated with our members more than any of the others,\u201d Nelson said in an email. \u201cOur petition generated 1,500,000 signatures \u2015 far more than any other petition we have ever run... We believe it was the largest petition opposing a cabinet nominee in U.S. history.\u201d Their members also made more than 100,000 phone calls to Senate offices, working closely with unions \u2015 the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association \u2015 and other progressive groups. NEA said that in just one month, it sent more than 1.2 million emails and made more than 40,000 phone calls concerning DeVos\u2019 confirmation. Parents and teachers are highly networked. They organize school concerts, field trips, bake sales and all sorts of other events on a daily basis. As it turns out, they can also organize opposition to a Cabinet secretary. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an outpouring like that,\u201d said NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia. \u201cAnd by the way, those weren\u2019t all our members.\u201d NEA members posted messages to Facebook urging others to oppose DeVos, Eskelsen Garcia said, and then \u201cthey called their friends and neighbors, they organized their church groups. They got a lot of parents and community folks to make those phone calls too.\u201d Some people have wondered whether DeVos has taken extra heat because she\u2019s a woman \u2015 one of just two in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Meghan McCain, author and daughter of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said she found the backlash to DeVos \u201ca little sexist.\u201d Thurston Domina, an associate professor of education policy at the University of North Carolina, told NPR that DeVos is \u201cno more clueless or ideologically awful than some other appointees, but we have a cultural role for a man who\u2019s sort of a cowboy and comes in.\u201d Because of this double standard, Domina said, DeVos comes off looking like a \u201clady who lunches.\u201d Eskelsen Garcia, the first female president of the NEA in 25 years, rejected the idea that DeVos is facing greater opposition because of her gender. \u201cBetsy DeVos is unpopular because of her policies,\u201d she said. \u201cAny attempt to make her somehow the victim of some kind of discrimination herself is absolutely not supported by anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d DeVos isn\u2019t the first female education secretary \u2015 that was Shirley Hufstedler, who held that position during the Carter administration. Most recently, Margaret Spellings served as education secretary from 2005 to 2009. Over the years, AFT has clashed with plenty of government officials \u2015 including those in Democratic administrations. But there was a key difference, said Randi Weingarten, the union\u2019s president: \u201cThere was always a common ground... about public education. They didn\u2019t actively try to kill what is foundational to democracy.\u201d DeVos, of course, did end up getting confirmed. But the circumstances were embarrassing: Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie, giving her the smallest margin of confirmation ever. Pence had to cast a vote in his role as president of the Senate because two Republican senators \u2015 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2015 decided to join with a united Democratic caucus in opposing DeVos\u2019 confirmation. In a speech announcing her opposition, Collins expressed her surprise at DeVos\u2019 unfamiliarity with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which had flummoxed the nominee during her hearing. Ultimately,\u00a0Collins said, an education secretary needs to support strengthening public education. \u201cThe mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cI am concerned that Mrs. DeVos\u2019 lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify, and assist with those challenges, particularly for our rural schools in states like Maine.\u201d Murkowski, like Collins, is from a rural state and said she was concerned that DeVos wasn\u2019t fully committed to helping students \u201cwho are not able to access an alternative choice in education as in so many of my communities.\u201d Also key to Murkowski\u2019s opposition, she said, was the outpouring of disapproval from Alaskans. \u201cI have heard from thousands \u2015 truly thousands of Alaskans who have shared their concerns about Mrs. DeVos as secretary of education,\u201d she said in a speech on the Senate floor. \u201cThey\u2019ve contacted me by phone, by email, in person. Their concerns center, as mine do, on Mrs. DeVos\u2019 lack of experience with public education and the lack of knowledge she portrayed at her confirmation hearing.\u201d Alyse Galvin, a founding member of Great Alaska Schools, was a major spearhead of that opposition, which targeted both of the state\u2019s senators. She and other education advocates in Alaska organized a \u201cBetsy DeVos Tie-Breaker Telethon\u201d on Facebook Live, urging people to call them and give their thoughts about DeVos. They then displayed the results and noted where they were coming from. \u201cIt was a really obvious visual reminder to people about where Alaskans stood with DeVos,\u201d Galvin said. The top reason people said they opposed DeVos was because of her lack of experience in public education. \u201cEvery teacher \u2015 and I would say a lot of parents \u2015 know the name \u2018Betsy DeVos,\u2019\u201d Galvin said. \u201cAnd I would say most people in the nation, up until this year, have never known who their education secretary is... We\u2019ve trusted that it\u2019s going to work. When word got around that this person has never even set foot really as an educator in public education, there was no doubt that people were going to start paying attention.\u201d Republicans who oppose DeVos say it\u2019s not against the party\u2019s philosophy to support public education. Indeed, the vast majority of Americans send their children to public schools, and for the most part, people are happy with their local schools. Ginny Evans is a high school teacher in a Dallas suburb and a member of the NEA. She voted for Trump. \u201cSchool choice is, to me... whether I\u2019m going to have my child go to [public] school in Plano or go to school in Lewisville,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not charter schools. I\u2019m going to keep our dollars in public education. And there is no way our most vulnerable \u2015 our special education kids \u2015 there is no way they can even get the quality education that they deserve in a charter school. There\u2019s not enough there.\u201d David Kinsella is a high school teacher in Prince William County, Virginia, who identifies as a moderate Republican (he didn\u2019t vote for Trump). He, too,\u00a0is a member of the NEA,\u00a0and he said he doesn\u2019t like that DeVos seems more interested in helping the \u201ccharter school industry\u201d than helping public schools and the students who attend them. He noted that in many places, like Virginia, there isn\u2019t much demand for charter schools. A genuinely conservative approach, he said, would be to respect those choices rather than pushing charter schools on communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a history of supporting public schools,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why suddenly we all have to change because Betsy DeVos arrives on the scene. All Republicans [aren\u2019t] going to change their philosophy and say, \u2018OK! Out with public schools. Let\u2019s bring in the private charter schools and let\u2019s help that industry and help them get ahead.\u2019\u201d DeVos may be in office, but the opposition to her hasn\u2019t stopped. Just days after her confirmation in early February, she decided to visit a middle school in Washington, D.C. She encountered protesters, who shouted \u201cShame!\u201d and forced her to retreat to her car with her security detail. \u201cI respect peaceful protest and I will not be deterred in executing the vital mission of the Department of Education,\u201d\u00a0DeVos later said. \u201cNo school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation\u2019s schoolchildren.\u201d Since then, DeVos has consistently faced protests. Betsy DeVos at GWU #SupportSurvivors #INeedTitIeIX https://t.co/Os2o7geXXc One of the most notable protests occurred in May at Bethune-Cookman University, a historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida. Students booed DeVos, who was giving a commencement address, and about half of the graduating students turned their backs on her. Dominik Whitehead, a BCU graduate, was the lead organizer. He decided to do something about DeVos\u2019 appearance at his alma mater after hearing that she had co-opted HBCUs for her own agenda, saying historically black schools were pioneers of \u201dschool choice.\u201d In reality, HBCUs were a response to Jim Crow laws that barred African-Americans from attending white schools. In other words, they didn\u2019t really have much choice. Ultimately Whitehead organized more than 60,000 people to sign online petitions objecting to DeVos\u2019 speech. DeVos has aggressively pushed her agenda since taking office, even though she had little support for her confirmation. \u201cYou\u2019d think that someone who came in in that manner would tiptoe carefully and adopt a listening posture and move with some humility,\u201d said the congressional staffer. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen that. She\u2019s been gangbusters on a lot of things, particularly on our rolling back all sets of protections for students.\u201d After reportedly putting up an initial resistance, DeVos went along with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use the restroom that best corresponded to their gender identity. DeVos rescinded Obama administration rules on how colleges should handle sexual assault, leaving advocates worried that the move could help shield those who have been accused. She withdrew consumer protections for student loan borrowers and reinstated heavy fees for some borrowers who default. And in April, DeVos hired a woman to head the Office for Civil Rights who once claimed she\u2019d experienced discrimination in college for being white. \u201cWhat she\u2019s been effective in is creating a platform for herself and for her colleagues that now, people have to fight against,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cSo instead of taking the tremendous energy and aspiration and the hope and glow in the aftermath of changing No Child Left Behind and rolling up our sleeves to focus on teaching and learning, we\u2019re back in the school wars. How is that fair to kids?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking,\u201d Warren said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even pretend that she\u2019s working for students... She has filled the room with for-profit college hacks and has clearly picked their side over and over. She\u2019s been very effective at rolling back rules that were in place to try to get some accountability with the for-profit colleges.\u201d The fight has continued to energize activists and union members. \u201cWe have never seen more energy than we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cWe have actually had our phones ringing off the hooks. The increased activism of our members and parents and community leaders saying, \u2018Put me in, Coach. What can I do to fight this horrible agenda of this secretary of education?\u2019 We\u2019ve never seen anyone in charge of public education and protecting students be so remiss in their job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awoken an activism by a lot of people who weren\u2019t active before,\u201d Weingarten said. Warren has kept an eye on DeVos with a project called DeVos Watch. The oversight campaign focuses on how DeVos\u2019 work affects student loan borrowers. Over the summer, Warren had a victory when she teamed up with Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to stop the Department of Education from giving management of the entire $1.2 trillion federal student loan portfolio to just one company, rather than the nine companies that currently manage it. \u201cYou\u2019d have a completely non-competitive market for the student loan serving and a too-big-to-fail company, making, I should say, hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis is big money. And she just announced that this is how she\u2019s going to do it.\u201d DeVos backed off from her plan after Blunt and Warren introduced their legislation. \u201cChange is possible. I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve seen it even with Betsy DeVos,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be in these fights.\u201d DeVos is still moving forward where she can. Last week, she rescinded 72 documents that were intended to provide clarity about students\u2019 rights and how schools can use federal money. The Education Department determined the documents were unnecessary. One of the key federal laws they provided guidance on? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \u2015 which DeVos hadn\u2019t heard of at her hearing just a few months ago. Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.

      "content": "As a teenager, Michael McLaughlin wanted to go to college. He had several disabilities, including dyslexia and bipolar disorder, which threatened to make the road ahead more difficult. He sometimes had trouble paying attention in class and understanding directions. He also had an IQ of 115 \u2014 on the upper ranges of what is considered average. With help, he should have been able to graduate alongside his classmates, ready to pursue higher education. But instead of graduating from Bartlett High School in Anchorage, Alaska, in four years, he took six. After high school, he did odd jobs for several years. \u201cOur son\u2019s education was a waste,\u201d his mother, Michelle McLaughlin, said. \u201cWe could get no one to listen or do what was needed.\u201d There are 6.6 million public school children enrolled in special education in the United States, 13 percent of all public school students. Kids like Michael make up the vast majority of them. Their disabilities shouldn\u2019t keep them from achieving the same standards as their peers \u2014 and experts estimate that up to 90 percent of students with disabilities are capable of graduating high school fully prepared to tackle college or a career if they receive proper support along the way. Yet, just 65 percent of special education students graduate on time, well below the 83 percent four-year rate for American students overall. Many of those that do earn their diplomas find themselves unprepared for the real world. After high school, students with disabilities have lower college graduation rates than their peers and earn less once they join the workforce. \u201cFor many children with disabilities, they\u2019re capable of far more than their schools give them credit for,\u201d said Kitty Cone, a special education lawyer who works in Arkansas. Their education \u201cfalls far short of what federal law requires or even what common sense dictates.\u201d In interviews with 45 parents and students and more than 50 other experts, advocates and lawyers across 34 states and the District of Columbia, families and advocates described systemic problems with special education in high school. They spoke of teachers inadequately trained to support special education students. Of districts lacking the funding to provide needed supports. Of expectations lowered to the point where they do students more harm than good. Of very capable students being pushed into \u201calternate\u201d diploma programs, limiting their future options. Of students not being taught the soft skills, like communication and organization, that they\u2019ll need in college and the workforce. And of parents who either don\u2019t know what their children\u2019s rights are or feel forced to fight long battles to make schools comply with the law. Related: Is teacher preparation failing students with disabilities? Special education is a broad umbrella. It includes students with specific learning disabilities (such as dyslexia and dysgraphia), hearing and vision impairments, emotional disabilities, autism and more severe cognitive delays. Students\u2019 needs vary greatly by disability, and even two students with the same disability may need different supports to keep up with their peers. In some cases that means being given more time on tests or being offered the option of using technology for written assignments; in other cases it means having an aide in the classroom working with them individually. Experts and parents widely agree that most students with disabilities do best academically and socially when they are in the same classrooms as their nondisabled peers, and when they are given the same opportunities to plan out their postsecondary lives. Even students with cognitive delays may be able to attend modified post-secondary programs if given adequate preparation and encouragement in school. But too often, schools aren\u2019t providing students with the appropriate help. Janae Cantu has dyslexia and thus struggles with reading. Her disability doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t analyze and discuss a text; she can be taught strategies to help her decode words more easily. But, instead of getting that kind of instruction or preparing for college-level work with her peers, she left her general education classes in Oklahoma for one period every day in ninth grade to go to a special education class where students did activities like making cars out of cereal boxes and racing them. Mark Nelson also has dyslexia, along with dysgraphia, which means he has trouble writing. \u00a0Rather than being challenged, he was allowed to use a teacher-made study guide while taking exams at his California high school. He said he never had to study or actually learn anything to get an A. One time, a teacher gave his special education world history class all of the answers to their final exam. Tyrone Colson is on the autism spectrum. His high school placed him on a track to get an alternative diploma, which would have made it impossible for him to enroll in most colleges or apply for most jobs. His mother fought the decision, and he graduated from his Washington, D.C., high school with a traditional diploma, proving that his disability didn\u2019t prevent him from meeting the same standards as his peers. Sean Sieleni, who has Down syndrome, was exclusively enrolled in general education classes for 11th grade, where he successfully studied with his peers, completed homework and took modified exams. Yet a teacher suggested that Sean should stop taking academic classes and have a \u201cfun\u201d senior year. Instead, his mom worked with the school district administrators to expand their expectations for Sean, and he reenrolled in general education classes for 12th grade. Kenyatta Burns, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder, was able to grasp grade-level material \u2014 she just needed a bit more help staying focused and completing long assignments. Instead, she was passed from class to class at her high school in North Carolina. When she dropped out at the end of ninth grade, she didn\u2019t know how to use punctuation or do multiplication. Such negative experiences can have lasting consequences. Parent and special education advocate Sri Hatharasinghe-Gerschler recalls teachers telling her she\u2019d never go to college when she was in middle school in the mid-1990s. Hatharasinghe-Gerschler had been diagnosed with a reading comprehension disability in elementary school. She said she never got the help she needed or was taught strategies to work on comprehension. Instead, her high school placed her in remedial courses for math and English, where she just fell further behind. Her parents hired a tutor to help her. After she graduated high school, she enrolled in a junior college to study child development while working full time. Two years later, she transferred to the University of California, San Diego. Post-graduation, Hatharasinghe-Gerschler provided in-home behavioral services for students with disabilities and now helps parents and students navigate the special education system. At age 34, despite her ultimate success, she said her understanding of grammar and writing remains so poor that she still feels angry about her experiences in the classroom. The system, she said, \u201cfailed me.\u201d Related: STUDENT VOICE: They told me I\u2019d never go to college but I just finished my freshman year \u2014 what about all the other students with autism? For years, many parents and students said, the system has denied their legal rights. Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which passed in 1975, all special education students are entitled to a \u201cfree and appropriate education\u201d that will allow them to reach their fullest potential. Technically, the U.S. Department of Education is responsible for monitoring state compliance with IDEA. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos raised eyebrows in January during her confirmation hearing when she said that requiring taxpayer-funded schools to follow IDEA was \u201ca matter best left to the states.\u201d When pressed later on in the hearing if she was aware that IDEA is federal law, she said she \u201cmay have confused it.\u201d Not long after, the Department of Education overhauled the IDEA website. In a July speech, DeVos reaffirmed that she believed special education was important. \u201cEnsuring that all children with disabilities have appropriately ambitious goals and the chance to meet challenging objectives is a priority for the department,\u201d DeVos said in a July speech. Since then, the department has eliminated 72 guidance documents that dealt with the rights of special education students. At least two dealt directly with the transition from high school to college or career. The department said the documents were \u201coutdated, unnecessary, or ineffective.\u201d The department did not respond to a request for comment on the rescinded transition guidelines or the administration\u2019s plans for IDEA oversight At a local level, courts and state education departments often play an important role in making sure special education law is followed. They have found districts guilty of many violations of the federal law, including isolating special needs children from their peers and, in the case of one South Carolina district, shortening the school day for special education students. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a student with autism whose parents accused a Colorado school district of not doing enough to help their son meet his educational goals. The court ruled that students with disabilities must be provided an \u201cappropriately ambitious\u201d education. \u201cA student offered an education program providing \u2018merely more than de minimis\u2019 progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,\u201d wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts in a unanimous ruling. That ruling \u201creinforced that you can\u2019t educate children based on stereotypes,\u201d said Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who sits on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. She has a son with cerebral palsy and has focused on special education throughout her political career. \u201cWe all want our kids, no matter how they learn or what their physical condition is, we want them to be challenged to reach their full potential.\u201d  The quality of special education services can differ vastly from district to district. \u201cWe tend to see the same districts over and over again,\u201d Cone, the Arkansas special education lawyer, said. \u201cI still think that they\u2019re lazy in general and they will continue to try to play the odds that they won\u2019t get sued.\u201d For every reported case in which a school or district is taken to court, experts and lawyers said there are many more in which families never realize they have the right to fight for better conditions for their children. \u201cOnce they\u2019re given this diagnosis, [schools] can use it and say, \u2018Oh your kid has autism so they can\u2019t be in a mainstream class,\u2019 \u201d advocate Hatharasinghe-Gerschler said. \u201cParents that don\u2019t know any better fall into this trap and say, \u2018Fine.\u2019 \u201d Parents that do know better often don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of months or years of court battles, or may not have the time or resources to do so. Many parents said that advocating for their children\u2019s rights can feel like a full-time job. Even when students get the services to which they\u2019re entitled, some parents said, schools and teachers don\u2019t grasp how individual disabilities affect different children differently or have reasonable expectations for what their children should be able to do. Oftentimes, parents find themselves not only advocating, but problem-solving as well. Back in Anchorage in the early 2000s, Michelle McLaughlin started doing research on her own to determine why her son, Michael, was falling further behind in elementary school. Every special education student is assigned an Individualized Education Program (IEP), which describes the student\u2019s current ability level, sets goals and details any accommodations they will need for classes and exams. Schools are supposed to revise the IEP document annually in partnership with the student\u2019s parents and conduct a barrage of assessments to reevaluate the child\u2019s disability classification every three years. Over the course of Michael\u2019s education career, he received some help, such as a class with other students with mood disorders in which he worked on communicating and controlling his behavior. Michael\u2019s IEP allowed him to work in small groups, have extended time on assessments and use a computer for written assignments. But he still struggled. McLaughlin said that at one point school officials delayed updating his IEP for several months. Her research turned up strategies, like using sheet protectors to outline the page, which helped him focus, and trying to decode words from the beginning instead of from the middle \u2014 strategies she said his teachers were unaware of. With these strategies in place, McLaughlin said, Michael was able to focus and comprehend more when reading. Related: Unmet Needs: Children with disabilities caught in the voucher crossfire Margie Gillis, president of Literacy How, a Connecticut-based group that trains teachers and administrators in literacy instruction, said that what Michael and students like him really need is \u201cexplicit and systematic instruction in the structure of language.\u201d Unfortunately, she added, teachers often don\u2019t know how to address this \u2014 a problem that stems from teaching preparation programs. Special education is a matter of neuroscience: the brains of students with disabilities work differently than those of students in general education. Many students and adults with disabilities interviewed explained how they process information in a particular way. Experts say that teachers need to learn the physiological differences in order to effectively teach their students. A lack of understanding often results in an assumption that students can\u2019t handle academic material.  Yet general education teachers rarely have much training in special education. Few teacher education programs require more than one class on students with disabilities. Meanwhile, special education teachers have to balance completing extensive federal paperwork with planning lessons and teaching classes. And they aren\u2019t always taught everything they need to know to handle the full range of disabilities they face in the classroom, or even, Gillis said, how to teach reading to children with different neurological obstacles. Carole Banks, a special education teacher at a charter school in California, said that the only reason she felt prepared during her first year of teaching was because she\u2019d worked as an assistant special education teacher for five years prior to going to school for her teaching degree. \u201cMy program, they tried, but if I hadn\u2019t had experience, I would have just been feeling like I was thrown in the middle of an ocean with no life raft,\u201d she said. Banks works in a resource lab for special education students who are mainstreamed in general education classes; they come to see her for one period each day. She said she holds her students to the same standards as their general education peers. But she\u2019s had to do research on her own to find strategies for how to help them cope with their disabilities. And the schools she\u2019s worked for have not had the funding to send her to an expensive training session for a reading program she believes would be extremely helpful. \u201cIn every setting I\u2019ve worked in, special ed has been the red-headed stepchild,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI wish that special education services were more respected and people knew how much special education teachers do.\u201d Many parents interviewed expressed frustration that special education teachers aren\u2019t better supported and said that the root of the problem is not individual teachers in the classroom but administrators\u2019 lack of understanding and districts\u2019 lack of incentive: special education services are usually expensive to provide. Under IDEA, the federal government is supposed to fund 40 percent of the \u201cexcess cost\u201d of educating children with disabilities \u2014 meaning the money above and beyond what\u2019s needed for a general education student. The government has never reached that target, forcing school districts to make up the difference \u2014 when they can afford it. In fiscal year 2015, the federal government gave states about $12 billion, or 16 percent of the excess costs, according to a report by the New America Foundation, a nonprofit public policy institute. To reach the 40 percent target would require roughly $18 billion more, the report said. Senator Hassan said she plans to push for full funding during the next budget process. \u201cNobody likes to be the family or the child whose special education needs create budget cuts in other parts of the school budget,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know how important it is to make sure that investments in education don\u2019t fall just on local and state taxpayers.\u201d Related: OPINION: \u2018I spend half my days in accelerated classes and the other half in special ed\u2019 When Michael McLaughlin was in sixth grade, his mother gave up on the public schools and began to homeschool him. But by tenth grade, she worried that he was missing out on the opportunity to communicate and work with his peers, an important skill his autism diagnosis made even more critical. Michael returned for half days. His special education teachers worked with him on the goals that they\u2019d laid out in his IEP. \u201cA lot of it was socialization,\u201d McLaughlin said about her decision to send him back to school. \u201cAnother part of it was \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel like he was getting enough with homeschooling with me. We were just concerned with what his education was going to be.\u201d McLaughlin worried that he wouldn\u2019t be prepared for college. He enrolled full time in 11th grade. At first, the district wanted to put Michael on a track to earn a certificate of attendance. Unlike a GED, a certificate is not equivalent to a high school diploma and is not accepted by most colleges and employers. Certificates of attendance are designed for students with severe cognitive limitations who cannot meet high school academic standards. Experts say there is little accountability to make sure districts aren\u2019t limiting students like Michael \u2014 who, with special education supports, can handle a rigorous high school curriculum \u2014 to those alternate certificates. McLaughlin said that the school also wanted him to transition into a life skills program. Life skills programs are designed for students with ability levels and IQs far below Michael\u2019s. He would have learned independent living skills, like doing laundry and grocery shopping. \u201cThat just made absolutely no sense to us,\u201d McLaughlin said. Michael\u2019s family insisted that he earn a regular diploma, even if it took him a little longer than other students. He ended up repeating a year of high school to earn more credits. (Under IDEA, special education students are allowed to stay in public schools up to the age of 21.) He graduated in 2013. Bartlett High School principal Sean Prince said he can\u2019t speak to the details of Michael\u2019s experience because he did not become the school\u2019s principal until 2014, a year after Michael graduated. But he said he feels \u201chelpless\u201d that he couldn\u2019t do something to help Michael. \u201cI wish we could have helped more,\u201d Prince said. \u201cI hate that [Michael\u2019s] mom still has bad feelings about this. \u2026 It really makes me feel bad if she felt we weren\u2019t doing a good job because we try to meet the needs of students every day.\u201d Now 24, Michael is enrolled in a three-year painting apprenticeship. His dad works as a foreman at a painting company and has hired Michael. He\u2019ll continue to work for his dad when he completes the program. McLaughlin said Michael likes the program. But she said his experiences at school hurt him in more ways than limiting his future career and education options. \u201cIt\u2019s impacted him in every possible way that it can,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe biggest thing my son still struggles with, to this day, is his feeling of self-worth.\u201d This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with HuffPost.

Students who are diagnosed with one or more of the 13 disabilities covered by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act qualify for special education. Those disabilities include learning disabilities, autism, emotional disturbance, and hearing impairment. Within each disability, there is variance in severity and how the disability reveals itself in a classroom. Special Education Glossary IEP: Every student covered under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act receives an IEP, or an Individual Education Program. This lengthy plan details a student\u2019s current performance levels, goals for the next year, the classes a student will take, and any accommodations or modifications the student will receive in classes. Transition plan: The transition plan is part of an Individual Education Program and must be developed before a student with a disability turns 16, according to federal law. This plan uses student interests and other information about a student to outline post-high school goals. Accommodations: Accommodations include strategies like allowing a student to take extra time on a test, type an assignment instead of hand writing it, or sit in an area that helps a student focus. These are described in a student\u2019s IEP. Modifications: Modifications are changes in assignments and curriculum meant to assist students with disabilities in mastering content, such as providing fewer answer choices on assignments or tests, or providing text at an appropriate reading level for a student.",

      "content": " The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the process of dismantling the rules issued under President Obama to constrain the predatory abuses of for-profit colleges. At the end of the troubling first day of what\u2019s called negotiated rule-making, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak.\u00a0 I was the only person to get up to speak.\u00a0I said this: This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from predatory college abuses. What the department now is doing is a bad idea, and I have submitted public comments explaining why I believe that. But that\u2019s the Washington, D.C. perspective on what\u2019s going on here \u2015 injury to a rule. From the perspective of those hard working Americans who have been defrauded and abused by for-profit colleges \u2015 veterans, single mothers, immigrants, the forgotten Americans whom President Trump promised to fight for \u2015 this proceeding, and this department\u2019s failure to act on 99,000 pending applications for relief, is about something much more urgent. Almost all the students seeking relief attended for-profit colleges. Many were left with useless credits and degrees from high-priced, low-quality programs. They were deceived into enrolling and left without the careers or salaries they were promised. Many nonetheless faithfully pay down their student loans every month, even if that leaves them with little money for rent, food, clothes for their children. This proceeding, and the delay in acting on claims, is causing immense hardship and heartbreak for those Americans. My colleagues and I know these men and women. They\u2019re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. They\u2019re not asking, as Secretary DeVos recently suggested, for \u201cfree money,\u201donly to have some of their debts cancelled, so they have some chance for a future. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos and this department are now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout. There is no sound public policy rationale for delaying and rewriting the borrower defense rule. The rule would quickly start saving money for taxpayers, by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those predatory schools that produce widespread loan defaults. But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting reveal its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. This process today is, instead, about the corruption of our system. It\u2019s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity \u2015 deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And this proceeding extends and embodies that scandal. State attorneys general \u2015 Republicans and Democrats \u2015 will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media outlets, and advocates for students and veterans will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors in this industry, even if your department continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice and the wrong side of our people. Keep the existing borrower rule. Help these students.

      "content": " When Betsy DeVos announced she would repeal and replace the Obama administration\u2019s rules to protect students and taxpayers against predatory for-profit colleges, one of the signs that she was stacking the deck was the announcement that her Department of Education would select not the traditional two, but instead four, representatives of for-profit colleges to be on the panels of stakeholders charged with trying to negotiate new rules. But as the rulemaking process began this week in Washington \u2015 featuring a determined effort by the department to prevent the public from watching the proceedings live \u2015 it was apparent that there are, in fact, more than four for-profit college industry representatives around the table, and some are associated with schools that have troubling records. On the department\u2019s published roster of negotiators to remake the \u201cborrower defense\u201d rule \u2015 establishing standards and procedures for students injured by their schools to obtain debt relief \u2015 are \u201cAaron Lacey Partner Thompson Coburn LLP\u201d and  \u201cBryan Black Attorney.\u201d They are the two negotiators in the category of \u201cgeneral counsels/attorneys and compliance officers.\u201d While the borrower rule would apply to all of higher education, from the Ivy League to community colleges, both men selected for the panel role of education lawyer are deeply connected to the for-profit college industry. Lacey\u2019s law firm Thompson Coburn represents the collapsed, disgraced ITT Tech for-profit college chain on a number of matters, including a case in which a former employee alleges a breathtaking series of frauds and abuses against students. Thompson Coburn also lobbied for ITT in Washington, D.C., and it has been subpoenaed by the trustee in the ITT Tech bankruptcy. In addition, Thompson Coburn lobbies for giant for-profit chain Adtalem (DeVry), which has faced multiple federal and state law enforcement investigations. Aaron Lacey also spoke the past two years about the Obama rules at the annual meeting of the for-profit colleges\u2019 discredited trade association, CECU. But Lacey\u2019s connection to predatory schools is more extensive: From 2010 to 2014 he worked as senior vice president of regulatory affairs and strategic development at Vatterott College, a for-profit college with a disturbing record. In 2013, a jury in Jackson County, Missouri, awarded Jennifer Kerr $27,676 in actual damages and $13 million in punitive damages from Vatterrot. (The trial judge cut the punitive award to about $2 million because state law caps punitive damages; in 2014, a Missouri appeals court upheld the verdict.)  Kerr, a single mother from Lee\u2019s Summit, Missouri, saw Vatterott\u2019s TV ads and visited the campus in 2009 to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. A Vatterott recruiter told Kerr that the school didn\u2019t have a nursing program, but it did offer a medical assistant\u2019s degree. With that credential, the recruiter said, Kerr could make $15 to $17 an hour, and her Vatterott credits would transfer to a nursing program and put her on the \u201cfast track\u201d to being a nurse. But after signing for more than $27,000 in loans and being in the program for over a year, Kerr discovered that her program wasn\u2019t a medical assistant program at all \u2014 it was a medical office assistant program. You might not need college for that. Vatterott staff then told her that a medical assistant\u2019s degree would require more classes and another $10,000. Kerr told the Kansas City Star that, after leaving Vatterott, \u201cFor a long time, I was just devastated and depressed. The diploma I got was worthless.\u201d But she was pleased that her case exposed Vatterott\u2019s misconduct: \u201cThe truth finally came out. Not just for me, but for everyone like me who was fooled \u2026 I feel like in doing this, maybe others will have the courage to do the same. Maybe they\u2019ll see that they have a recourse.\u201d Jennifer Kerr was not the first student to be deceived by Vatterott College. The Senate HELP Committee obtained internal training documents from Vatterott that seemed to instruct recruiters  to use exploitative tactics: \u201cWe deal with people that live in the moment and for the moment. Their decision to start, stay in school or quit school is based more on emotion than logic. Pain is the greater motivator in the short term.\u201d Another Vatterott document described the target market for recruiters: \u201cWe serve the UN-DER world, Unemployed, Underpaid, Unsatisfied, Unskilled, Unprepared, Unsupported, Unmotivated, Unhappy, Underserved!\u201d Vatterott\u2019s recruiting abuses have led to bad outcomes for many enrolled students. As of 2014, the year that Lacey left Vatterott, the percentage of Vatterott students defaulting on their student loans within three years of dropping out or graduating was a very high 26.6 percent. In 2012, eight of Vatterott\u2019s 39 programs failed all three tests of the Obama Administration\u2019s initial \u201cgainful employment\u201d rule, which established bare minimum standards to penalize schools that consistently leave their students with insurmountable debt. Gainful employment is the other rule that DeVos is preparing to override. Student bulletin boards are full of complaints about the quality of a Vatterott education. In 2009 and 2010, three top Vatterott executives pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy to fraudulently obtain federal student grants and loans for ineligible students in 2005-06 by providing false general equivalency diplomas (GEDs) and doctoring financial aid forms. As to the other legal compliance lawyer picked for the panel, Bryan Black\u2019s law practice, based on his website, focuses on matters including personal injury, dog bites, slip and fall, criminal defense, divorce, \u201cliquor accidents,\u201d and \u201cBryan\u2019s latest verdict \u2018NOT GUILTY\u2019 in $14,000,000 cocaine trial.\u201d He promises \u201cno fee until you win.\u201d There\u2019s no mention of college compliance, although it\u2019s clear from Black\u2019s writings and comments already in the rule-making that he is well-versed in relevant issues. That is likely because, in fact, Bryan Black is more than simply an \u201cattorney.\u201d In a July 2016 comment Brown submitted to the department, extensively criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s proposed borrower defense rule \u2015 the very rule he is now charged with helping to remake \u2015 Black identifies himself as \u201cOwner 4 Paul Mitchell Schools, Michigan - Florida.\u201d  Paul Mitchell is a franchise for-profit beauty school.  Unlike many for-profits, there are no pending law enforcement investigations of the schools of which I\u2019m aware, although, as with many schools, there are numerous student complaints posted online. Black and his wife Tina are for-profit college owners. Black appropriately acknowledged his connection to Paul Mitchell schools in introducing himself as the rule-making meetings began, even if DeVos\u2019 department failed to note it in publishing its negotiator roster. As to the official for-profit college representatives on the panel, attorney Linda Rawles, who this morning at the rule-making session complained that other negotiators were \u201cretweeting folks who say the whole for-profit industry is evil\u201d and suggested that Secretary DeVos should remove from the panel negotiators who use social media, posts on her website rave reviews of her work from people working at Bridgepoint Education, Kaplan, the University of Phoenix and InfiLaw \u2015 all for-profit higher education companies with troubling records and multiple law enforcement investigations. While the department\u2019s list of negotiators references Rawles simply as working at \u201cRawles Law,\u201d her LinkedIn profile indicates that she is concurrently \u201cRegulatory Counsel\u201d at Bridgepoint Education, with dates listed as June 2013 to the present. [Update 12-07-19: Rawles has now changed her Bridgepoint title on LinkedIn to read \u201cOutside Regulatory Counsel.\u201d]  Bridgepoint has a remarkably bad record of abusing students and taxpayers, and a long trail of law enforcement investigations; the school\u2019s recent shady maneuvering to keep receiving veterans\u2019 educational benefits being only the latest example. Bridgepoint is also the company where Robert Eitel worked as chief compliance officer before he joined the Department of Education as senior advisor to DeVos. If the presence of all these for-profit college lawyers on the negotiating panel isn\u2019t enough, the DeVos department has already slanted the entire discussion, with one-sided issue papers that read like for-profit college industry attacks on the Obama rule, and an announcement by the department\u2019s chief negotiator that the talks would start from a baseline of the 1994 law, rather than the 2016 final rule \u2015 a lawless position.

      "author": "David Halperin",
      "content": " After Betsy DeVos announced she was dumping the Obama gainful employment and borrower defense rules \u2015 measures designed to protect students and taxpayers against predatory abuses by for-profit colleges \u2015 and was starting a new round of rule-making, there was evidence that she was stacking the deck. Her Department of Education issued completely one-sided \u201cissue papers\u201d around which the sessions would be framed. The department\u2019s chief negotiator for the meetings made a legally dubious announcement that the borrower defense discussions would start from a baseline of a 1994 law, rather than the 2016 Obama final rule. And the department persistently refused to allow members of the public to livestream the proceedings. There was also the DeVos department\u2019s striking announcement that it would include not only the traditional two representatives of for-profit colleges to be on the panels of stakeholders charged with trying to negotiate new rules. Instead, there would be four designated representatives of for-profit colleges on each of the borrower defense and gainful employment panels. But as the rule-making process has unfolded in the past few weeks, it has become apparent that there are, in fact, many more than four for-profit college industry representatives around the table. Worse, some of these negotiators are associated with schools that have particularly troubling records, the kinds of schools whose predatory abuses \u2015 deceptive recruiting, high prices, low spending on education, financial recklessness, and barring of lawsuits by injured students \u2015 were imperiled by the very Obama rules that the negotiators are now empowered to throw away. DeVos is letting the foxes draft rules for the henhouse. Perhaps we couldn\u2019t expect otherwise from a Secretary of Education selected by the founder of predatory Trump University. Borrower defense negotiators As we reported last month during the opening sessions on the borrower defense rule, negotiators chosen by the DeVos Department include these individuals: \u2015 Linda Rawles, one of four people selected by by the DeVos department to represent for-profit colleges on the panel, has the title \u201cregulatory counsel\u201d at Bridgepoint Education, a for-profit college company with a remarkably bad record of abusing students and taxpayers, and a long trail of law enforcement investigations, including a blockbuster lawsuit filed last week by California\u2019s attorney general with detailed and startling allegations of illegal business practices. The department didn\u2019t note Rawles\u2019 connection to Bridgepoint on its negotiator roster, and nor did Rawles mention it in introducing herself at the start of the rule-making. Bridgepoint, which has a strong stake in getting rid of the Obama accountability rules, is also the company where Robert Eitel worked as chief compliance officer before he joined the Department of Education as senior advisor to DeVos. [Update 12-07-19: Rawles has now changed her Bridgepoint title on LinkedIn to read \u201cOutside Regulatory Counsel.\u201d] \u2015 Aaron Lacey, a negotiator chosen by the department to represent \u201cgeneral counsels/attorneys and compliance officers\u201d is a partner with the law firm Thompson Coburn, which represents the collapsed, disgraced ITT Tech for-profit college chain and lobbies for giant for-profit Adtalem (DeVry); both companies have faced multiple federal and state law enforcement investigations. Lacey previously was senior vice president of regulatory affairs and strategic development at Vatterott College, another for-profit college with a disturbing record and legal violations. \u2015 Bryan Black, the other legal compliance lawyer picked, has in fact mostly worked as a personal injury lawyer. Although the DeVos department did not disclose it on its negotiator roster, Black, as he noted in introducing himself at the first rule-making session, is the owner of four Paul Mitchell for-profit beauty schools. But there are several others on the borrower defense panel with ties to for-profit schools. They include: \u2015 Greg Jones was chosen by the DeVos department as one of two negotiators to represent all of the private non-profit colleges in the United States. Jones is president of the non-profit Compass Rose Foundation. Compass Rose operates career colleges in Florida \u2015 Sunstate Academy and Jones Technical Institute. According to an IRS filing, Compass Rose in 2015 paid Greg Jones $247,474, paid his father Donald Jones, the foundation\u2019s CEO, $280,577, and paid Donald\u2019s wife Sharon Jones, the treasurer, $174,092. But those hefty non-profit salaries for the Joneses may not reflect the full measure of their incomes over the years. A complaint filed with the IRS alleged that a deal by Compass Rose to sell Southwest Florida College in 2009 to the firm AEA Investors, which has since merged the school into for-profit Southern Technical College, gave the Joneses millions of dollars in consulting fees and for a non-compete agreement. The IRS rejected the complaint without providing a reason. In an email to me, Greg Jones said that the complaint to the IRS \u201cwas a baseless claim.\u201d (AEA Investors operates the former Compass Rose schools through its subsidiary Sextant Education Corp. According to the Washington Post, Betsy DeVos is or was invested in a trust that \u201chas an indirect financial stake\u201d in Sextant/AEA. An AEA Partner, John Cozzi, was, for more than a decade, a board member at predatory ITT Tech.) In 2007, while Compass Rose owned Southwest Florida College, the foundation entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to resolve liabilities from a department program review. Compass Rose was required to pay the department $567,723 and to repurchase federal loans totaling $608,400. According to a former Southwest employee, the school\u2019s financial aid office was improperly signing loan documents on behalf of students. Greg Jones said by email, \u201cThe discrepancy was discovered by our non-profit administration and was immediately self-reported to the United States Department of Education and the Inspector General\u2019s Office.\u201d Greg Jones spoke on a panel addressing the Obama regulations at the 2016 annual meeting of the for-profit colleges\u2019 main trade association, CECU (formerly APSCU), a group that has relentlessly sought to block the Obama rules and previously included as members some of the most notoriously bad companies in the industry, such as Corinthian Colleges, EDMC, ITT Tech, Kaplan, Career Education Corporation, DeVry, Bridgepoint, ATI and FastTrain. CECU uses Trump sycophant and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to advocate against accountability measures. Also speaking at the same CECU meeting, on a panel addressing the gainful employment rule: fellow negotiator Aaron Lacey.  (The other negotiator chosen by the DeVos department to represent non-profit colleges on borrower defense is Ashley Ann Reich, an official from Liberty University, whose president, Jerry Falwell, has publicly opposed the Obama rules.) \u2015 Michale McComis, executive director of ACCSC, is the main negotiator selected by the department to represent accrediting agencies. As of last year, 343 of the 390 institutions accredited by ACICS were for-profits, and some are former for-profit Corinthian/Everest campuses subsequently run by non-profit debt collector ECMC. After the Obama Department of Education last year determined that the notoriously lax accreditor ACICS no longer merited the federal recognition required to make schools eligible for federal student aid, ACCSC became the national accreditor of choice for for-profit schools. \u2015 Chris DeLuca, one of the negotiators formally representing for-profit colleges, was for nine years the chief financial officer and in-house lawyer for a company that owns a chain of for-profit cosmetology schools. DeLuca, like Aaron Lacey and Greg Jones, spoke on a panel \u2015 his covering the borrower defense rule \u2015 at the 2016 CECU convention. Gainful employment negotiators The second set of negotiations, this time on gainful employment, started this morning, and again there are extra negotiators with ties to the for-profit college industry, some quite troubling: \u2015 Sandy Sarge, a negotiator selected to represent chief financial officers and business officers, worked, according to her bio, from 2007 to 2012 at Alta Colleges, the company that ran for-profit Westwood College. Sarge started at Alta as Divisional CFO for Westwood and says \u201cher principle supervisor was the President of Westwood Colleges.\u201d Later she became senior vice president \u2013 Operational Finance for Alta, overseeing Westwood and the company\u2019s other schools. Although I\u2019m not aware of any evidence tying Sarge to misconduct at Alta, the company had a disgraceful record during her tenure there: In 2009, Alta agreed to pay the U.S. government $7 million to resolve allegations that the company\u2019s schools in Texas submitted false claims for federal student grants and loans; the Justice Department alleged that Alta\u2019s Texas colleges obtained its required state licenses by misrepresenting to the state that they complied with job placement reporting requirements and that their interior design programs complied with requirements for a professional license. In 2012, Westwood paid $4.5 million to settle claims by Colorado\u2019s attorney general that it had engaged in deceptive business practices \u2015 misleading prospective students, engaging in deceptive advertising, and failing to comply with Colorado\u2019s consumer lending laws. In 2014, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued Westwood, alleging that the school, starting in 2004: Attorney General Madigan\u2019s complaint included devastating allegations of wrongdoing with respect to Westwood\u2019s criminal justice program, which was pitched to low-income students in Illinois and cost more than $75,000: And this cruel trick: Westwood settled the Illinois case in 2015 for $15 million. A few months later, the school shut down. Alta Colleges, owned by the Boston private equity firm Housatonic Partners, was getting as much as $338 million a year \u2014 more than a third of a billion dollars \u2014 from U.S. taxpayers. \u2015 Stephen Chema, representing \u201cgeneral counsels/attorneys and compliance officers\u201d on the gainful employment panel, is an attorney with Ritzert & Leyton. Peter Leyton of that firm has long advised for-profit colleges and for more than a decade served on the board of their troubling trade association CECU. At a 2014 APSCU conference, Leyton presented a 124-page Powerpoint analyzing the gainful employment rule and dismissing lawsuits and law enforcement actions against the industry as the product of \u201c[s]tudent and disgruntled former employee complaints\u201d and \u201cplaintiff\u2019s attorney \u2018trolling.\u2019\u201d Leyton, like borrower defense negotiators Lacey, Jones, and DeLuca, spoke on the Obama rules at the 2016 meeting of the anti-accountability CECU group. \u2015 Jeff Arthur, one of the negotiators representing for-profit colleges, is vice president of regulatory affairs & chief information Officer at ECPI University. In December 2015, the Virginia Department of Veterans Services withdrew its approval for a campus of Medical Careers Institute, part of for-profit ECPI, to receive GI Bill education funding, because it found the school had engaged in a series of deceptive practices, including introducing a new testing requirement for nursing students without notifying the students of the impact on graduation if they failed to pass; withholding student transcripts against the published school policy; and \u201can overall lack of clarity and consistency in communicating school policies and changes.\u201d In the current round of rulemaking meetings, as well as during such sessions in the last years of the Obama administration, for-profit college representatives have complained to the department that their industry was being portrayed as villainous. In response, department representatives and hired meeting facilitators have asked advocates for students on the panel not to heavily criticize the industry or to name particular schools or companies. But now that the DeVos department has disgracefully stacked the negotiator deck with people tied to some of the worst abusers in the for-profit college industry \u2015 like Bridgepoint, ITT Tech, Westwood, Vatterott, and CECU \u2015 negotiators, as well as the public, need to speak up. Bonus negotiator fact: John Ellis of the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, representing state AGs on the borrower defense panel, was briefly famous as \u201ccorner guy\u201d when he worked in Washington for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).",

      "content": " The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the next step in dismantling the rules issued under President Obama to constrain the predatory abuses of for-profit colleges against students and taxpayers. Last month, the department moved toward taking apart the \u201cborrower defense rule,\u201d which created standards and procedures for students injured by their schools to obtain debt relief. This week, the rule on the chopping block is \u201cgainful employment,\u201d\u00a0which established bare minimum measures to penalize schools that consistently leave their students with insurmountable debt. Today, at the end of the troubling first day of what\u2019s called negotiated rulemaking\u00a0on the gainful employment rule, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak. I was the only one to speak, and I said this: This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from well-documented abuses by some career colleges. Blocking the gainful employment rule means that more students will enroll in programs that will ruin their financial futures. These students, as before, will be veterans, single mothers, people of color, immigrants, and the forgotten Americans President Trump promised to fight for. Many will enroll because of false promises about the selectivity of the school, the urgency of enrolling immediately, the cost of attending, transferability of credits, job placement, starting salaries. Many will enroll in programs that aren\u2019t strong enough to help them succeed. Even if these students graduate \u2015 and many don\u2019t \u2015 and even if they get the job they dreamed of \u2015 and many won\u2019t \u2015 they may not earn enough to pay down their loans, because the tuition was just too high. That is the problem the GE rule addressed, implementing a law passed by Congress in 1965. My colleagues and I know hundreds of men and women who are buried in debt from attending dishonest schools, or simply overpriced schools. They\u2019re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos is now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout. The gainful employment rule would save money for taxpayers by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those schools that leave students worse off than when they enrolled. But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting suggest its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. There are many student success stories; I know some of these students, too. Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. The department announced in January that about 800 programs failed the GE test \u2015 less than 10 percent of all GE programs. I\u2019m dismayed that owners whose programs passed or came close to passing GE don\u2019t want to step up and make their programs work, instead of fighting to trash regulations that would put their most unscrupulous, irresponsible competitors \u2015 the ones who have ruined the industry\u2019s reputation \u2015 out of business. This process today is, in reality, about the corruption of our system. It\u2019s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity \u2015 deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And if you don\u2019t do the right thing here, this proceeding will extend and embody that scandal. State attorneys general \u2015 Republicans and Democrats \u2015 will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media, and advocates for students will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors, even if Secretary DeVos continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice, and the wrong side of our people. Keep the existing gainful employment rule. If you do, you will improve the effectiveness, integrity, reputation, and ultimately the success of career colleges, and you will help these students.

Faced with evidence that many for-profit college students end up dropping out, or graduating but still failing to get ahead economically, the officials, as they have in prior years\u2019 sessions, often blame their own students for borrowing too much money and for failing to be diligent in their course work. And, just as strikingly, they suggest, over and over, that if a Department of Education rule or proposed rule would force them or their fellow school operators to alter or close a particular education program\u00a0 \u2014 whether in teaching, nursing, IT, or hairdressing \u2014 there must be something wrong with the rule. They rarely suggest that there might, instead, be something wrong with the program \u2014 such as being of low quality, or given to admitting many students that the program is not designed to adequately assist, or simply being overpriced. This mind-set makes these for-profit college officials the most entitled group I\u2019ve ever observed. Many for-profit colleges get 80 percent, 90 percent, and even more of their revenue directly from federal taxpayers through student grants and loans \u2014 because so many of the students they enroll are low-income people eligible for federal student aid, or military troops and veterans who earn education benefits. Collectively the industry has received as much as $32 billion in a single year from the federal government. One company, the operator of the University of Phoenix, has taken in as much as $2 billion in a year. For-profit colleges you\u2019ve never heard of\u00a0have been getting hundreds of millions more. Sending all that money to this industry, taxpayers have a right to expect that the schools will avoid serious waste, fraud, and abuse. We have a right to demand good performance. Especially because bad performance will often leave our fellow citizens \u2014 the ones whom this taxpayer money is supposed to assist \u2014 worse off than when they started, deep in debt and without improved career prospects. But what is the actual record of this industry? More than half of the students who have enrolled in for-profit colleges \u2014 many of them veterans, single mothers and other low- and middle-income people seeking a better future \u2014\u00a0dropped out within about four months. The relentless drive to meet recruiting and revenue goals \u2014 to get \u201casses in classes\u201d \u2014 has led many for-profit schools to\u00a0enroll numerous students\u00a0whom their programs are not strong enough to\u00a0help. Although for-profit colleges often promise that their programs are affordable, the real cost can be nearly double that of Harvard or Stanford. But the quality and reputation of the programs are often weak, so even students who manage to graduate often struggle to find jobs beyond the Office Depot shifts they previously held. The Department of Education has\u00a0reported\u00a0that 72 percent of the for-profit college programs it analyzed produced graduates who, on average, earned less than did high school dropouts. A May 2016\u00a0study\u00a0published by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that for-profit college students, graduates and dropouts combined, earned less after leaving school than they did before they enrolled. Today, 10 percent of all college students attend for-profit colleges, on campuses and online \u2014 but these institutions account for\u00a040 percent\u00a0of student loan defaults. For-profit schools are driving a national student debt crisis that has reached $1.4 trillion in borrowing. They absorb\u00a020 percent\u00a0of all federal student aid, diverting sums from often better, more affordable programs at nonprofit and public colleges. And numerous for-profit colleges \u2014 from giant companies like Bridgepoint, EDMC, Career Education Corp., and Kaplan, to smaller schools \u2014 have been the subject of multiple federal and state law enforcement investigations and actions alleging fraud and deceptive practices \u2014 for example, for\u00a0misleading prospective students about matters like program costs, accreditation, transferability of credits, job placement rates, and likely starting salaries, and lying to government overseers about whether their students have even graduated from high school, about their financial aid status, and much more. The schools aggressively target the very high-risk students whom they complain about at these meetings. When pro-student negotiators in this rule-making meeting try to discuss examples of abuses, the Department\u2019s designated meeting mediators repeatedly warn them that it\u2019s not collegial to name or describe particular schools. From experience at prior meetings, I know that this is the result of industry representatives complaining to Department officials. This limitation is absurd. Facts regarding school behavior are entirely relevant to addressing these issues. Being genteel regarding institutions is how we got into this mess. The for-profit college industry has a dismal record \u2014 one with many victims, and one that cries out for stronger rules and enforcement. Yet through eight years of the Obama administration the industry hired every expensive well-connected Democratic and Republican lobbyist and litigator\u00a0it could find to fight against greater accountability \u2014 to force taxpayers to continue to send millions and billions to even the worst actors in the industry. Under industry pressure, the Obama administration ended up weakening a pair of new rules \u2014 gainful employment and borrower defense. In the end, these rules aren\u2019t strong enough to match all the industry\u2019s abuses. However, they could go a long way toward restraining the worst outrages. But now that the head of Trump University is President of the United States, and Betsy DeVos is his Secretary of Education, and former for-profit college executives serve as top deputies in her department, the new administration has embarked on a course to defang or eliminate both rules. Federal regulations require that these rules be undone through the same laborious process by which they were created \u2014 negotiated rule-making, where representatives of various interested parties, selected by the Secretary, gather around a table and try to craft regulations. If these negotiators cannot agree unanimously, then the Department will draft the regulations themselves, which is what happened in the Obama administration, and which surely will happen again under Trump and DeVos. There are many career officials in the Department, and even some Trump appointees, who realize there remains a great deal of fraud, overcharging, and weak instruction in the for-profit college industry. But the sneering public remarks that DeVos has offered on the Obama rules, the one-sided \u201cissue papers\u201d that the Department has issued to guide the current meetings, and the inclusion on the panels of negotiators tied to predatory schools, strongly suggest where we\u2019re heading \u2014 back to an era of near-impunity for bad actors. My colleagues and I, by now, know personally many people who were misled, overcharged, and abused by for-profit colleges. Some came to the rule-making meetings last year to tell their stories. They\u2019re not here this time, and some of them say it\u2019s because they feel burned by the process. They made the effort to argue for greater accountability, and for cancelling the federal loan debt of defrauded and abused students. They haven\u2019t received such loan forgiveness, so many continue to pay down loans for worthless education programs, diverting money they need for rent, food, clothes for their kids. They can\u2019t afford to travel to DC and leave their jobs and family responsibilities even for a day. Meanwhile, as always, the for-profit colleges have the money to stock the negotiator table and a room of observers with their high-priced lawyers and lobbyists. They have the money because we taxpayers continue to provide it. The rule on the chopping block this week \u2014 gainful employment \u2014 would ultimately take away federal aid from career education and for-profit programs that, year after year, saddled students with more debt than their incomes would reasonably allow them to repay. The rule\u2019s requirements for school achievements are not overly demanding; the Department announced in January that about 800 programs failed the first round of the test \u2014 less than 10 percent of all relevant programs, in a sector rife with weak performers. But many for-profit college representatives seem to insist that, because they see themselves as good people, and because they work hard, they don\u2019t want a rule that might force them to alter their programs, or spend additional money on compliance, or lower their prices. They don\u2019t want a rule even if many of the schools that will have to change or shut down are among the most shoddy operations in their industry. Apparently, if one \u201cgood\u201d program might face adversity, it\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s almost as if the for-profit college owners think they can just raise their hands and get free money. [UPDATE 12-06-17 10:20 am: This mind-set was just reflected in a comment by negotiator Jennifer Blum of for-profit Laureate Education. She posited a situation where a college has a teacher training program that is failing the gainful employment rule \u201cthrough no fault of their own; it just has to do with the salaries that teachers make.\u201d But that\u2019s the point of the gainful employment. A school might not think that it\u2019s at \u201cfault,\u201d but the ex-students are buried in debt from the high tuition.] Some owners are good people. They are justifiably proud of their staffs, of student success stories. But if they work to undo these Obama accountability measures, they are bad citizens. Because the rules have the potential, over time, to protect millions of people from predatory educational programs that would ruin their financial futures. And that goal is worth some sacrifice, or, if necessary, the exit from the business,\u00a0of some for-profit college owners, as a condition for the industry continuing to receive our tax dollars. (And let\u2019s be clear: Under the gainful employment rule, the government would never order any school to close. The federal government can only decide whether the school is eligible for taxpayer funds. For-profit operators remain free to run whatever schools or programs they want, if they can get state licensing. Many for-profit schools operate without federal aid, often at much lower prices for students.) To emphasize: This is not the normal government policy trade-off between say, consumer protection, and the interest of banks in maximizing profit. Or environmental protection versus fossil fuel profits. The for-profit college industry is funded almost entirely with our taxpayer dollars. And the issue is whether the government, on behalf of taxpayers, should require some meaningful standards, enough good results for students, in exchange for those dollars, or whether, instead, the owners are permanently entitled to an open torrent of our money without serious regard to performance. Every day that Betsy DeVos blocks the Obama gainful employment and borrower defense rules is another day that numerous additional Americans will be deceived into enrolling into programs that will bury them in debt, while enriching their deceivers \u2014 all at taxpayer expense. This is the situation facing the Secretary now. Can she learn from these rule-making sessions, and the long record of blatant abuses by the for-profit college industry, that it\u2019s at last time for the Department of Education to step up and start implementing genuine measures to protect students? Putting the two Obama rules into effect is, in fact, not enough, but it would be a strong start. This article also appears on\u00a0Republic Report.",

      "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2015 It was late morning in an artsy cafe, the smell of coffee and baked goods sweetening the air, and Ashley Bishop sat at a table, recalling a time when she was taught that most of secular American society was worthy of contempt. Growing up in private evangelical Christian schools, Bishop saw the world in extremes, good and evil, heaven and hell. She was taught that to dance was to sin, that gay people were child molesters and that mental illness was a function of satanic influence. Teachers at her schools talked about slavery as black immigration, and instructors called environmentalists \u201chippie witches.\u201d Bishop\u2019s family moved around a lot when she was a child, but her family always enrolled her in evangelical schools. So when Bishop left school in 2003 and entered the real world at 17, she felt like she was an alien landing on Planet Earth for the first time. Having been cut off from mainstream society, she felt unequipped to handle the job market and develop secular friendships. Lacking shared cultural and historical references, she spent most of her 20s holed up in her bedroom, suffering from crippling social anxiety. Now, at 31, she has become everything that she was once taught to hate. She shares an apartment with her girlfriend of two years. She sees a therapist and takes medication for depression, a condition born, in part, of her stifling education. Years later, some of the schools Bishop attended are largely the same, but some have changed in a significant way: Unlike when Bishop was a student, parents are not the only ones paying tuition for these fundamentalist religious schools \u2013 so are taxpayers. These schools are among thousands in the United States that participate in private school choice programs, which most often come in the form of state-level voucher or tax credit scholarships. Voucher programs offer publicly funded financial aid to parents for private schools. Tax credit programs usually offer individuals or corporations tax credits if they donate to a scholarship granting organization, which in turn offers private school scholarships based on various criteria, including income. President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have openly championed such programs and have encouraged states to embrace school choice, arguing that voucher programs give parents an alternative to low-performing public schools. Currently 14 states and the District of Columbia have voucher programs, and 17 have tax credit programs. DeVos has made it a top priority to push a federal school choice initiative. Many of the private schools that participate in these state-led programs are run by evangelical Christian churches. They are sometimes unaccredited and can teach a curriculum similar to the one Bishop studied \u2015 all with the help of taxpayer dollars. The textbooks used at all of Bishop\u2019s schools were published by three of the most popular, and most ideologically extreme, Christian textbook companies: Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education. The ideas in these textbooks often flout widely accepted science and historical fact. But the number of schools using these resources is largely unknown, even in states where they receive support from publicly funded scholarships. No state or federal organization tracks the curriculum being used in private school choice programs. The religious affiliations of schools that participate in these programs are also not always tracked. That means there are thousands of kids receiving an extremist and ultraconservative education at the expense of taxpayers. Several months ago, HuffPost set out to create a database of every private school in the country that receives taxpayer funding. We also tracked the religious affiliation of each school and looked at how many taught from these evangelical Christian textbooks. HuffPost obtained lists of schools that participate in private school choice programs around the country. We searched for the most up-to-date lists on either a state\u2019s education or revenue department\u2019s website. Several states did not keep a list of which schools participate in choice programs. In those instances, we went directly to the individual scholarship granting organizations in each state. Our list totaled about 7,200\u00a0across the 25 of 27 states that offer private school choice along with the District of Columbia. (Two states that do not allow religious schools to participate in private school choice programs were excluded from our analysis.) Then we researched the religious affiliations of each school by scouring each school\u2019s website. If a school did not maintain a website, we emailed school representatives and often followed up with a phone call. Our analysis found that about 75 percent of voucher schools across the country are religious \u2015 usually Christian or Catholic, with about 2 percent identifying as Jewish and 1 percent identifying as Muslim. There were gray areas: At least five schools identified as non-religious but used a curriculum created by the founder of the Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Since a plurality of schools in these programs (42 percent) are non-Catholic Christian schools, we dove deeply into researching the curriculum of those schools. We searched their websites for information on curriculum sources and sent out emails to school leaders if they did not make their academic plan public. We did not assess Catholic schools, which made up 31 percent of Christian schools, since there is already a large body of research on the outcomes of students who go to these schools. Evangelical Christian schools are newer \u2015 many popped up only a few decades ago \u2013 and remain less scrutinized. Indeed, we found many of the non-Catholic Christian schools (33 percent) were using Abeka, Bob Jones or ACE textbooks in at least one subject or grade. We found that Abeka was the most popular textbook source \u2015 used in about 27 percent of non-Catholic Christian schools \u2015 and Accelerated Christian Education was the least popular \u2015 used in about 5 percent of these schools. We could not definitively ascertain the curriculum used by about 1,800 Christian schools, because they did not respond to requests for information. Around 200 Christian schools told us they did not use these three textbook sources. With taxpayers footing the bill for religious private schools, the separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, becomes a murky line. So how did it come to be that taxpayers are footing the bill for an evangelical education? Most states have little oversight on the curriculum used in schools that participate in private school choice programs. Some states have zero regulations on the topic. Others require private schools to follow the state\u2019s broad-based content standards but specify little else. (Rhode Island\u2019s stipulations appear the most strict: Curricula in private schools must be submitted and largely equivalent to what is taught in public schools.) Additionally, private schools that participate in these programs are not typically subject to the same accountability and transparency rules as public schools, although rules vary on a state-by-state basis. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many students use taxpayer funds to attend schools with evangelical curricula, but we do know that over 400,000 students nationwide currently attend school using money from a voucher or tax credit program, according to the education reform group\u00a0EdChoice. Some states are more transparent than others. In Indiana, about 4,240 students received over $16 million in scholarships to attend schools that use the Abeka or Bob Jones curriculum, according to 2016-2017 figures from the Indiana Department of Education. These numbers could soon grow. DeVos is an advocate of school choice and religious education. While she failed in her first attempt to push a federal private school choice program via the Education Department budget, she has repeatedly said she will not stop trying. The prospect of giving kids more access to these schools with public money is deeply upsetting to Bishop, who was recently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of bullying and corporal punishment she experienced as a child. After leaving high school and getting a taste of the outside world, Bishop fell into a deep depression. When she went to job interviews, she had no idea what to say about the education she had received. HuffPost spoke to nearly a dozen former students and teachers at schools that relied on Abeka, Bob Jones and Accelerated Christian Education curricula. Many of these students, who consider themselves no longer religious, reported feeling traumatized by their educational experiences. A number of them communicate with each other via online support groups for survivors of fundamentalist schools, including Bishop. Some say these curriculum sources left them woefully ill-equipped to thrive in a diverse society while instilling in them racist, sexist and intolerant views of the world. Bishop said her fundamentalist education made her wary of people from other religious groups whom her teachers and textbooks had demonized. \u201cAnything that wasn\u2019t Christianity was a strange religion,\u201d said Bishop, who made it a priority to study other religious practices after high school and even spent time with the Hare Krishna. \u201cBut even other denominations were evil. Catholicism especially.\u201d Another former student who spoke to HuffPost under the pseudonym Natasha Balzak, was taught at home that all Muslims hate America, she said. Teachers at her Florida school reinforced this idea, telling students to pray for Muslims and other non-believers, like atheists and gay people. \u201cWhen it comes to hateful ideology and rhetoric, I was taught a lot of things to skew my mind into believing \u2015 I guess you could call it brainwashing,\u201d said Balzak, 27, who is using a pseudonym to protect the identity of family members who are still deeply involved in their church. Balzak recalled that her school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, used a mix of ACE and Abeka materials, but the head of the school said they were not aware of the school ever using ACE and that they currently used only Abeka in lower grades for phonics. The school participates in Florida\u2019s three private-school choice programs and currently enrolls 172 students on these scholarships. It received $554,418 in taxpayer-funded scholarships this year, according to a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education. A HuffPost analysis of Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE textbooks confirms the recollections of these students. These materials inaccurately portray events in Muslim and Catholic history while perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes. The materials speak disparagingly of Native Americans and Native culture. The chart below details some of the inaccurate and biased perspectives in these textbooks compared with the perspective of an academic who studies these issues. See all the schools we could confirm use one of these curriculums in our full dataset. A Bob Jones high school world history textbook portrays Islam as a violent religion and contains a title \u201cIslam and Murder.\u201d In the same textbook, when describing the Catholic Reformation, Catholic leaders are described as failing \u201cto see that the root of their problems was doctrinal error.\u201d When describing the concept of Manifest Destiny, the term used to describe America\u2019s 19th century expansion westward, an ACE textbook referred to the movement essentially as spreading the gospel: \u201cIt was considered God\u2019s will that this vastly superior American culture should spread to all corners of the North American continent,\u201d the passage reads. \u201cThe benighted Indians would be among the many beneficiaries of God\u2019s provision.\u201d David Brockman, an expert on world religions, was presented with passages from the Bob Jones and ACE textbooks. Most Protestants would likely disagree with the theological and historical narratives portrayed in the books, he said. \u201cThe textbook simply distorts history,\u201d wrote Brockman, a non-resident scholar at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, after examining the selections. \u201cAnd given the biblical command not to bear false witness, I would question whether a distorted history is consistent with Christian teaching.\u201d When Balzak attended a secular college in 2009, it was a shock to the system, she said. In her first environmental science class, she learned about climate change \u2015 a concept she had been taught was a hoax. \u201cWhen I took my first real science class, a million light bulbs went off,\u201d said Balzak, who had only been taught creationism in school. \u201cEverything finally made sense.\u201d The experience made Balzak feel robbed of a fact-based education. Indeed, Balzak\u2019s former school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, includes a statement of faith in its parent-student handbook, which is posted on its website: \u201cWe believe God created the entire universe out of nothing.\u201d The handbook also describes the school\u2019s attitude toward LGBTQ students. It says administrators will reject applicants or expel current students if they are caught \u201cliving in, or condoning, or supporting any form of sexual immorality; practicing or promoting a homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity.\u201d Coral Springs\u2019 head of school noted that the institution had likely changed a lot since Balzak attended some years ago, although he has worked at the school for only a few years. He said that staff members do not recall the school ever relying significantly on Abeka materials, and says that the student body has become significantly more diverse, \u201cIt\u2019s a very different education I\u2019m sure than 20 years ago,\u201d said head of school Joseph Sanelli. But in some ways, Balzak considered herself lucky. She said her childhood wasn\u2019t traumatic, just deeply imperfect. Bishop didn\u2019t have such luck. Some of the schools Bishop attended were worse than others. She faced the greatest difficulty from ages 11 to 13, when she attended Franklin Christian Academy in Georgia. The school appears to no longer be open, according to the Georgia Department of Education list of private schools, and a series of calls to what Bishop said was an affiliated church were not returned. The school consisted of three rooms, Bishop recalled, with most of the school\u2019s 30-something kids spending all day in the same classroom. The school relied on an Accelerated Christian Education curriculum currently used by at least nine private schools in Georgia that are eligible for taxpayer funds. ACE classrooms are uniquely designed. Students sit in cubicle-like offices, with barriers separating their desks. Teachers do not lead students in lessons or discussions. Instead, students spend all day silently sifting through a succession of readings and fill-in-the-blank worksheets. When students have a question, they raise either an American or Christian flag to get the attention of a class supervisor. A 2012 training manual for administrators obtained by HuffPost lists an education degree as a \u201cdetriment\u201d for the job. Indeed these supervisors\u2019 lack of qualifications was once the topic of a \u201cJudge Judy\u201d episode about a decade ago. At Bishop\u2019s school, she dealt with intense physical bullying and verbal harassment. When she would complain about the harassment, school authorities told her to ignore it. They sometimes implied she was at fault and needed to get closer to Jesus, she said. The school did not employ professionals trained to deal with mental health issues, she added. As a teenager she went nearly mute and thought about killing herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. I did self-harm,\u201d she said, speaking slowly and deliberately over coffee. \u201cI just hated myself and I didn\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d It was also around that time that Bishop realized she was attracted to other girls. She repressed her feelings for decades, even spending most of her 20s married to a man. An examination of ACE textbooks shows that its materials push strict ideas about gender roles and sexuality. Even now Bishop still sometimes finds herself shrinking in the presence of men, saying that it\u2019s almost like \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d Balzak echoes these sentiments, saying that even her female teachers reinforced the idea that women are secondary to men. When describing the 1920s, a high school ACE textbook criticizes women for wearing short skirts and cutting their hair, calling it a violation of Scripture. Before the 1920s, when women were less likely to work outside the home, they \u201cwere comfortable to be discreet, chaste, keepers at house, good, obedient to their own husbands,\u201d says the material. School, Bishop said, made her want to give up on education. She spent some time being home-schooled, then at another Georgia school before moving to Roxboro Christian School in North Carolina. After less than two years there \u2015 in which she spent much of her time hiding in the bathroom \u2015 she dropped out and got her GED. Roxboro currently participates in North Carolina\u2019s voucher program, and representatives there confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. The school also confirmed that they use Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE. Roxboro has received over $8,000 this year in voucher program and currently enrolls four scholarship recipients, per a report from the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority. Two other schools Bishop attended are also eligible to receive monetary assistance via school voucher or tax credit programs. Bishop attended Beaufort Christian School in South Carolina and Neuse Christian Academy in North Carolina as a child. Beaufort Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and ACE, per its website. A representative from the school confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. Neuse Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and Bob Jones University, and it received $37,368 in scholarship money for 18 students, per the North Carolina Education Assistance Authority. The school was not able to confirm Bishop\u2019s enrollment because it does not still have its records from that time. Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education started selling textbooks in the early 1970s, a few decades before Wisconsin enacted the nation\u2019s first voucher program. At the time, enrollment in fundamentalist Christian schools was booming. For one, recent Supreme Court decisions had banned school Bible readings and official school prayer. Groups of evangelical Protestants were alarmed. The founders of these textbook companies dedicated their lives to pushing fundamentalist viewpoints. Abeka leaders Arlin and Beka Horton also founded Pensacola Christian College in Florida, which outlaws dancing and other \u201csatanic practices.\u201d They also founded Pensacola Christian Academy, a K-12 school that currently receives public funding for student scholarships via Florida\u2019s tax credit program. Bob Jones University Press is affiliated with Bob Jones University, which famously lost its tax-exempt status in 1983 after banning interracial dating, a policy it didn\u2019t reverse until 2000. Accelerated Christian Education was founded by Donald Howard, a Texas pastor. In his 1988 book, \u201cWorld Awakening,\u201d Howard describes AIDS as a plague sent down by God intended to punish gay people and other idol worshippers, like \u201cfeminists, prochoice, and Planned Parenthood advocates.\u201d ACE, Abeka and Bob Jones University Press leaders have largely similar educational philosophies, with a few subtle differences. The leaders of all three companies subscribe to an authoritarian vision of education in which students are taught not to question their elders. While ACE\u2019s curriculum barely involves a teacher, Abeka\u2019s promotes the educator as an absolute authority, per research from Binghamton University professor Adam Laats. They all have come under fire for providing children with an inadequate education. Eleven separate reviews of the ACE program by experts and academics have repudiated the curriculum, according to research conducted by Jonny Scaramanga at University College London. A representative of ACE responded to one of these reviews from 1987. \u201cOur material is not written with conventional viewpoints in mind. We do not believe that education should be nondirective or speculative, or that the final interpretation of facts and events should be left up to immature inexperienced minds as mainline secular curricula do,\u201d wrote a former ACE vice president at the time. The University of California system refuses to accept certain high school courses that rely on BJU and Abeka materials for credit. The Association of Christian Schools International sued the University of California System over this issue in 2005. A judge eventually ruled in favor of the UC System. Still, American taxpayers continue to indirectly prop up these curricula through voucher programs. It is unclear how the proliferation of private school choice programs has affected the bottom line for these textbook companies. Representatives of Bob Jones University Press did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives of ACE did not respond to requests for comment either, however its website claims they are in 6,000 schools around the globe, although a number of experts told HuffPost that they are skeptical of this number. A spokesperson for Abeka noted that, while the company is aware its materials are used in private schools that receive public funding, \u201cAbeka does not advocate or encourage the use of state or federal funding for private, Christian schools.\u201d \u201cWe recognize that academic scholars have differing opinions on historical/scientific content and that this frequently occurs in both public and private educational institutions as reported in the media. We are confident that our content is accurate, age appropriate, and academically rigorous,\u201d wrote Brent Phillips, assistant to the president for business affairs, via email. Educators who use or are familiar with these resources told HuffPost that not all schools who use them have a fundamentalist approach. Indeed, not all schools who use these curricula are deeply religious, and they are used in a range of Christian schools. \u00a0They emphasize that the quality of these publishers\u2019 resources differ based on subject and grade level. Bishop said that, while her \u201ceducation did not equip me to get the most basic of jobs,\u201d she praised the rigor of Abeka and Bob Jones vocabulary and reading comprehension lessons. (Below, a passage on slavery from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Dave Moore, executive director of Pittsburgh Urban Christian School in Pennsylvania, said that he does not use any materials provided by these sources but that \u201cAbeka has excellent elementary grammar resources.\u201d Pittsburgh Urban Christian receives scholarship money through Pennsylvania\u2019s school tax credit program. \u201cI would still use it if we didn\u2019t already develop our own curriculum. It does such a good job of it,\u201d said Moore of Abeka\u2019s elementary phonics and math resources. If his school decided to use Abeka materials, he would direct teachers to be on alert for propaganda, he said. \u201cWe do the same thing with secular textbooks,\u201d Moore said. Some educators told HuffPost they are happy with the education students receive with these resources. Stephen Lindahl, assistant director of Calumet Christian School in Griffith, Indiana, disagreed with characterizations of Abeka and Bob Jones University Press as pushing a far-right worldview. His school uses Abeka materials almost exclusively for elementary school and then a mix of Abeka and Bob Jones in some later grades. \u201cAbeka and Bob Jones and other biblically based curriculum try to approach academics from a biblical standpoint and from a moral, ethical view, which does not necessarily push any agenda outside of an understanding of God and who Christ is,\u201d Lindahl said. He noted that secular textbooks, too, often come with a specific point of view. HuffPost also reached out to multiple national school-choice advocacy groups for their responses on our findings. None of them responded, even sometimes with weeks\u2019 notice. However, professors who have studied the curricula say they are dangerous tools for schools to wield. \u201cI want parents to know their children might be coming home with a book that looks like an ordinary textbook but the messages are not what people would ordinarily learn,\u201d said Kathleen Wellman, a professor of history at Southern Methodist University who is working on a book about these publications. \u201cMany universities don\u2019t require history education, so for many Americans this will be their last exposure to history. And many students say they didn\u2019t realize at the time how thoroughly indoctrinated they were being.\u201d Sometimes Bishop wonders what her life would have been like had she not attended evangelical schools. She tried taking online university courses once but dropped out after having trouble balancing academics with her job. She still thinks about trying college again from time to time but worries about the financial feasibility. (Below, a passage on evolution from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Growing up, her schools had never offered outlets for her interest in art or dance \u2015 things that she maybe would have wanted to explore. The only thing she ever remembers wanting to do was perform, a far cry from her current job, working in the produce department of a grocery store. The only career paths presented to her revolved around the church. \u201cIt would be kind of different if I was at a school that allowed me to head in a direction I wanted to go,\u201d said Bishop, who lights up when talking about the dance classes she has taken as an adult. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get that chance.\u201d Kaeli Subberwal contributed to this report.\u00a0Data and graphics by Alissa Scheller.\u00a0Animation by Isabella Carapella.

      "content": "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2015 Sunnie Kahle used to think that if she promised to be good, she could go back to her old school. She\u2019d plead with her great-grandmother to let her enroll again at Timberlake Christian Schools, where she had gone since she was 3 years old. Even if teachers were mean to her, even if other kids said bad things about her, she wouldn\u2019t be mad. She just wanted her old life back. Her great-grandmother and guardian, Doris Thompson, 74, didn\u2019t know how to tell Sunnie she wasn\u2019t allowed back at the school. Administrators didn\u2019t want her there. In a 2014 letter to Thompson that essentially expelled Sunnie, the school referenced several passages from the Bible as to why they wouldn\u2019t take her back. They suggested Sunnie wasn\u2019t acting \u201cChristlike\u201d by wearing her hair short and preferring pants to skirts. Sunnie was 8 years old. She wasn\u2019t traditionally feminine enough for them. Timberlake Christian Schools in Virginia is one of over at least 700 religious schools in America currently receiving public money while openly advertising and practicing anti-LGBTQ policies, HuffPost has found in a new investigation. HuffPost has been examining private schools that receive taxpayer dollars through voucher or tax credit programs. We created a database of more than 7,000 schools in 25 states and the District of Columbia with private school choice programs that give public money to private religious schools. In the first story of this investigation, which we published earlier in December, we looked at what was being taught. We discovered thousands of schools that used evangelical Christian curricula,\u00a0largely considered inaccurate and unscientific. In our second article, we singled out a handful of schools that purported to be secular but maintained strong ties to the Church of Scientology. For this story, we researched the number of schools in our database that practice discrimination toward LGBTQ students and staff members. We visited every website of each school in search of evidence of their attitudes and policies on gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ students. If a school did not advertise a specific policy, we followed up via email or a call. For Catholic schools, we looked for diocese-wide policies on these issues. Often, these schools had policies against heterosexual sex before marriage, as well. We found at least 14 percent of religious schools take an active stance against LGBTQ staff and students.\u00a0Some of these schools have policies on their websites generally broadcasting their opposition to same-sex marriage or even stating their belief that homosexuality is a sin on par with bestiality. Others have harsher policies \u2015 specifically stating that students can face punishments, like expulsion, for displaying signs of a \u201chomosexual lifestyle\u201d or \u201calternate gender identity.\u201d At least 5 percent of these schools also have explicit policies against hiring or retaining LGBTQ staff. On the other hand, we also found many schools that have policies specifically protecting students from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Many more of these schools belong to larger churches that preach anti-LGBTQ sentiment. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is \u201copposed to homosexual practices and relationships,\u201d per the denomination\u2019s website. The Roman Catholic Church says marriage can occur only between a man and woman. We did not assume that schools identifying with these groups were hostile places for LGBTQ students. In our count, we included only schools (or dioceses) that had a specific anti-LGBTQ policy. In that way, our numbers represent a bare minimum of schools where LGBTQ students may encounter hostility. Religious schools are generally exempt from the types of regulations that would protect students and teachers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. It\u2019s only in recent years, though, that these schools have received an injection of taxpayer funds with the rise and expansion of state-level private school choice programs. Since President Donald Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, have expressed the desire to use federal dollars to increase private school choice, it\u2019s worth closely examining which students are served and which are not. After Sunnie was kicked out of Timberlake, her great-grandma transferred her to public school. Thompson, who is emphatic when she talks about Sunnie, in the way only proud grandmas do, has a tattoo on her wrist that says, \u201cFamily is forever.\u201d Sitting in her living room, the walls lined with photos of Sunnie, here in this city just a couple of hours from Richmond, the Virginia capital, Thompson explained how she came to be Sunnie\u2019s guardian. It\u2019s a complicated tale of mental illness and addiction, but since Sunnie was 2 months old, Thompson has been her protector. In February of 2014, when Sunnie was in the second grade, the school principal sent a letter home to Thompson saying that, although Sunnie was a \u201cvery bright girl,\u201d she recommended that Sunnie not re-enroll the next year if she wasn\u2019t able to \u201cdress\u201d and behave accordingly with her \u201cGod-ordained identity\u201d as a female. Thompson pulled her out of the school immediately. \u201cThey pretty much ruined a little girl\u2019s life,\u201d said Thompson, who helps with her husband Carroll\u2019s truck repair business. Sunnie didn\u2019t attend Timberlake using a publicly funded scholarship through Virginia\u2019s tax credit program for low-income students. But the year she was kicked out, other students did. During the fiscal year of 2014, Timberlake received $104,121.57 in scholarships. That number has increased. For the fiscal year of 2017, the school received $237,500, per the Virginia Department of Education. In Virginia, tax credits are given to individuals and corporations that donate to scholarship programs. These scholarship groups then help low-income students attend private schools. Voucher programs are more direct: Taxpayer funds help provide voucher scholarships for students who meet certain requirements to attend private schools. A 2016 analysis of voucher program rules conducted by Indiana University professor Suzanne Eckes found that not a single one had protections preventing discrimination for LGBTQ students. Eckes did not include tax credit programs in her research. So HuffPost conducted a similar analysis including programs that were left out by Eckes. We found the same trend. Only one state\u2019s program, Maryland\u2019s, protected students from discrimination based on sexual orientation. While in our research we found a handful of Maryland schools that expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and homosexuality, each stopped short of saying they would deny these students admission. See all the schools we could confirm have a discriminatory policy. DeVos has been pressed before on if private schools receiving federal money under a possible voucher program would be required to prohibit anti-LGBTQ discrimination. In June, testifying before a Senate subcommittee, DeVos said that such a program would have to follow federal law. Indeed, in an email to HuffPost, a spokesperson for DeVos emphasized the fact that there is no federal voucher program and that, if there were, it \u201cwould have to comply with federal law.\u201d The problem is federal law is murky. The Obama administration interpreted Title IX \u2015 the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools \u2015 to include protections for LGBTQ students. The Trump administration seems to think these decisions should be made at the local level. \u201cThere\u2019s no federal protections for LGBTQ students outside of Title IX,\u201d said Nathan Smith, director for public policy for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. \u201cWe still think it covers LGBTQ students, despite the fact that this administration doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d Advocates of school choice emphasize that anti-LGBTQ bullying is a problem in all schools, not just private religious ones that participate in voucher programs. They preach the bigger cause of giving parents the ability to choose the most appropriate school for their child. Indeed, voucher programs are typically targeted to low-income families who normally wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the private school of their choice. \u201cI abhor discrimination and I would hope that schools would not discriminate against LGBTQ students even if the issue is part of their statements of faith,\u201d wrote Robert Enlow, CEO and president of EdChoice, an education reform group, in an email. \u201cI also recognize, though, that we live in a pluralistic society that values choice, individual freedom and an abiding respect for all faiths. I trust parents to make the best choices for their kids based on their shared values and goals.\u201d But Thompson hopes leaders at Timberlake know that their interpretation of faith is one without merit. \u201cI feel sorry for them,\u201d Thompson said, referring to administrators at Timberlake, \u201cif they have to answer and stand before our God one day.\u201d The 74-year-old describes Sunnie as the great love of her life. Even after raising two kids and helping with three grandkids, Sunnie is her ultimate baby. The child has always been fiercely loyal and unfailingly independent, and she has a heart as sweet as apple pie, Thompson said, beaming with pride when asked about Sunnie\u2019s personality. But now, at 12, Sunnie is also angry and sad. Life was never going to be easy for Sunnie. Sunnie\u2019s mom had her as a teen. Sunny\u2019s father has not been a consistent presence, Thompson said. Sunnie\u2019s story of being kicked out of Timberlake was largely covered in the media when it first happened in 2014. Headlines screamed outrage. Sunnie was another victim of homophobia, another viral story here today and gone tomorrow. What wasn\u2019t covered is what happened next. Sunnie didn\u2019t want to leave Timberlake. From her point of view, it was a place where she was loved and accepted by her friends. At her new public school, she was teased. The other students would call her \u201cit\u201d and \u201cgay.\u201d Sunnie made one friend \u2015 he used to come over on weekends, and they would play games, Thompson recalled. Then, suddenly, the boy\u2019s father stopped letting him come over. The father said Sunnie needed to \u201cfind out her gender\u201d before they could hang out again. Things didn\u2019t get better. First, Sunnie faked being sick so often that truancy became a problem. Sunnie didn\u2019t talk to HuffPost for this article for reasons that HuffPost is not reporting to protect the privacy of a minor. But Thompson wants Sunnie\u2019s story to be heard. \u201cBeing so young, she really doesn\u2019t know how she feels. She doesn\u2019t know what she wants to be. Or who she wants to be,\u201d Thompson said as her eyes welled with tears, reliving the trauma Sunnie experienced. Sunnie still doesn\u2019t talk about feelings she may or may not be having. She\u2019s on the verge of puberty.\u00a0But Thompson worries about what will happen next. At the time that Sunnie was kicked out of school, lawyers for Timberlake Christian Schools told the media: \u201cParents and guardians send their children to the School because of our Christian beliefs and standards. We have a duty to create an environment that is supportive of these Christian values.\u201d HuffPost reached out to the school and asked if they had anything further to add about Sunnie\u2019s situation, years later. They said they did not. The school\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policy remains in place. Punishable behaviors include, \u201cbut is not necessarily limited to, living in, condoning or supporting sexual immorality; practicing homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity; promoting such practices; or otherwise having the inability to support the moral principles of the school,\u201d according to the school\u2019s website. Sunnie\u2019s story is unusual because of how young she is. She had adult thoughts and projections pushed on her before she was even close to having them herself. But a similar version of this story plays out around the country regularly. In 2012, the same year 15,000 Indiana students used vouchers, Warren came out to his family and friends as transgender, he told HuffPost. At the end of his junior year, he informed the principal at his Catholic school that he would be returning as a boy for his senior year. The bishop from the diocese overseeing Cathedral High School thought this was unacceptable. But instead of kicking Warren out, or telling him not to come back, administrators ignored the way he chose to identify, Warren said. Teachers were told that if they called Warren by his chosen name, they would face reprisal. Those with whom Warren was close, who wanted to respect his new identity, were afraid to buck the diocese, he said. Some found workarounds by calling him by his last name or initials. Warren was deeply involved in the school marching band as well as the school\u2019s plays. During the marching band performances, they would announce the performers. Warren asked announcers to leave his name out, since he knew only his \u201cdead name\u201d would be announced. He asked not to be listed in the programs for the school plays. \u201cI was pretty depressed a lot of the \u00a0time. I had horrible social anxiety,\u201d said Warren, who\u2019s withholding his last name because his college peers are not aware of his transition. Even after Warren got his name changed legally that school year, the school refused to accept it. They sent off his high school transcripts to colleges with the wrong name, compelling Warren to explain the confusion to admissions offices, thereby being forced to out himself. A representative of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis said that it opens its doors to \u201call who are committed to a quality Catholic education, regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, socio-economics, religion, learning differences, etc. Our admissions policies and practices at each local site conform to this approach.\u201d The high school did not respond to requests for comment on the situation. The diocese does, however, have a policy against employing staff members in same-sex unions, a representative told HuffPost during data collection. For Warren and Sunnie, other kids at their private schools were not the problem. They were supportive. It was the adults. Thompson only hopes the adults at Timberlake learn to treat children with kindness and empathy. \u201cGod wants you to love everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially his children. He loves his children.\u201d Thompson is attending regular counseling sessions to educate herself on how to be the best parent she can be to her great-granddaughter. \u201cCourse, now I\u2019m 74 years old, so I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to be around here 10 years, when she\u2019ll be 22 years old. I hope to God that he will let me stay here until she is grown. But I hope that she will make something of herself. Be somebody, and be proud of who she is.\u201d Data and graphics by Alissa Scheller. If you have experienced discrimination in schools, email rebecca.klein@huffpost.com.

      "content": " It took Betsy DeVos nearly a year to take any action on the nearly 100,000 applications by former students who assert that they were deceived and abused by predatory for-profit colleges like Corinthian, ITT and Kaplan. But the new process announced today appears to be a step backwards, a new attack on students, and a gift to the most abusive predatory schools. In addition to denying thousands of claims today, DeVos outlined new standards that rip off injured students by limiting their debt relief through weighing of their income, often even if they have only a low-wage, part-time job, and even if that job has nothing to do with the training they received at the offending college. It\u2019s somewhat unclear from department statements and media reports exactly how the comparisons will be made, but it appears the new approach would punish those students who have overcome the obstacles of a deceptive, subpar education and found a way to support themselves. Or it could penalize the financially worst-off graduates of a career education program at a failed school if others in that program did better. Worse, to limit student debt relief, the department is using income data derived from the Obama gainful employment rule \u2015 the same data that the department, at the urging of for-profit college lobbyists, appears ready to abandon when measuring the performance of schools. In other words, data that shows career college students tend to earn low incomes is used by DeVos when it helps her limit debt relief for students, but is trashed by DeVos when it puts at risk the profits of predatory for-profit colleges. But what the department has announced is even worse than that because: 1. Even full cancellation of federal loans would not come close to making students whole from their experience of attending a dishonest school, because of all the out-of-pocket expenditures, grants, scholarships, earned benefits, expensive private loans, time and effort that the student expended and that would not be recovered; in light of those non-recoverable costs for students, the new stingy standard is even more harsh. 2. The relief standards are not nearly high enough to deter bad colleges from staying in the federal student aid program and, more importantly, they\u2019re not high enough to deter the department from keeping bad colleges in the program. Thus the new DeVos policy of limiting loan relief for defrauded students is in fact a permissive approach to waste, fraud and abuse that will, over the long term, not save taxpayers money but instead will cost billions. Students have rightly taken action today to file a class action lawsuit against DeVos for denying them the relief to which they are fully entitled. DeVos was supposed to make her first appearance as Secretary today before the House Education and the Workforce Committee. But that appearance \u2015 her only scheduled appearance before the committee for 2017 \u2015 was inexplicably cancelled.  The committee chairwoman, Virginia Foxx \u2015 a relentless supporter of the for-profit college industry \u2015 claims as her committee motto \u201cKeeping Washington Accountable.\u201d Hardly.",

      "content": " Today is the second day of the second round of the Betsy DeVos Department of Education\u2019s regulatory meetings to repeal and replace the Obama administration\u2019s borrower defense rule \u2014 a rule that was aimed at protecting students and taxpayers from predatory practices by for-profit colleges. The DeVos Department\u2019s intentions already have been made apparent, with a series of draft provisions that are entirely one-sided, seemingly aimed at allowing predatory schools to return to an era of impunity. By now, we\u2019ve heard at the meeting the main arguments of the for-profit college industry on these issues, supporting the DeVos draft rule wholeheartedly. They are familiar and disturbing arguments. Above all, the for-profit college industry has an extraordinary and troubling sense of entitlement. School operators all believe, or at least all say, that their own schools are good for students. They seem to believe it follows that they are permanently entitled to millions or even billions annually in federal taxpayer money \u2014 many for-profit colleges get close to 90 percent of their revenue from federal student grants and loans \u2014 and that any regulation that would impose burdens, adjustments, or risks of any significance must necessarily be bad. They feel that way even though a well-constructed rule has the potential to drive out of the market the\u00a0unscrupulous schools that compete for the same students with false promises and that give the industry its horrible reputation for fraud and abuse. Thus the industry seems enthusiastic about the DeVos-Trump draft borrower defense rules, which essentially nullify the 1994 law that gives former students who are ripped off by their colleges \u2014 colleges approved for federal aid by the Department \u2014 the right to seek cancellations of their federal student loans. The draft rules, released last week, erect numerous and redundant barriers to students getting the benefit of that law. The DeVos draft rules are so biased against students that the room heard panel member Michale McComis, the head of the major for-profit college accreditor, ACCSC, say that combining all the barriers to loan cancellation \u201cfeels a little stacked against the student.\u201d McComis later described the collective constraints as \u201cbelts and suspenders on pants that are too tight.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it just not reasonable that a student would be able to achieve anything... If that\u2019s the intent, I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re here.\u201d Why we\u2019re here seems apparent. The DeVos Department is barred by law from undoing the Obama rules without going through the same negotiated rule-making process that created the rules in the first place. Hence, eleven meetings over several months, gathering various stakeholders to address the issues, with a parallel set of meetings to reverse the Obama gainful employment rule, another measure aimed at curbing predatory school abuses. Much of Monday\u2019s meeting was focused on just one of the barriers in the DeVos rule: A former student would be required to prove her right to loan relief to the Department by a demanding\u00a0\u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard, as opposed to the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard normally used in civil lawsuits. It\u2019s the difference, essentially, between having to convince a decision-maker that there\u2019s a 75 percent chance you\u2019re right, as opposed to 51 percent. Pro-student negotiators quickly exposed the unfairness of this requirement. Abby Shafroth of the National Consumer Law Center asked the DeVos Department why it was demanding this higher proof standard for students, most of whom are of low to moderate income and cannot afford lawyers.\u00a0 A lawyer for the Department replied flatly that the normal standard doesn\u2019t protect the interests of schools and taxpayers sufficiently; he hastened to add that the Department \u201ccan certainly re-evaulate.\u201d The DeVos Department\u2019s position that stronger debt relief for students is worse for taxpayers is short-sighted at best, dishonest at worst.\u00a0 If the Department granted abused students meaningful debt relief, it would quickly have a stronger sense of the enormous costs of allowing dishonest and poorly performing schools to participate in the federal aid program, and it would get tougher on schools and remove the worst actors from federal aid more quickly. This is exactly what bad schools in the industry are afraid of. Joseline Garcia of the US Student Assocation asked the DeVos Department representatives to walk through how a student without a lawyer can prove borrower defense by clear and convincing evidence. The Department lawyer declined. She also asked how many former students of the collapsed predatory Corinthian Colleges could have individually met the clear and convincing standard. The lawyer again didn\u2019t have an answer. Shafroth noted that the school, not the student, will have all the relevant documentation.\u00a0Students aren\u2019t preserving evidence of deception when they enroll, because they don\u2019t think they\u2019re being scammed at the time \u2014 or else they wouldn\u2019t enroll. In the loan relief proceeding devised by the DeVos Department, the student has no right to obtain documents from the school. Shafroth concluded that a clear and convincing standard, by itself, \u201cwould effectively do away with borrower relief in almost all circumstances.\u201d Ashley Harrington of the Center for Responsible Lending added that this provision, combined with the rest of the draft DeVos rules, would allow\u00a0even the worst schools to evade borrower defense claims. Every time the pro-student advocates exposed troubling aspects of the DeVos draft, they were countered by industry representatives on the panel, mostly two lawyers, both tied to awful predatory schools: Linda Rawles, who is a lawyer for Ashford/ Bridgepoint; and Aaron Lacey, who previously worked at Vatterott College. Both schools have well-documented records of deceiving and abusing students, and both schools have faced significant law enforcement investigations and actions. Rawles and Lacey endlessly defended the draft DeVos rules; indeed, Rawles took credit for suggesting the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidentiary burden for students. Rawles offered a series of dubious justifications for imposing a higher evidentiary burden on students. She claimed students will understand \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d because it\u2019s sometimes used in campus disciplinary proceedings. She later asserted\u00a0that \u201cclear and convincing\u201d just means \u201casking for some evidence.\u201d Except, no, it does not mean that.\u00a0And when another negotiator said it sounded like the less-demanding preponderance of evidence standard means that if it\u2019s \u201che said/she said,\u201d the student wins, Rawles nodded her head. But in fact, under a preponderance standard, the student would still have the burden of proof and thus would lose a \u201che said/she said\u201d draw. Rawles later said that the panel discussion should stop focusing on the abuses of now-defunct Corinthian Colleges. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different world now,\u201d she said. Suzanne Martindale of Consumers Union then pointed that out that there are still concerns about ongoing bad practices, as illustrated by California\u2019s attorney general last month suing Ashford / Bridgepoint for systematic fraud. That again, is the for-profit college company for which Linda Rawles works as outside legal counsel. It\u2019s also the company where Robert Eitel worked before becoming a senior adviser to Betsy DeVos at the Department of Education. So what is Rawles talking about? Ultimately, Rawles and other for-profit college representatives fell back on the industry\u2019s favorite boogeyman: the slick con artist student who will seek, and obtain, loan relief when the school in fact did nothing wrong. What kind of scam would that be? A student would have to go to school, put in all the hours of classes, studying, and commuting; find child care; commit personal and family money, plus any Pell grants or GI bill benefits; and take out the high-interest private loans often required to attend expensive for-profit schools. Most of that time and money would never be coming back. The only thing this alleged scam could possibly accomplish was cancellation of the federal student loans \u2014 a significant piece, but far from the whole thing. Even then, under the Obama-era borrower defense rule, federal loan cancellation would be far from a sure thing. Betsy DeVos snidely claimed last year that under the Obama regulation \u201call one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\u201d But in fact, under the Obama rule, a student still had to prove, or show government findings of, school misconduct. So for the owners who believe their schools are honest and effective, here\u2019s how you would have avoided trouble under the Obama borrower defense rule: Be honest and effective. Don\u2019t set out to deceive or defraud students. Train your recruiters to behave ethically. Offer a quality education \u2014 one that will actually help a students build careers \u2014 at a fair price. Look at the facts. Since the Department of Education started taking the borrower defense law seriously in the wake of the collapses of for-profits Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech, it has received some 99,000 student complaints. 98.6 percent of them are from students who attended for-profit colleges. There are very few from non-profit and public colleges. There also are plenty of for-profit schools where not a single student has filed for debt forgiveness. Students who attended good schools, it seems, are not seeking loan relief. Negotiator Will Hubbard of Student Veterans of America said he has seen little evidence of students committing fraud, but much evidence of for-profit schools committing fraud, and that was why the Obama Administration issued its borrower rule. Under the Obama rule, if a few students at a good school managed nevertheless to get their loans forgiven by showing school misconduct, taxpayers, not the school, would, initially, be on the hook for the money.\u00a0 Only if the Department saw a pattern of wrongdoing would it be likely to come after the school. In that light, it seems clear that the Obama borrower defense rule is not a lucrative scam for crooked students at honest schools. Instead, it\u2019s protection for honest students at crooked schools. When the discussion moved on, NCLC lawyer Shafroth objected to another enormous barrier that the DeVos rule sets up: A student can rely on a state court judgment to get loan relief only if it\u2019s not a default or consent judgement, and only if it\u2019s a judgment that the student herself obtained. That would prevent a student from relying on the fact that her school settled her claim for cash, or that her school was in bankruptcy and didn\u2019t contest her claim, or that her state\u2019s attorney general obtained a multi-million dollar judgment against the school. These are common ways that claims against schools are resolved, yet they would count for nothing under the DeVos rule. But industry lawyer Lacey insisted that any other formulation would be unfair to schools. It appears that the drafters of the DeVos rule decided to include every conceivable obstacle to students recovering. Perhaps they thought they would make a better record for a subsequent court challenge if the Department could claim to have listened to students by eliminating some of the barriers before issuing a final rule. Or perhaps they calculate that if a court struck down some of the barriers, enough would survive to still render student rights, and the 1994 debt relief law, a nullity. As pro-student negotiators continued to expose flaws in the rule by pointing out its failures to protect students from predatory college abuses, some of the school representatives got indignant, claiming that the pro-student representatives were vilifying all for-profit schools, when their own schools were good and honest. This was an extraordinary position for several reasons. First, the pro-student negotiators had not condemned all for-profit schools, just specific egregious practices. Second, in last year\u2019s borrower defense rule meetings under the Obama administration, and in this year\u2019s gainful employment meetings under Trump, industry representatives have prevailed upon Department officials to warn negotiators not to single out specific schools for criticism \u2014 an absurd position, given the need to use illustrations to back up arguments. Third, the owners are singling out their own schools for praise, sometimes effusive praise. Finally, the owners who claim their industry is being vilified are the same ones who repeatedly claim that a strong rule will allow student scam artists to thrive; they are vilifying their own students. Addressing yet another barrier to student relief in the DeVos rule, Bridgepoint / Ashford lawyer Linda Rawles said it would be \u201crare\u201d for a college to enroll a mentally disabled or incapacitated student. That\u2019s really wrong when it comes to for-profit colleges. Here are a few examples: (1) Corinthian Colleges; (2) Bridgepoint / Ashford. Linda Rawles and Aaron Lacey \u2014 the lawyers tied to big predatory schools \u2014 are dominating the conversation for the industry side, commenting on nearly every point, while some other for-profit college negotiators say less. They also are asserting their will physically. Rawles is actually an alternate, rather than primary, negotiator. But while other alternates sit directly behind their primary negotiators, Rawles has carved out a spot at the table and eased her chair to just inches from it, next to the primary negotiator she was supposed to back up. Rawles\u2019 presence at the table has essentially displaced Lacey, who has gradually moved his chair to the head of the table and now the center of the head of the table, alongside the negotiators representing the Department of Education, who normally monopolize that side. Lacey\u2019s seizure of the Department\u2019s table territory, and Rawles\u2019 self-promotion to the table, are a reflection of the DeVos Department\u2019s proposed rule, which would give Lacey\u2019s clients, and Rawles\u2019 clients, everything they want.

      "content": " Three civil rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for rolling back protections for students who report sexual assault. SurvJustice, which helps university women report assault, joined with Equal Rights Advocates and the Victim Rights Law Center to file the suit, which argues that the changes are discriminatory, violate federal law and are having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on assault reports. In addition, schools are either not responding to the fewer complaints or not taking action as quickly, according to the suit. The suit was filed Thursday in the Northern District of California against DeVos, the Department of Education and Candice Jackson, acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the department. The suit argues that DeVos and Jackson hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d about women and are convinced that many who report sexual abuse or assault\u00a0\u201cmisunderstood a harmless romantic advance,\u201d are lying or later regretted a \u201cconsensual sexual encounter.\u201d This \u201cdiscriminatory mindset not only motivated decision makers at the department, it flows from the top of the Executive Branch,\u201d the complaint adds, referring to President\u00a0Donald Trump. DeVos issued a new policy in September increasing protections for those accused of sexual assault in kindergarten through college.\u00a0She said that the Obama administration hadn\u2019t ensured the rights of the accused and moved to adopt what she termed \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d Shortly before the changes, DeVos called the 2011 Obama-era policies addressing\u00a0campus sexual assault \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cwholly un-American.\u201d She raised the standard of proof for accusers from a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d to \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d The new guidelines also allowed even cases of sexual assault to be settled by mediation. Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California system, said at the time that changes would \u201cin effect weaken sexual violence protections\u201d and \u201cprompt confusion among campuses.\u201d Deadspin pointed out that DeVos ditched the Obama policies two days after meeting with the head of Michigan State University. Larry Nassar, a doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State\u2019s athletic department, was sentenced this week to up to 175 years in prison after more than 100 women confronted him in court for sexually assaulting them. He was fired by Michigan State in 2016. Shortly before the Education Department changes were made, Jackson flippantly dismissed \u201c90 percent\u201d of school sex assault reports in an interview with The New York Times. They \u201cfall into the category of \u2018we were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,\u2019\u201d Jackson told the newspaper. She has also branded the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment as \u201cfake victims.\u201d Laura Dunn, founder of SurvJustice and a university sex assault survivor, told People magazine: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the abuser-in-chief\u00a0take away our protections.\u201d Trump has been accused of assault or harassment by about\u00a021 women.",

      "author": "Carol Kuruvilla",
      "content": " When Bilal Askaryar woke up on the morning of Feb. 10 last year, he wasn\u2019t expecting to get arrested. But it was a risk he was willing to take. It was a cold winter\u2019s day in Washington, a city still buzzing from the spirit of historic civic protests. Just a few weeks earlier, hundreds of thousands of people\u00a0gathered on the National Mall to defend women\u2019s rights. Days later, activists flocked to Washington Dulles International Airport and marched through the nation\u2019s capital to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that sought to ban immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily halt refugee resettlement programs. Askaryar is a 32-year-old communications specialist who lives in D.C. and\u00a0who believes strongly in the right of Americans to participate in protests and, when necessary, in acts of civil disobedience. He participated in the Women\u2019s March and in protests against Trump\u2019s plans to restrict refugee immigration. That February morning, Askaryar briefly contemplated staying in his warm bed and skipping another, smaller protest set to take place at a local public school. But his conscience tugged at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be one of those people that opposes everything on social media or in dinner conversations among friends, but doesn\u2019t actually do anything about it, when it comes down to it,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my body on the line for those who can\u2019t.\u201d Askaryar said that in the hours that followed his decision to attend, he came to believe that engaging in civil disobedience as a Muslim can carry with it certain hazards. He said he ended up the only person facing legal charges for his actions that day, although he claims others at the protest were more combative with police officers at the scene. (The initial Washington Post story on the protest reported that one person was arrested, without providing a name.) In subsequent stories on Askaryar\u2019s case, media outlets honed in on his ethnicity and his place of birth \u2015 Afghanistan. That was information he doesn\u2019t think would have been spotlighted if he was a white protester. The U.S. Muslim community is heavily composed of immigrants and the children of immigrants from around the world. While native-born Muslims have been involved in civil rights demonstrations and other forms of political activism in the U.S. for decades, the newer wave of Muslim immigrants and their children, who hail primarily from South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, are experiencing a political awakening. They\u2019re running for office, forming new activist organizations\u00a0and getting involved in intersectional activism. But in a time when anti-Muslim hate crimes are spiking\u00a0and Islamophobic rhetoric flows from the highest political offices in the land, these Muslims find themselves having to defend their identity as Americans. Askaryar considers it ironic that while participating in civil disobedience, an act he believes is \u201cthe highest form of patriotism,\u201d\u00a0he had to contend with being portrayed as the \u201cother.\u201d As the story of his arrest gained traction, Askaryar said he felt a sense of panic, and then disillusionment. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe that every American citizen has a right to make his or her voice known and to fully exercise their First Amendment rights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this case, it\u2019s not true.\u201d The night before Feb. 10, Askaryar heard on social media about a Black Lives Matter protest planned for Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington. The BLM protesters and other local groups wanted to express their discontent with Trump\u2019s new education secretary, Betsy DeVos, who was visiting the school. Askaryar and other Devos critics\u00a0view her policies as detrimental to public schools. When he arrived for the demonstration, Askaryar said he and others learned that DeVos\u2019 team was trying to avoid confronting members of the local teachers\u2019 union, who were protesting at the building\u2019s front entrance. The BLM protesters positioned themselves at a side entrance, to force DeVos to enter through the front. In a video, Askaryar (wearing a black jacket and gray beanie) is seen with another protester physically blocking DeVos from using the side entrance. Holding a Black Lives Matter sign, the activist shouts \u201cShame\u201d as the education secretary retreats back into her car. In the ensuing altercations with police, Askaryar said that, like him, other protesters were resisting officers\u2019 instructions. Some demonstrators planted themselves in front of DeVos\u2019 vehicle and refused to budge. Yolanda C. Rondon, a lawyer with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, was acting as a legal observer at the protest. She told HuffPost she wasn\u2019t sure if police singled out Askaryar for arrest \u2015 \u201cI\u2019m not inside the police officer\u2019s mind,\u201d she said. But she does think Askaryar could have stood out to officers because of the way he looked. The police department had previously dealt with the BLM protesters, Rondon said. And most of the members of the National Lawyers Guild who joined in the protest were white, she said. Officers \u201cprobably saw Bilal and saw that he\u2019s not part of [those groups] and thought he\u2019s just a troublemaker ... here to start some stuff,\u201d Rondon said. \u201cThey probably did treat him differently because he wasn\u2019t black and he wasn\u2019t white.\u201d Askaryar was charged with two counts of assault on a police officer, one count of failure to obey a lawful order, and one count of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. All the charges were dismissed by a D.C. Superior Court judge in November. Askaryar said he believes the risk of being arrested goes with participating in civil disobedience. But there was one part of his encounter with the police that caused him to worry. He said one of the first things an officer asked him while he was being arrested was, \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d It\u2019s when he heard this question that he said he started to feel scared. \u201cBeing arrested was fine. I mean, I wasn\u2019t planning on it. But there are worse things than spending a night in D.C. jail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that was actually scary was that the police immediately went to, \u2018Where were you born,\u2019 and assuming that I wasn\u2019t a U.S. citizen.\u201d \u201cI saw then that they think that\u2019s relevant. And I knew I was in a sensitive situation because I happen to have been born in Afghanistan, which is a Muslim-majority country which people associate with scary things.\u201d Asked to comment on Askaryar\u2019s allegations of bias, Hugh Carew, a spokesperson for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, told HuffPost that \u201cif anyone believes that they were treated inappropriately by an MPD officer, we urge them to file a complaint with MPD or the Office of Police Complaints so the matter can be fully investigated.\u201d Askaryar said he\u2019s not interested in pursuing that course of action. But he also said that for him, the arrest was only the beginning of the story. Days after Askaryar\u2019s arrest, he said he grew concerned about coverage of his case by local and national media. Along with defending himself against the charges, he found himself having to defend his American identity. Askaryar\u2019s family came to the U.S. as political refugees in the 1990s, when he was just 5 years old. Askaryar has since become an American citizen. A few weeks before his arrest, he\u2019d published an essay on NPR about his family\u2019s past, and America\u2019s moral duty to continue to take in refugees fleeing persecution. After his arrest, Askaryar noticed something curious. In a follow-up story on him, the Post highlighted that he came to the country as a refugee \u2015 even making it the focus of the piece\u2019s headline. The Post also contacted Askaryar\u2019s father in California to ask about the family\u2019s background and his son\u2019s possible motives. Askaryar doesn\u2019t think white, non-Muslim activists arrested during acts of civil disobedience would have their family\u2019s immigration history detailed in this way. \u201cHow many times when white protesters get arrested do people think to call their parents? Or ask their parents about their ethnic background and motivations?\u201d Askaryar said. \u201cEverything about the coverage of my participation in the non-violent civil disobedience was framed as immigrant or refugee arrested for assault. That\u2019s not how we talk about Caucasians who get arrested on civil disobedience.\u201d The Post\u2019s reporting was picked up on other sites, including right-wing outlets\u00a0Gateway Pundit and PJ Media. The sites narrowed in on Askaryar\u2019s former status as a refugee. They also highlighted his sexual orientation, based on an article he had written for The Washington Blade, a queer online magazine in D.C. He said he began receiving online backlash from right-wing commentators, with some calling for him to be sent back to Afghanistan. Reading headlines like \u201cGay Refugee from Afghanistan Charged with Assault for Blocking Betsy DeVos\u201d and \u201cAfghan refugee pleads not guilty to charges following DeVos protest at D.C. school,\u201d Askaryar said he began feeling fearful about his safety and the safety of his family. He was also concerned the publicity would hurt his career prospects. Most of all,\u00a0he said he was astonished media organizations thought the fact that he had come to this country as a refugee decades ago was relevant to his protest against DeVos. Kristine Coratti Kelly, vice president of communications and events at the Post, told HuffPost that because Askaryar and his lawyer declined to speak with the newspaper for its follow-up article, the story relied on his NPR essay \u201cto give readers a sense of who he is. His father confirmed the account, telling us, as we reported, that his son\u2019s motivation in taking part in the protest was to \u2018protect education.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019m an American citizen,\u201d Askaryar said. \u201cI was there because I believe as an American citizen that dissent is the highest form of patriotism. It doesn\u2019t matter where I was born 30-something years ago.\u201d \u201cIf I was there protesting the president of Afghanistan visiting the United States, maybe [his immigration history] would be relevant,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I was there protesting the secretary of education of the United States of America.\u201d He said the only difference he sees in the attention he received \u201cis my ethnic background.\u201d In the years since the 9/11 attacks, Muslim organizations in the U.S. have documented a rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes and rhetoric. There are also more subtle ways in which presenting oneself as a Muslim in society spurs unintended consequences. Some describe the perils of \u201cflying while Muslim\u201d \u2015 referring to the discrimination and profiling Muslims face while traveling on airplanes. Simple things, like using the word \u201cAllah\u201d or reading a book about Syria, can cause fellow passengers alarm, and sometimes result in Muslims being kicked off flights. Muslim women describe facing verbal harassment online. Linda Sarsour, an outspoken Muslim activist and one of the leaders of last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March, is often the target of such attacks. Muslim communities have also been subjected to massive, unwarranted and targeted surveillance by law enforcement\u00a0\u2015 with officers eavesdropping on conversations, infiltrating student groups, and monitoring sermons in mosques. Such religious profiling has enflamed already tense relations between American Muslims and law enforcement, Rondon said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to note that, similar to the black community, Muslim and Arab communities have had strenuous relationships with the police, particularly because they feel [officers] are only there to police them and not to keep them safe,\u201d she said. Askaryar said he believes he stood out from the rest of the activists at Jefferson Middle School Academy not because of what he was doing, but because he was a Muslim man with a beard. Askaryar has sported a beard since 2015. Although he\u2019s a devout Muslim and some Muslims choose to have beards to emulate the Prophet Muhammad, Askaryar said he didn\u2019t grow one because of his faith. Rather, it was simply something he decided to do for aesthetic reasons. For most of his life, he said, he had been \u201crelatively passing\u201d as an American citizen. But once he had the beard, he said he began to notice a difference in the way he was labeled. People began to \u201cassume maybe this guy is a Muslim or Middle Eastern.\u201d Blair Imani, a community activist based in Brooklyn, New York, is well acquainted with how appearances associated with being a Muslim can change other people\u2019s perceptions. Before Imani converted to Islam in 2015, she said she was seen by others only as a black woman during protests in which she participated. But after she began wearing a hijab, she said the heckling she received at demonstrations changed. People started to telling her to \u201cgo back to where you\u2019re from\u201d \u2015 even though black Muslims have been in the United States for centuries. \u201cAs a black woman, protest and standing up against police brutality was in the canon of who I was expected to be,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once I converted, there\u2019s this foreignness that the Muslim identity is given.\u201d Mariam Durrani, an anthropologist who studies Muslim youth at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, agreed that Muslim Americans continue to be seen as foreigners. And\u00a0because of the current climate of xenophobia and anti-Muslim racism, Muslims Americans \u2015 like other minority groups \u2015 are often held to higher standards when protesting. \u201cMuslim Americans are expected to be model citizens, which somehow means not being critical of policies or the government,\u201d she told HuffPost. Black and indigenous Muslim American communities have been speaking up about discrimination for decades. But as the non-native community grows, Durrani said, its\u00a0youth are starting to see themselves as stakeholders in conversations the country is having about race, class, and gender. \u201cToday\u2019s activism is intersectional, digital, and begins with the premise that [Muslims] are part of this country and invested in its future,\u201d Durrani said. The problem is that when Muslim activists engage in protest, the story often becomes more about who is protesting, instead of what is being protested. That\u2019s what Imani sees when Muslim women protest while wearing the hijab. \u201cWhat would make it easier is if our message resonated in a way that honors who we\u2019re protesting \u2026 versus, \u2018Oh, she was wearing a scarf,\u2019\u201d \u00a0she said. Askaryar said his experiences last year haven\u2019t deterred him from wanting to participate in civil disobedience in the future. But he called his arrest and the media coverage of it a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d \u201cI used to think that I could show up at these Black Lives Matter actions and volunteer because black kids should not be doing this because they\u2019re in a lot more danger than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve realized since that that may be true, but it\u2019s also not a good time for Muslims, South Asians, Arab folks to be engaging in these things either.\u201d As an immigrant and a Muslim, he said he\u2019s experienced discrimination. But this was the first time he really understood the double standard that Muslim activists, and other minority activists, are held to. \u201cPeople brashly question, \u2018Why is this former immigrant engaging in civil disobedience? If you don\u2019t like this country go back to where you come from.\u2019 That kind of obnoxious, toxic rhetoric is anti-American at its core,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cPeople have been given license to increasingly question their fellow Americans that have different origins than they do. ... We are protesting not because we hate this country, but because we love this country and we want to hold it to the highest ideals that it aspires to.\u201d",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " NEW YORK \u2015 When Betsy DeVos was named education secretary last February, she become public education\u2019s No. 1 enemy. After all, the billionaire is notorious for her desire to expand private school choice programs (which include many religious private schools that teach Christian fundamentalist doctrine). One year into her tenure, educators have turned this opposition into action. As in so many industries and among Democrats at large, there has been a wave of activism in response to President Donald Trump in the past year. In education, this activism has manifested as a renewed rallying around traditional public schools. The Network for Public Education, an advocacy group, has seen membership shoot up to 330,000 members, compared to 22,000 members before DeVos was nominated. The previous year, membership had increased by only a fraction of that amount. And in states like Kentucky, more teachers than ever\u00a0are running for office. Polls have shown a decline in support for some of DeVos\u2019 favorite types of schools. One poll from August showed that public enthusiasm for charter schools \u2015 a type of public school that is privately operated and often has support from both parties \u2015\u00a0is dropping. Another poll, from American Federation for Children, the education reform group DeVos used to head, found that overall support for the concept of \u201cschool choice\u201d has been dropping too, although it remains high. (The AFC poll defines school choice as giving \u201cparents the right to use the tax dollars designated for their child\u2019s education to send their child to the public or private school which best serves their needs.\u201d) DeVos \u201cwas a wake-up call to everyone who was concerned about the future of public education,\u201d Diane Ravitch,\u00a0a former U.S. assistant secretary of education and founder of the Network for Public Education, said\u00a0over breakfast in a Brooklyn neighborhood in January.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually glad\u00a0[Trump] chose her.\u201d Ravitch, who is writing a book about resistance to school privatization efforts, calls DeVos a \u201cblessing in disguise.\u201d For the first time in a decade, Ravitch said, she feels public schools are \u201cgaining ground on the school privatization movement... and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to survive the scrutiny.\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second largest teachers union, says she has also seen increased engagement among her members in the age of Trump and DeVos \u2015 especially as an upcoming Supreme Court case threatens to deal a major blow to union finances. She told HuffPost she has recently observed a string of local races where pro-public education advocates have prevailed. More members are showing up at town halls and regional meetings. \u201cYou see a tremendous appetite to fight,\u201d Weingarten said. But she\u2019s not cheery about the reasons for this increased engagement. \u201cWhat you also see, on the other side, is a brazen, non-hidden quest to just kill us, and to kill every bit of every tool that enables broad-based voice and opportunity,\u201d she said. Indeed, Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, says she is far more more worried than she is optimistic about DeVos\u2019 impact. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, even though there is a heightened awareness and pushback, there is so much money on the other side that it is overwhelming,\u201d said Burris, a former public school principal. Despite widespread dislike for DeVos and some of her policies,\u00a0these issues are still moving forward in many places. A majority of consequential education policy decisions are made at the state and local levels, especially as DeVos\u2019 plans for more federal school choice have mostly stalled. Burris notes that groups like hers have seen an increase in monetary donations \u2015 but \u201cbecause there are so many Republican majorities in statehouses, they are seizing the day,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are sponsoring legislation at a breakneck speed.\u201d Advocates for charter schools say they have seen some declining support from liberals, but support among centrists and conservatives has remained steady. Peri Lynn Turnbull handles external relations and strategy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. She says that while charter schools have become a harder sell in left-leaning, anti-Trump states, she\u2019s glad that overall it has become a more relevant issue. It has become challenging, though, to combat what she calls increased misinformation about what charter schools are and what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s elevated the conversation, for one. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Turnbull, whose organization has also been critical of many of Trump and DeVos\u2019 signature priorities. On the other hand, Lennie Jarratt of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank,\u00a0said there\u2019s been an increase in private school choice legislation at the state level that \u201chadn\u2019t happened like that in prior years.\u201d Private school choice takes various forms \u2015 whether through tax credits, vouchers, or education savings accounts \u2015 but it generally helps parents subsidize a child\u2019s enrollment in a private school. Opponents of private school choice say it drains public school systems of resources. \u201cTeachers unions pushed back harder probably than any other year against school choice,\u201d Jarratt said. \u201cThe proponents of school choice [have] been just as vocal, and more vocal too.\u201d Jeanne Allen, head of the pro-charter and pro-voucher group Center for Education Reform, says that not having to advocate as much to get a voice with federal leaders has freed up her group to focus more on other issues. She doesn\u2019t believe that opposition to DeVos has had any lasting impact on the education field. \u201cShe\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but when I talk to people from all walks of life, I get very little, I hear very little criticism,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI think the political fallout over her confirmation was a very, very small vocal minority of people who have any kind of lasting concerns.\u201d",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " A lawsuit accusing the Department of Education of discrimination in its revision of college sexual assault guidelines is now using as ammunition President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s defense of his former staff secretary,\u00a0Rob Porter. Porter resigned from his White House job\u00a0earlier this month after his security clearance was held up by accusations of domestic violence from both of his former wives. Trump, however,\u00a0praised Porter and implied he may have been \u201cfalsely accused.\u201d Porter denied the women\u2019s accusations. Trump\u2019s comments are now being cited in the lawsuit as evidence of the administration\u2019s\u00a0\u201cdisbelief of women and girls\u201d and its \u201cdisregard for gender-based violence.\u201d The lawsuit challenges new guidelines on sexual assault claims at universities. Three civil rights organizations filed the suit\u00a0last month in the Northern District of California against the Education Department and Education Secretary\u00a0Betsy DeVos\u00a0for\u00a0rolling back protections\u00a0for students who report sexual assault. The suit was amended Wednesday to include the details of Porter\u2019s resignation and Trump\u2019s comments. Another member of the administration, speechwriter David Sorenson, also stepped down this month amid allegations of domestic abuse, which he has denied. As the reports of Porter\u2019s alleged abuse were made public, \u201cPresident Trump defended Mr. Porter, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly stated that Mr. Porter is a man of \u2018integrity,\u2019\u201d the amended suit now states. \u201cAfter Porter and Sorensen\u2019s resignations, Trump tweeted: \u2018Peoples [sic] lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused \u2014 life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u2019\u201d the suit adds. The lawsuit argues that this\u00a0\u201canimus towards women gives license to and encourages executive branch decision-makers who share the same discriminatory views to perpetuate those views in their work.\u201d This anti-woman bias is apparent in DeVos\u2019\u00a0new policy in September rolling back protections for those in public kindergarten through college claiming sexual assault and increasing protections for those accused, the lawsuit says. DeVos said that the Obama administration hadn\u2019t ensured the rights of the accused. Before revising the federal guidelines, DeVos criticized the Obama administration for toughing the\u00a0campus sexual assault\u00a0policy in 2011, calling it \u201cshameful\u201d and\u00a0\u201cwholly un-American.\u201d DeVos raised the standard of proof for accusers from a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d to \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d The new guidelines also allow even cases of sexual assault to be settled by mediation. The suit argues that DeVos and Candace Jackson, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d about women and are convinced that many who report sexual abuse or assault\u00a0\u201cmisunderstood a harmless romantic advance,\u201d are lying or just came to regret a \u201cconsensual sexual encounter.\u201d Shortly before the Education Department changes were made, Jackson\u00a0flippantly dismissed \u201c90 percent\u201d of school sex assault reports\u00a0in an interview with The New York Times. She has also branded the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct as \u201cfake victims.\u201d\u00a0Trump has been accused of assault or harassment by\u00a021 women.",

      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " The Education Department announced on Monday that it will open an investigation into Michigan State University and how the school handled reports of child sexual abuse involving former doctor Larry Nassar. \u201cThis new Title IX investigation will look at systemic issues in the University\u2019s handling of sex-based incidents involving Dr. Larry Nassar,\u201d Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in a press release. Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU\u2019s campus. During this time, he sexually abused\u00a0over 260 young girls and women\u00a0under the guise of medical treatment.\u00a0He recently received three concurrent sentences of\u00a060 years,\u00a040-125 years\u00a0and\u00a040-175 years\u00a0in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography. Several of Nassar\u2019s victims\u00a0say they reported the abuse\u00a0to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were\u00a0continually disregarded\u00a0or swept under the rug. According to an investigative report from the Detroit News, at least\u00a014 MSU representatives knew about\u00a0Nassar\u2019s abuse and failed to report it. According to the Education Department\u2019s statement, the Office for Civil Rights is heading to East Lansing, Michigan, where the school is located, to join the Federal Student Aid team to begin the investigation. \u201cI appreciated seeing acting President [John] Engler\u2019s directive to the entire university to cooperate fully with our \u2015 and with all \u2015 inquiries into the university\u2019s actions,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cWe expect MSU\u2019s full and complete disclosure about its actions to protect students from sexual assault.\u201d MSU\u2019s last president, Lou Anna K. Simon, resigned in January after 13 years in the role amid criticism that she did not do enough to stop Nassar\u2019s abuse. In a statement to HuffPost, MSU\u2019s vice president for communications and brand strategy, Heather Swain, said the university was notified last week of the Title IX investigation. \u201cAs we have been, MSU is cooperating fully with this and all investigations,\u201d Swain said. \u201cOur focus is on taking the actions that demonstrate the voices of the survivors have been heard and on creating a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community.\u201d DeVos said the crimes Nassar committed are \u201cunimaginable,\u201d and went on to applaud the bravery of the dozens of survivors who spoke out against him. \u201cThe bravery shown by the survivors has been remarkable. My heart goes out to them as they have had to relive their horrific experiences and as they begin the long road to healing,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery student across every campus should know that I am committed to ensuring all students have access to a learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination and that all institutions that fall short will be held accountable for violations of federal law,\u201d DeVos added. During Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearings earlier this year, 265 survivors and family members read impact statements in court. Their statements were emotional, cathartic and powerful, taking the news cycle by storm. Many of the survivors called for investigations into MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for how poorly the organizations handled the accusations against Nassar. \u201cI knew that he abused me. I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,\u201d survivor Amanda Thomashow\u00a0said\u00a0in her victim impact statement. MSU has repeatedly denied covering up Nassar\u2019s behavior in any way. \u201cAny suggestion that the university covered up Nassar\u2019s horrific conduct is simply false,\u201d\u00a0MSU spokesperson Jason Cody\u00a0told HuffPost\u00a0in January.\u00a0\u201cNassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.\u201d Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed a bill that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual assault in the wake of the Nassar scandal. In January,\u00a0Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) announced that his office will also conduct an\u00a0\u201cindependent, thorough, transparent and prompt\u201d investigation into MSU and its handling of the Nassar case.

      "content": " Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School weren\u2019t pleased with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 visit to the Parkland, Florida, school on Wednesday. They told HuffPost that DeVos met with few students and gave \u201cBS answers\u201d to their questions about what she plans to do to address gun violence. The brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members there. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence. Student journalists at the school, who said they were among the only students that DeVos met,\u00a0described feeling \u201cdisappointed\u201d\u00a0by DeVos\u2019 visit and called it \u201cintrusive\u201d and \u201cnot helpful.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I didn\u2019t understand what the point was for her to come,\u201d senior Kyra Parrow, editor-in-chief of the school yearbook, told HuffPost. \u201cShe didn\u2019t answer my questions properly. It wasn\u2019t informative. It wasn\u2019t helpful at all. She just kind of gave me a BS answer.\u201d A number of the students,\u00a0some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions. Carly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, The Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d Student Ryan Deitsch told HuffPost that they were not allowed to record DeVos\u2019 visit.\u00a0However, Parrow said she was not told anything was off-limits in her coverage, but she wished DeVos had met with more students. \u201cI was lucky enough to be able to follow her around, but no other students were invited,\u201d she said. \u201cMy peers have every right to have a voice just as much as I do. I was lucky enough to ask her a question, but you know what? My other peers deserve to ask a question.\u201d Anna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there\u201d and that DeVos\u00a0\u201cwas very vague in her answers\u201d to students\u2019 questions about what she plans to do on gun violence. DeVos \u2015 who has generated fierce opposition from education activists and who, during her Senate confirmation hearing, famously suggested protecting schools from bear attacks \u2015 did not discuss specific gun policy proposals with reporters on Wednesday, deferring to local and state officials. When asked about proposals to train and arm certain teachers, for which President Donald Trump has expressed approval, DeVos said the idea has been \u201cmischaracterized,\u201d arguing that it should be \u201ca model\u201d but not \u201cmandated or required for every community.\u201d Asked about students\u2019 reactions to possibly arming teachers, she claimed that \u201cwe didn\u2019t have a conversation about that.\u201d In addition to the limited group of student journalists, DeVos briefly met with students with therapy dogs and was introduced to school officials, teachers and counselors, Fusco said. \u201cThat was literally it,\u201d she said, adding that she wished DeVos \u201cwould have asked to hear from the majority and not a few.\u201d \u201cIf anything, her visit was intrusive,\u201d Deitsch said. \u201cShe was clearly there for a photo op. This was nothing more.\u201d He added that DeVos interrupted a group of students in a therapy session, a detail that Fusco and Parrow confirmed. \u201cI saw their faces, like, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\u201d Fusco said of the students. Parrow recalled witnessing it from afar, saying that she \u201cbacked away from it because I felt uncomfortable.\u201d Later the same day, Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade made a surprise visit to the school, meeting with students and staff, and telling them that he was \u201cinspired by all of you.\u201d Parrow said she appreciated DeVos visiting Stoneman Douglas but wished the education secretary could have offered more than \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d \u201cShe has the power to do something,\u201d Parrow said. \u201cShe has the power to make change, and she has those connections. I felt almost disrespected that she came to my school and spoke to my face and said nothing that was helpful, like, \u2018Why did you come anyway? We don\u2019t need thoughts and prayers \u2014 we\u2019re done with that. We need action.

DeVos first attempted to dodge the question, telling Stahl that \u201cone sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many.\u201d When Stahl repeated the question, DeVos became flustered. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d DeVos answered. \u201cBut I\u2019m committed to a process that\u2019s fair for everyone involved.\u201d The Education Department did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. DeVos has been widely criticized for\u00a0rescinding\u00a0an Obama-era Title IX guideline called \u201cThe Dear Colleague Letter.\u201d The 2011 letter was a comprehensive set of guidelines that clarifies schools\u2019 responsibilities under the gender-equality law. It also serves as a tool for victims and those accused throughout the reporting process. The education secretary came under fire last summer when she met people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes in group discussions of campus sexual assault. One group she met with\u00a0mainly consisted of members\u00a0of the National Coalition for Men, which a\u00a0survivor advocate described\u00a0as\u00a0\u201cviciously and very intentionally harass[ing] rape survivors.\u201d During a September 2017 speech at George Mason University Law School, DeVos called the current campus reporting process a \u201cfailed system\u201d that is \u201cincreasingly elaborate and confusing.\u201d\u00a0She dedicated nearly half of her 20-minute speech to anecdotes about people wrongfully accused of assault. In January, several civil rights and sexual assault survivor advocacy groups sued the Education Department and DeVos over her actions to roll back the Title IX guidelines. Watch the full \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview below. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this article indicated that DeVos planned to roll back The Dear Colleague Letter. In fact, the Education Secretary officially rescinded the letter in September of last year.",

      "content": " Questioned by a persistent lawmaker on Tuesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said private schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students should not be eligible for federal dollars, backtracking from an answer she gave last year. Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) had pressed DeVos\u00a0on the issue at a House appropriations subcommittee hearing last May. At that time, DeVos indicated she thought the importance of state autonomy and parental choice should allow schools with such discriminatory policies to still qualify for federal dollars. This year, Clark again focused on the issue at a similar hearing and DeVos finally relented, saying these schools should not be eligible for the money. Clark\u2019s questioning stemmed from Education Department\u2019s 2019 budget proposal, which calls for giving more than $1 billion to school choice initiatives. Such programs \u2015 which are currently only supported at the state and local level \u2015 help families use public dollars to fund scholarships to private schools. A HuffPost investigation previously found that many institutions that participate in these programs \u2015 at least 14 percent of religious schools \u2015 have explicit policies discriminating against LGBTQ students. \u201cI cannot find a single state that protects LGBT students within the states\u2019 voucher anti-discrimination laws,\u201d Clark said at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cState dollars flow to private schools that are allowed to discriminate. I couldn\u2019t find any case where that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Clark asked DeVos whether approval of her department\u2019s budget would mean federal funds \u2015 in addition to state dollars \u2015 would flow to these exclusionary schools. DeVos repeatedly tried to evade the question, saying that \u201cwhere federal dollars flow, federal law must be adhered to,\u201d along with variations of that response. But Clark repeatedly demanded a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. \u201cIs there some problem? Yes or no. Would you guarantee?\u201d asked Clark. Pinned down, DeVos complied with Clark\u2019s request and said that \u201cyes,\u201d schools with discriminatory polices should be precluded from federal funds. \u201cTook a year,\u201d Clark said in response.

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos got an earful about her student loan policies on Tuesday during a House appropriations subcommittee hearing. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) went after DeVos over new departmental guidance that would tend to\u00a0protect federal student loan servicers\u00a0that employ predatory collection practices in violation of state regulations.\u00a0The guidance, issued in March,\u00a0states that only federal authorities have the authority to oversee such loan collection programs. \u201cDespite your statements all morning about supporting states\u2019 rights, what your office has done, you\u2019ve issued a declaration to pre-empt state regulations on companies that collect student loans,\u201d DeLauro said in the budget hearing. The Connecticut congresswoman pointed to multiple settlements in favor of student borrowers against a \u201ctrack record of predatory practices and abuses\u201d by loan servicers. A number of states, including Connecticut, have\u00a0lost the right to protect their consumers\u00a0under the Education Department\u2019s new policy. DeVos made attempts to defend her department\u2019s oversight efforts, but was interrupted by DeLauro. At one point, as she tried to speak,\u00a0the congresswoman asked her, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone believe what you are doing?\u201d DeVos stuttered and paused, closing her eyes, on several occasions. \u201cWho do you believe this serves?\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cDoes it serve the borrowers or the servicers?\u201d Earlier this month, the bipartisan National Governors Association\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0warning against the Education Department\u2019s guidance. \u201cStates have stepped up to fill the void left, we believe, by the absence of federal protections for student loan borrowers, from potential abusive practices by companies servicing student loans,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWith this declaration, the department moves to block state policies protecting student borrowers by establishing a federal regulatory ceiling.\u201d Watch the full exchange between DeVos and DeLauro in the C-SPAN clip above.",

      "subtitle": "These transgender students hoped the Department of Education would help them. Instead, they were rejected.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "At least three school districts around the country are continuing to enforce potentially hostile restroom policies for transgender students after the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights refused to investigate student complaints, HuffPost has learned. One of those students, 18-year-old Preston Curts, a transgender male senior at a high school in Florida, originally filed a discrimination claim back in 2016, under the Obama administration. He filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department challenging Marion County Schools\u2019\u00a0rule that banned transgender students from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity. He hoped things would change, at least before he graduated. In December, Curts\u2019 complaint was abruptly dismissed by the Trump administration, quashing any possibility that he will get to spend his last few months of school in an environment where he\u2019s allowed to be himself. In January, HuffPost broke the news that the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights was refusing to investigate these types of complaints. A month later, the Trump administration publicly discussed the protocol shift. HuffPost has learned exclusive details about the students who are being left behind in the wake of this policy change. There are at least four bathroom-related cases throughout the country, including Curts\u2019, that have been dismissed by the Trump administration amid this policy change. In response to these claims \u2015 which deal with school districts in Hawaii, Michigan, Texas and Florida \u2015 the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) specifically told the complainant that the agency was no longer obligated to investigate instances of bathroom discrimination involving transgender students. The Trump administration contends that the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination does not cover gender identity. In at least three of these districts, there continues to be either an explicit policy banning transgender students from specific facilities or a vague procedure that doesn\u2019t necessarily give transgender students\u2019 access to the restroom that aligns with their gender identity. Now that the Trump administration has abandoned this issue, some students are stuck in hostile schools with little hope for change. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like effort going to nothing,\u201d Curts told HuffPost of his previous legal action. Curts\u2019 complaint \u2015 which was filed on his behalf by the Florida branch of the ACLU \u2015 was submitted in May 2016, in the same week that the Obama administration released guidance calling on schools to give students access to facilities based on their gender identity. For Curts, who is being identified publicly for the first time, it seemed like progress was on the horizon. Then, a few months later, Trump happened. Curts had already been using male restrooms in school since he was 13, before a local parent found out about it in 2016 and pushed the school administration to take action. The issue turned into an acrimonious public debate. Curts would slip into Marion County School Board meetings and listen to the adults in the room discuss his private restroom habits, speculating how violating it would be for students to potentially face him in such an intimate space. Curts \u201cpassed\u201d for male, and many didn\u2019t know at the time that the so-called threat they were discussing was sitting among them. The whole scenario was almost funny, in an excruciating sort of way, Curts recalled. \u201cThis huge thing unraveled before me,\u201d Curts said, of the school board\u2019s decision to adopt an anti-transgender resolution on the issue. Curts made his best attempts to ignore the opposition. He continued using the male restrooms, even with the new Marion County resolution. But doing this led to multiple suspensions. His sophomore year, he was suspended twice, the second time for three days. His junior year, he faced another three-day suspension. After watching his grades suffer, he knew he had to figure something else out. \u201cThey basically put you in a position where they force you to give up,\u201d he said. Curts eventually worked out a deal with his high school administration allowing him to use the men\u2019s faculty restroom. Teachers will still reprimand him for being a kid in the teacher\u2019s room if they haven\u2019t been made aware of his situation. It\u2019s not ideal, but for now, it seems like the best option to \u201csurvive at school.\u201d Public Relations officer for Marion County schools Kevin Christian confirmed that school board policy says students must use the restroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificate, but that alternative arrangements can be made with school principals. When asked about Curts\u2019 suspensions, Christian said that while he would not discuss disciplinary action taken against any students, \u201cthere are consequences to breaking the rules.\u201d HuffPost also reached out to members of the Marion County School Board for clarification on the reasoning behind the rule. Only one member responded over email. \u201cI have no interest in remounting an old retired horse. I have students who can\u2019t read in this district and which bathroom they use has zero to do with their test scores,\u201d wrote school board member Nancy Stacy. At the time the resolution was passed, arguments in favor of it centered around student safety and student privacy. HuffPost reached out to the other school districts that previously had complaints filed against them on this issue, to learn more about their current policies. In Texas, athletic director of Prosper Independent School District Valerie Little told HuffPost that while all the district\u2019s students currently use the facilities consistent with their birth sex, the district would \u201cpossibly\u201d allow a student to work out an alternative arrangement after meeting with the child and figuring out a plan \u201cfor what is best for all students.\u201d In Michigan, a representative for Bedford Public Schools told HuffPost that the complaint against them had been voluntarily rescinded by parents involved, although information obtained by HuffPost contradicts this claim. The representative, communications specialist Sandy Kraine, told HuffPost over email that Bedford students \u201ccan use the traditional single sex restrooms that correspond with their biological gender or any of the gender neutral locations in the building.\u201d The principal of the last school,\u00a0Wilfred Murakami of Kealakehe High School in Hawaii, said that since the initial complaint was filed, the school has changed its policies and has \u201cbeen able to resolve without conflict the requests of students who identify as transgender.\u201d A representative of the Hawaii Department of Education also pointed to district guidelines calling on schools to give students access to facilities consistent with their gender identities. HuffPost also reached out to a district in Tennessee, where the ACLU previously filed a bathroom-related complaint on behalf of a student. Months into the Trump administration, the ACLU voluntarily withdrew this complaint amid suspicions that it would not be treated fairly. The district did not get back to HuffPost with details of their current policy. HuffPost has also learned of at least one other complaint on this issue in Florida that is still open. The Obama administration interpreted Title IX \u2015 the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination \u2015 to include discrimination based on gender identity. The Trump administration, on the other hand, says the law does not extend this far, although two influential federal appeals courts have disputed this. Just a few months into the Trump presidency, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice rescinded the Obama-era guidance on this issue.\u00a0For almost a year, though, it was unclear how the administration would deal with specific instances of alleged discrimination. In February, Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told BuzzFeed that \u201cin the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.\u201d When questioned at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this month about this narrower view of Title IX, department Secretary Betsy DeVos responded, \u201cThis department is not going to make law; we are going to continue to enforce laws.\u201d Advocates vehemently disagree with this interpretation of the law, and say that the Education Department is failing to protect an already vulnerable student population. Denying students access to the correct bathrooms can negatively impact their grades and make them feel unsafe at school, says Laura Wernick, a Fordham professor who has studied the issue. \u201cThe literature is really clear that when gender non-conforming and trans youth don\u2019t feel safe using restrooms, it has a huge effect not only on them physically but also on their whole sense of self on issues of depression and well-being,\u201d Wernick told HuffPost. In Curts\u2019 case, the complaint he filed was not just about him. He\u2019s not the only trans student in his high school, and not the only student having this issue. A younger student at the same Marion County school, who is using the pseudonym of Jake to protect his identity, is facing similar issues. Jake\u2019s entire day is colored by gender-related obstacles. On the school bus, boys and girls are made to sit separately by gender, a policy which had obvious complications for Jake. Jake started getting bullied, and as result, is now driven to school by family. Jake also participates in his school\u2019s JROTC for physical education credit. To avoid having to change in a locker room, he shows up to school in his gym clothing. After class, he walks across campus to change in the nurse\u2019s office. Having to change separately from other students also outs Jakes to peers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise know he is transgender. Jake normally uses the nurse\u2019s office bathroom, single-stall bathrooms attached to a few classrooms or faculty restrooms. But once, when he was in a rush, he used a regular male restroom. He thought no one was around to see him enter it. He was wrong, and ended up with a detention. Now Jake is doing his best to stay out of trouble. He says he \u201cloves\u201d the academic part of school and he hopes to eventually attend medical school. He once considered joining the military after high school, but has decided against it. He says that while he \u201cloves America,\u201d he doesn\u2019t \u201csuspect he would thrive in the military\u201d and he is more passionate about medicine. Indeed, President Trump recently announced limits on allowing transgender people to serve in the military. Like Curts, Jake isn\u2019t optimistic that anything will change at Marion. He\u2019s just doing his best to make it through. \u201cYou have a handful of people who care about you, and a pot full of people who could care less what happened to you,\u201d Jake said.",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with a group of civil rights leaders, parents and teachers Wednesday morning to discuss the impact of Obama-era guidance that calls on schools to reduce their reliance on suspensions and to consider whether racial bias plays a role in their disciplinary practices. The examination of this guidance is part of DeVos\u2019 work as leader of a new Federal Commission on School Safety, although she has reportedly been thinking for months about rescinding the guidance. Wednesday\u2019s meeting,\u00a0which took place on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., involved leaders in some of the country\u2019s most prominent civil rights groups, including the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law \u2015 all of which are strongly in favor of keeping the guidance. Other participants included leaders from the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, the National Education Association, as well as teachers from the advocacy group Educators for Excellence and education researchers. Later on Wednesday, DeVos also met with groups, parents and teachers who want to see the guidance repealed. Liz King, senior policy analyst and director of education policy for the Leadership Conference, described the morning meeting as \u201cfrustrating and underwhelming.\u201d King spoke directly to Education Department officials about how this administration\u2019s actions are having a negative impact on school climate, especially for LGBTQ and immigrant students. She urged DeVos to maintain the existing guidance. \u201cOur children deserve better than this administration,\u201d said King, who described DeVos as \u201cvery pleasant,\u201d although \u201cshe didn\u2019t say much.\u201d Evan Stone, co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, left the meeting with a more positive view, although he still suspects advocates of the guidance are fighting an \u201cuphill battle.\u201d He was heartened that DeVos opened the meeting by acknowledging the large racial disparities in how students are disciplined. DeVos said she was moved by the stories from educators in the room, according to Stone. Stone\u2019s group requested that DeVos come visit some of the communities that have had positive experiences with the Obama-era guidance. \u201cHopefully the lived experience of teachers who are working to change things will have an impact,\u201d\u00a0he said. In a country where students of color, students with disabilities and LGBTQ students are disproportionately subject to harsh disciplinary practices, like suspensions and expulsions, the guidance is seen as a tool to help reduce the flow of students who are pushed from school into the criminal justice system. The guidance warns schools that they could be found in violation of federal civil rights laws if they are disciplining some groups of students \u2015 like students of color or students with disabilities \u2015 at disproportionately high rates. It also encourages schools to adopt restorative justice practices as a way to deal with discipline issues,\u00a0rather than punishments that push kids out of the classroom. On the other side of the issue, critics say the guidance helps keep disruptive children in the classroom, putting teachers and students at risk. The guidance came under renewed scrutiny after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, when conservative leaders speculated that lax discipline policies allowed the accused shooter\u2019s behavior to go unchecked. (The school\u2019s responses to the suspect\u2019s behavior appear entirely unrelated to the guidance. The Education Department had also started meeting with critics of the guidance months before the shooting.) But even before Wednesday\u2019s meetings began, DeVos faced critiques from the advocacy groups and civil rights organizations that had not been offered a seat at the table. Groups like the National Women\u2019s Law Center sent DeVos a letter\u00a0slamming what they called\u00a0\u201cthe exclusive and non-transparent approach\u201d of the summit. The letter was co-signed by groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality. It expressed the groups\u2019 support for the guidance. A number of other groups asked to be included in Wednesday\u2019s discussion but did not receive an invitation. A representative from the National Disability Rights Network told HuffPost they asked the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights for an invitation last Friday, but the agency declined. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a group that represents children with disabilities, also asked both the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and its Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services for an invitation, but did not hear back. King said it was \u201cwas glaringly apparent there was no one from the disability community, the LGBTQ community, the Native American community, the Latino community, or the immigrant community in the room.\u201d Additionally, only one of the country\u2019s major teachers unions was invited, with the administration leaving out the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cI find it very offensive that they don\u2019t want to hear our opinions,\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten told HuffPost. DeVos\u2019 meeting with critics of the guidance included groups like the Manhattan Institute, as well as parents and teachers who believe the guidance should be rescinded. (The Education Department did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for information about who would be present at this meeting.) Nicole Landers of Baltimore County is one such parent. She says the relaxed disciplinary practices at her kids\u2019 schools have come at the expense of student safety.\u00a0Landers\u2019 daughter was sexually harassed last year by another student when she was a fifth-grader. Her older son was bullied to the point where he became suicidal. Their tormentors, though, remained in the classroom, and she believes the Obama-era guidance helped make this situation possible. \u201cWhatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,\u201d Landers said. \u201cIt takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.\u201d This is a developing story.

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " A nonpartisan government watchdog agency released a report Wednesday outlining severe disparities between how white students and students of color are disciplined \u2015 the same day\u00a0Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with groups\u00a0to discuss possibly rescinding Obama-era guidance designed to reduce these inequities. The Government Accountability Office report, which was requested by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Jerrold Nadler\u00a0(D-N.Y.), comes as civil rights leaders are fighting tooth and nail to save this guidance. The 2014 guidance calls on schools to reduce their reliance on harsh disciplinary practices like suspensions and expulsions. It also warns schools they could run afoul of federal law if certain groups of students are disproportionately punished. The Education Department data analyzed in this report is from the 2013-2014 school year, and reveals deep discipline disparities across student groups \u2015 the very problem the guidance is intended to address.\u00a0Independent of school poverty level, type of public school or type of disciplinary action, boys, students with disabilities, and black students are being punished at far higher rates than other students. For black students, these inequities start as early as preschool. This is the first such analysis to explicitly compare schools at different poverty levels. In high-poverty schools, black students are overrepresented among students who receive suspensions by 25 percentage points, and in more affluent schools, they are overrepresented by 12 points, the data shows. Students with disabilities face similar problems. In affluent schools, students with disabilities are overrepresented among students who receive suspensions by 20 points, while in low-income schools, they are overrepresented by nearly 11 points. Notably, some disability groups claim they were left out of Wednesday\u2019s discussions with DeVos on the disciplinary guidance. Two advocacy groups told HuffPost they asked for an invitation to the summit but were either rebuffed or ignored. Spokespeople for the Education Department did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the matter. Even though black students only make up about 16 percent of public school students, they account for nearly 40 percent of students who are suspended from school, the report says. A similar pattern exists for students with disabilities, and for male students in general. Students with disabilities make up about 12 percent of public school students, but account for a quarter of those who are suspended, referred to outside law enforcement or arrested at school. \u201cThe analysis shows that students of color suffer harsher discipline for lesser offenses than their white peers and that racial bias is a driver of discipline disparities,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cThis report underscores the need to combat these gross disparities by strengthening, not rescinding, the 2014 Discipline Guidance Package, which recommends specific strategies to reduce the disparities without jeopardizing school safety.\u201d Proponents of the Obama-era guidance say that having the federal government voice its priorities in this area is an important step in keeping students safe. Indeed, harsh school discipline can have far-reaching effects on a student\u2019s life. Students who face suspensions are more likely to drop out of school or eventually enter the criminal justice system. Advocates say the guidance is designed to help stymie this cycle. But critics say the pressure to reduce reliance on suspensions has meant keeping disruptive or dangerous students in the classroom, thereby posing a threat to other students and staff members. One critic of the guidance, a mother who met with DeVos on Wednesday, previously told HuffPost she has watched her children\u2019s school district become more relaxed in discipline. \u201cWhatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,\u201d said Nicole Landers of Baltimore County when asked about her general feelings on the guidance. \u201cIt takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.\u201d However, the GAO report shows that national suspension rates had already begun to fall before the guidance was implemented. The Education Department has said there is no specific timeline for when a decision will be made on whether to keep the guidance. The department did not respond to a request for comment on the guidance.",

      "content": " Black students and students with disabilities routinely receive harsher punishments at school than their peers. But the Education Department is considering eliminating civil rights guidance designed to stymie these disparities \u2015 even as data released Tuesday illustrates the scope of the problem. The data comes from responses to a survey sent to all of the nation\u2019s public school districts as part of the Education Department\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection, reflecting information from the 2015-2016 school year. The survey is conducted every other school year, and is intended to paint a picture of the different opportunities afforded to different groups of students. This year,\u00a0as in years past, the numbers show wide gaps in terms of how vulnerable students are treated when compared to their white peers. The Obama administration often cited numbers from this survey when designing civil rights guidance intended to reduce racial disparities. But the Trump administration has put pieces of Obama-era guidance on the chopping block. Specifically, under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Education Department has signaled it may scrap guidance that is supposed to reduce racial bias in school punishments. Indeed, even more than in years past, the latest figures show that a growing number of black students are disproportionately subject to school-based arrests and referrals to police. This issue is particularly relevant amid new federal efforts to increase the number of police officers in schools after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. Black students are also disproportionately suspended and expelled. At the same time, the data shows that high schools dominated by black and Latino students have less access to high-level STEM coursework, compared to all high schools. Students with disabilities are likewise subject to high rates of suspension and expulsion, and are also more likely to be restrained and secluded in school. While students with disabilities make up just 12 percent of students enrolled at public schools, they make up 28 percent of those subject to school-based arrests. For the first time, the 2015-2016 survey asked about school-related shootings and homicides. Only 0.2 percent of schools reported having at least one incident related to a school shooting, and even fewer reported a school-related homicide. The latest data reflects patterns recently found in a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, which noted stark disparities in terms of how black students are disciplined compared to their white peers. In response to the release of the survey results, DeVos said in a statement that \u201cprotecting all students\u2019 civil rights is at the core of the Department\u2019s mission.\u201d However, critics will likely see the new numbers as evidence that DeVos\u2019 agenda is specifically harmful to students of color and students with disabilities.\u00a0Earlier this month, DeVos met with critics and proponents of the Obama-era guidance that is designed to reduce racial bias in school discipline. Critics of the guidance say it has had a compromising effect on school discipline overall. Proponents say it is a necessary protection for vulnerable student communities who are already disproportionately punished. It is not clear when the Education Department will make a decision on whether to keep this guidance.",

      "content": " This story has been updated with video from Monday\u2019s meeting and new information about what took place there. At a roundtable with the nation\u2019s top educators on Monday afternoon,\u00a0at least one teacher told Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that her favored policies are having a negative effect on public schools,\u00a0HuffPost has learned.\u00a0HuffPost has also obtained video of DeVos expressing disapproval of the teachers strikes currently roiling Arizona. DeVos met privately with more than 50 teachers who had been named 2018 teachers of the year in their states. As part of the discussion, teachers were asked to describe some of the obstacles they face at their jobs and were given the opportunity to ask the education secretary questions. Jon Hazell, Oklahoma\u2019s teacher of the year, told DeVos that school choice policies are draining traditional public schools of resources in his state. He specifically referenced charter schools and private schools in voucher programs, Hazell told HuffPost. His comment received support from other teachers in the room. But Hazell, a Republican who voted for President Donald Trump, said he found DeVos\u2019 responses to his concerns unsatisfactory. DeVos told Hazell that students might be choosing these schools to get out of low-performing public schools, he said. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re the one creating the \u2018bad\u2019 schools by taking all the kids that can afford to get out and leaving the kids who can\u2019t behind,\u2019\u201d Hazell said he told DeVos in response. (Hazell said he was not referring to DeVos specifically as creating the \u201cbad\u201d schools but to school choice policies generally.) The centerpiece of DeVos\u2019 education agenda involves expanding school choice policies. Before entering the White House, she spent years advocating for these programs and pouring money into the cause. Brian McDaniel, California\u2019s teacher of the year, confirmed Hazell\u2019s version of events. He described the two as nearly engaging in a \u201cverbal sparring session\u201d and said DeVos\u2019 staffers looked eager to take Hazell\u2019s mic away, although they never did. Tara Bordeaux, Texas\u2019 teacher of the year, said Hazell\u2019s line of questioning hit on the concerns of \u201ca lot of educators right now.\u201d At one point during the event, DeVos talked about how traditional public schools and charter schools should be thought of as parts of the same public school system, a comment that irked educators in the room because the two types of school are managed differently and subject to different rules and regulations. Charter schools are publicly funded but often privately operated.\u00a0Melissa Romano, Montana\u2019s teacher of the year, and McDaniel said they believed DeVos was including voucher programs in that statement. Voucher programs provide children with publicly funded scholarships to private schools. \u201cThat was a shocker to all the teachers in the room,\u201d Hazell, a science teacher of 35 years, told HuffPost. Overall, both Hazell and McDaniel said, DeVos was a friendly, attentive listener who was respectful of the teachers\u2019 opinions. They said teachers also remained respectful in their critiques. However, both said they left the meeting immensely disappointed. McDaniel, a music teacher, initially had high hopes for the meeting. After he pressed DeVos for more support for music education, she expressed support for the subject and said she would look into providing more backing for the arts. \u201cIf I would have left the room right then and there, that would have been probably the greatest moment of my life as an educator,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThings slowly started to erode, though.\u201d DeVos also expressed opposition to teachers going on strike for more education funding, per video of the meeting obtained by HuffPost. DeVos made her comments after Josh Meibos, Arizona\u2019s teacher of the year, asked her about when striking teachers will be listened to. In response, DeVos told Meibos that she \u201ccannot comment specifically to the Arizona situation,\u201d but that she hopes \u201cadults would take their disagreements and solve them not at the expense of kids and their opportunity to go to school and learn.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful there will be a prompt resolution there,\u201d DeVos can be heard saying in the video. \u201cI hope that we can collectively stay focused on doing what\u2019s right for individual students and supporting parents in that decision-making process as well. And there are many parents that want to have a say in how and where their kids pursue their education, too.\u201d She continued, \u201cI just hope we\u2019re going to be able to take a step back and look at what\u2019s ultimately right for the kids in the long term.\u201d DeVos has an\u00a0intensely fraught relationship\u00a0with teachers unions, and her family has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of working against organized labor. Meibos had protested last Friday with other Arizona teachers,\u00a0many of whom are on strike over issues related to education funding and teacher salaries. The idea of his fellow teachers protesting while he was meeting with the U.S. secretary of education weighed on him. \u201cIt was disappointing not to hear language about supporting teachers,\u201d Meibos said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go in that direction.\u201d Other teachers in the room found DeVos\u2019 response similarly disappointing. \u201cShe basically said that teachers should be teaching and we should be able to solve our problems not at the expense of children,\u201d Romano said. \u201cFor her to say at the \u2018expense of children\u2019 was a very profound moment and one I\u2019ll remember forever, because that is so far from what is happening.\u201d DeVos took questions for about 30 minutes. Not all teachers had the opportunity to have questions answered. Representatives from the Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment. The White House is slated to hold a formal reception for the states\u2019 teachers of the year on Wednesday. \u201cI think a lot of us were grateful about having the opportunity to speak with the secretary and be in the presence of the Department of Education,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cHowever, I left with more questions than answers.\u201d",

      "content": " After a contentious meeting with Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on Monday,\u00a0several of the nation\u2019s top teachers had the opportunity to meet with President Trump on Wednesday and delivered messages about the importance of empathy and kindness. Jonathan Juravich, Ohio\u2019s teacher of the year and one of the four finalists for national teacher of the year, said he told Trump during their short encounter,\u00a0\u201cI want you to know what I teach my students is about respect and empathy, and that\u2019s how we as adults need to model those behaviors for our students,\u201d Trump told Juravich that he liked the message. The 2018 state teachers of the year spent the day at the White House, attending events like a discussion with DeVos and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. Trump made brief remarks honoring the educators at a ceremony and briefly posed for photos with each of the finalists. The national teacher of the year, Mandy Manning, also spoke for a short while. On a call with reporters,\u00a0the four finalists described the day as a remarkable experience, saying officials treated them with the utmost respect. Other state teachers of the year echoed this sentiment separately with HuffPost but said they were disappointed that they were not given the opportunity to take pictures with the president,\u00a0as honorees were in previous years. Manning,\u00a0from Washington state, works primarily with refugee and immigrant high school students. During her brief meeting with the president, she provided him with 45 letters from her pupils. In one letter, a Rwandan student described experiencing more hostility from those born in the United States in the last couple of years and her hope that he will model positive messaging about immigrant and refugee communities. Manning said the student \u201chopes [Trump] will consider his words have a lot of weight and they signal to people how they can and should act. She hopes he would take care with his words.\u201d Surveys have shown that since his election,\u00a0schools have become more hostile environments for students of color and religious minorities. Trump handed the letters to an aide, with the instruction to to put them on his desk because \u201che wanted to make sure to read the letters,\u201d Manning said. Attendees said it went better than the polarizing roundtable with DeVos on Monday, when she faced questions from state teachers of the year about school choice, striking teachers and standardized tests, as first reported by HuffPost. Her responses disappointed many of the honorees. She sparred with Jon Hazell, Oklahoma\u2019s teacher of the year, who confronted her over the effects of school choice in his state. Increasing school choice is the centerpiece of DeVos\u2019 agenda. At the roundtable,\u00a0she expressed displeasure with teachers who were on strike this week in Arizona, saying that she hopes\u00a0\u201cadults would take their disagreements and solve them not at the expense of kids and their opportunity to go to school and learn.\u201d Her response frustrated teachers in the room. \u201cShe basically said that teachers should be teaching and we should be able to solve our problems not at the expense of children,\u201d said Melissa Romano, Montana\u2019s teacher of the year. \u201cFor her to say \u2018at the expense of [kids]\u2019 was a very profound moment and one I\u2019ll remember forever, because that is so far from what is happening.\u201d ",

I urge this body to do its job and address and clarify where there is confusion around this.\u201d DeVos was responding to a question from Rep.\u00a0Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) about whether she thinks school leaders should call ICE on students or their parents. Advocacy groups immediately protested her answer,\u00a0pointing out that under the Supreme Court case Plyler v.

Elizabeth Hill,\u00a0press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, provided HuffPost with a clarification of DeVos\u2019 remarks on Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cHer position is that schools must comply with Plyler and all other applicable and relevant law,\u201d said Hill. During the hearing, DeVos did note that the 1982 Supreme Court decision requires public schools to educate all students, including those who are undocumented. Still, she repeatedly said it was a school\u2019s decision if it wanted to call ICE on kids and their parents. MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement saying that DeVos should resign for \u201cabject incompetence\u201d if she does not \u201cissue an immediate clarification that emphasizes the holding in Plyler.\u201d The organization also said it \u201cstands ready to hold accountable through legal challenge anyone in public education who attempts to report a student to ICE.\u201d DeVos\u2019 comments could have a chilling impact on undocumented students attending schools, said Andrea Senteno, legislative staff attorney for MALDEF, on Wednesday. Indeed, around the country, schools have seen\u00a0substantial drops in attendance\u00a0after ICE raids at local businesses. \u201cWe are very concerned her statement yesterday leaves open to interpretation what the law actually is for schools and administrators and those in the community,\u201d Senteno said. \u201cThere are going to be students and family members who are not going to know what that means.\u201d The Education Department needs to make publicly clear \u201cwhat the current law is and what students\u2019 rights are,\u201d said Senteno. The American Civil Liberties Union also blasted DeVos\u2019 comments at the hearing. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong,\u201d said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns for the ACLU, in a statement.

Eighth-grader Torin Hodgman wore a transgender pride flag as a cape during DeVos\u2019 Tuesday appearance at the Grand Rapids Public Museum School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The 14-year-old Hodgman, who identifies as genderqueer and prefers the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201ctheir,\u201d\u00a0can be seen walking alongside DeVos in the above MLive video.\u00a0DeVos interacted with students, who presented a series of science and environmental projects. She did not appear to acknowledge Hodgman\u2019s ensemble. Hodgman said they had planned to ask DeVos about school safety for LGBTQ youths during a morning roundtable.\u00a0While they didn\u2019t get a chance to do that, Hodgman hopes she recognized the flag. \u201cPublic schools are a place for all children,\u201d\u00a0Hodgman told MLive. The student\u2019s concerns are certainly justified. About a month into President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure, the Department of Justice and Department of Education\u00a0rescinded Obama-era guidance\u00a0that schools should allow trans students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other school facilities that align with their gender identity.

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who sparked a firestorm last week when she said it was a\u00a0school\u2019s choice to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement to report potentially undocumented students, changed her tune Tuesday, telling a Senate subcommittee she doesn\u2019t think schools can call ICE on undocumented students. DeVos\u2019 reversal came during a tense exchange with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who demanded that DeVos give a yes or no answer to whether the law allows this. DeVos first told Murphy that the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe \u201csays students that are not documented have the right to an education.\u201d When pressed for clarification, DeVos said she thinks \u201ca school is a sacrosanct place for students to be able to learn, and they should be protected there.\u201d Murphy accused DeVos of ducking the question. \u201cI think educators know in their hearts that they need to ensure that students have a safe place to learn,\u201d DeVos responded. Finally, after multiple rounds of prodding and Murphy\u2019s question,\u00a0\u201cSo they can\u2019t call ICE?\u201d DeVos responded:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think they can.\u201d Democratic members of Congress and civil rights groups have been demanding that DeVos correct her original comments since she made them. A week ago, in an exchange with Rep.\u00a0Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) while testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee, DeVos said she thinks it\u2019s \u201ca school decision, it\u2019s a local community decision\u201d whether school leaders should call ICE on undocumented students or families. The Education Department subsequently said DeVos believes that schools should follow the principles established by Plyler v. Doe, which requires public schools to educate all students. Many critics of the education secretary, however, demanded a more public correction.\u00a0By Monday,\u00a0over 100 members of Congress had signed a letter reiterating the need for a \u201cswift, decisive, and widely disseminated correction.\u201d Espaillat said Tuesday, after DeVos\u2019 appearance before the Senate subcommitee, that he doesn\u2019t believe her new statement goes far enough. \u2033I would like to see from her a more definitive answer, as opposed to \u2018I think,\u2019\u201d Espaillat told HuffPost. \u201cI think is in the right direction, but it\u2019s not a definitive answer.\u201d Espaillat said he is \u201cperplexed\u201d that DeVos hasn\u2019t clarified the issue. \u201cThis only lends itself to people feeling afraid or skeptical about things and it doesn\u2019t help matters,\u201d said Espaillat. \u201dWe would like to have a definitive answer, and it should be more along the lines of, this is what the law says, therefore they cannot do it.\u201d ",

Instead, DeVos said the commission will study \u201cschool safety and how we can ensure our students are safe at school.\u201d Leahy asked DeVos if she thinks an 18-year-old should be able to buy AR-15-style guns and ammunition. \u201cI believe that\u2019s very much a matter for debate, and I know that\u2019s been debated within this body and will continue to be,\u201d DeVos replied. \u201cOur focus is on raising up successful proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe for students to attend.\u201d The White House charged DeVos with leading a federal commission on school safety after a shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February left 17 dead. In a March press release, the White House said the commission will study and make recommendations on issues including \u201cage restrictions for certain firearm purchases.\u201d HuffPost reached out to the Education Department to see if the commission still plans to make recommendations in this area, given DeVos\u2019 comments Tuesday. In response, department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill clarified that the commission will still be making such recommendations. \u201cIt is one of the 27 items to be addressed by the report,\u201d Hill said in an email. She also noted \u201cthat the commission cannot create or amend current gun laws \u2014 that is the Congress\u2019 job.\u201d While speaking with Leahy, DeVos also said the commission will not look at countries where teens spend similar amounts of time playing video games or on social media but that do not have the same high rates of gun violence in schools as the U.S. Leahy ended the exchange by noting that the commission \u201cwill look at gun violence in schools but not look at guns \u2015 an interesting concept.\u201d DeVos has been holding listening sessions and events for her commission in recent weeks.

      "subtitle": "Betsy DeVos is considering rescinding guidance intended to protect students from this type of discrimination.",
      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " The Department of Education received more than 200 civil rights complaints last year involving students who say they were victims of racist school discipline, HuffPost has learned \u2015 a noteworthy figure as U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos considers revising or rescinding Obama-era guidance meant to protect students from racist punishments as part of the Federal School Safety Commission. Research shows that students of color are often disciplined more harshly than their white counterparts, sometimes for the same behavior. Black students only make up about 16 percent of all public school students, but account for about 40 percent of those who receive school suspensions, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. They are significantly more likely than white students to be expelled, arrested at school or referred to outside law enforcement personnel. The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights investigates complaints from students and families who have experienced such discrimination under Title VI, the federal law that protects against discrimination based on race, color or national origin.\u00a0In fiscal year 2017, the Department of Education received 216 complaints on this issue, according to data from the department provided to HuffPost. This is a small decline\u00a0\u2015 around 20 percent \u2015 from 2016, when the department received 265 complaints, but higher than 2015, when the department received 208 complaints. Several education experts told HuffPost that the dip in discipline complaints is likely a result of a natural ebb and flow,\u00a0devoid of meaningful implications. Others speculated that the Trump administration has had a silencing effect on people who might otherwise have filed a complaint. \u201cI think the context is the major reason,\u201d said Dan Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA. \u201cYou might see that degree of fluctuation, but given the context I would think it probably does have to do with the chilling effect.\u201d Monique Dixon, deputy director of policy and senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said she was not surprised by \u201cthe steady flow of complaints.\u201d \u201cThe Department\u2019s own data show that racial disparities in school discipline persist, and students, parents and education advocates have relied on OCR to fulfill its legal obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination,\u201d Dixon said. On the other hand, in 2017, the Education Department saw an increase in complaints regarding racial harassment in schools, as first reported by HuffPost. Civil rights advocates who support the Obama-era guidance fear that if it is rescinded, they will lose a key tool in helping fight racist school punishments. The guidance, which was released in 2014, calls on school leaders to be more cognizant of racial disparities in discipline, and warns that school districts could be running afoul of the law if certain groups of students are intentionally or unintentionally discriminated against. It also calls on schools to move away from exclusionary discipline practices like suspensions and expulsions in favor of emphasizing restorative practices and conflict resolution. DeVos is specifically tasked with considering the future of such guidance as part of the Federal School Safety Commission, which was formed in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead. However, DeVos has been meeting with proponents and critics of the Obama-era guidance for months, since before the commission was formed. Critics of the guidance say that student misbehavior is now more likely to go unaddressed, making classrooms less safe for conscientious students. Districts were not given the tools to implement restorative practices as an alternative to suspensions, critics say. \u201cWhatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,\u201d Nicole Landers, a parent from Baltimore who previously met with DeVos to express her opposition to the guidance, told HuffPost in April. \u201cIt takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.\u201d Are you a student who has filed a civil rights complaint?

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " A Department of Education affinity group for LGBTQ employees and allies met with Secretary Betsy DeVos last year and implored her to consider the effects the Trump administration\u2019s actions could have on transgender students, HuffPost has learned. The meeting took place in February 2017, the day the White House rescinded Obama-era guidance outlining protections for trans students. DeVos defended the decision in the meeting, calling the Obama guidance \u201cclumsy\u201d and \u201cnot done right,\u201d according to an employee\u2019s draft notes from the meeting obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. One of DeVos\u2019 deputies also said the secretary had personally fought for language in the rescission letter assuring that the Department of Education would continue to protect all students. In response, multiple employees expressed disappointment and told DeVos they disagreed with the move. One employee told her that in school districts where trans students are severely bullied, it could lead to life-or-death situations. Another took offense to DeVos referring to the Obama guidance as clumsy; he said he had helped write it. The employees recommended that DeVos watch Barry Jenkins\u2019 2016 film \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which explores themes of sexual identity and race. In turn, the secretary recommended the movie \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d The Obama-era guidance, issued by the Department of Justice and Department of Education, called on school districts to allow trans students to use the restrooms and facilities that correspond with their gender identity. The 2016 guidance ran into legal trouble almost immediately after it was issued, though, with 11 states suing the Obama administration in response. Since then, multiple high-profile courts have concurred with the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of the protections with which schools are required to provide trans students. During the meeting, which was put together by DeVos and her staff at the last minute, she announced that the guidance would be rescinded before it had yet been made public \u2015 a gesture for which the employees thanked her. DeVos told the group that rescinding the guidance was a \u201cdifficult decision,\u201d made after many conversations with the Department of Justice. In response, employees told DeVos that while they may disagree with the decision, they \u201cstand ready to do whatever we can to ensure that rescission is as minimally harmful to students as possible, as they need a safe place to go to school.\u201d The secretary also requested that the group provide her with stories from trans students, families and educators, and examples of model districts and policies. Spokespeople from the Department of Education did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for confirmation of this version of events. Other pieces of correspondence between Department of Education employees and obtained by HuffPost through FOIA reveal some confusion among the department\u2019s lawyers in the days leading up to the rescission. Employees tried to decipher when a rescission might be be announced through news reports while they worked to provide the Department with legal justification for the move. One employee, the day before the guidance was axed, wrote that no one at the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights had been consulted about the potential rescission to his knowledge. After the Department of Justice issued a letter announcing the move to the Supreme Court, Department of Education employees speculated that the document was a \u201crush job\u201d that had not been \u201creviewed by career civil servants\u201d who would have caught an inaccuracy. Reports surfaced at the time that the guidance had been dropped at the request of Attorney General Jeff Sessions but over the objections of DeVos. Since then, though, DeVos has publicly supported the move. In her meeting with employees, DeVos said she thought this issue should be left to districts, rather than to the federal government. Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for DeVos, said that the secretary actively sought out the group for input and advice. \u201cShe appreciated their perspectives and used several of their suggestions,\u201d Hill told HuffPost. \u201cSecretary DeVos regularly seeks input from those impacted by policy decisions, including people who may not agree on the policy end. She believes that open and constructive dialogue leads to better outcomes.\u201d In the months since the rescission of the guidance, the OCR has begun dismissing civil rights complaints filed by trans students who were not allowed access to the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity, as first reported by HuffPost. This story has been updated with Hill\u2019s comments. Are you a transgender student attending public school in America?

      "author": "Jenavieve Hatch",
      "content": " Candice Jackson\u2019s appointment to a top job in the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights was supposed to be a good sign for the students the office is supposed to protect. Some critics had warned that Jackson, a Stanford graduate, lawyer and activist who had authored a controversial book on the women who accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault, lacked experience in civil rights enforcement. How could someone without that experience run an office charged with protecting students against discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or ability? But Jackson is also a sexual assault survivor who is married to a woman. So when Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of education,\u00a0chose her to run the Office of Civil Rights in an acting capacity last April,\u00a0the decision sparked some hope. \u201cThis appointment should give folks on the left some comfort,\u201d Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education think tank, told The New York Times. \u201cThe idea that this administration is going to be anti-L.G.B.T., anti-women \u2014 I think we need to watch and see what happens.\u201d To the Clinton accusers whose stories Jackson had told in her book,\u00a0her new gig made perfect sense. In Jackson, they had found an advocate when very few others were willing to sign on for the role. \u201cI just love that girl,\u201d said Juanita Broaddrick, who says that Bill Clinton raped her in a hotel room in Little Rock when he was running for governor of Arkansas in 1972. Jackson \u201chas been a [rape] victim also,\u201d Broaddrick noted. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a victim, you know what to ask and what subjects to stay away from and how to make somebody comfortable. Candice did that immediately. I\u2019ve never had anything but a good opinion of her and her work and what she does.\u201d But Jackson\u2019s 14 months at the helm of the civil rights office left many sexual assault survivors reeling. Soon after she arrived in Washington, Jackson found herself in the midst of a national scandal. In July 2017, the Times reported on DeVos\u2019 growing focus on those accused of sexual assault rather than the accusers \u2014 whom the Obama administration had worked hard to protect. \u201cThe accusations \u2014 90 percent of them \u2014 fall into the category of \u2018we were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. The public\u2019s response to Jackson\u2019s comments was swift and furious: Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called for her resignation, as did Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who said that her comments were \u201cunworthy of her role at the Department of Ed.\u201d Jackson apologized. But she kept her powerful post at OCR, which she ran while Ken Marcus, Trump\u2019s pick for the top job, awaited Senate confirmation. Under her leadership \u2014 and DeVos\u2019 \u2014 OCR all but abandoned trans students. A once active and enthusiastic staff was significantly cut, with remaining staff members working in a culture of ambivalence toward the very civil rights issues that inspired them to join the office in the first place. And in May, her office began a new investigation focused on whether Yale University discriminates \u2014 against men. It\u2019s laudable that the Trump administration chose to put a lesbian sexual assault survivor in charge of monitoring the rights of vulnerable groups on America\u2019s campuses, said Eliza Byard, executive director of LGBTQ-advocacy group GLSEN. Unfortunately for the rape victims and the LGBTQ people whose civil rights she\u2019s charged with protecting, Jackson is the perfect representative of a certain class of Trump supporters: a person who has benefited hugely from greater protections for women and minorities but has spent her life fighting to undermine those protections for others. \u201cIdentity,\u201d Byard said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t substitute for your actions.\u201d *** Jackson got into professional politics early. In 1995, as a 17-year-old community college student at the public Los Angeles Valley College, she accepted an internship in the office of Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.). She took the job seriously. \u201cShe doorbelled for me at one point,\u201d Smith recalled. \u201cShe was always her own person. She was very strong, very unique, had her own ideas. I did not take it for granted.\u201d Smith, a write-in candidate and staunch social conservative, had been a favorite of Jackson\u2019s parents. Richard \u201cRicky Lee\u201d Jackson, Jackson\u2019s father, is a doctor, country musician, conservative blogger and failed congressional candidate. Her mother, Jeanine, works as a counselor and helps run the family medical practice. After interning for Smith, Jackson transferred to Stanford University, where she spent much of the next two years at the Stanford Review, the conservative campus newspaper co-founded by Peter Thiel, who later co-founded PayPal. She fell in with a crowd that also included future PayPal vice president Eric Jackson, climate change denier Alec Rawls, Bay Area venture capitalist Ken Howery and tech entrepreneur Jeff Giesea. On New Year\u2019s Day 1997, when she was a junior in college, Jackson married Brent Mayhugh, a Clark County, Washington, cop. In the pages of the Review, she railed against affirmative action, feminism and multiculturalism. \u201cThe real \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 are personal freedom, economic independence, and the proper role of government in our lives,\u201d she wrote in an April 1998 op-ed on the activities of the Women\u2019s Community Center, a campus organization founded in the 1970s for women to discuss their experiences in the male-dominated arena of academics. Stanford offered a multitude of tutoring programs year-round for all students. But Jackson devoted an entire column to complaining that she had been rejected from a summer program that was created and funded specifically for minority students, as well as Stanford University\u2019s minority-focused SEMAP (Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Achievement Program) course because she was white. In her senior farewell to the Review, she wrote that she was even more convinced of her beliefs than when she had arrived two years prior. \u201cI would like to see the balance shifted,\u201d she wrote, \u201cso that conservatism dominates and liberalism is the minority.\u201d *** Jackson spent the summer after she graduated as an editorial assistant at the Ludwig von Mises Institute for Austrian Economics in Alabama, where she nurtured a deep admiration for Murray Rothbard, the anarcho-capitalist scholar who founded the think tank. (Rothbard once called the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the law Jackson has been tasked with upholding in her position at the OCR, \u201cmonstrous.\u201d) Jackson was a staunch proponent of gay marriage even before she came out as gay, recalled William Anderson, a professor of economics at Frostburg State University in Maryland who met Jackson at Mises. He recalled that around that time, Jackson met her now-wife, Patty Campbell. \u201cHer point was that if the state is the arbiter of what\u2019s fair and what is not... it shouldn\u2019t be involved at all in denying marriage to gays. Mayhugh and Jackson divorced in 2000, and she married Campbell shortly thereafter. After Mises, Jackson headed to Pepperdine University\u2019s law school in Los Angeles on a full academic scholarship, then she worked for Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, until 2004. In 2005, her Stanford buddy Eric Jackson published her book, Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine. Much of the book serves as a manifesto against liberal politics \u2014 Jackson argues that Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged abuses of power are not just indicative of misogyny or liberalism alone, but also \u201cliberal misogyny,\u201d a combination of the two. She argued that liberal politics \u2014 including government involvement and intervention \u2015 is an abuse of \u201cforce\u201d akin to rape. But Their Lives also reflects hours of interviews with Clinton\u2019s alleged victims, and a real effort to take them seriously. \u201cI just feel grateful that she thought we were worthy enough to write about,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cShe came to my home and spent a couple of days here. Just to see how my life was. And it was like a girlfriend day, even though I\u2019m old enough to be her grandmother. She even went with me to my grandson\u2019s grade school to pick him up. And got involved in my everyday life. It was just fun. I hated to see her go.\u201d Jackson\u2019s compassion, Broaddrick said, stemmed from Jackson\u2019s own assault, which she discusses in Their Lives\u00a0in some detail. Jackson writes that she was raped by someone she had been friends with since childhood and that she, like many other survivors, initially struggled to use the word \u201crape.\u201d She wrote bravely about the struggles of self-blame, guilt and worthlessness that plague rape victims. \u201cThe trite phrase \u2018Whatever doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u2019 truly means something when it comes to experiencing rape, because for a while you feel as if a part of you has died, and recovering means finding a new, stronger life and identity,\u201d she wrote. But politics seems to circumscribe Jackson\u2019s compassion: She approached Clinton\u2019s victims with an earnestness that she does not offer for the women and girls who say they were victimized by her current boss. Trump\u2019s victims weren\u2019t real, she said in 2016, according to ProPublica. They were \u201cfake.\u201d In her book, Jackson claims that she supports \u201cgender, racial and sexual orientation equality in all aspects of life.\u201d But in the next breath, she says she opposes \u201ctrying to accomplish any of that through the power of political force.\u201d It\u2019s an odd philosophy for a person whose access to a law degree, a powerful government job, a marriage to the person she loves and the ability to legally raise children with her were only possible as the result of successful political movements. And as her underlings in the Trump administration would find, it\u2019s an especially odd philosophy for someone charged with using the power of the government to protect civil rights. *** Jackson became a likely Trump appointee on the second Sunday of October 2016. The Washington Post had released footage showing the Republican presidential nominee bragging about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d and his second debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was just 48 hours away. Trump needed to change the story, quick. Trump confidant, campaign hand and ratfucker\u00a0Roger Stone had a solution. Stone had pushed Trump for months to highlight the allegations of sexual violence and harassment by Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband, according to New York Magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman. Earlier that year, Stone had reached out to Jackson to plot how to bring his accusers\u2019 stories into the campaign. In the moment of crisis, Trump embraced Stone\u2019s suggestion. Jackson helped the campaign orchestrate a surprise news conference just before the debate. Trump sat at the center of two long tables pushed together, in front of an American flag and surrounded by Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers and Kathy Shelton, a Jackson client who was raped by a man Hillary Clinton represented as a lawyer in Arkansas in 1975. The news conference was a smashing success. Although polls indicated that Hillary Clinton won the presidential debate, the pre-debate circus garnered more than 3 million views on Facebook and was covered extensively by media outlets across the political spectrum. Less than a month later, Trump won the election, and Jackson\u2019s star rose. In the weeks following, she appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News\u00a0show with Shelton to accuse Hillary Clinton of hypocrisy for claiming to be a champion for women. She had delivered a similarly intense performance for Dinesh D\u2019Souza, the conservative political commentator and a longtime friend, in a video published on his YouTube channel a few weeks prior. Soon after Trump\u2019s election, Jackson submitted an application for a job with his administration. She had a lot of help. \u201cI have excellent recommendations from notable conservatives like David Horowitz, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, and Sean Hannity, each of whom tells me they have specifically reached out to Kellyanne Conway or Steve Bannon to recommend me,\u201d she wrote in an email to Trump transition team officials that was later obtained by BuzzFeed News. Jackson also cited a recommendation from Thiel, perhaps Trump\u2019s most prominent LGBTQ supporter. The Trump transition team moved quickly. Five weeks after Jackson emailed, a transition official emailed a DeVos aide with good news. \u201cCandice Jackson has been pre-approved for hiring!\u201d the official wrote. \u201cWould the Secretary like to call her and offer the position?\u201d *** Jackson\u2019s predecessors at the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, Russlynn Ali and Catherine Lhamon, entered the job with decades of experience in civil rights advocacy and were committed to expanding the rights of survivors of sexual assault on campus. In 2011, Ali announced in what\u2019s known as a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d memo that the office would launch its most aggressive effort yet to address and investigate campus sexual violence. \u201cThe sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students\u2019 right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe statistics on sexual violence are both deeply troubling and a call to action for the nation.\u201d The letter effectively required that schools and universities up the ante on how they responded to accusations of sexual violence. As per the letter, schools and universities were obligated to investigate all accusations of sexual violence regardless of whether or not there was a concurrent criminal investigation,\u00a0protect the accuser from repeated contact with the alleged perpetrator (for example, move a student to different campus housing during the investigation), and offer guidance to students who wished to make a Title IX complaint. But Jackson didn\u2019t have the experience of Ali or Lhamon \u2014 or their commitment to expanding protections for the people her office is supposed to serve.\u00a0In June 2017, shortly after her appointment, a group of LGBTQ activists met with Jackson about how she would protect trans students. Jackson was \u201csuper friendly\u201d and \u201cvery nice\u201d but didn\u2019t seem to understand the power of the role she\u2019d been given, said Nathan Smith, the director of public policy for GLSEN, one of the groups that attended the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big role that oversees a really important civil rights agency. And I\u2019m not sure I feel like she had the qualifications for leading that office effectively.\u201d Harper Jean Tobin, the director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality, was alarmed by Jackson\u2019s appointment. But she was particularly disturbed after the OCR closed a case and withdrew findings that a trans girl had been discriminated against at a school in Sparta, Ohio \u2014 proving that advocates had been right to worry that Jackson would roll back protections for transgender students. \u201cClearly this happened under [Jackson\u2019s] leadership,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI can\u2019t say how much this was driven by the Justice Department, which is clearly on a mission to do everything it can to undermine the civil rights of LGBTQ people, or how much it was driven in the department.\u201d Activists were not comforted by the fact that Jackson is a part of the LGBTQ community. Just as Jackson was eager to taper off responding to sexual violence complaints despite her own experience surviving it, she was equally as eager to do the same for LGBTQ complaints. Jackson didn\u2019t need experience to succeed at OCR, her friend Eric Jackson said. \u201cThat she hasn\u2019t been a lifelong bureaucrat is true,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we encourage citizens to serve the public?... They\u2019ve got a mess to clean up.\u201d Part of that \u201cmess\u201d included Ali\u2019s 19-page \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. Last September, Jackson sent her own \u201cDear Colleague\u201d memo, announcing that Ali\u2019s letter had been withdrawn. \u201cThe [document] may have been well-intentioned,\u201d Jackson wrote about Ali\u2019s memo, but it has \u201cled to the deprivation of rights for many students \u2014 both accused students denied fair process and victims denied an adequate resolution of their complaints.\u201d Since the publication of Jackson\u2019s letter, OCR has deemphasized campus sexual violence as a priority and focused instead of gender discrimination \u2014 against men. In April, the office began investigating Yale University after Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, a graduate student at the University of Southern California who has no affiliation with Yale, filed a complaint about the university\u2019s seven women-only campus organizations. Under Jackson\u2019s leadership, the OCR has also abandoned trans students\u2019 complaints, as HuffPost reported in April. Jackson\u2019s focus on the rights of people accused of sexual assault, rather than their alleged victims, shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, according to her Mises Institute colleague and friend William Anderson. \u201cThose accusations have a lifelong effect for the accused,\u201d Anderson said in an interview. \u201cAnd the Obama administration wanted a process that would be stacked for the accuser.\u201d It\u2019s true the Obama administration sought to shift the balance. But the process was already stacked \u2014 for rapists. False rape accusations are vanishingly rare. Most rapes aren\u2019t even reported. Reported rapes are rarely prosecuted. And people prosecuted for rape are rarely convicted. The Obama administration hoped that political force could change that status quo. But Jackson doesn\u2019t believe in that kind of change. *** I had a lot of questions for Candice Jackson, so I spent parts of the last year trying to make contact with her. I left her several voicemails, all of which went unanswered. I sent her several emails with the same result. I spent two days in Washington waiting in the smoking section outside the Department of Education, where I\u2019d heard she took her smoke breaks. I had a short email exchange with her wife, who declined to comment for the piece. I spoke to Jackson\u2019s friends, former supervisors and professors, but never to Jackson herself. As I interviewed Jackson\u2019s contemporaries, I was often reminded that, despite the many calls for her to be fired from her position in the OCR, her views aren\u2019t unusual. Ken Marcus, Trump\u2019s nominee to run OCR, was finally confirmed to the position earlier this month. Jackson remains at the office, for now, as his second-in-command. Her background was supposed to make her uniquely qualified for the job. But there\u2019s no evidence Marcus, a straight white man, will run the office any differently than she did. During his confirmation hearing, he was asked whether there was any decision the office made under Trump that he disagreed with. He didn\u2019t identify any. For many people who supported Trump \u2014 including 53 percent of white women voters \u2014 dismissing his accusers was as easy and convenient as believing Bill Clinton\u2019s. Conservatism, as Jackson had hoped, now dominates. Republicans control all three branches of government and most states. The president is a confessed sexual assaulter. And the idea that got Jackson in so much trouble last year \u2014 that sexual assault survivors don\u2019t know the difference between rape and sex they regret \u2014 remains widespread. When I called Jackson\u2019s friend William Anderson, for example, he echoed her comments to the Times, telling me that young women who wake up hung over and regretting the sex they had the night prior \u201care not survivors.\u201d A \u201creal\u201d survivor, he told me, is someone like his ex-wife, who was raped at knifepoint in college. I\u2019ve had the kind of sex that Anderson speaks of. I\u2019ve woken up and looked at the person lying next to me while I pieced together how they ended up in my bed or how I ended up in theirs. Sometimes I\u2019ve regretted it, and sometimes I haven\u2019t. But I\u2019ve had another kind of experience. I\u2019ve sat in a bar alone, hungry and hiccuping, while a bartender poured me more whiskey. The same bartender would invite himself into the bathroom with me for what I thought was a harmless make-out. And then the door closed and locked and he did things that bad men do when no one else is there. We know the difference. We feel it the next morning when we wake up and our entire waking lives feel unlivable. \u201cFor a while,\u201d as Jackson once said, \u201cyou feel as if a part of you has died.\u201d But my story, like so many other women\u2019s stories, doesn\u2019t serve any political end for Jackson. The man responsible isn\u2019t a powerful Democrat. He\u2019s just a bartender, and I\u2019m just a journalist. I know that identity isn\u2019t a substitute for actions. Being a survivor doesn\u2019t necessarily make you more likely to believe other survivors. And since I never got a chance to speak to Jackson, I can\u2019t help but be left wondering: Would she believe my story? And, if she did, what would she do about it?

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " Before becoming U.S. secretary of education \u2015 a position dedicated to enforcing and crafting national education laws \u2015\u00a0Betsy DeVos spent decades in Michigan, carefully influencing education policy through millions of dollars in donations to politicians and philanthropy. Now that DeVos has left her home state to join President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in Washington, politicians back home are working to undermine her previous efforts. All three Democrats running for Michigan governor have specific plans to reverse her footprint on the state\u2019s schools. Abdul El Sayed, who announced his education plan on Wednesday, has the most direct, comprehensive and radical rebuke of DeVos. His plan, titled \u201cDe-DeVos Public Education\u201d calls for new efforts to stifle DeVos\u2019 pet causes, like school choice, and reverse the impact of school segregation. \u201cBetsy DeVos has destroyed Michigan\u2019s education system. She\u2019s trying to destroy the federal education system, and we\u2019re going to have to show the country and the world how we de-DeVos an education system,\u201d El-Sayed, former Detroit health director, told HuffPost over the phone. The other two Democratic candidates for governor on the ballot \u2015 former state Senate Democratic leader Gretchen Whitmer and businessman\u00a0Shri Thanedar \u2015also say they intend to reverse DeVos-influenced policies as part of their education proposals. Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary is Aug. 7.\u00a0Four Republicans are vying to replace outgoing Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in the November election. DeVos, a billionaire married to the former Amway CEO, helped vastly expand charter schools over the years \u2015 both for-profit and nonprofit ones. Decades after DeVos began pushing the expansion of her favored policies, Michigan students post poor rankings on nationally representative tests. For Michigan politicians, the rebuke of DeVos appears to make sense. Polls rank DeVos as the Trump administration\u2019s least-popular\u00a0Cabinet secretary. Her nomination to lead the Education Department sparked outrage from families and teachers around the country. Progressive national education groups have benefited financially from opposition to DeVos, seeing spikes in donations after her confirmation. Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidates seem to be making the same bet. The education plans of El-Sayed and Thanedar call for banning for-profit charter schools. Whitmer\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go quite as far, but proposes an end to the expansion of these schools. All three Democratic candidates emphasize the need for greater accountability for nonprofit charter schools \u2015 with Sayed calling for an independent, statewide charter-authorizing council that would increase scrutiny and transparency. Thanedar said he\u2019s not opposed to charter schools and school choice, but opposes charter schools with a \u201cprofit motivation.\u201d Beyond DeVos, the candidates are proposing universal preschool and pay raises for educators. Thanedar specifically calls out DeVos\u2019 treatment of college sexual assault victims. El-Sayed wants to end early childhood suspensions. Whitmer emphasizes her time in the Michigan legislature, where she actively worked against the DeVos agenda. The three candidates promote their commitment to college affordability, with El-Sayed proposing four years of debt-free college for families below a certain income. The candidates\u2019 plans represent a stark departure from where Michigan education has been headed under Republican leadership. Charter school advocacy groups insist that policies favored by DeVos remain popular.\u00a0A 2017 survey from the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, found that most Michigan families who participate in educational choice are satisfied with their schools. On a nationwide scale, school choice groups insist that enthusiasm for charter schools are still going strong, despite DeVos\u2019 low popularity. But Thanedar said that some people in Michigan consider DeVos an \u201cenemy of public education\u201d and believe \u201cthe unregulated expansion of charter schools is one of the reasons for our failing schools.\u201d Even DeVos acknowledged that Michigan schools need to raise their performance during a March interview with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say overall that they have all gotten better,\u201d DeVos told journalist Lesley Stahl of the state\u2019s schools. \u201cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it.\u201d Said said El-Sayed:\u00a0\u201cBetsy DeVos is the single biggest obstacle to improving education in this country and certainly improving education in the state of Michigan. The sooner we root out the approach she has embedded into a GOP-dominated legislature, the better off our kids are.\u201d",

      "content": " A\u00a0$40 million yacht owned by the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u00a0was set adrift by vandals at a dock in Ohio last weekend, causing thousands of dollars worth of damage to the vessel, according to the Toledo Blade. The SeaQuest\u2019s captain said his crew awoke Sunday to find the boat had been untied from its mooring at the Huron Boat Basin and was floating away, according to a police report obtained by HuffPost. The crew was\u00a0\u201cable to gain control of the ship, but not before it struck the dock with its Starboard forward section,\u201d the police report stated.\u00a0Damage to the yacht consisted of \u201cseveral large scratches and scrapes,\u201d which the captain estimated would cost between $5,000 and $10,000 to repair, according to the police report. Huron City Police Chief Robert Lippert confirmed to HuffPost that the yacht belonged to the DeVos family. He said DeVos had not been aboard at the time,\u00a0but could not confirm whether other family members had been. Representatives for DeVos and her family did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Lippert would not speculate on a potential motive, citing the ongoing investigation. Police had not yet obtained surveillance video of the incident, but were following up on a few potential leads,\u00a0Lippert said. \u201cHad there been different wind or more wind, [the yacht] could have certainly floated a lot further than it did,\u201d Lippert told HuffPost. The 163-foot yacht is one of 10 boats owned by the DeVos family, the Blade reported. Betsy DeVos is one of the Trump administration\u2019s wealthiest officials, with an estimated net worth of around $1 billion, according to Forbes. Her father founded Prince Corporation, a successful automotive business, and her father-in-law co-founded Amway marketing company. DeVos visited Toledo, Ohio, earlier this month to tour the Correctional Treatment Facility and Penta Career Center, according to her public schedule. Her role as secretary of education has been intensely criticized by public school advocates and LGBTQ activists, who condemn her efforts to strengthen \u201cschool choice\u201d initiatives, as well as her decision to rollback LGBTQ student protections imposed under the Obama administration. This article has been updated with additional details about DeVos.",

      "content": " If something newsworthy happens, but it doesn\u2019t involve Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump or Russia, does it still make a sound? You bet. Lately, though, those sounds have been muffled, buried under a pile of incriminating recordings of Trump authorizing\u00a0\u201chush money\u201d payments for women with whom he allegedly had relationships. While we were all distracted by the latest shiny Cohen disclosure \u2015 a claim that Trump knew in advance of his son\u2019s June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2015 here are five other stories you might have missed: The Trump administration patted itself on the back for a job well done Thursday, ahead of a court-ordered midnight deadline to reunify more than 2,000 children with their parents after having forcibly separated them at the U.S.-Mexico border. But while officials congratulated themselves for reuniting 1,400 eligible families, more than 700 children aren\u2019t considered \u201celigible,\u201d and are therefore still in government custody. These children have parents who have been deported or released, who failed a background check or who otherwise haven\u2019t been located. Of the 460 who have been deported, \u201cthere is a very high likelihood that those parents are not going to see their children again,\u201d former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John Sandweg told CBS Thursday. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be proud of the work they\u2019re doing on reunification,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt told reporters Thursday. \u201cThis is a disaster that they created.\u201d Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos wants to scrap Obama-era regulations on for-profit colleges that require them to prove they provide \u201cgainful employment\u201d for their graduates. The Obama rule, which was never fully implemented, would have forced for-profit schools to publish data about their students\u2019\u00a0post-graduation employment rates. Programs whose graduates fare poorly in the job market and that have a high degree of student loan debt could see their federal aid slashed \u2015 potentially forcing them to close. At its peak, the for-profit college industry received up to $32 billion a year via student grants and loans, paid by taxpayers. Critics maintain these schools lured in prospective students with the promise of high-paying jobs upon graduation, but the careers they were promised rarely arrived. Instead, students graduated saddled with debt. Under DeVos\u2019 proposal, instead of schools having to prove their value, the burden would fall on students to prove their schools showed \u201creckless disregard\u201d in any application for debt forgiveness, according to The Hill. In an unsubstantiated tweet this week, Trump claimed Russia will be \u201cpushing very hard for the Democrats\u201d in the 2018 midterm elections: But early evidence points to Russian President Vladimir Putin once again engaging in information warfare to benefit the GOP, as Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) confirmed this week that Russia\u2019s GRU intelligence agency unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate her Senate computer network in August 2017. McCaskill is facing re-election this year in a state that swung heavily for Trump in 2016. Her status as a vulnerable Democrat may have attracted Russia\u2019s interest. \u201cThe Russians saw 2016 as a success, and they\u2019ll be back in 2018, unless we do far more to protect ourselves than we\u2019re currently doing,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chief Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told\u00a0The Associated Press. \u201cUnfortunately, the lack of leadership from the White House means that we still have no all-of-government approach to addressing this threat.\u201d Blazes in both Northern and Southern California\u00a0have forced thousands of residents from their homes. At least one firefighter has died and three have been injured\u00a0fighting the Carr Fire in Northern California\u2019s Shasta County. As of Friday afternoon, the 44,450-acre fire had destroyed 65 structures and damaged 55, with an additional 4,978 threatened. \u201cWhen it hit, people were really scrambling,\u201d Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said. \u201cThere was not much of a warning.\u201d McLean described the inferno as \u201ca wall of flames\u201d that\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctaking down everything in its path.\u201d A second blaze, burning in central California\u2019s Mariposa County and labeled the \u201cFerguson Fire,\u201d has grown to 45,911 acres and forced closures in Yosemite National Park. Seven firefighters have been injured fighting in \u201cvery rough terrain,\u201d according to a government incident report. One firefighter has been killed. And to the south, the 11,500-acre Cranston Fire continues to burn about 90 miles east of Los Angeles,\u00a0where it\u2019s forced at least 3,200 people to evacuate and is threatening 2,100 homes. Authorities arrested 32-year-old Brandon McGlover of Temecula, California, on Wednesday. They believe he started the fire intentionally.\u00a0McGlover pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday. South of the border, horrific state-sponsored violence in Nicaragua shows no signs of abating. In a rare interview granted to Fox News, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he doesn\u2019t intend to step down or hold early elections, despite widespread protests calling for him to leave his post. Ortega has been in power since 2007. In 2014, he pushed through \u201creforms\u201d that ended term limits and permitted him to run for a third term in office.\u00a0He won, and his wife,\u00a0Rosario Murillo, was elected vice president. At least 300 civilians have died and 2,000 have been injured in the violence since April \u2015 violence meted out by paramilitary groups \u201coperating with the active or tacit support of and in coordination with the police and other state authorities,\u201d according to the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for human rights.",

      "author": "Jennifer Bendery",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 It was early 2017, and Alyse Galvin was on a mission: Bring down Betsy DeVos\u2019 nomination for education secretary. Galvin, a 52-year-old education advocate in Anchorage, Alaska, was horrified by DeVos\u2019 lack of experience. So she spearheaded a campaign to pressure the state\u2019s two senators to vote no. She and other educators launched a \u201cBetsy DeVos Tie-Breaker Telethon\u201d on Facebook Live, urging Alaskans to call in and share their thoughts on DeVos. They were flooded with negative feedback and displayed their results. DeVos was ultimately confirmed. But she barely got through, and it was partly due to Galvin\u2019s efforts. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was one of two GOP senators to vote no, which forced Vice President Mike Pence to come in to break a tie vote. Murkowski said she made her decision after an outpouring of disapproval from Alaskans. Now Galvin is in a different kind of campaign: The mother of four is running for Congress and taking on Rep. Don Young (R), who has held this House seat for 44 years \u2015 making him the longest-serving member. The 85-year-old lawmaker, known for his charismatic and straight-up offensive persona, is an Alaska fixture. Where to even begin with unseating someone like Young? Galvin, who is running as an independent and is a front-runner to take on Young in November, said in a recent interview that she has plenty of advantages. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m there,\u201d she said with a smile, casually burning Young for his apparent absence in parts of the state. \u201cSo many communities are like, you know, I can\u2019t remember the last time we\u2019ve seen him.\u201d (Young spokesman Jerry Hood called it \u201cdisingenuous\u201d to suggest Young is not visiting rural communities and said he travels the state extensively.) To reach some of those far-flung towns, Galvin has been driving around the state in a 20-year-old RV holding \u201croving town halls,\u201d setting up shop in parking lots and inviting locals into the RV for cookies, hot chocolate and conversation. Most talks center on jobs and health care, she said, which reflects the grim reality that Alaska has the highest unemployment and highest health care costs in the nation. Back in Anchorage, Galvin is running a well-organized grassroots campaign fueled by more than 600 volunteers. Her donations are all from individuals, except for one from the state\u2019s largest teachers union, NEA-Alaska. Notably, she\u2019s been out-raising Young all year.\u00a0In the fundraising quarter that ended on June 30, Galvin raised\u00a0$246,000 to Young\u2019s $177,000 \u2015 more than any candidate in the race. In the quarter before that, Galvin raised\u00a0$284,000 to Young\u2019s $103,000. But Young has more cash on hand than Galvin by\u00a0about $200,000. Galvin\u2019s inspired some creative fundraising, too. One woman offered to hold a garage sale for her, with the request that Galvin come by in her RV. (Is she going? \u201cYou bet I am!\u201d she said.) An artist invited people to make Alaskan-themed plates and gave the proceeds to Galvin\u2019s campaign. A band of drummers held a concert for her, too. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fun!\u201d she said, beaming with energy. \u201cLet\u2019s make Alaskans better appreciate the good in good government. It\u2019s a fun opportunity for us. The people power is everything.\u201d Galvin has got a good shot at winning the Democratic primary on Aug. 21, though she\u2019s not a Democrat. She\u2019s a pro-gun independent who supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. But she is otherwise socially progressive \u2015 she is pro-LGBTQ rights and pro-abortion rights, for example \u2015 and because of Alaska\u2019s unique campaign rules, she can run as an independent on the Democratic ballot. That means if Galvin wins the primary against her main challenger, Democrat Dimitri Shein, she will be the Democratic nominee as an independent. But if Galvin makes it to that point, that\u2019s where things get hairy. Never mind Young\u2019s staying power; his House seat is rated solidly Republican\u00a0by The Cook Political Report. Young defeated his 2016 Democratic challenger by\u00a0more than 14 points. \u201cMost people assume Young will win,\u201d said Dr. Amy Lovecraft, a political science professor at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. \u201cIt\u2019s his race to lose.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fun notion that an up-and-coming, bright and motivated woman could take his seat, but I consider it a very, very long shot,\u201d said Stephen Haycox, an Alaska historian. \u201cYoung\u2019s arrogance and old guy antics play well in Alaska.\u201d Still,\u00a0it\u2019s hard to simply write off Galvin\u2019s campaign in the context of what\u2019s happening at the national level.\u00a0Democrats are expected to sweep in November, and first-time female candidates are popping up in races all over the country \u2015 and often winning \u2015 as part of a backlash to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Galvin\u2019s independent status could also resonate since, incredibly,\u00a0more than 50 percent of registered Alaska voters\u00a0are \u201cundeclared\u201d or \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d She also simply represents change. The past few years have been brutal for Alaska budget matters, particularly in education, a topic that Galvin can own.\u00a0The Me Too movement has also\u00a0hit Alaska, and Galvin could certainly put a fresh spotlight on women\u2019s issues. She\u2019s already touting her all-female congressional campaign team on her Facebook page with the caption \u201cWorking women run Alaska and they run this campaign.\u201d \u201cHer biggest strength is that she would demonstrate a pushback on Young,\u201d said Lovecraft. \u201cI would love to see their match-up. If she\u2019s got good advisers, she could really paint him into some corners. She could cast Don Young as an old fogey while she\u2019s ready to take us into the future.\u201d Hood tamped down on the significance of Galvin raising more money than Young, noting that Young\u2019s 2016 Democratic challenger, Steve Lindbeck, had raised more than Galvin by this point in that race and still lost by a lot. \u201cHaving said that, we take all challengers seriously,\u201d Hood said. \u201cCongressman Young will campaign for re-election aggressively, regardless of who his opponent may be.\u201d Ultimately, Galvin thinks her energy and willingness to meet people \u201cwhere they are\u201d is why she\u2019s had Republican, Democratic and independent voters tell her they\u2019ll support her campaign. She said people tell her all the time that they just appreciate that she can relate to their struggles. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that those who are leading are connected to what people are experiencing,\u201d Galvin said. \u201cWe really are all just independent weirdos.\u201d",

      "content": "(Reuters) \u2015 U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will issue new rules to colleges and universities for addressing sexual harassment or assault cases, lessening their liability for incidents that happen off-campus, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The new policies would also strengthen the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape and seek to provide more support for victims, the Times reported. Department of Education spokeswoman Liz Hill declined to discuss the proposed recommendations with Reuters. \u201cWe are in the midst of a deliberative process. Any information the New York Times claims to have is premature and speculative, and therefore we have no comment,\u201d Hill said. The report was published on the same day that officials said a former University of Southern California (USC) gynecologist, George Tyndall, accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of students, had agreed to a suspension of his medical license. The Education Department is investigating how USC handled that case after the university acknowledged failing to properly act on at least eight complaints lodged against Tyndall between 2000 and 2014. Last year, the administration of Republican President Donald Trump reversed guidelines established under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on how colleges should handle sexual assault accusations, saying the prior policies led to too many students being falsely charged or disciplined. The prior rules outlined a strict set of steps for schools to follow or risk losing funding under Title IX, the federal law that bars sex discrimination in education. According to the New York Times, the rules being prepared by DeVos\u2019 office would preserve much of Title IX but would also for the first time legally define sexual harassment on campuses and how schools were expected to address formal complaints. The proposals would hold colleges and universities responsible only for incidents on campus or in their programs and call for impartiality in investigating allegations and using the presumption that the accused student or staff member is innocent until proven guilty, the newspaper reported. \u201cThe proposed campus sexual misconduct policies from Betsy DeVos and her Department of Education are just the latest example of the Trump administration turning its back on women and victims of sexual assault,\u201d the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. \u201cThese proposed rules are a blatant and disturbing attack on every student who has experienced or could experience sexual assault or misconduct on a college campus, and they exemplify the misplaced priorities of DeVos and the Trump administration,\u201d the DNC said.

      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u00a0is expected to propose a controversial set of sexual misconduct rules for schools across the country \u2015 and survivors\u2019 advocates are not happy. DeVos is preparing new Title IX policies that would \u201cbolster the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape, reduce liability for institutions of higher education and encourage schools to provide more support for victims,\u201d according to an explosive\u00a0New York Times report\u00a0published Wednesday. The potential new regulations for Title IX (the federal civil rights law created to ensure gender equality in education) include several changes that have advocates up in arms, including narrowing the definition of sexual misconduct and allowing assailants to cross-examine their accusers during the mediation process. Title IX regulations apply to all levels of schooling, but advocates are focusing on universities due to the epidemic of sexual violence that takes place on campuses. \u201cWhat is reflected in the Times article is a tacit endorsement of campuses where it is safer to commit sexual assault than to be a survivor,\u201d Jess Davidson, executive director of the survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, told HuffPost. Almost all of the known proposed regulations would put survivors at risk, but one stands out as particularly alarming. The potential new Title IX guidelines would only hold universities accountable for sexual misconduct that is \u201csaid to have occurred on their campuses,\u201d according to the Times. Title IX advocates and sexual assault survivors agree that this regulation could potentially be disastrous: A whopping 87 percent of college students live off campus. Additionally, many social events take place off campus at bars, Greek life houses, apartment complexes and sports teams\u2019 houses. \u201cThis is really just saying that \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter that you were assaulted three minutes off campus. You still have to share a classroom with your rapist. And you don\u2019t have any rights,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Sage Carson, manager of the anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, told HuffPost. \u201cTitle IX is not meant to be focused on where the assault occurred but how that violence is impacting someone\u2019s education. And the impact of that doesn\u2019t change depending on where you were assaulted,\u201d Carson continued. \u201cThis was a really clear message that DeVos just doesn\u2019t understand the point of Title IX at all.\u201d Although Title IX is best known as a broad tool to combat gender discrimination in education, it also provides\u00a0important protections\u00a0for survivors of sexual assault,\u00a0including\u00a0the right to an investigation and the ability to change class schedules so as not to interact with an assailant. Davidson, who has previously blogged for HuffPost, said she was \u201cabsolutely outraged\u201d by the off-campus provision. \u201cWhether or not your assault happened in a campus facility or an off-campus facility \u2015\u00a0students deserve just as much access to their Title IX rights as any other student,\u201d she said. Sejal Singh, policy coordinator for Know Your IX, brought up the sexual abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor accused of sexually abusing hundreds of athletes. \u201cWould it make sense for Larry Nassar not to be held accountable if he only abused student athletes at off-campus events?\u201d\u00a0Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d Not only would this proposed rule ignore the rampant sexual violence that often takes place at fraternity and athletes\u2019 houses, it would likely further isolate marginalized students who commute to campus. \u201cWhen you look at community colleges and commuter colleges \u2015 this guideline would prevent marginalized students from having their claims considered,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s already more difficult to report sexual assault if you are a student from a variety of historically underserved backgrounds.\u201d As a Title IX coordinator and sexual assault survivor herself, Taylor Parker knows just how dangerous the off-campus provision could be. \u201cA lot of assaults happen at off-campus parties,\u201d Parker told HuffPost. \u201cIf off-campus misconduct creates a hostile learning environment on campus, then this provision completely misses the point of what a civil rights law is attempting to accomplish.\u201d \u201cI feel like my government has basically abandoned me,\u201d she added. Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told The New York Times that the department is \u201cin the midst of a deliberative process,\u201d saying the proposed regulations obtained by the paper are \u201cpremature and speculative.\u201d DeVos, however, has been on a mission to overhaul the Obama-era Title IX guidelines and regulations since she was confirmed\u00a0last year. In 2017, DeVos met with people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes (a group consisting mainly of so-called men\u2019s rights activists) and, not long after, rescinded an Obama-era Title IX guideline called \u201cThe Dear Colleague Letter.\u201d Title IX advocates and survivors told HuffPost they\u2019re prepared to fight, and other supporters should be too. \u201cThis policy actually can be stopped,\u201d Davidson said. The Department of Education will likely release a final proposed Title IX regulation in the next few days or weeks. Legally, the department is required to consider all comments from the public before making a decision. \u201cEveryone has the opportunity to stop this from happening, but we absolutely have to participate and comment,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually one of the best opportunities we\u2019ve ever had to stop something created by the Trump administration in its tracks.\u201d Need help?

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0on Wednesday was on the losing end of a lawsuit accusing the Department of Education of illegally delaying regulations set by the Obama administration to protect student loan borrowers from predatory colleges. Attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit against DeVos after her department began rolling back the so-called borrower defense rules, which were set to take effect on July 1, 2017. U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss ruled in favor of the attorneys general, calling DeVos\u2019 attempts to delay the Obama-era rule from its start date \u201cunlawful,\u201d \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and \u201cprocedurally invalid,\u201d\u00a0according to the opinion. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey celebrated the judge\u2019s ruling, saying in a tweet that the federal court \u201cagreed that the actions of the [Education Department] are not only wrong, they are illegal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for the #BorrowerDefenseRule to go into effect and give thousands of students the relief they\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d she added.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) congratulated Healey on the win. \u201cThis is a crushing defeat for [DeVos], and a huge win for students who have been scammed by [for-profit] colleges,\u201d Warren tweeted. The Obama administration overhauled borrower defense rules after receiving an \u201cunprecedented influx\u201d of fraud claims from Corinthian Colleges. The for-profit education chain, which ran Heald College, Everest College and WyoTech, shut down in 2016 amid allegations of deceptive marketing and lying about grades and attendance records. Other for-profit colleges, including ITT Tech, shuttered after facing similar fraud accusations. The Obama-era regulations to protect students from the college\u2019s predatory actions were finalized in October 2016. DeVos delayed the effective date, citing a federal lawsuit filed by a trade association challenging the new rules. In a press release\u00a0at the time, DeVos called the Obama-era rules a \u201cmuddled process that\u2019s unfair to students and schools.\u201d Moss has scheduled a hearing for Friday to address remedies for the situation.",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " A coalition of advocacy and teacher groups sued the U.S. Department of Education on Wednesday morning for information related to its decision to allow schools to purchase firearms using federal funds. The American Federation of Teachers, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence say the Education Department is violating federal law by not releasing records related to the decision in a timely manner. In August and September, the groups filed two Freedom of Information Act requests for more information on the decision. The requests, filed on behalf of the groups by Democracy Forward, were designed to glean information on issues such as whether the Education Department was influenced by the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups. A request also sought information on which school districts were interested in arming teachers using federal funds. The government is required to determine whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 days. But according to the lawsuit, also filed by Democracy Forward, the government has fallen short of its statutory obligation. The plaintiffs are requesting expedited processing of their information request, which the government previously denied. \u201cThe information sought by Plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA requests, which will shed light on whether lobbyists associated with the firearms industry or gun-lobby groups including the National Rifle Association were involved in the Department\u2019s decision and reveal communications between the Department and states or local school districts and within the Department concerning the use of these funds to arm teachers, is plainly of great public importance,\u201d says the lawsuit. Controversy over the issue started in August, when\u00a0The New York Times first reported that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was weighing whether to allow states and districts to use federal grant money under the Every Student Succeeds Act to arm school staffers, after representatives from Texas asked if it was permissible. The grant money is intended to provide academic support and improve conditions for student learning. But in late August, DeVos said she would not restrict how these grant funds are spent, writing that she had \u201cno intention of taking any action concerning the purchase of firearms or firearms training for school staff.\u201d\u00a0The law, as she interpreted it, gives schools substantial flexibility in this area. Critics said her move undermines the intent of the act, since Congress has expressly prohibited schools from using federal funds on firearms in separate laws. The groups filing the FOIA lawsuit also say that using federal funds in this manner is unlawful. \u201cShe wants to turn the U.S. government into an arms dealer for schools. That\u2019s insane,\u201d\u00a0said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten\u00a0in August about DeVos. Weingarten, in a press release Wednesday, also said she has heard from gun-owning teachers around the country who are concerned about the safety effects of bringing more guns into a school setting. \u201cIt\u2019s time Betsy DeVos starts standing up for kids and teachers, not the NRA,\u201d said Weingarten.",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " A new filing in a lawsuit against the Trump administration accuses Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and a top deputy of being motivated in part by sexism in their policy decisions. The lawsuit, originally filed in January, challenged DeVos\u2019 elimination of Obama-era Title IX guidance on how sexual assault cases are handled on campus. But an amended complaint submitted Wednesday says that DeVos\u2019 decision was influenced by discriminatory and stereotyped views of women. DeVos scrapped the Title IX guidance in September 2017, issuing her own interim guidance on the subject. Her version\u00a0raised the standard of evidence used in campus sexual assault cases. At the time, DeVos said that the Obama administration\u2019s directive was an example of federal overreach. But plaintiffs in the filing say DeVos and her deputies had more nefarious motivations, and they use new Freedom of Information Act records as evidence. The records indicate that Department of Education leaders had solicited input from groups and academics who push inflated and widely discredited statistics regarding the prevalence of false rape allegations. A National Sexual Violence Resource Center study found that false reports account for only about 2 percent to 10 percent of such allegations, a range that it said was likely inflated. \u201cWhat you see is that this administration is buying into the sex stereotype that women and girls lie about these types of things, and they\u2019re making policy based on that view,\u201d\u00a0Karianne Jones, counsel for Democracy Forward Foundation, told HuffPost. Democracy Forward is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with the National Women\u2019s Law Center, National Center for Youth Law and Equal Rights Advocates. According to the lawsuit, the records also show Candice Jackson, then acting head of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, recommended a book to her staff, Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus\u00a0by academic Laura Kipnis. The book describes Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as allowing women to seek legal recourse for \u201cawkward sexual experiences\u201d and then ask for protection from \u201csexual bogeymen,\u201d per the filing. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education wasn\u2019t able to comment on the specifics of pending litigation but pushed back on the lawsuit\u2019s assertions, noting that department leaders met with a wide range of stakeholders on the issue at the time. \u201cThis lawsuit is nothing more than a baseless, politically motivated attack on the Secretary,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said by email. \u201cShe and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue including survivors, falsely accused students, college presidents and university GCs and the message was very clear from all of them \u2014 we have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well. \u201cThe Secretary is committed to Title IX reforms that will ensure survivors feel empowered to come forward, all students are afforded due process and universities have clear rules to follow.\u201d The lawsuit says that, although the department solicited the views of those who were critical of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance, \u201cthe Department met with organizations that advocate for Title IX\u2019s protections for survivors only after repeated, collective requests from those organizations.\u201d The FOIA records also show that Jackson had consulted with figures such as professor Gordon Finley of Florida International University on the issue. Finley is a member of the National Coalition for Men, a men\u2019s rights organization, and has referred to Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as a \u201cwar on men.\u201d Records also show Jackson was in close contact with the group Families Advocating for Campus Equality, requesting they publish op-eds before a speech by DeVos, according to the lawsuit. The group was started by parents whose children had been accused of sexual assault on campus. DeVos previously publicly met with representatives of the National Coalition for Men and Families Advocating for Campus Equality. The plaintiffs in the case, which include groups like SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates and Victim Rights Law Center, say these documents, along with other statements and actions taken by DeVos and Jackson, show they had \u201cdiscriminatory motivation.\u201d An original lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs challenged the Trump administration\u2019s overall rescission of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance. An overall challenge to the rescission was dismissed, with the judge saying you cannot challenge a nonbinding piece of guidance. But the amended complaint takes a different approach,\u00a0instead focusing on the mindset of administration officials. At the time DeVos rescinded the guidance, she said the old process lacked due process.\u00a0A report from the Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Wednesday says that DeVos is gearing up to release new rules on the matter, which will require that accused students be allowed to cross-examine their accusers and will narrow the definition of sexual assault cases that schools must arbitrate. Advocates worry that such a process will make victims more reluctant to come forward. The lawsuit mentions President Donald Trump\u2019s previous comments and behavior toward women, accusing him of sexism. Jackson previously said that 90 percent of sexual assault accusations are a result of drunken regrets or misunderstandings, a remark noted in the amended complaint and original lawsuit. At the time of the original lawsuit, a lawyer for the federal government said this did not prove intentional sexism on Jackson\u2019s part. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story mischaracterized the guidance Betsy DeVos issued for campus sexual assault cases; her version raised, not lowered, the standard of evidence used.",

      "subtitle": "The Education Department just proposed guidelines to the civil rights law that would drastically change the way schools handle sexual misconduct.",
      "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
      "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released her long-awaited proposed Title IX guidelines Friday morning, and there\u2019s a lot to unpack. The\u00a0proposed regulations essentially provide more protections for the accused and make it harder for survivors of sexual violence to report harassment and assault by narrowing the definition of sexual misconduct. Additionally, the guidelines essentially prioritize schools above all by creating fewer sexual misconduct cases, which reduces costs (saving colleges anywhere from $286 to $368 million over 10 years, according to estimates included in the proposed guideline). \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s proposed rule is designed to let schools off the hook for sexual assault and harassment,\u201d\u00a0Sage Carson, manager of the anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, said in a Friday morning statement. \u201cThese proposals signal the Department of Education\u2019s decision to prioritize schools\u2019 bottom line over survivors\u2019 right to an education,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf these draft rules become law, more survivors will be forced out of school by harassment, assault, and their schools\u2019 indifference to their complaints.\u201d Title IX,\u00a0the federal civil rights law created to ensure gender equality in education, applies to all schools that receive federal funding, including nearly all colleges and universities,\u00a0all public K-12 schools and a few private K-12 schools that receive federal dollars. The regulations differ slightly for K-12 schools versus college and university campuses. The suggested guidelines are similar to a copy\u00a0partially leaked in August\u00a0which faced swift criticism from survivor advocacy groups for making it harder for victims to report harassment and assault. Below are the provisions that could have the largest impact on how sexual misconduct is handled in school settings across the country: Keeping with the leaked copy, Friday\u2019s suggested guidelines narrow the definition of sexual misconduct, defining it as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Jess Davidson, executive director of survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, described this portion of the regulations as \u201cone of the most harmful parts of the rule.\u201d \u201cThe definition is extreme and it\u2019s going to require that students are harassed multiple times before they are able to receive any form of accommodation,\u201d she told HuffPost. Under the proposed guideline, a school \u201cis only responsible for responding to conduct that occurs within its \u2018education program or activity.\u2019\u201d The Education Department loosely defines \u201ceducation program or activity\u201d as \u201call of the operations of\u201d a school including anything that has \u201cany academic, extracurricular, research, [or] occupational training.\u201d This definition, however, does not include off-campus housing or bars and other settings within a school environment where assault and misconduct often take place.\u00a0This is one of the most worrisome provisions of the entire 149-page proposal because\u00a087 percent of college students live off campus. Davidson noted that this provision could prove disastrous for marginalized students, specifically community college and commuter students who spend a majority of their time off-campus. Additionally, this would allow schools like Michigan State and Ohio State, both currently embroiled in sexual assault scandals, to sidestep misconduct perpetrated by staff at off-campus events. \u201cWould it make sense for Larry Nassar not to be held accountable if he only abused student athletes at off-campus events? It\u2019s absurd,\u201d\u00a0Sejal Singh, policy coordinator for Know Your IX, said to HuffPost in August. Under the proposed provisions, the accused can participate in a live cross-examination of the alleged victim through a third party (although this does not apply fully to K-12 incidents). Unlike the earlier leaked copy, Friday\u2019s proposed rule would not allow the accused to cross-examine their accuser personally. Additionally, the accuser is allowed to request that their alleged perpetrator watch the live cross-examination from a separate room which prohibits \u201cany unnecessary trauma that could arise from personal confrontation.\u201d This process, known as mediation, encourages schools to simply work it out themselves instead of following a regulated investigation protocol. \u201cBefore the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), schools pushed survivors to \u2018work it out\u2019 with their rapists, fostering a climate where students were afraid to come forward\u201d\u00a0anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX\u00a0said in a Friday statement.\u00a0\u201cThe Department\u2019s decision to revert back to a harmful status quo will allow for schools and rapists to intimidate survivors into silence.\u201d Additionally, the Education Department has not offered any guidelines on how this mediation process would potentially play out. The guidelines would restrict whom a victim can report to in order to implement corrective measures through the school. College students would only be able to report a Title IX issue with the school\u2019s Title IX coordinator which, Davidson said, is cause for concern. \u201cThe lived experience of most college students don\u2019t set them up to go first to the dean of students or to the Title IX administrator directly,\u201d she said. \u201cMost students want to talk to \u2015 as anybody does \u2015 students want to talk to a campus official or an adult who they trust, who will be on their side, who will affirm them, and will help them find safety and an answer.\u201d \u201cTo see this definition go forward \u2015 that would essentially give a free pass to OSU and Michigan State and Larry Nassar \u2015 is really horrifying,\u201d Davidson added. It\u2019s worth noting that mandatory reporting laws still apply, but for a student to receive help and protection from their school specifically, they would need to seek out a Title IX coordinator. This provision would not apply to students K-12. The proposed guidelines state a school can use \u201ceither the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard.\u201d Many survivor advocate groups, however, highlighted that using a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard would treat sexual misconduct survivors more harshly than victims of other discriminatory campus crimes. \u201cInstead of imposing discriminatory procedural hurdles for campus sexual harassment cases, schools should use the same standards that they use for other serious campus wrongdoing, such as physical assault or arson,\u201d Know Your IX noted. Many politicians and Title IX advocates were up in arms over the proposed guidelines.\u00a0Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) urged Congress to stand against the proposal, writing that it \u201cseems intended to make college campuses safe spaces to commit sexual assault and harassment instead of safe spaces to learn.\u201d In a Friday statement, Sen.\u00a0Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called on \u201cevery woman, man, mom, dad, and anyone else who cares about campus safety and preventing sexual assault to make your voices heard and demand that Secretary DeVos and President Trump withdraw this proposal immediately.\u201d Lara Kaufmann, Director of Public Policy for Girls Inc., pointed out how damaging this proposal could be for K-12 girls specifically. \u201cAll girls should be able to grow up safe, respected, and valued,\u201d she said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cUnfortunately, these new proposals will lead to fewer students reporting assaults and harassment, more dangerous K-12 schools, and more girls being denied their civil right to equal access to education.\u201d President of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten also condemned the proposed rules in a Friday statement. \u201cThis rule abdicates the responsibility to protect every student\u2019s right to safety on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells academic institutions that they needn\u2019t bother helping to protect students; they won\u2019t be liable. These changes once again demonstrate that students are not DeVos\u2019 priority.\u201d Since she was confirmed as Secretary of Education last year,\u00a0DeVos has been on a mission to overhaul the Obama-era Title IX guidelines and regulations. In 2017, DeVos met with people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes (a group consisting mainly of so-called men\u2019s rights activists) and, not long after, rescinded an Obama-era Title IX guideline,\u00a0The Dear Colleague Letter. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the secretary has talked a lot about the importance of a fair process but that\u2019s not what this reads like to me,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t somebody trying to create fairness in the process, this is somebody who is trying to prevent the process from taking place at all.\u201d Legally, the Education Department is required to consider all comments from the public\u00a0and publicly respond to criticism before making a decision.

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " The Trump administration recommended rescinding Obama-era guidance designed to reduce racist school punishments as part of a much-anticipated Federal Commission on School Safety Report released Tuesday. The report also recommends increasing the presence of armed personnel in schools \u2015 ranging from police officers to teachers \u2015\u00a0and urges states to adopt measures that allow extreme risk protection orders, which temporarily suspend an individual\u2019s access to guns if they pose a danger to themselves or others. The report was released after months of listening sessions and meetings between administration officials and stakeholders on the issue of school safety. It does not recommend new age restrictions for gun purchases, asserting that \u201cavailable research does not support the conclusion\u201d that such restrictions reduce homicide. \u201cWe cannot keep our children safe by only looking at one issue of this much larger problem,\u201d Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who led the commission, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. The Obama-era discipline guidance was speculated to be on the chopping block since before the administration formed its Federal Commission on School Safety in March. The Obama guidance, announced in 2014, is a non-binding set of recommendations for how to produce more equitable school punishments. But after the deadly Parkland, Florida, shooting in February, the guidance was wrapped into larger issues of school safety \u2015\u00a0especially after conservative stakeholders and legislators connected it to a restorative justice program that counted the Parkland shooter as a participant. Civil rights advocates have blasted attempts to connect the guidance to the deadly shooting, and argue the Obama directive is essential to protecting minority students. \u201cWe met with the administration to discuss the guidance, and we made it very clear we see it as an extension of Brown versus Board of Education,\u201d Todd Cox, Director of Policy at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in late November. \u201cAttacking that guidance is essentially attacking Brown and its legacy. It\u2019s another example of how this administration doesn\u2019t have students, particularly students of color, in its best interest.\u201d On a call with reporters, a senior administration official said that the guidance was preventing violent students in school from being punished.\u00a0It is now all but certain that the guidance will be rescinded. Instead, the report recommends \u201chardening\u201d schools by increasing the presence of police officers and arming school staff. Research shows that increased presence of police in schools leads to more student arrests, which disproportionately impact of students of color. In addition to DeVos, the commission included Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was involved as well before he was forced out of the administration in November. School leaders and civil rights advocates have already begun to blast the report. National Association of Secondary School Principals executive director JoAnn Bartoletti said in a statement that many of the recommendations focus on strategies that are already well-known. She criticized the report\u2019s avoidance of gun issues, calling the guidance to arm school personnel \u201cobtuse.\u201d But Bartoletti saved her harshest criticism of the commission for its recommendation to rescind the Obama guidance. \u201cThe Commission asserts without foundation that this non-binding guidance makes school less safe,\u201c Bartoletti said. \u201cThe conclusion is offensive, it\u2019s infuriating, it\u2019s nonsensical, and it will assuredly lead to the result the administration wanted all along.\u201d Black students and students with disabilities are disproportionately suspended in both rich and poor schools, the Government Accountability Office found in a\u00a0report released in April. The Obama guidance provided a set of proposals for how schools might remedy such disparities, and warned schools that they might be running afoul of federal discrimination law if certain groups of students are disproportionately punished, even unintentionally. The legal theory underpinning this idea \u2015 that even formally neutral policies may discriminate against certain groups of people \u2015 is called disparate impact, but the Trump administration report questions its legal basis. \u201cWhere well-meaning but flawed policies endanger student safety, they must be changed,\u201d the new report states. While the Obama guidance is non-prescriptive, it has long drawn the ire of conservative groups who say it is an example of federal overreach and has kept dangerous kids in the classroom at the expense of innocent children. In April, one parent told DeVos that her children have been tormented by school bullies, and she believed the Obama guidance helped keep them in the classroom. \u201cWhatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,\u201d Nicole Landers of Baltimore County, Maryland, told HuffPost at the time. \u201cIt takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.\u201d Civil rights groups, on the other hand, have fought fiercely to keep the guidance in place, viewing it as an important protection for students who are especially vulnerable. Regardless of whether the guidance stays in place, school districts may still be violating federal law if they are consistently disciplining certain groups of students more harshly than others. The report also focuses on improving mental health support in school and emphasizes the importance of social emotional learning. It includes recommendations for the media on its coverage of school shootings, urging journalists not to focus on the perpetrator. Senior administration officials said on Tuesday they believe the commission\u2019s report \u201ccan make a significant contribution to school safety.\u201d",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " The Department of Education and the Department of Justice officially rescinded a piece of Obama-era guidance designed to protect students from racist school discipline on Friday. The repeal comes after the Trump administration\u2019s Federal Commission on School Safety, chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, released a report earlier in the week recommending the withdrawal of this guidance. The move was immediately blasted by civil rights advocates and Democratic leaders, who say it represents a retreat from the protection of vulnerable student groups, who receive disproportionately harsh school punishments compared to their peers. In the Federal Commission on School Safety report, Trump officials framed the rescission as one that would give schools more local control over their disciplinary practices and keep students safe from violent or disruptive peers. But according to civil rights advocates, there is scant evidence that the guidance ever made schools less safe, and repealing the guidance will help perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline. The school-to-prison pipeline is the idea that students who get pushed out of schools, via suspensions or expulsions, are more likely to end up in the criminal justice system. The Obama guidance, put forth in 2014, was non-binding, and entailed a set of recommendations for state and local school leaders to help make school discipline practices more equitable. The guidance warned schools that they may be violating civil rights law if certain groups of students are consistently disciplined more harshly than others, even if a school\u2019s policies are not intentionally discriminatory. The guidance was reportedly on the chopping block even before the deadly Parkland school shooting in February. But after the shooting, leaders like Sen. Marco Rubio\u00a0(R-Fla.)\u00a0tried to connect it to the tragedy. The school shooter had attended a restorative justice initiative in his district, and Sen. Rubio argued that the program helped the student evade law enforcement. Civil rights groups have panned the argument, calling it tenuous and politically motivated. On Tuesday, as part of a larger school safety report that had recommendations on school security measures and mental health services, the administration signaled its intention to rescind the guidance. The report suggested that the guidance had a chilling impact on school discipline and specifically criticized the legal doctrine of disparate impact. Disparate impact is the idea that even neutral discipline policies can be illegal if they have the effect of disproportionately impacting one group of students. The rescission of the guidance has no formal impact on the law. Schools are still required to protect students from discrimination based on race, color and national origin. But education stakeholders still worry that it will send an important symbolic message to schools and students, leading to less vigorous enforcement of these issues at the federal level. Education Secretary DeVos championed the decision in a statement Friday. \u201cEvery student has the right to attend school free from discrimination. They also have the right to be respected as individuals and not treated as statistics. In too many instances, though, I\u2019ve heard from teachers and advocates that the previous administration\u2019s discipline guidance often led to school environments where discipline decisions were based on a student\u2019s race and where statistics became more important than the safety of students and teachers,\u201d said DeVos. Democratic leaders instead argued that the move will have a dangerous impact on the most vulnerable students. \u201cBy rescinding this guidance, Secretary DeVos and Acting Attorney General Whitaker are creating confusion for schools and making it harder for students of color to learn without being discriminated against,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in a statement.",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos loves to tell the story about a former teacher named \u201cJed.\u201d Here\u2019s how it goes. Jed, a once-passionate public school teacher, was told to \u201ckeep it down\u201d at school because his class was having too much fun learning. He left the profession, DeVos likes to suggest, because he didn\u2019t have enough autonomy to teach as he wished. If only there were fewer federal mandates and more flexibility, DeVos often says before pushing for more school choice. Politicians and public figures often trot out anecdotes about everyday people whose experiences illuminate a larger issue. But DeVos has referenced \u201cJed\u201d quite regularly. She has used the Jed anecdote in three speeches since 2017, in an interview with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and when testifying before Congress. She most recently spoke of him on Monday in a speech she gave to the\u00a0National School Boards Association. But who is Jed? The real-life Jed, HuffPost discovered, is actually mortified by the attention. \u201cI hate knowing she is using my words to further push her agenda, which is the antithesis of me,\u201d said Jed Dearybury, who was a finalist for South Carolina Teacher of the Year in 2014. \u201cHonestly, it makes me mad as hell. It makes me want to fight harder.\u201d Dearybury met with DeVos, along with nine other former teachers, in July of 2017. DeVos wanted to chat with educators who had recently left the classroom to learn more about their experiences and why they switched jobs. In truth, Dearybury, who spent over 13 years teaching at public elementary schools in South Carolina,\u00a0didn\u2019t leave the classroom over frustration with his district or state or federal mandates. He changed jobs so he could advocate for teachers on a larger scale, without fear of overstepping. He now works for the Palmetto State Teachers Association as the director of professional development and communications.\u00a0The organization \u201cis as close as you\u2019re going to get to a union in South Carolina,\u201d said Dearybury. After publication he told HuffPost in another interview that while South Carolina is legally prohibited from having unions, PSTA \u201cis a professional association that represents and unifies teachers across the state\u201d in the absence of one.\u00a0(Dearybury spoke to HuffPost in an individual capacity and not as a representative of his employer.) \u201cI love all these teachers striking across America. I wish every teacher in America would walk out on the same day,\u201d said Dearybury, who left the classroom around three years ago.\u00a0In the later interview with HuffPost, he clarified that \u201cwhile we don\u2019t want strikes, sometimes they do get people\u2019s attention.\u201d He had no idea his words were going to be used in public speeches and congressional testimony. He was under the impression it was a casual, off-the-record conversation. The anecdote he provided in the meeting, about being told to \u201ckeep it down,\u201d was told as an example of how even sometimes fellow teachers have overly rigid views of pedagogy. Indeed, it was another teacher \u2015 not a school administrator \u2015 who had reprimanded him. Two other meeting attendees have confirmed this version of events to HuffPost. Dearybury worries that leaders of his former district, which he loved, will hear one of DeVos\u2019 speeches and interpret it as him criticizing them. He is also concerned his words will be interpreted as an endorsement of DeVos\u2019 agenda. A spokesperson for DeVos did not respond to a request for comment. Secretary DeVos has referenced Jed when speaking before highly polarizing groups, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council. \u201cThe frustration they expressed, I think, is indicative of a system that for too long has tried to control everything from above and has not respected and honored the needs of the individual students,\u201d DeVos said of the teachers she met with, including Jed, when speaking before Congress in May. Meanwhile, Dearybury says he is concerned about the treatment of LGBTQ students under the Trump administration and the unequal distribution of funds between schools in rich and poor areas. \u201cI want equal opportunities for all students. In this administration, when they say equal opportunity, they think you mean you want rich kids to go to private school and get a tax credit,\u201d he said. This story has been updated to include additional comments from Dearybury about PSTA. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story misstated the title of the National School Boards Association as the American School Boards Association.",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos came to Washington in February 2017 with a mission \u2015 to increase school choice. On Thursday, Republican legislators like Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) took DeVos\u2019 dream one step closer to reality, unveiling a bill that could help families use public dollars to pay for private schools and other educational programs like apprenticeships, online learning and special education services. The bill, the Education Freedom Scholarship and Opportunity Act, would give individuals and businesses tax credits for donating to organizations that grant state scholarships. These organizations, in turn, would dole out scholarships to students. Standing beside Cruz and Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) at a press conference Thursday morning, DeVos hailed the effort as a \u201chistoric investment in America\u2019s students,\u201d framing the issue as one of \u201ceducation freedom\u201d rather than \u201cschool choice.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in education today is at the core of what makes America truly great: freedom,\u201d DeVos said. States will have the ability to opt into the program and shape how the scholarships are used, as well as determining which students are eligible. Cruz told The Daily Caller that his legislation would provide $10 billion in federal tax credits. (The Department of Education, on the other hand, is pushing $5 billion in tax credits.) Individuals could donate to a scholarship organization anywhere in the country under the program, even if their state doesn\u2019t create one. They would be able to donate up to 10 percent of their adjusted gross income, while businesses could give up to 5 percent of their net taxable income. The program would look similar to tax credit programs that already exist in 18 states \u2015 and that opponents say function as school voucher programs by another name. But DeVos and her allies are emphasizing that this bill wouldn\u2019t divert resources from public schools, and could help bolster them, if a state created a program that would allow scholarships to be used in that way.\u00a0In programs that already exist, tax credits are often used to send low-income children to private schools. But opponents say that when a student leaves a public school for a private one, the public school no longer receives per-pupil funding for that student, even as its fixed costs \u2015 like building infrastructure \u2015 remain the same. DeVos dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d the idea that the bill is an attack on public education. \u201cThe only folks who are threatened are the ones who have a vested financial interest in suppressing education freedom,\u201d she said. Private schools that participate in existing school choice programs \u2015 including vouchers \u2015 aren\u2019t subject to the same accountability or transparency rules as public schools, and a vast majority of them are religious.\u00a0Over 40 percent of the schools that participate in current programs are non-Catholic Christian schools. Of those schools, at least 30 percent use evangelical textbooks that promote creationism, and sometimes push regressive ideas about race and gender, according to a previous HuffPost investigation. At least 14 percent of religious schools that currently participate in private school choice programs openly discriminate against LGBTQ students, according to a HuffPost investigation. DeVos has previously unsuccessfully proposed injecting federal money into private school choice programs in the Department of Education budget. She has also faced grilling by lawmakers about whether she would allow federal dollars to go to schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students. But at Thursday\u2019s press conference, Cruz called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issue of the 21st century.\u201d He was flanked by students and families who have benefited from school choice around the country, including those with special needs. The legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress, and while it has received praise from pro-voucher education reform groups, public school advocacy groups are pushing back against it. \u201cIt reflects this administration\u2019s persistent disdain for public education,\u201d said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, in a statement. A statement from Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called the proposal \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d But DeVos and Cruz pointed out that President Donald Trump promoted school choice during his campaign, and that he was elected to enact such a program. They also emphasized that the legislation won\u2019t result in any federal mandates, with states designing their programs as they see fit. \u201cThe American people elected Donald Trump in part because he pledged to bring school choice to America\u2019s students,\u201d DeVos said.",

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 The Trump administration has proposed a study of whether the U.S. Marshals Service should take over security for Cabinet officials, following a series of scandals over how various Trump appointees have used their department security details. The administration is asking Congress for $1 million in funding to study whether it makes sense for the USMS to take over protection of civilian Cabinet- and sub-Cabinet-level officials across the government. Current security arrangements vary from department to department, which generally gives Cabinet members a lot of discretion over their own security details and creates potential for waste and abuse.\u00a0Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke took his security detail on a personal vacation to Europe in 2017, while former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt ordered his\u00a0costly security detail to run his personal errands like picking up moisturizing lotion. Last summer, the Trump administration unveiled a plan for the Marshals Service to take over the task on a broader scale, but as CNN reported\u00a0at the time, some officials within the service questioned whether it was a good idea to expand their mission beyond protecting judges, providing court security, securing witnesses and transporting prisoners. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 budget proposal, unveiled Monday, suggests the plan is still under consideration and moving forward. \u201cWhat it does is get the proposal on the table, to start looking at what it would take to have the Marshals provide that level of security to any Cabinet member that requires such protection as a result of a security study and a threat assessment,\u201d\u00a0Lee Lofthus, a longtime DOJ employee who serves as assistant attorney general for administration, told reporters during a budget briefing at the Justice Department on Monday. \u201cThey came to us and said, \u2018Look, we would like to take a look and see if a law enforcement organization that is used to doing this type of work \u2015 both threat assessments and the actual details \u2015 could provide this work government-wide where it\u2019s warranted,\u2019\u201d Lofthus said. \u201cThat may give the government some advantages in terms of doing this work better and at the appropriate cost.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want the Marshals to detract from their violent crime effort, so this would be a new function for the Marshals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is that they\u2019d have to get resources if they\u2019re going to take on this work in the future.\u201d NBC News reported last year that the U.S. Marshals, in an unusual arrangement, provided security for Education Secretary Betsy Devos at a cost of $5.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $6.8 million in fiscal 2018. The expected cost of DeVos\u2019 Marshals security for fiscal 2019 is $7.74 million.",

It didn\u2019t go well. According to Education Week, the proposal released earlier this month would gut at least 29 programs\u00a0in an attempt to save some $7 billion. \u201cWe had to make some difficult decisions with this budget,\u201d DeVos told a House subcommittee. \u201cMadam Secretary, I have to say, and maybe it\u2019s offensive: Shame on you,\u201d Rep.\u00a0Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said per CNN. The suggested budget has little chance of making it into law; the Trump administration has proposed similar cuts in previous years that didn\u2019t pass when Republicans controlled the House.\u00a0With Democrats now holding the purse strings, it\u2019s even less likely to pass. But if the Special Olympics cuts were enacted,\u00a0more than 10 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue would be impacted. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) asked DeVos how many kids would be affected by the proposed Special Olympics cuts. DeVos said she didn\u2019t know. \u201cIt\u2019s 272,000 kids,\u201d he replied. DeVos admitted that the Special Olympics was an \u201cawesome organization\u201d but noted that it also received support from philanthropic groups. DeVos, a billionaire, even\u00a0donated a portion of her salary to the organization last year. More than two years ago, she met with Special Olympics athletes and shared this image on Twitter: This week, that old image received many new replies: You hurt people. Your life hurts people. DeVos pushed back on the negative public reactions to the budget proposal in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Special Olympics is not a federal program,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year. There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don\u2019t get a dime of federal grant money.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from Betsy DeVos.",

Matt Wolking, the newly appointed deputy director of communications for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, accused Democrats of seeing \u201cabortion as the cure for Down syndrome and other disabilities.\u201d \u201cThe idea that **killing** children with disabilities is just fine but reducing taxpayer funding for a private charity that will still flourish without it is \u2018cruel\u2019 is demented. But that\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 position,\u201d Wolking tweeted as part of a thread.\u00a0\u201cTheir criticisms of [Education Secretary Betsy Devos] as \u2018cruel\u2019 are not sincere.\u201d Wolking was appointed this month to lead Trump\u2019s \u201caggressive rapid response team,\u201d which the campaign said will refute attacks and expose \u201cthe fake news media,\u201d according to The Washington Times. He previously worked for Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, DeVos defended the Education Department\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics, which provides year-round sports training and athletic competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. On Wednesday, after receiving intense backlash, DeVos released a statement saying the Special Olympics is a great enough organization to raise money without the federal government\u2019s help. \u201cThere are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don\u2019t get a dime of federal grant money,\u201d she added. The Special Olympics has meanwhile started an online campaign to advocate for continued federal funding, which it said would go to its educational programs in schools. Dr. Timothy P. Shriver, chairman of Special Olympics International, stressed the importance of these educational services\u00a0in a statement\u00a0and said that support for the programs \u201chas been matched by many members of congress - both republicans and democrats.\u201d \u201cThis work, as distinct from the traditional Special Olympics program, is critical to the future not just of education in schools but of the country,\u201d he said, adding that the lessons the Special Olympics programs offer \u201care critically the responsibility not just of the volunteer sector but of our elected leaders.\u201d",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " This week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos found herself at the center of a firestorm after Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) questioned her about a budget that proposed eliminating federal funding for the Special Olympics in a now-viral moment. \u201cIt\u2019s 272,000 kids that are affected,\u201d he told her. The moment blew up, even though the administration\u2019s budget was released weeks ago and the cut was previously proposed twice without success. DeVos\u2019 response drove an entire news cycle, though there was no indication the proposed budget would ever make it through Congress. But advocates say the focus on the Special Olympics obscures the much deeper cuts DeVos is trying to make to other areas, even if it is an important program. Amid all the controversy, other at-risk programs have been overlooked \u2015 even if those cuts are similarly unlikely to pass. \u201cSo many people don\u2019t understand there are so many programs that impact kids with disabilities,\u201d said Curtis Decker, the executive director of the National Disability Rights Network. \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have \u2018disability\u2019 in their name doesn\u2019t mean the cuts being proposed in a variety of program aren\u2019t serious.\u201d The Education Department\u2019s proposed budget would eliminate 29 education programs, including a program that operates after-school programs for low-income kids, one that provides professional development for teachers and one that helps provide mental health services. These programs are essential to kids with disabilities, according to advocates. \u201cThis budget is pretty anti-disability,\u201d said Decker. Other areas have avoided proposed cuts. Grants that directly fund special education services are not being targeted. The administration is proposing that those funding levels remain flat. Still, advocates say current funding for such grants isn\u2019t nearly enough. \u201cIt does feel like a reduction as districts identify more and more kids who have special needs,\u201d said Bob Farrace, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Instead, DeVos has prioritized other areas, like charter schools and private-school vouchers. The proposed budget calls for tens of millions of dollars more to support charter schools and an increase in funding for a school voucher program in the District of Columbia. It aims to cut over $7 billion from the Department of Education overall. A focus on school choice \u2015 at the expense of traditional public schools \u2015 is an attack on students with disabilities, Decker said. \u201cWhen you start going after public education, this is the major place kids with disabilities go. That\u2019s where the protections are. That\u2019s where the trained teachers are. That\u2019s where there\u2019s a familiarity of the rights of kids with disabilities,\u201d he said. The Trump administration\u2019s original proposal aimed to cut $17.6 million from the Special Olympics, about\u00a010 percent of the organization\u2019s funding. But by Thursday, President Donald Trump said his administration would not make that cut, though it was proposed in his administration\u2019s budget and Congress makes the ultimate decision about funding. DeVos echoed support for his decision, saying in a statement that it was \u201cfunding I have fought for behind-the-scenes over the last several years.\u201d But during hearings before the Senate and House this week, she repeatedly defended eliminating federal funding for the Special Olympics, using the national deficit as justification. \u201cWe had to make some difficult decisions with this budget,\u201d DeVos told a House subcommittee on Tuesday. In a statement on Wednesday, she noted that the program is mostly privately funded. \u201cThe Special Olympics is not a federal program. It\u2019s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission,\u201d she said in that statement. \u201cGiven our current budget realities, the federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations.\u201d Advocates see the proposed federal defunding of the Special Olympics as symbolic of the administration\u2019s larger disdain for people with disabilities, even if it accounts for a relatively small share of the program\u2019s budget. \u201cThe Special Olympics cut gained a lot of prominence in large part because it\u2019s a tangible expression of what we believe is a very cruel budget proposal,\u201d said Farrace. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy shorthand.\u201d",

I just told my people,\u201d Trump said to reporters Thursday. \u201cI want to fund the Special Olympics, and I just authorized a funding of the Special Olympics.\u201d Trump also claimed he had \u201coverridden [his] people\u201d to protect the organization\u2019s federal funding. While DeVos, acting on behalf of the Trump administration, proposed nixing Special Olympics funding, her proposal was not likely to make it into law.

Similar proposed budgets cuts couldn\u2019t even pass the House when Republicans had control.

DeVos faced criticism from lawmakers and the general public\u00a0Wednesday after she defended to a House subcommittee the decision to cut federal funding to the private organization.

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Friday compared this week\u2019s debacle over federal funding for the Special Olympics to the confusion that followed Trump\u2019s reversal of sanctions linked to North Korea last week. \u201cIn a certain way, it\u2019s like the Special Olympics,\u201d Trump said, according to Talking Points Memo. Trump was referencing the new sanctions against North Korea, which he canceled last week. \u201cFor many years, it hasn\u2019t been approved, and then at some point it gets negotiated out in Congress,\u201d the president continued. \u201cWell, I went out, and I said we\u2019re going to have funding for the Special Olympics. So that is why I approved that.\u201d In a confusing move last week, Trump announced he was canceling new sanctions made against two Chinese shipping companies that the Treasury Department claimed helped North Korea evade sanctions targeting its nuclear weapons program. The Treasury Department announced the penalties one day earlier. Trump made a similar move again on Thursday, this time after statements by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. One day after DeVos was fiercely criticized for defending the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cut federal funding for the Special Olympics, Trump said he was trying to protect the organization. Undermining DeVos\u2019 defense of the budget cut, Trump claimed he had \u201coverridden [his] people\u201d in order to protect funding for the Special Olympics. On Friday, Trump said his exchange with the Treasury Department and DeVos were \u201csimilar.\u201d \u201cSo it is a little bit of a similar situation with different parties,\u00a0to put it mildly,\u201d Trump said, according to ABC News. Although DeVos further defended the proposed Special Olympic cuts after the plan went viral earlier this week, the education secretary adjusted her tone on the organization\u2019s funding after Trump spoke out against it. \u201cI am pleased and grateful the president and I see eye to eye on this issue, and that he has decided to fund our Special Olympics grant,\u201d she said in a statement, one day after saying in another statement that the Special Olympics already received \u201crobust\u201d private support and thus didn\u2019t need federal funds. \u201cThis is funding I have fought for behind the scenes the last several years,\u201d she added Thursday.",

      "content": " A Democratic congresswoman is demanding that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos step down, accusing her of supporting race-based punishment of students in light of her push to end an Obama administration policy on fair treatment for minorities in the classroom. \u201cI am calling for her resignation because she has failed to live up to her basic job responsibilities of making sure that our kids have fair and equitable access to a great public education and to keep them safe,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cWhat Betsy DeVos did that I so object to and find disgusting is she rescinded civil rights policy and cherry-picked racist research to back it up.\u201d In December, the Trump administration scrapped guidance intended to shield students from racist discipline at school shortly after DeVos recommended the move. In doing so, DeVos cited a Journal of Criminal Justice study that argued that \u201cthe use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued.\u201d The study also claimed that \u201cthe racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student.\u201d According to U.S. News & World Report, the findings stated that differences in suspension rates across racial groups \u201cappear to be a function of differences in problem behaviors that emerge early in life, that remain relatively stable over time, and that materialize in the classroom.\u201d Clark called out DeVos\u2019 use of the research as an indication that she had failed \u201cto stick up for children\u201d and was therefore \u201cunfit to carry on this job.\u201d The congresswoman denounced DeVos\u2019 use of the research, which she contended was an effort to portray behavioral issues as a matter of \u201cwho these children are\u201d in terms of race. Responding to Clark\u2019s criticisms, Department of Education press secretary Liz Hill emailed the following statement on Tuesday: The Secretary rescinded this guidance months ago because she heard repeatedly that it wasn\u2019t working for students or for teachers.\u00a0For the Congresswoman to show up and try to grab headlines is nothing more than political opportunism at its worst. Secretary DeVos always has and always will fight to make sure every student is treated like an individual and has the opportunity to learn and grow in an environment that is safe and nurturing. DeVos came under fire last month for advocating for the end of federal funding for the Special Olympics, but her proposal was later dismissed by President Donald Trump, who said he told his \u201cpeople\u201d to keep it in the administration\u2019s budget proposal. This story has been updated with a statement from the Department of Education.",

I\u2019m an introvert.\u201d She said she also believes the media uses her \u201cname as clickbait.\u201d \u201cAs much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual.\u201d It was DeVos\u2019 first time appearing at the Education Writers Association annual national seminar, although she had been invited to it since taking office. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s two education secretaries attended the event every year. DeVos used the speech to promote her signature priority: the expansion of school choice programs. She pushed her proposal for Education Freedom Scholarships, which has been bolstered through legislation led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and would incentivize states to create programs that would subsidize individual scholarships for school choice. Under this piece of legislation, individuals and businesses could receive tax credits for donating to organizations that grant scholarships. These organizations could then provide scholarships to students to help them pay for education-related costs, like private school. It would be up to states, though, to shape what exactly their program would look like. \u201cWhile it is true that 90% of students today are enrolled in traditional public schools, it\u2019s also true that 60% of their parents say they would prefer something different if only they had the freedom to choose,\u201d DeVos said in her speech. During a question-and-answer session that followed the speech, DeVos noted that she was talking to both Democrats and Republicans about supporting the proposal. Opponents have called the proposed scholarship an attack on public education that is designed to push students to private schools.\u00a0DeVos previously has pushed back on such criticism, calling it \u201cfake news.\u201d DeVos, who has spent more than two years on the job, has been one of Trump\u2019s longest-lasting Cabinet secretaries.\u00a0But when asked whether she would stay on for four more years if asked, she joked that she\u2019s not sure her husband would sign on for it.",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) promised a crowd of educators on Monday that she would make one of their colleagues the next U.S. secretary of education if elected president. \u201cI will name a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher,\u201d Elizabeth Warren said to applause in Philadelphia. \u201cNo more Betsy DeVos.\u201d Warren first announced her promise in an email on Monday. She reiterated her commitment later in the day during the town hall event, which connected her with educators from the American Federation of Teachers, one of the country\u2019s two major teachers unions. While DeVos, the current secretary of education, has never worked in a classroom, multiple previous education secretaries have, like DeVos\u2019 predecessor John B. King. \u201cI want someone who has seen tattered textbooks. Or tried to manage when there\u2019s too many kids in a classroom. But I also want someone who has actually been there and taught a child to read,\u201d said Warren to applause. A New York City public school teacher named Liat Olenick approached Warren\u2019s team in March about pledging to make a public school teacher education secretary. Olenick sought out members of Warren\u2019s team at a rally in Long Island City, and kept in touch with them about her idea, she told HuffPost. Olenick has also asked Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) during events to make the same pledge.\u00a0They have not publicly done so, she said, though they both affirmed their commitment to public education in responding. Spokespeople for Warren did not reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. But Olenick said she believes the pledge represents proof of Warren\u2019s commitment to public education. \u201cJust the fact that Elizabeth Warren is listening to teachers and thinks it\u2019s important to listen to teachers is really powerful,\u201d said Olenick, who is also a leader of Indivisible Nation BK, an activist group in Brooklyn. The commitment, according to Warren, is part of her larger plan to transform education in America. Warren said she would start by enacting a new tax on the wealthiest Americans, targeting those who have fortunes of more than $50 million. Then, she said, she would use the money to pay for universal child care, universal preschool, higher wages for early childhood educators, expanding Pell grants, tuition-free public colleges and wiping out student debt. Warren also used the town hall to burnish her own public school credentials as a former special needs teacher. She called the role a dream job, and one that she still might have today had she not been terminated for being visibly pregnant. The role was \u201cnot a job. It\u2019s a calling and I loved it,\u201d said Warren. She later noted that her campaign is \u201ca chance to put a public school teacher in the White House.\u201d The town hall was the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 third recent event with 2020 presidential contenders. Union members previously met with Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The events are part of the union\u2019s presidential endorsement process. \u201cOur No. 1 goal is to elect a President who reflects our values and that means beating Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten previously stated of the process. \u201cBut to win our endorsement, candidates will have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\u201d",

These government-related messages had not been directed on to her department accounts, but did appear in the government accounts of other department staffers who were included on the emails. In total, investigators found fewer than 100 such messages sent to or from DeVos\u2019 four personal accounts between Jan. 20, 2017, and April 10, 2018. \u201cMost messages occurred during the first 6 months of 2017 and were from a single writer who was offering advice on potential candidates for Department positions,\u201d the report read. Other messages were from individuals offering DeVos their congratulations on her confirmation to her new position along with advice. During that same period, DeVos used her personal accounts to send six messages to a department email address, five of which concerned official business. The investigation determined that \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s emails related to government business were not always being properly preserved.\u201d The report noted that DeVos has been personally briefed on \u201crecords management requirements,\u201d including a warning that \u201cemployees are prohibited from using personal email or messaging accounts to conduct official government business.\u201d The investigation was completed per a 2017 request from House Democrats. President Donald Trump turned the use of private email servers into a rallying cry for his 2016 campaign, attacking Democratic opponent\u00a0Hillary Clinton for having used private servers to conduct government business while she was secretary of state. However, a federal investigation into the issue found that Clinton committed no crimes and did not intentionally mishandle classified information.",

      "subtitle": "Teachers went on strike in February over a bill they opposed. A few months later, they face the same fight.",
      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " West Virginia teachers went on strike in February to protest a bill that would open up the state to charter schools and help students pay for alternatives the public education system. They won that strike, and went back to work, when the House of Delegates\u2019 rejected the legislation. Just four months later, history is repeating itself. Earlier this month, the state Senate passed two bills similar to the one teachers protested in February, but with additional language that makes it more difficult for the educators to go on strike. The fate of the bills is again in the hands of the House of Delegates, which reconvenes on Monday. The bills represent the latest skirmish in a nearly two-year tug-of-war between local teachers and state legislators, during which teachers went on strike twice. The first walkout, in 2018, protested low pay and health care costs, and was teachers\u2019 first in the state since 1990. It lasted nine days and helped spur a \u201cred state revolt\u201d across the country, as teachers in Kentucky, Oklahoma and elsewhere\u00a0subsequently staged their own walkouts. The second strike in West Virginia earlier this year lasted just two days. Now, during the summer break for public schools, teachers are getting ready to mobilize again. The two education bills that the state Senate advanced promise a pay hike but would allow the establishment of charter schools \u2015 public schools that are privately managed \u2015 and create education savings accounts that help families use public money to pay for private schools. One bill also specifies that strikes by public employees are illegal in the state and that the workers can be fired for such work stoppages. It also says school superintendents must keep schools open during walkouts. The West Virginia Supreme Court previously ruled that teachers don\u2019t have the right to strike. But in the recent labor strife local superintendents closed schools in anticipation of work stoppages, which took the onus off of the teachers. In Arizona and Oklahoma, legislators also recently introduced bills that included new penalties for striking teachers, but the measures did not pass. In West Virginia, teachers like Brittney Barlett are on edge, ready to pack their bags and go protest at the capital in Charleston. Barlett will drive three hours each way on Monday to the city, missing a day of her summer job. \u201cThey can try to fire all of us, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work, and it\u2019s simply retaliatory,\u201d said Barlett. Barlett has only been working as a teacher for three years \u2015 two of which have been filled with protests. In addition to teaching, she\u2019s decided to run against her local state delegate after he voted against the teachers in February. \u201cThere\u2019s such a disconnect between what they\u2019re saying and what the reality of our classrooms are,\u201d Barlett said of Republican state senators, all of whom voted for bills that have provoked the teachers\u2019 ire. A recent report by the state Department of Education suggests widespread opposition to the idea of charter schools and education savings accounts across the state. The report, based on a series of forums, surveyed participants on their views of education issues. The department received nearly 700 comment cards on the topic of charter schools and education savings accounts, with 90% of respondents expressed disapproval. But GOP state Sen. Patricia Rucker, chair of the education committee, disputes that the report accurately reflects public attitudes. She said its findings were \u201cslanted\u201d by the large number of teachers who participated, and that respondents weren\u2019t given proper clarification on the definition of charter schools and education savings accounts. She also noted that most indicated support for the idea of more flexibility in education. Responding to criticism that the Senate bills represent reprisal against teachers, Rucker said in an email to HuffPost, \u201cThere is nothing retaliatory about local control or clarifying that our state does not allow for public employees to strike (as determined by our state Supreme Court). ... There is nothing retaliatory in giving local counties the option to have charters, something the majority of the United States has already,\u201d The Republican-led bid in the West Virginia Senate has the support of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. But state Del. Sean Hornbuckle (D) is skeptical that Republicans have the numbers to pass the bills in the House. The bills have encountered bipartisan opposition in that chamber. Hornbuckle said he isn\u2019t opposed to charter schools on principle and that he believes they might work well some places. In West Virginia, though, many schools are in rural areas and they are already struggling to retain students. Opening up charter schools could drain public schools of an already shrinking pool of resources and students. The bills are \u201ca deliberate poke in the eye of teachers and also labor unions,\u201d Hornbuckle said. \u201cThe fact that one would like to attack working class folks and blue-collar America \u2015 that might work in some places but it\u2019s not gonna fly in West Virginia.\u201d",

      "author": "Gavrielle Jacobovitz",
      "content": " More than 158,000 former students at predatory for-profit colleges sued Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and her department on Tuesday, demanding that the Department of Education continue reviewing applications for federal loan relief. The former students had applied for \u201cborrower defense,\u201d which would allow them to have their federal loans canceled if their college misled them or violated state laws. But their applications have been left untouched. Since June 2018, the Department of Education has neither granted nor denied the \u201cborrower defense\u201d application of any plaintiff, according to the complaint \u2015 leaving the former students waiting and in debt. (The department did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.) The plaintiffs now hope the lawsuit will give them a second chance. They are represented by the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard\u2019s Legal Services and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates (HERA). For-profit colleges implicated in the suit include the ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Colleges, DeVry University and Brooks Institute of Photography. Alicia Davis, a former student at Florida Metropolitan University, now called Everest University, said she and the other plaintiffs \u201chave been pretty much scammed and defrauded and ruined when trying to go and do something with ourselves and better ourselves.\u201d \u201cLiterally 160,000-plus people cannot move on with their life because of this non-decision by Besty DeVos,\u201d she added later. Davis worked as a bartender for a few years after high school until her early 20s, when she decided on the career she wanted to pursue: crime scene investigation. She saw an ad on television for Florida Metropolitan University, which boasted of its online degree in criminal justice. So she emailed them and heard back from a \u201ccounselor\u201d there, who sold her on the school. The woman highlighted that the program was online and claimed that a bachelor\u2019s degree was necessary for crime scene investigation careers \u2014 both were selling points for Davis. The woman said her credits could be transferred if she decided to pursue an education elsewhere. The counselor never told Davis how much the program would actually cost. Instead, according to Davis, the counselor said she would qualify for scholarships and that anything that wasn\u2019t covered with financial aid would be covered with grants and scholarships within the college. Davis was convinced, and she enrolled at FMU in 2006 to pursue a degree in criminal justice. She didn\u2019t know that the school was taking out loans on her behalf \u2015 loans that she didn\u2019t learn about until 10 years later. After Davis tried to transfer to a community college and apply for financial aid, she had to switch schools because FMU \u201cghosted\u201d her in 2008 \u2015 no longer contacting her about the program or replying to messages. At that time, FMU was bought by Corinthian, and Davis could no longer log into its online campus. Everest is now run by Zenith Education Group \u2014 Corinthian was shut down in 2015. Zenith Education Group said it could not address allegations from before 2015, the year it acquired a subset of for-profit Everest campuses from Corinthian Colleges. \u201cNot a single credit transferred\u201d to the community college. She wound up taking out even more student loans. After earning a master\u2019s at the University of Central Florida, Davis was about $100,000 in debt. Davis says FMU never sent her notices or information about the loans, which she said ruined her financially and could hurt her when applying for jobs if the company runs a credit check. \u201cIt\u2019s dropped my credit score, I can\u2019t get a car loan, I can\u2019t refinance credit cards\u2014which I need to do to lower my payment \u2014 I can\u2019t get a good interest rate,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to buy a house.\u201d But it\u2019s not only Davis who is experiencing the effects of predatory for-profit education. \u201cIt\u2019s an entire country full of people. And it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s terrible, honestly,\u201d she said. The Obama administration attempted to help former students like Davis in 2016, when it announced regulations against misleading and predatory practices by colleges by clarifying the \u201cborrower defense\u201d regulation that had been implemented in 1995. The changes were meant to take effect July 1, 2017. But in June 2017, now under the Trump administration, DeVos announced that her department would postpone the date of implementation because of pending litigation against the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation. DeVos said later that year that \u201cunder the previous [borrower defense rules], all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\u201d Nineteen states and the District of Columbia sued, and in September 2018, a federal judge ruled that Devos could not delay the plan for debt relief. But the Department of Education has not processed any claims for federal debt relief since June 2018, according to the Project on Predatory Student Lending. \u201cWe\u2019re suing Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education to hold them accountable and protect students across the country,\u201d Toby Merrill, the director of Project on Predatory Student Lending, said in a statement. The group is asking former for-profit college students who have filed applications to submit testimonies for the lawsuit. Many of the plaintiffs say they were misled by the for-profit universities they attended. The complaint cites a study by the progressive think tank Century Foundation that showed that in multiple for-profit schools in the U.S., from August 2016 to January 2017, less than 30% of tuition money was spent on instruction \u2015 at Capella University in Minneapolis, that figure was only 10%. \u201cGiven the predatory nature of this industry, and the Department\u2019s failure to regulate it, it is no surprise that students of for-profit colleges accounted for approximately 98% of all loan cancellation applications sent to the government between 2016 and 2018,\u201d reads the complaint. The attorneys for the former students are arguing the agency is violating the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies \u201cto render responsive decisions on matters within its purview in a prompt and definite fashion.\u201d In other words, federal agencies shouldn\u2019t stall. Federal agencies \u201chave a duty to decide\u201d so that former students can make decisions about how to move forward with their lives, according to Natalie Lyons, senior attorney for Housing & Economic Rights Advocates. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that they have to grant every application, but they have to make a decision on the merits,\u201d she said. DeVos \u201cby all appearances doesn\u2019t like this particular set of regulations, particular set of rights,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cBut simply because she doesn\u2019t like them doesn\u2019t mean that she can not act on them.\u201d This story has been updated with Zenith Education Group\u2019s response to a request for a comment",

      "content": "I am drowning in more than $120,000 of student debt after being defrauded by a for-profit college, and I refuse to wait for relief from the Trump administration. That\u2019s why I am going on the offense and suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. More than 158,000 other former students are doing the same. Many have been waiting more than two years for the department to cancel their debts under a law called Defense to Repayment (DTR), which requires debt discharges for scammed students. Recently, nearly 900 of us submitted testimony in the case. While it is now widely known that student debt has reached crisis levels, statements from former students reveal the specific impact that student debt, particularly debt from predatory schools, has on people\u2019s lives. A survey of the defrauded students found that 96% feel their lives are worse off now than before they went to school. Nearly half have put off getting married and having children because of debt. Student debt is a national crisis, with more than 44 million people together owing $1.5 trillion, but these testimonies provide even more evidence of the suffering that former for-profit college students experience. In 2007, I enrolled in the Illinois Institute of Art in Schaumburg, Illinois, to earn my bachelor\u2019s in fine arts. Now I\u2019m not sure I will ever be able to repay my more than six-figure debt. My credit is ruined. Before I filed my application for DTR and my loans were placed into forbearance, debt collectors would call me as many as 10 times a day at all hours. They even called my recently deceased grandmother as well as other members of my family, none of whom are listed on my loan documents. The worst part is the effect that this debt has had on my family. My children have never known a life free from debt and all the anxiety that it causes. My 59-year-old mother holds some of my loans via the Parent Plus loan program. That means that until these loans are canceled, she cannot retire. This debt has already affected three generations of my family. To add insult to injury, I received a worthless degree from the school I attended. The quality of the education was dismal. Students had to learn from free online tutorials and YouTube videos. Instructors would frequently be late or absent, and many classes covered the same content under a different name. During my enrollment, the school engaged in fraud, which was later revealed in an $11 billion whistleblower lawsuit. Recruiters showed prospective students falsified career placement statistics and offered inflated salary numbers. They also lied about the equipment and facilities that would be available to students. While I struggle every day with this debt, I am also convinced that debtors can win relief if we band together. DTR is the provision in the Higher Education Act that established rules for college financial aid programs. It was made public a few years ago by borrowers who had attended Corinthian, a chain of for-profit colleges that\u00a0had been under investigation for scamming students since 2007. The Obama administration eventually agreed that predatory loans should be canceled under the law. In fact, 28,000 people saw their loans disappear in the first mass student debt cancellation in US history. But Obama\u2019s Department of Education did not finish the job. Soon after her appointment by President Donald Trump, DeVos stopped processing borrower defense claims. Not a single loan has been canceled for more than a year. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked DeVos about the delay in a congressional hearing, and she seemed to blame students for being defrauded! \u201cThere are bad actors,\u201d she testified, \u201con both sides of the equation.\u201d That is why I and my fellow borrowers will force America\u2019s billionaire education secretary to finally follow the law. In the final accounting, we are fighting for more than just debt relief. We are organizing for the right to a true education that doesn\u2019t put us in debt. To win that battle, we know that we must stand together and refuse to be silent. This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

During a meeting open to staff on Tuesday, investigators explained that their inquiry \u2015 which included interviews and fingerprints \u2015 led them to believe that a framed poster had fallen off the office wall, breaking other objects as it dropped. PREVIOUSLY: Federal authorities are investigating after a Black employee\u2019s possessions at the Department of Education were recently vandalized in what could have been a racially motivated attack. African art objects were beheaded and dismembered and a school desegregation poster was damaged within the department\u2019s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education in Washington, D.C., NBC News first reported, citing multiple unnamed department employees and a congressional aide. \u201cWe can confirm there was an incident involving an employee\u2019s personal belongings on the third floor,\u201d Angela Morabito, a spokesperson for the Department of Education, said in a statement to HuffPost. The employee had been out of the office for several days prior to reporting the damage internally on Tuesday afternoon, Morabito said. \u201cSecretary DeVos took immediate action, including referring the case to Federal Protective Services for a comprehensive investigation, increasing building security, and most importantly, ensuring the impacted employee was supported,\u201d the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on an \u201congoing law enforcement matter.\u201d The Federal Protective Service is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security that responds to criminal acts against government officials and infrastructure, as well as against people who receive government services. Although Morabito would not confirm that the vandalized office belonged to a female employee who had recently been designated a \u201cdiversity change agent\u201d within the Education Department, as NBC News reported, she did emphasize Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 strong support for the diversity program. As a diversity change agent,\u00a0the female employee\u2019s job would be to train other employees to \u201cembrace diversity and inclusion as strategic opportunities,\u201d according to a government website. DeVos \u201chas strengthened [the program] since taking office to ensure a strong culture of inclusion at the Department,\u201d Morabito said. Hate crimes and racially motivated violence appear to be on the rise across the country over the last several years, according to FBI data. The recent mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, was one particularly high-profile example, with the gunman allegedly having prepared an anti-Hispanic manifesto before killing 22 people.",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hit the road this week for what her department calls a \u201c2019 Back-to-School tour.\u201d Her itinerary includes a school that bans transgender students and staff, HuffPost has discovered. DeVos on Thursday is scheduled to visit Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School in Pennsylvania, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg. The diocese has a specific policy for students and staff who may be experiencing \u201cgender identity questions,\u201d applicable in situations where a person wants to \u201cchemically and/or surgically alter\u201d their biological sex. \u201cThis is understood in Catholic moral terms as self-mutilation and therefore immoral. To attempt to make accommodations for such persons would be to cooperate in the immoral action,\u201d says the policy, posted on the diocese website. The policy says students will be unable to enroll or continue to attend diocese schools if they undergo or have undergone such a procedure. The policy similarly applies to staff. The diocese also forbids its schools from employing any individual \u201cwho promotes, procures, assists, or performs an abortion.\u201d The diocese did not immediately respond to questions about the policy. Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School will host DeVos for a roundtable discussion promoting the expansion of a Pennsylvania tax-credit program that provides low and middle-income families with publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools. DeVos has championed programs that help funnel public dollars to private schools in the form of vouchers or tax-credits. She has been dogged by questions about whether taxpayer funds should be going to schools that actively discriminate against LGBTQ students. A previous HuffPost investigation found that at least 14% of religious schools that participate in state voucher or tax-credit programs have policies that explicitly target LGBTQ students and staff. Over half of U.S. states have a private school choice program. However, as secretary of education, DeVos has made it a mission to create a federal program. During congressional testimony in March 2018, under questioning from Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), DeVos conceded that private schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students should not be eligible for federal dollars. The Pennsylvania Educational Improvement Tax Credit, or EITC, gives businesses tax credits if they donate to a scholarship-granting organization that helps families afford private schools.\u00a0During the 2017-18 school year, over 37,000 scholarships were awarded to families in Pennsylvania through the program. Diocese schools are among those benefitting. DeVos\u2019 Thursday roundtable is billed as a discussion of the program. She is to be joined by the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Harrisburg diocese officials. \u201cThe secretary\u2019s visit is focused on the legislature\u2019s efforts to expand the EITC-funded scholarship program,\u201d Elizabeth Hill, a DeVos spokesperson, said in an email. DeVos \u201cwas disappointed\u201d that Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) vetoed Republican-passed legislation that would have expanded the program, she added. \u201cMore than 50,000 kids who wanted access to the state\u2019s scholarship program were turned away due to lack of funding last school year alone,\u201d Hill said. Hill did not respond to a question about the Harrisburg diocese policy regarding LGBTQ students and staff.",

Wayne Johnson, was appointed chief operating officer of Federal Student Aid in 2017 by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who called him \u201cthe right person to modernize the FSA.\u201d \u201cHe actually wrote the book on student loan debt,\u201d DeVos said at the time. Johnson later shifted into another role as chief strategy and transformation officer but still focused on student aid. Now, more than two years later, he believes the student loan system is \u201cfundamentally broken,\u201d according to the WSJ. Johnson, who plans a long-shot bid for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), thinks the federal government should not be involved in student lending at all. \u201cWe run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody ... but it rides on their credit files \u2014 it rides on their back \u2014 for decades,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThe time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.\u201d Johnson said he would like to see up to $50,000 forgiven for anyone with federal student loan debt. Americans are currently trying to pay back a collective $1.5 trillion in student debt. The prospect of loan forgiveness has been a popular subject on the campaign trail for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) popularized the idea during his 2016 campaign. But under Sanders\u2019 plan, the government would become more involved with the cost of education: After wiping out all of the outstanding debt, the government would make public college free to attend and offer federal student loans at a much lower interest rate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is pitching a similar plan, but one that would forgive a smaller proportion of loans for wealthier borrowers and not forgive loans taken out by the wealthiest \u2015 people who make more than $250,000. Other Democratic contenders \u2015 including South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has six-figure debt himself \u2015 have put forth more limited plans for debt forgiveness and proposals to make public college more affordable in general.",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court by a federal judge on Thursday and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine after wrongly trying to collect on student loans taken out to attend a chain of now-shuttered for-profit colleges. U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim wrote in her order that there was \u201cno question\u201d that DeVos\u2019 Education Department \u201charmed individual borrowers who were forced to repay loans either through voluntary actions or involuntary methods.\u201d Around 16,000 people were affected by the department\u2019s continued efforts to collect on the loans, even after the judge ordered it to stop. Of those, 1,808 faced wage garnishment or offsets from their tax refunds, and 847 saw their credit scores negatively impacted. The borrowers have since been reimbursed, according to the department. Kim wrote that \u201cthe evidence shows\u201d the department made \u201conly minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.\u201d The judge had ordered DeVos\u2019 Education Department to stop collecting on the loans in May 2018. After discovering her order had not been followed, Kim issued a sharp rebuke of the department earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability,\u201d the judge said at the time, Politico reported. It is extremely rare for a court to hold a Cabinet secretary in contempt of court, and DeVos is facing fresh calls for her resignation over the issue. Because DeVos is named in the lawsuit in her official capacity as education secretary, the billionaire school-choice activist will not be personally responsible for paying the fine.\u00a0The $100,000 will go toward debt relief promised to former students of Corinthian Colleges, who former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration found were defrauded by the company. Corinthian Colleges, which closed in 2015, was found to have inflated job-placement rates of graduates by counting students who were employed prior to enrollment as successfully placed, and by paying temporary employment agencies to hire graduates. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d the Education Department said in a tweet. \u201cWe acknowledged that servicers made unacceptable mistakes.\u201d",

      "content": " The reading proficiency of fourth-graders and eighth-graders has declined in more than half of U.S. states since 2017, according to the results of a national student achievement test released Wednesday. The National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the Nation\u2019s Report Card,\u00a0also showed students failed to make significant gains in mathematics. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos lamented the generally abysmal results, which she said reflected a \u201cstudent achievement crisis.\u201d \u201cThis must be America\u2019s wake-up call. We cannot abide these poor results any longer,\u201d DeVos said in a statement. The NAEP is taken every two years by a sample of fourth- and eighth-graders in reading and math. This year\u2019s results, based on the test scores of about 600,000 students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, showed a decline in performance in almost all categories. Average scores were on par with those from about a decade earlier, but lower-performing students fared even worse this year than they did in 2009. \u201cOver the past decade, there has been no progress in either mathematics or reading performance, and the lowest performing students are doing worse,\u201d\u00a0Peggy Carr of the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the test, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cCompared to a decade ago, we see that lower achieving students made score declines in all of the assessments, while higher achieving students made score gains,\u201d Carr added. Eighth-graders\u2019 reading and math scores both decreased from 2017. Fourth-graders saw a drop in just their reading scores. The average math score for fourth-graders was 1 point higher this year than in 2017. DeVos expressed alarm at the low level of reading proficiency among students nationally. Only 35% of fourth-graders were considered proficient in reading, according to the 2019 test results, a drop of 2 percentage points from 2017.\u00a0Among eighth-graders, only 34% were proficient in reading \u2015 also a decline of 2 percent. \u201cOur Nation\u2019s Report Card shows that two thirds of American students can\u2019t read at grade level. Two out of three!\u201d the education chief decried, noting that 31 states had seen a decline in their eighth-grade reading scores since 2017, while fourth-grade reading scores had fallen in 17 states. \u201cThink about the mom or dad who cannot read, and so does not read to their own children at bedtime. Think about what that portends for their lifelong learning journeys. Think about what it means if they are passed along, grade to grade, not reading as they should,\u201d DeVos said. As the AP noted, most states saw stagnating or worsening test scores, but there were a couple of \u201cbright spots.\u201d Mississippi and Washington, D.C., were the only two jurisdictions that improved in at least three of four categories. \u201cOur achievement is at an all-time high in Mississippi,\u201d celebrated state Superintendent Carey Wright. Some education experts suggested students\u2019 worsening performance could be linked to spending cuts. In a pointed critique of DeVos, who has sought to slash education funding, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees federal spending on education, urged the education secretary this week to \u201cjoin House Democrats and families across our nation by supporting increased investments in our public education system,\u201d The New York Times reported. DeVos shrugged off such suggestions, however, and used the test results to push her argument for expanding alternatives to traditional public schools, including religious schools and privately run charter schools. \u201cGovernment has never made anything better or cheaper, more effective or more efficient. And nowhere is that more true than in education,\u201d DeVos said.",

      "content": "Betsy DeVos\u2019 confirmation hearing in January 2017 made her a universal punchline. When asked about her thoughts on guns in school, she famously pointed to the need to protect students from grizzly bears. When asked about her opinions on exams that measure proficiency versus those that measure growth, she could barely stammer out an answer. In a Republican-majority Senate, the billionaire mega-donor was barely confirmed to her position, a humiliating turn that required Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Two years later, DeVos remains among the least popular Cabinet members in a historically unpopular administration. Yet, somehow, even as her peers dropped like flies \u2014 former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 the education secretary has remained standing. HuffPost spoke with over a dozen people about DeVos\u2019 longevity, including former colleagues at the Department of Education, former co-workers in the advocacy space, and several political opponents who continue to root for her downfall. For the most part, despite her wild unpopularity, they chalk up DeVos\u2019 success to President Donald Trump\u2019s relative disinterest in education, her comparative lack of ethical conflicts and scandal, and her connections to the evangelical community, a group that serves as an important voting bloc for the president. But they also point to her wholehearted belief in the righteousness of her agenda and persistence in seeing it through. Many of both her supporters and opponents say they\u2019re not surprised she\u2019s lasted this long, describing her in similar terms \u2015 determined, dedicated, resolute \u2014 though vehemently disagreeing on what these traits mean for students. Her boosters and detractors seem to agree: Whether people hate or love what she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s doing it because she truly believes in it. DeVos\u2019 confirmation hearing earned her a portrayal by Kate McKinnon on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 and a message from the White House detailing the inadequacy of her performance, according to a former administration official. But since then, Trump has mostly stayed out of her way, whether out of disinterest or distraction. DeVos has similarly worked to avoid conflict with Trump and the pitfalls of self-promotion, quietly pressing forward with her education agenda. She has unsuccessfully worked to drum up interest in a federal school choice program and she\u2019s slashed guidance that promotes civil rights in schools. She has moved to give colleges \u2014 especially for-profit ones with sometimes fraudulent practices \u2014 more freedom from oversight, despite a litany of judicial challenges. \u201cShe keeps doing what she said she was gonna do, what she\u2019s always done and what she was hired to do,\u201d said Jeanne Allen, CEO of the Center for Education Reform, who has crossed paths with DeVos over the years as an advocate for school choice. Her clashes with the president have generally been infrequent and insignificant: DeVos heard from the White House early on when she issued a botched statement calling HBCUs \u2014 historically black colleges and universities formed in response to systemic discrimination\u00a0\u2015 pioneers in school choice. When she flubbed a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\u00a0interview in March 2018, she also heard from her boss, said a former staffer. DeVos has mostly navigated her way through the bumps, though \u2014 even when it comes to larger issues of policy and communication \u2014 publicly carrying the president\u2019s water. When Trump charged DeVos with running the Federal School Safety Commission after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, he made her the face of an initiative she had relatively little say over, sources told HuffPost. To DeVos\u2019 dismay, the White House used the commission to emphasize schools\u2019 ability to arm personnel. DeVos didn\u2019t necessarily disagree with such proposals \u2015 she is dedicated to the idea of local control and allowing districts to make such choices for themselves \u2015 but she didn\u2019t see the need to highlight such an option. And then, as the president waffled on whether the commission should look at potential age restrictions on firearms, she was left to look foolish, at one point describing the commission as a group that would study school shootings but not guns. DeVos most publicly pushed back against the president in March after he took credit for saving proposed cuts to the Special Olympics. Until that point, DeVos had toed the administration\u2019s line over the cuts, even amid widespread public outrage. The cuts had been proposed every year \u2014 and were most recently pushed by Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and acting White House chief of staff \u00a0\u2014 despite DeVos\u2019 opposition. \u201cI am pleased and grateful the president and I see eye-to-eye on this issue, and that he has decided to fund our Special Olympics grant,\u201d DeVos said in a statement at the time. \u201cThis is funding I have fought for behind the scenes over the last several years.\u201d In response to this article, DeVos\u2019 office emphasized her \u201cstrong working relationship with President Trump.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s evident in their collaborative efforts to protect First Amendment rights on college campuses, make American STEM education (and the future STEM workforce) the envy of the world, their work on school safety, and most of all, their partnership on the Education Freedom Scholarships Proposal,\u201d\u00a0 spokesperson Angela Morabito said. The Education Department denied there had been any conflict between DeVos and the White House on the Federal School Safety Commission, emphasizing that the secretary believes \u201cevery school and community has its own unique needs, one size does not fit all, and the people closest to the problem must be empowered to solve it.\u201d Eliza Byard, president of LGBTQ civil rights group GLSEN, recalls DeVos painfully pushing school choice during a meeting with advocates of transgender youth, right after the Education Department rescinded guidance designed to protect these students. Amid a discussion about safety concerns for these children, DeVos awkwardly promoted school choice, despite the fact that private schools in voucher programs are in fact legally allowed to ban LGBTQ students \u2014 and many of them do. \u201cThe thing that is painful and alarming and infuriating about that is there were already things in place solving those problems and they were ripped apart,\u201d Byard said. Indeed, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, uses harsh words to describe DeVos. But there\u2019s one word Weingarten won\u2019t use: chameleon. \u201cShe is who she is.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t pretend to be pro-public education, she doesn\u2019t pretend to be pro-student. She is pro-privatization, she is pro-big business, she is pro-the student lender industry,\u201d said Weingarten, who leads a teachers\u2019 union of about 1.7 million members that recently sued DeVos over alleged mismanagement of a student loan forgiveness program. But those who have worked with DeVos both inside and outside the Education Department maintain that while she might have tunnel vision, her motives on this issue are pure. They describe her as driven by altruism rather than opportunism, a trait that may separate her from her peers in the Trump administration. Whether misguided or not, she truly sees choice as a prerequisite for meaningful educational improvement that could especially benefit low-income children of color. \u201cI think Betsy DeVos has the best of intentions. Her desire to expand choice, especially for poor kids and kids of color, comes from a big heart and interest in seeing kids in America do better,\u201d said Michael Petrilli, president of the right-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Institute. \u201cTo the degree she\u2019s been cast as some kind of villain, that\u2019s not who she is. You might think she has bad ideas, but she doesn\u2019t have bad intentions.\u201d Former employees and associates say they understand why it\u2019s easy to see DeVos as a villain. But they work to rationalize her actions, painting her motivations and personality in plain terms. When she takes steps to protect at times predatory for-profit colleges \u2015 well, she thought the Obama administration treated these institutions unduly harshly and that the free market should be left to work its magic unencumbered, regardless of the casualties. (Courts have consistently ruled against DeVos in several of her attempts to roll back protections for victims in these cases, in one instance calling her actions \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d) \u201cShe\u2019s not an outwardly warm and fuzzy type person \u2015 that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s cold and distant \u2015 but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean she approaches her job or issues that come across her desk as: How can we screw up students\u2019 lives today?\u201d said one former education staffer. And,\u00a0according to a former employee, her most recent wave of scandals \u2014 which resulted in her being held in contempt of court after the Department of Education continued to collect money from defrauded students despite a ban on doing so \u2014 was more of an accidental snafu in a cumbersome system than any type of sinister DeVos-led plot. (The judge in that case previously said she was \u201castounded, really, just really astounded\u201d at the department\u2019s \u201csheer scale of violations.\u201d) \u201cPretty simply, it was nothing more complicated than an operational glitch,\u201d said A. Wayne Johnson, who was the Department of Education\u2019s chief strategy and transformation officer before resigning in October and endorsing a mass cancellation of student debt. Wayne described DeVos as an \u201cinspirational leader,\u201d and \u201cthe best example of what a committed public servant is about.\u201d Her decisions are characteristically deliberate and methodical. Early in the administration, when DeVos sparred with Trump and Sessions over the decision to repeal joint Department of Education and Department of Justice guidance designed to protect transgender students, it was less out of concern for those students than concern for a lack of process,\u00a0sources said. While former employees suspect that DeVos may have ultimately decided to rescind the guidance \u2014\u00a0which called on schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity \u2014 she would have preferred to have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders first. They maintain that she\u2019s not personally homophobic or racist \u2014 despite slashing a number of pieces of guidance designed to protect vulnerable groups \u2014 just disdainful of federal overreach. When a group of Harvard students unfurled a sign calling her a white supremacist during a September 2017 speech, she was particularly hurt, they said.\u00a0(In response to a question about this incident, Education Department spokesperson Morabito said DeVos wants to focus on students, \u201cnot on herself, and certainly not on personal attacks that have no basis in truth.\u201d) But these depictions are a far cry from how her detractors describe DeVos and the impact of her actions. \u201cShe never pretended she knew anything about schools or public schools,\u201d said Weingarten. \u201c[The Department] hasn\u2019t dealt with the student loan crisis. Instead, they\u2019ve just walked away from obligations to students, or they\u2019ve made it worse.\u201d Others wonder if, when it comes to school choice, DeVos is actively hurting the cause she most wants to promote. There\u2019s scant expectation she will succeed in pushing any type of federal program \u2015 an initiative at odds with her love of small government. Using her bully pulpit as education secretary to promote school choice seems like her greatest hope for expanding programs around the country, but DeVos is an unpopular Cabinet member in a historically unpopular administration. School choice once drummed up bipartisan support, but DeVos has helped make the issue radioactive for centrists and Democrats, Petrilli says. After writing a letter of support to Congress upon DeVos\u2019 nomination, he now wishes she would just step down. \u201cShe seems like someone who is determined to show grit and perseverance and demonstrate she was going to follow through [with the job.] I think she deserves a lot of credit for that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only argument is two years is plenty to demonstrate that. She could have stepped down after the midterm election and felt quite good.\u201d DeVos\u2019 office vehemently denies that the issue of school choice has been in any way harmed by her tenure, saying that it continues to gain popularity across states. \u201cThe only vocal national opponents of education freedom are seeking the endorsement of the teachers union,\u201d said Morabito. \u201cThey are the ones who ought to be asked to explain why the issue has suddenly become divisive.\u201d \u201cSecretary DeVos is dedicated to advancing Education Freedom,\u201d Morabito continued. \u201cShe has worked tirelessly to keep the focus on the cause \u2015 allowing every student in America to access a high-quality education that\u2019s right for them.\u201d But her last day also can\u2019t come soon enough for advocates like Byard, who says DeVos has already perpetuated so much harm in the everyday lives of vulnerable students. \u201cI wish something would get through to her,\u201d Byard said. \u201cWe\u2019re parents and we\u2019re people who care deeply about children. And we\u2019re scared.\u201d This article has been updated to include comments from an Education Department spokesperson.",
