      "content": "On Thursday night, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will share a presidential debate stage for the first time in a hotly anticipated showdown between the establishment Democratic front-runner and one of his fiercest progressive challengers. Biden and Warren\u2019s core disagreement centers on how hard the next president should push to fundamentally restructure the American economy. Warren has called for \u201cbig structural change\u201d; Biden promises a return to normalcy. To really understand this schism, you must consider the 36 years that then-Sen. Biden spent defending the uniquely pro-corporate laws of his home state, Delaware \u2014 laws that protect America\u2019s biggest companies from taxes, lawsuits and accountability; fuel economic inequality; and prioritize the interests of shareholders over those of consumers, debtors and workers. The system Biden protected affects every American: Because so many companies are registered there, Delaware is effectively the principal author and enforcer of much of the nation\u2019s corporate law. The state boasts more corporate registrations than human residents, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies. Delaware is corporate America\u2019s home base. Like Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 attacks on the \u201crigged economy,\u201d Warren\u2019s calls for change represent a direct challenge to Delaware\u2019s special status. By taking on three key policies that have made Delaware into the corporate paradise it is today, the Massachusetts senator is calling much of Biden\u2019s record into question. Warren\u2019s first and biggest target is the notion of shareholder primacy: the idea that corporate managers\u2019 most important legal duty is to maximize shareholders\u2019 wealth.\u00a0That means the interests of workers, families, local communities and the environment are of secondary importance to executives and board members. \u201cThat is in part a function of Delaware corporate law,\u201d said Kent Greenfield, a corporate and constitutional law professor at Boston College.\u00a0Under Delaware law \u2014 which covers all those companies registered in the state \u2015\u00a0shareholders must come first. In effect,\u00a0Delaware corporate law\u00a0encourages companies to undercut employee pay and ship jobs overseas in order to enrich shareholders. And it locks out other stakeholders, like workers and consumers, from being considered in the corporate decision-making process. Between 2007 and 2016, Warren noted last year, \u201clarge American companies dedicated 93% of their earnings to shareholders.\u201d This has other real-world consequences. When President Donald Trump pushed a massive corporate tax cut through Congress in 2017, for example, much of that money was returned to shareholders, rather than workers or other stakeholders. As vice president, Biden criticized shareholder primacy,\u00a0saying in 2016 that corporations should \u201cembrace your obligation to workers as well as your shareholders.\u201d But it\u2019s the competition between states to develop the most business-friendly corporate charters \u2015 the competition that Delaware won \u2015 that effectively ensures shareholder primacy across the nation. And the last time Congress moved to end that competition in the 1970s, Sen. Biden swooped in to defend Delaware\u2019s position. In the wake of a succession of corporate scandals and bankruptcies, the Senate held a series of hearings to examine whether the federal government, instead of the states, should issue corporate charters for large companies. These hearings were anathema to Delaware\u2019s politicians and business community. The state was then, as now, the national leader in corporate registrations.\u00a0Fees from business registrations were, and still are, a major source of funding for the state government. (Today, they account for more than one-quarter of the state\u2019s income.) Federalizing corporate charters would also cut profits for the state\u2019s lawyers, accountants and corporate registration companies. As Congress mulled a possible change, Biden appeared before two different committees to vouch for prominent Delaware lawyers who were there to argue against nationalizing corporate charters and for preserving Delaware\u2019s special position. At one hearing, he suggested that senators not attending should \u201ctake the time\u201d to review the lawyers\u2019 testimony \u201cbefore they make final decisions.\u201d Before another hearing, he praised the witness: \u201cHis judgment on these matters is also pretty sharp.\u201d Biden and Delaware won: Congress never moved to have the federal government take over issuing big corporate charters. The hearings fizzled out after Ronald Reagan took the White House and Republicans won the Senate in 1980. Now progressives like Sanders and Warren are trying again. In 2018, Warren introduced legislation to federalize the top tier of corporate charters and thereby take away Delaware\u2019s special place as the national writer of corporate law.\u00a0Warren\u2019s bill would require corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to obtain a federal corporate charter that would require them to consider the needs of a broader array of stakeholders \u2014 employees, local communities, suppliers, the environment \u2014 when making decisions rather than solely focusing on the concerns of shareholders. \u201cThe role that Delaware plays in determining our system of corporate governance is also, in that sense, going to be in play in the coming campaign,\u201d said Robert Hockett, a Cornell Law School professor who advises Warren, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The second aspect of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have taken aim at is its credit card industry, which Biden boosted by making it harder for Americans to discharge credit card debt in bankruptcy. In 1981, Delaware state lawmakers, at the behest of Republican Gov. Pete du Pont, passed a sweeping financial deregulation bill designed to attract banks to the state. The bill, written by lobbyists for Chase Manhattan Bank and J.P. Morgan (then two separate companies), eliminated the state\u2019s interest rate caps and gave special tax treatment to financial institutions. Months after the legislation passed, MBNA Corporation, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country, relocated from Maryland to Delaware. In the decades that followed, Biden and the rest of Delaware\u2019s congressional delegation worked hard to protect MBNA and the other financial institutions that flocked to their state. One big problem for credit card issuers was federal bankruptcy law. As the credit card industry exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of Americans filed for personal bankruptcy protection \u2015 a legal process that allows individuals to prioritize what debts they can pay off and start anew with less debt than before. Creditors, including the credit card industry, banks and retailers, argued that people were taking advantage of the process to discharge debt they could otherwise pay. These businesses wanted the debts owed to them to be higher priority and harder to discharge. On the other side were academics led by Warren, then a Harvard Law School professor. Warren\u2019s research found that people filing for personal bankruptcy were generally dealing with a stroke of bad luck. They had a major medical expense, a messy divorce or a lost job. (Some of this research was \u2014 and remains \u2014 controversial.) And women made up a major proportion of those declaring bankruptcy. Warren argued that the system was a last-ditch safety net for hardworking people. In the late 1990s, the credit card industry funded a massive lobbying campaign to pass federal legislation to make it harder to discharge credit card debt in personal bankruptcy. They hired President Bill Clinton\u2019s former Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, and funded multiple questionable studies to back up their argument that fraud was causing the spike in bankruptcies. At the same time, Congress created a National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study the problem. The commission, which Warren served as reporter and senior adviser, mainly sided with the academics against the credit card industry. But the industry\u2019s lobbying campaign won out. The first legislation to change the bankruptcy process in favor of creditors was pushed through the House in 1997. It went through four separate iterations before ultimately becoming law in 2005. Republicans generally backed the bills while the majority of Democrats opposed them. That first bill passed the Senate too and almost became law \u2015 until Biden reportedly threatened to filibuster the measure because the House had made it too friendly to creditors in conference committee. Nonetheless, he had initially voted for that bill, and afterward, he took the reins as the main Democratic voice in favor of rewriting bankruptcy law. News reports at the time referred to Biden as \u201cthe linchpin to passage,\u201d \u201cthe only Democratic true believer\u201d and \u201cpossibly the bankruptcy bill\u2019s staunchest defender.\u201d In 2000, President Clinton pocket-vetoed another version of the bill on the advice of first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Warren had convinced to oppose the measure. A Democratic amendment that would have prevented abortion opponents from using bankruptcy to discharge legal debt stemming from their participation in violent protests killed the 2001 bill. Finally, with a bigger Republican majority in 2005, Congress passed a bill that was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Biden was one of a minority of Senate Democrats who voted for the legislation all four times. Today, Biden claims that his support was part of an effort to improve legislation that was ultimately going to pass with or without him. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005, he saw it as his job to work with Republicans and Democrats to solve the issue of rising personal bankruptcies. Through his actions, he helped to protect lower-income debtors, prioritize alimony and child support payments, and increase credit card disclosure, according to the Biden campaign. The former vice president has \u201cchampioned the middle class for his entire career and has a proven track record of delivering on his progressive values,\u201d said Mike Gwin, a Biden campaign spokesman. But though he showed some distaste for creditors\u2019 goals, Biden believed the bill was necessary and tried time and time again to pass it. He\u00a0shoehorned the measure into a foreign affairs bill to get it before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was ranking member, in 2000. He cast the deciding and only Democratic vote in a 10-8 split supporting the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001. \u201cI am so sick of this self-righteous sheen put on anybody who wants to tighten up bankruptcy [who] is [painted as] really anti-debtor,\u201d Biden said at a 2001 hearing. \u201cPeople are getting hurt.\u201d Over the years, he voted against numerous consumer-friendly amendments offered by his Democratic colleagues that would have eased the bill\u2019s new requirements for consumers filing bankruptcy over medical debts or debts incurred while on active-duty military service. He opposed other amendments that would have put caps on credit card interest rates and penalized mortgage lenders if they had broken the Truth in Lending Act when they extended credit. \u201cSome of these looked like they were sympathetic to people with real issues, but they were not good public policy solutions,\u201d a former Biden Senate aide said. Through the many iterations of the bankruptcy bill, Warren emerged as its fiercest outside opponent. And she directly took on Biden. The year after the 2001 bill failed, Warren wrote a 39-page article in the Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal arguing that politicians like Biden should be forced to pay a political price for supporting economic legislation that hurts women. Biden\u2019s assertion that he made the bill prioritize women was misleading, Warren argued. Biden said he moved alimony and child support up the list of priorities for payment when a person entered personal bankruptcy. Child support services professionals backed his proposal, arguing that it would \u201crevolutionize the enforcement of support obligations against debtors in bankruptcy.\u201d But Warren wrote that this move was simply a sleight-of-hand, pushing alimony and child support payments above priorities that only came into play in business-related bankruptcies. The practical effects of the proposed change, she wrote, \u201cwould be either nonexistent or detrimental.\u201d More to the point, the latest bill\u2019s restrictions on personal bankruptcy would fall hardest on women because it was women who made up the majority of bankruptcy filings, Warren argued. \u201cFor a million women who will go to the bankruptcy courts each year, there is no more important pending federal legislation,\u201d she wrote. Major women\u2019s rights organizations, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, opposed the bill for the same reason. Warren and Biden finally came face to face at a Senate hearing on bankruptcy in 2005. In a now-famous exchange, he back-handedly complimented her for making \u201ca very compelling and mildly demagogic argument.\u201d He suggested she was targeting the wrong credit card problem by opposing the bankruptcy bill. \u201cYour problem with credit card companies is usury rates from your position,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt is not about the bankruptcy bill.\u201d \u201cBut, Senator, if you are not going to fix that problem, you can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cI got it, OK. You are very good, Professor,\u201d Biden said to laughs from Warren and the audience. The 2005 law did reduce the personal bankruptcy filing rate. But studies indicate the law made it harder for the country to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, led to 250,000 additional home foreclosures\u00a0and drove\u00a0a 25% increase in persistent insolvency. The pro-creditor status quo might not last forever \u2014 especially if Sanders or Warren wins the presidential election and the Democrats retake control of the Senate. The Sanders campaign announced on Sept. 5 that it would introduce a proposal to roll back parts of the 2005 law to help those with heavy medical debts. The Warren campaign has yet to release any bankruptcy-related reforms. The third pillar of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have challenged are the laws that make it a favorite place for companies to file for bankruptcy. Biden, again, has been on the other side. In the early 2000s, Enron, an energy services firm, collapsed amid a massive corruption scandal. John Cornyn, then attorney general of Texas, pushed the company to file for bankruptcy in Houston, where it was based and where it employed 7,500 people.\u00a0Instead, Enron filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan, where one of its subsidiaries was incorporated and it employed 57 people. This was possible because U.S. law allows corporations to file in any state in which they or their subsidiaries are incorporated. In other words, companies can venue or forum shop, effectively choosing the jurisdiction most favorable to their interests in bankruptcy. And there are two favorite venues: Delaware and New York. The Los Angeles Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. General Motors, famously of Detroit, filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan. There is a longstanding debate in the world of corporate bankruptcy law about whether venue shopping is a problem. Some contend it makes sense to let companies go to Manhattan and Delaware where the judges have greater experience in handling large, complicated bankruptcies.\u00a0But others, like Warren, argue that venue shopping allows corporations to pick their judges while creating steep burdens for employees, pensioners and other small creditors to attend out-of-town proceedings and pay the higher legal fees charged in both Delaware and Manhattan. That\u2019s what Enron\u2019s employees argued. And it was why now-Sen. Cornyn, with Warren\u2019s help, authored an amendment to the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill to ban venue shopping. At that same committee hearing, he asked her to explain her concerns about the practice. \u201cIn the case of large corporations that can leave their home venue \u2015 Enron, who can leave Houston, Texas, where its employees, where its pensioners, where its trade creditors reside \u2015 and escape the obligation to make the process open to the thousands of people who are directly affected by the bankruptcy, that affects the bankruptcy system overall,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA fair bankruptcy system is one that retains access for the employees, for the pensioners, for the small creditors, and that means those cases need to stay home, not go to a distant location where they [the corporations] think they may get a better deal.\u201d Warren\u2019s comment \u2015 that corporations could \u201cescape the obligation to make the process open\u201d \u2015 angered Biden. \u201cI find it outrageous such a statement,\u201d Biden said before asking Warren if she thought Delaware courts weren\u2019t open. Delaware\u2019s dominance in corporate bankruptcy cases is a side effect of its dominance in corporate charter registration. It\u2019s also a huge cash cow for local businesses from law firms to hotels to restaurants. But to critics like Warren, it makes it easier for the little people to get screwed. \u201cEmployees of companies like Enron literally cannot go to Delaware and hire local counsel, which the Delaware bankruptcy court requires them [to do] before they can make an appearance, and that effectively cuts thousands of small employees, pensioners and local trade creditors out of the bankruptcy process,\u201d Warren tried to explain to Biden. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford it, they are not there.\u201d Before moving on, Biden declared that Cornyn\u2019s amendment was going nowhere. Biden and his fellow Delaware senator, Tom Carper, threatened to withhold their votes from the bankruptcy bill if the venue shopping amendment was attached. Cornyn withdrew it under pressure from Republican leadership in order to placate the two Democrats. That wasn\u2019t the first time Biden had quashed an effort to stop venue shopping in corporate bankruptcy. \u201cMost of these proposals were to remove an industry Delaware had built up and to get a piece of the action for themselves,\u201d the former Biden Senate aide said. \u201cAs long as Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware is in the Senate,\u201d any possibility of venue shopping reform is \u201cnonexistent,\u201d Brady Williamson, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission\u2019s chairman, observed in 2006. When Warren won election to the Senate in 2012, she joined Cornyn as the Democratic co-sponsor on legislation to ban venue shopping.\u00a0But the bill hasn\u2019t moved in the Senate even though Biden is gone. Delaware\u2019s current Democratic senators \u2015 Carper and Chris Coons \u2015 have taken his place as its biggest opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s another one of these \u2018what\u2019s good for Delaware and to hell with the nation,\u2019\u201d said Adam Levitin, a bankruptcy law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. It\u2019s no big surprise when senators promote their home state\u2019s business interests. \u201cI take it very personally when my colleague or a colleague in the Senate decides to take an action that would benefit his state only marginally but would do great damage to my state,\u201d Biden said in 2004. \u201cI take that very personally.\u201d Biden\u2019s competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination have done it too. Sanders has supported stationing F-35 jets in Vermont, bringing jobs and dollars to his state.\u00a0Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), whose states are both home to big medical device manufacturers, endorsed a bill to repeal the medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act. And Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), whose state is home to numerous pharmaceutical companies, voted against a proposal to lower drug prices. What has made Biden\u2019s parochialism so significant is that his state\u2019s special interests are central to the structure of the U.S. \u2014 and global \u2014 economy. By putting his state first, Biden helped to build and protect the economic structure that Warren and Sanders blame for a wide range of Americans\u2019 troubles. That is what the coming debates will be about. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Biden voted against a 2005 amendment to bar wealthy bankruptcy filers from hiding assets in special asset protection trusts. He voted for it.",

      "subtitle": "Her latest plan would give current and future retirees $200 more a month.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren unveiled another plan Thursday, this time to increase Social Security benefits across the board and extend the program\u2019s solvency by 19 years. The senator from Massachusetts is proposing increasing monthly benefits for current and future beneficiaries of the retirement, disability and survivors insurance program by $200 a month for a total of $2,400 more a year. That top-line benefit increase \u2015 along with an assortment of other benefit improvements \u2015 would lift an estimated 4.9 million people out of poverty, according to an independent analysis of the plan conducted by Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which Warren\u2019s campaign released alongside the proposal. Her plan finances the changes by increasing taxes on the 2% of Americans making $250,000 a year or more. The additional revenue is enough to push back the date of the program\u2019s impending funding gap from 2035 to 2054, according to Zandi. \u201cWe need to get our priorities straight,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post outlining the plan. \u201cWe should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program.\u201d Warren\u2019s reform plan would also switch the program to a more generous cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula to account for seniors\u2019 health care costs, resulting in higher year-over-year benefit growth. The additional $200 a month that beneficiaries would receive would become part of a base benefit subject to the new COLA formula, which is designed to insulate benefits from the effects of inflation. And in addition to the proposed across-the-board benefits, Warren calls for targeted benefit increases that aim to shore up some of the most vulnerable populations. Many of the provisions have been in other recent progressive Social Security reform proposals. She would, for example, establish a special minimum benefit of 125% of the federal poverty level; allow caregivers of young children, seniors or people with disabilities to count caregiving work toward their earnings; reinstate and expand on the defunct \u201cstudent benefit\u201d enabling the children of a deceased worker to receive cash payments through the age of 24 if they pursue a higher education; and eliminate an obscure penalty on select state and local government employees who received some pension benefits in lieu of Social Security. Warren\u2019s plan to finance the higher Social Security benefits \u2015 and patch up the program\u2019s funding gap in the process \u2015 also builds on elements already in circulation. Unlike some other progressive reform plans, though, she maintains present tax rates for workers earning $250,000 a year or less. Currently, American workers contribute payroll taxes into Social Security on the first $132,900 that they earn each year, leaving the incomes of higher earners untouched. Warren would create a new payroll tax bracket on earnings over $250,000, including investment income not currently taxed for Social Security. Her plan would subject that income to a 7.4% tax on the employee and the employer both (14.8% total) while maintaining the 6.2% rate on income below the current taxable maximum. But what distinguishes Warren\u2019s plan from other recent reform proposals, including Rep. John Larson\u2019s Social Security 2100 Act and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Social Security Expansion Act, is the simplicity and universality of its across-the-board increase. The additional flat dollar amount would make it less abstract than the more technical changes in other proposals, such as modifications to the benefit formula. It\u2019s the additional $200 a month above all that gives Warren license to claim that her plan offers \u201cthe biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century.\u201d And, as with her plan to cancel most Americans\u2019 student debt, Warren has created an online calculator for people to see how their Social Security benefits would change under her plan. In the Medium post, Warren documented in detail the growing importance of Social Security as a source of retirement income in light of slow wage growth and the decline of defined-benefit pensions. Among workers approaching retirement \u2015 ages 50 to 64 \u2015 the average 401(k) balance is less than $15,000, Warren noted. As a result, Social Security provides 90% of the income for 1 in 4 senior households, and a majority of the income for at least half of those households. Warren framed her decision to back a major expansion of Social Security benefits as part of a larger commitment to fighting for consumers and struggling families that dates back to her days as a bankruptcy law expert. \u201cI\u2019ve dedicated most of my career to studying what\u2019s happening to working families in America,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOne thing is clear: it\u2019s getting harder to save enough for a decent retirement.\u201d As with the cause of adopting a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care system, Warren is typically less closely associated with grassroots efforts to defend and expand Social Security than Sanders, her closest ideological counterpart in the Democratic presidential primary field. Sanders led opposition to then-President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to reduce Social Security benefits as part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans prior to Warren\u2019s arrival in the Senate. But after Warren took office in 2013, she quickly became a pivotal figure in progressive efforts to reorient the Social Security debate from one centered on alarmism about the program\u2019s finances to a discussion of the role it could play in addressing a growing retirement income crisis. In a speech on the Senate floor in November 2013, Warren made the case for expanding Social Security benefits, sparking criticism from Third Way that resulted in several members of Congress distancing themselves from the business-friendly think tank. Many Social Security advocates regard the speech \u2015 and the response it evoked \u2015 as a key turning point in the public debate on Social Security. She subsequently sponsored a nonbinding budget amendment in March 2015 calling for \u201csustainable expansion\u201d of Social Security benefits; all but two of the Senate Democrats present voted in favor. Warren \u201cis a powerful leader in the movement to expand Social Security,\u201d said Nancy Altman, a co-founder of the nonprofit Social Security Works, which has been working with Warren on the issue since her first Senate campaign. \u201cAll Americans owe her a debt of gratitude for standing up for our Social Security system.\u201d The greatest political vulnerabilities of Warren\u2019s plan are its failure to fully close Social Security\u2019s long-term funding gap and its expansion of benefits for all workers, not just those with the greatest needs. Larson\u2019s bill, for example, would extend Social Security\u2019s solvency for the entirety of the 75-year outlook that the program\u2019s actuaries examine. But Warren is not the first progressive Social Security advocate to chafe under the program\u2019s 75-year outlook. Aside from Medicare Part A, Hospital Insurance, there are few if any major government programs required to plan so far into the future. And when it comes to the effect of her proposed reforms on the neediest in the population, Warren can point to ample evidence that her plan is weighted toward those with the least. Benefits would increase for workers in the bottom half of the earnings scale by 25% on average, while the top 10th of workers would see their benefits increase by less than 5%, according to the analysis conducted by Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics.",

      "content": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Progressive Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will share the debate stage for the first time with establishment favorite Joe Biden Thursday night in a prime-time showdown displaying sharply opposing notions of electability in the party\u2019s presidential nomination fight. Biden\u2019s remarkably steady lead in the crowded contest is built upon the idea that the former vice president is best suited to defeat President Donald Trump next year \u2014 a contention based on ideology, experience and perhaps gender. Sanders and Warren, meanwhile, have repeatedly criticized Biden\u2019s measured approach, at least indirectly, by arguing that only bold action on key issues like health care, the economy and climate change can build the coalition needed to win in 2020. The top-tier meeting at center stage has dominated the pre-event talk, yet each of the other seven candidates hopes for a breakout moment with the attention of the nation beginning to increase less than five months before the first primary votes are cast. \u201cFor a complete junkie or someone in the business, you already have an impression of everyone,\u201d said Howard Dean, who ran for president in 2004 and later chaired the Democratic National Committee. \u201cBut now you are going to see increasing scrutiny with other people coming in to take a closer look.\u201d The ABC News debate is the first limited to one night after several candidates dropped out and others failed to meet new qualification standards. A handful more candidates qualified for next month\u2019s debate, which will again be divided over two nights. If nothing else, viewers will see the diversity of the modern Democratic Party. The debate, held on the campus of historically black Texas Southern University, includes women, people of color and a gay man, a striking contrast to the Republicans. It will unfold in a rapidly changing state that Democrats hope to eventually bring into their column. Perhaps the biggest question is how directly the candidates will attack one another. Some fights that were predicted in previous debates failed to materialize with candidates like Sanders and Warren in July joining forces. The White House hopefuls and their campaigns are sending mixed messages about how eager they are to make frontal attacks on anyone other than Trump. That could mean the first meeting between Warren, the rising progressive calling for \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d and Biden, the more cautious but still ambitious establishmentarian, doesn\u2019t define the night. Or that Kamala Harris, the California senator, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, look to reclaim lost momentum not by punching rivals but by reemphasizing their own visions for America. Biden, who has led most national and early state polls since he joined the field in April, is downplaying the prospects of a clash with Warren, despite their policy differences on health care, taxes and financial regulation. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be me, and she\u2019ll be her, and let people make their judgments. I have great respect for her,\u201d Biden said recently as he campaigned in South Carolina. Warren says consistently that she has no interest in going after Democratic opponents. Yet both campaigns are also clear that they don\u2019t consider it a personal attack to draw sharp policy contrasts. Warren, who as a Harvard law professor once challenged then-Sen. Biden in a Capitol Hill hearing on bankruptcy law, has noted repeatedly that they have sharply diverging viewpoints. Her standard campaign pitch doesn\u2019t mention Biden but is built around an assertion that the \u201ctime for small ideas is over,\u201d an implicit criticism of more moderate Democrats who want, for example, a public option health care plan instead of single-payer or who want to repeal Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts but not necessarily raise taxes further. Biden, likewise, doesn\u2019t often mention Warren or Sanders. But he regularly contrasts the price tag of his public option insurance proposal to the single-payer system that Warren and Sanders back. Ahead of the debate, the Biden campaign emphasized that he\u2019s released more than two decades of tax returns, in contrast to the president. That\u2019s a longer period than Warren, and it could reach back into part of her pre-Senate career when she did legal work that included some corporate law. There are indirect avenues to chipping away at Biden\u2019s advantages, said Democratic consultant Karen Finney, who advised Hillary Clinton in 2016. Finney noted Biden\u2019s consistent polling advantages on the question of which Democrat can defeat Trump. A Washington Post-ABC poll this week found that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, 45% thought Biden had the best chance to beat Trump, though just 24% identified him as the \u201cbest president for the country\u201d among the primary field. \u201cThat puts pressure on the others to explain how they can beat Trump,\u201d Finney said. Voters, she said, \u201cwant to see presidents on that stage,\u201d and Biden, as a known quantity, already reaches that threshold. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to beat him, you have to make your case.\u201d Harris, said spokesman Ian Sams, will \u201cmake the connection between (Trump\u2019s) hatred and division and our inability to get things done for the country.\u201d Buttigieg, meanwhile, will have an opportunity to use his argument for generational change as an indirect attack on the top tier. The mayor is 37. Biden, Sanders and Warren are 76, 78 and 70, respectively \u2014 hardly a contrast to the 73-year-old Trump. There\u2019s also potential home state drama with two Texans in the race. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro clashed in an earlier debate over immigration. Castro has led the left flank on the issue with a proposal to decriminalize border crossings. For O\u2019Rourke, it will be the first debate since a massacre in his hometown of El Paso prompted him to overhaul his campaign into a forceful call for sweeping gun restrictions. O\u2019Rourke has recently used the F-word in cable television interviews. He\u2019s given no indication whether he\u2019ll bring that rhetorical flourish to broadcast television. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " HOUSTON \u2015 After two debates that did not feature the leading Democratic presidential candidates all on one stage, Thursday\u2019s showdown finally felt like a real debate, with establishment front-runner Joe Biden sparring with the progressive challengers close at his heels in the polls, Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.), as well as other moderates in the race. The 10 candidates ditched the introductory boilerplate and dived straight into their differences on health care and the economy, executing veiled shots at each other they\u2019ve telegraphed for weeks. But the highly anticipated face-off between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, the three polling leaders in the race, never really came to a head beyond one exchange on health care. \u201cHow are we going to pay for it?\u201d Biden asked moments after the debate began, referring to the universal health care plan backed by both Sanders and Warren. \u201cI want to hear that tonight. My distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it,\u201d he said, referring to Warren. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d the former vice president added, name-dropping former President Barack Obama. Warren responded by saying \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate, and explained that she planned to make the richest individuals pay for her plan. Sanders, who has made his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan the signature feature of his candidacy, also made sure not to miss a dig at Biden. \u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,\u201d Sanders said. Biden\u2019s campaign previewed his attacks in the days leading up to the debate as advisers repeatedly argued that Democrats should select a nominee able to offer \u201cmore than plans,\u201d a reference to Warren\u2019s most popular line on the campaign trail, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d Warren, meanwhile, took swipes of her own ahead of the debate that were widely seen as focusing on Biden. On the campaign trail, Warren repeatedly touted how she is not \u201cspending my time with high-dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists,\u201d a reference to the former vice president\u2019s fundraising events with well-heeled donors. The tension between the two campaigns spilled out into the open on the eve of the debate after former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Warren a \u201chypocrite\u201d and saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have any trouble\u201d taking his money until she swore off high-dollar fundraisers for her presidential bid this year. Biden\u2019s campaign told reporters on Thursday that he was not involved in the decision to publish the op-ed. The expected fireworks between the two candidates fizzled on stage, however. Warren did not bring up the op-ed, and apart from her remarks on Medicare for All, she played it safe by focusing on her plans for the economy and taking on corruption in Washington. Biden ignored Warren\u2019s former work in bankruptcy law and clients, continuing to make his case about \u201crestoring the soul of America\u201d amid the chaotic tenure of President Donald Trump. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, meanwhile, delivered one of the sharpest attacks against Biden when he insinuated that the onetime Delaware senator\u2019s memory might be failing him. \u201cAre you forgetting what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care, eliciting some gasps from the audience and reprimands from several other candidates on stage. The line appeared to evoke some critics\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s mental acuity. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d lamented South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg afterward. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed, chiming in with, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d Biden campaign adviser Anita Dunn responded by telling reporters that Castro \u201cclearly didn\u2019t learn from the first two debates that taking personal cheap shots at Vice President Biden actually doesn\u2019t work out that well.\u201d But New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker seemed to back up Castro in a later interview with CNN, stating that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.\u201d It was unclear, however, if the damage to Biden over the course of the night was severe enough to knock him from his front-runner perch. Other lower-ranked candidates also had standout moments during the night. Buttigieg got emotional in his closing remarks while talking about coming out as gay\u00a0when the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy forced LGBTQ members of the military to keep quiet about their sexual orientation. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke won applause when he reiterated his support for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. O\u2019Rourke vowed: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d Klobuchar took a swing at Sanders over the specifics in his health care plan, saying, \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill and ... it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\u201d And the audience loved California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 opening remarks in which she spoke directly into the camera to address Trump and his policies.\u00a0\u201cNow, Mr. President, you can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional comments during and after the debate.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " The 2020 Democratic presidential primary is in the middle of a slog, and Thursday night\u2019s debate reflected that. The campaign is mature enough that multiple candidates have dropped out of the race but still young enough for the top-polling candidates to bring risk-averse approaches to the debate, limiting the possibilities for fireworks. It was late enough in the cycle for most of the arguments to be familiar to a highly informed voter but perhaps not late enough to qualify as must-see television for the less-engaged. Little happened on Thursday night to directly and immediately threaten the polling lead of the top three presidential candidates \u2015\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2015 and, beyond their now-standard opening 30-minute exchange on health care and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a brief scuffle on Biden\u2019s vote for the Iraq War, they avoided directly criticizing each other. The lower-polling candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), all deployed different strategies for a breakout moment: Klobuchar used her corny sense of humor, Harris tried to focus on criticizing President Donald Trump, and O\u2019Rourke had success introducing his campaign\u2019s new focus on gun control to a national audience.  Here are four takeaways from the third Democratic presidential debate: Polling in recent weeks has shown a solid top trio of Biden, Warren and Sanders, with Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2015 both of whom had stints in the top tier \u2015 falling into the single digits. The fact that Warren and Biden, who have clashed in the past, were sharing the debate stage for the first time only increased expectations of a showdown. Instead, new lines of contrast were few and far between, with all three top candidates opting to take a rain check on a climactic battle. Sanders and Warren teamed up to battle Biden in an occasionally testy health care exchange that mostly was a retread of arguments from earlier debates. Repeat viewers who were sold on Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan and those who prefer Biden\u2019s more incremental push to expand Obamacare were unlikely to have heard any arguments to budge them. One answer from Sanders did stand out. After Biden brought up his own vote in favor of the Iraq War, Sanders highlighted his own opposition to the conflict. \u201cThe truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what [Dick] Cheney and [George W.] Bush said about Iraq,\u201d Sanders said to Biden. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the former vice president responded, as many in the audience cheered. But Sanders quickly let the topic drop, moving on to discuss his work to improve veterans\u2019 health care as the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. In the same answer, he noted he had voted against increases in military spending during the Trump administration. That\u2019s a potential point of contrast with Warren, but he never mentioned her votes to make the contrast clear. Though all three top-tier candidates received plenty of attention from the moderators \u2015 Biden led in speaking time, with 17\u00bd minutes, Warren was second with 16\u00bd minutes, and Sanders was in fourth beyond Booker with 14 minutes \u2015 all also had stretches when they seemed to take a back seat. Their campaigns are likely to be fine with that. At this point, the front-runners have much more ground to lose than they stand to gain. The goal of any lower-polling candidate is to have A Moment, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s declaration of support for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons \u2015 \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he told the moderators. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d \u2015 qualified as one and is likely to be one of the few clips voters who didn\u2019t watch live will see from the debate. It\u2019s likely to generate attention not only because the party\u2019s base seems ready to embrace candidates adopting bolder positions on gun control but also because it\u2019s a risky position for a Democrat to hold for the general election. O\u2019Rourke, who is polling in single digits, has adopted a more urgent tone in his campaign since the mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa, Texas, last month and has put an aggressive gun control push at the center of his messaging. It\u2019s paying off: The O\u2019Rourke campaign bragged that it had its best fundraising hour of the quarter during the debate. It\u2019s possible this is O\u2019Rourke finding his stride. But it\u2019s also possible it leads to a burst of attention with little long-term effect. (See the praise of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro after the first debate for an example.) Castro has consistently shown his willingness to draw contrasts and critique his opponents \u2015 remember his attacks on O\u2019Rourke in the first debate \u2015 and Biden was his main target Thursday. His attack on the 76-year-old former vice president during the health care portion of the debate \u2015 \u201cYou just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago said that they would have to buy in.\u201d \u2015 is unlikely to lead to a detailed policy discussion and has already led to a discussion about whether the attack was unfairly ageist. (Castro, in post-debate interviews, insisted he wasn\u2019t taking a shot at Biden\u2019s age.) Sure, slamming Biden is likely to please progressives eager for the other candidates to knock the Delawarean from his perch atop the polls. The response to Castro\u2019s comments, even in the immediate hours after the debate, illustrates the risks of throwing punches in a primary, especially when the other candidate has an extensive network of surrogates and allies like Biden does. The debate had barely ended when former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was on national television calling Castro \u201cmean and vindictive.\u201d Expect similar commentary from other Obama administration alumni with fond feelings for the former vice president. At the same time, Castro, who is polling at around 1%, was not guaranteed to feature in post-debate chatter. The punches he threw at Biden mean he will be talked about \u2015 something a candidate polling at 1% needs desperately. And another debate exchange made it clear Castro isn\u2019t going to shy away from criticizing the other candidates. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d Buttigieg said after the former San Antonio mayor\u2019s exchange with Biden. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election,\u201d Castro responded. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for.\u201d Thursday\u2019s debate moderators were two white men, one black woman and one Latino man. It was a diverse group of questioners, and it paid off. Some of the strongest questions of the night came from ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. The majority of the moderators in the 2016 and 2018 Democratic debates were men, and predominantly white men. But the Democratic National Committee instituted a new rule for the 2020 election cycle mandating that every debate have a female moderator. It also encouraged news outlets hosting debates to include people of color. On Thursday, Davis pressed Harris on her criminal justice record, listing positions that have changed over the years. And Davis pointedly read Biden one of his quotes from 1975, in which he said he didn\u2019t believe society had any responsibility to address the legacy of slavery. Ramos pressed Biden on President Barack Obama\u2019s deportations of undocumented immigrants and asked him why Latinos should trust him. He also challenged Biden when he dodged the question. He then turned to Castro, the former Obama Cabinet secretary and the only Latino candidate in the field, and asked him why voters should trust Democrats to deal with immigration reform since the party failed to do it when it controlled Congress and the White House in 2009.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner. And there were moments in Thursday night\u2019s debate when he looked the part. Standing between a pair of liberal senators offering radical change, he unabashedly embraced his more moderate position on health care, forcefully pressuring Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to level with Americans about the steep cost of implementing a fully government-run system. He was more polished and practiced than in previous contests. And he repeatedly leaned on the legacy of former President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular Democrat in the nation. \u201cI\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked,\u201d he declared. But the debate was punctuated by moments that highlighted why Biden can\u2019t shake questions about his consistency and whispers about his fitness for office, despite his lead in most national polls and early state surveys. Most glaringly: a meandering answer near the end of the debate about his past statements on racial inequality. Biden said poor parents should play the \u201crecord player\u201d for their children before veering off into comments about Venezuela. Biden\u2019s standing in the Democratic contest is the source of much debate within the party. Is he an experienced elder statesman who can calm an anxious nation and peel back some of the white working class voters who helped send President Donald Trump to the White House? Or is the 76-year-old past his prime and out of step with a party that is growing younger, more diverse and more liberal? Thursday night\u2019s contest provided fresh fodder for each of those theories. Biden was at his best in his lengthy exchange with Sanders and Warren over the future of health care in America. He confidently pressed them over the cost of their sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposals, exposing Warren\u2019s unwillingness to say whether middle class Americans would see a tax increase under her plan (Sanders says they would, but argues the rise would be offset by lower health care costs). In a retort to Sanders, who has said he expects employers would pass on health care savings to their workers, Biden exclaimed: \u201cFor a socialist you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d Biden was the focus of fierce criticism from his rivals in both of the previous Democratic debates. But those attacks did little to diminish Biden\u2019s standing atop polls, nor has a series of verbal flubs and misstatements throughout the summer. The other reality: The candidates who have launched the sharpest attacks on Biden have gained little ground or already dropped out of the race. Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, bested Biden in the opening debate with a highly personal critique over his decades-old position on federally mandated school busing, but any boost for her candidacy was short-lived. Perhaps mindful of that reality, most candidates sidestepped overt criticism of the vice president in Thursday\u2019s debate. The one notable exception was Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing secretary and is in need of a jolt to break out of the lower tier of candidates. In a highly charged moment, Castro challenged Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a barely veiled reference to questions about the former vice president\u2019s age. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said during an exchange on health care. In a post-debate interview, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker laid into Biden as well, saying there were many people concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball \u201cacross the end line without fumbling.\u201d Castro and Booker were zeroing in on real questions that are being asked about Biden. Is he too old to serve as president? If he were the nominee, would he make a mistake at a critical moment that could clear the way for Trump? Biden\u2019s stumbles later in the debate magnified those questions. He struggled through an answer about the war in Iraq and gave a grab-bag answer to a question about how to repair the legacy of slavery in America. He appeared to suggest that poorer families needed help learning how to raise their children. Biden\u2019s supporters argue that ultimately, those answers \u2014 and the questions they raise \u2014 matter less to voters than their overall impressions of the former vice president. Indeed, there is a deep reservoir of goodwill for Biden in the Democratic Party, shaped in large part by the eight years he served as Obama\u2019s No. 2. Which leaves little doubt as to why Biden spent much of the debate reminding Americans about those years, urging them to see him as the rightful heir to legacy of the last Democrat to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2014 good, bad, indifferent,\u201d Biden said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201chell yes\u201d moment at the Democrats\u2019 presidential debate is scrambling his party\u2019s message on guns. The Democrats have long contended their support of gun control laws does not mean they want to take away law-abiding citizens\u2019 firearms. But on Friday, they struggled to square that message with their presidential contender\u2019s full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,\u201d the former Texas congressman declared during Thursday night\u2019s debate. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso was the site of a mass shooting last month that killed 22 people, and he has put the issue of gun violence at the center of his campaign effort. On Friday, his campaign hawked T-shirts emblazoned with his debate vow. However, some fellow Democrats chastised him and fretted that his remarks may have made things harder for gun control supporters as they negotiate with President Donald Trump on legislation to respond to this summer\u2019s mass shootings. \u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told CNN Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done.\u201d His fears about new rages against gun control supporters seem sure to be borne out. \u201cThis is what their goal is. We\u2019ve always said it, now they\u2019re saying it,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation, based in Washington state. \u201cNow they\u2019ve said it and we\u2019re going to make them eat it.\u201d Meanwhile, Coons is working with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on a measure to require that law enforcement officials be notified when someone fails a gun-purchase background check. Toomey, who is also working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the firearms issue, agreed that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments could backfire. \u201cThis rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\u201d he said. O\u2019Rourke was less provocative in his language but still determined Friday. \u201cMuch respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it.\u201d One worry among Democrats is that calling for outright confiscation plays into claims by Trump and other Republicans that Democrats are coming for people\u2019s firearms. On Thursday night, just as O\u2019Rourke made his call to take back the rifles, Trump warned at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.\u201d Republicans, Trump promised, \u201cwill forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d That line got huge applause at the GOP retreat, and again Friday when it was repeated there by Vice President Mike Pence. By all accounts, Trump needs to run up the score in rural areas to win reelection next year. The 2020 outcome is expected to depend heavily on a trio of Rust Belt states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 that have large numbers of rural voters, many of whom are gun-owners or sympathetic to owners on this issue. And Democrats\u2019 hope of winning control of the Senate rests on states with high rates of gun ownership, like Arizona and Texas. Several gun control groups stressed Friday that they were not advocating confiscation, but they also didn\u2019t follow Coons\u2019 lead in condemning O\u2019Rourke\u2019s declaration. \u201cI think it is very understandable that he is taking a policy position that the larger gun safety community hasn\u2019t taken and he\u2019s trying to push the envelope,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, the gun control group named after Gabby Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011. \u201cIf the American voter does not think this is an appropriate solution, they\u2019ll let us know.\u201d Gun rights groups have seemed to be somewhat on their heels recently as the unabated series of mass shootings has increased pressure for new control measures. Even the staunchly conservative lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, said he supports background checks for all gun purchases after the El Paso attack and a second mass shooting in the state. Infighting and investigations at the National Rifle Association and election wins by pro-gun-control Democrats last November have convinced some politicians that the winds have shifted on the gun issue. Indeed, O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t alone. None of the other nine candidates on the debate stage contradicted him on his proposal to require owners of the two popular styles of assault rifles to sell them to the government. Two candidates \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 have also called for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, asked if she agreed with O\u2019Rourke Thursday night, allowed only that she preferred a voluntary buyback to a mandatory one. All 10 of the Democrats onstage have called for an assault weapon sales ban, the latest sign of how the party has become emboldened on gun control. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much the politics of gun safety has changed \u2014 whereas candidates once avoided gun safety entirely, now they\u2019re jockeying to be the boldest,\u201d said Taylor Maxwell of Everytown, the gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Proposals like background checks and so-called red flag laws, which allow authorities to confiscate guns from people who are deemed threats, are \u201curgent,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many lives are on the line not to take these simple, broadly popular and bipartisan steps immediately.\u201d But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks worry Democrats like Warren Varley, who lost a race for a state legislative seat in Iowa last year. \u201cThe lines like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna come and take your AR-15,\u2019 just play into the fears that the NRA has been stoking, and a proposal like that is just going to make rural Iowa and I think probably rural areas elsewhere more red,\u201d Varley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just a bridge too far for most rural folks, and it conjures up images of the government coming in and invading your home and images of big government trampling over the rights of individuals.\u201d Trump and White House aides have discussed a number of gun control measures with members of Congress, including steps to go after fraudulent buyers, notify state and local law enforcement when a potential buyer fails a background check, issue state-level emergency risk protection orders, boost mental health assistance and speed up executions for those found guilty of committing mass shootings. A formal announcement on the president\u2019s plan is expected as soon as next week. __ Riccardi reported from Denver.

      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elizabeth Warren has released a sweeping anti-government corruption proposal, providing a detailed policy roadmap for a fight she says is at the core of her presidential campaign. The Democratic senator from Massachusetts is announcing the plan Monday in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, near the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Co., which caught fire in 1911, killing 140-plus workers. Many of those deaths later were attributed to neglected safety features, such as doors that were locked inside the factory. Warren\u2019s plan would ban lobbyists from many fundraising activities and serving as political campaign bundlers, tighten limits on politicians accepting gifts or payment for government actions and bar senior officials and members of Congress from serving on nonprofit boards. It also would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts, prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases and ban class action waivers for all cases involving employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights. \u201cMake no mistake about it: The Trump Administration is the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes,\u201d Warren wrote in an online post announcing the plan. \u201cBut these problems did not start with Donald Trump. They are much bigger than him \u2014 and solving them will require big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government.\u201d Warren has long argued that the nation\u2019s modern government only works for \u201cthe wealthy and the well-connected\u201d like big energy, health care and insurance companies that employ lobbyists to advance their priorities over the best interests of ordinary citizens. She wrote that popular policies championed by the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing \u2014 and many of its crowded field of presidential hopefuls\u00a0\u2014 like universal child care, an overhaul of the federal criminal justice system, gun reform and plans to promote affordable housing have been \u201cstymied because giant corporations and billionaires who don\u2019t want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign noted that she already proposed a series of anti-corruption measures in Congress last year, but it says the proposal released Monday goes farther. Calls for drastically remaking the way government works are also a key theme for Warren\u2019s presidential campaign competitor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But while Warren is seeking a remake of the system, Sanders has advocated for a full political revolution. \u201cReal change in America never takes place from the top down,\u201d Sanders told a weekend rally in Las Vegas, a rallying cry he repeats frequently. \u201cIt takes place from the bottom up.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The Working Families Party endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 election cycle.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Working Families Party, a leading progressive organization with roots in organized labor, announced Monday that it is endorsing the presidential bid of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The group\u2019s backing provides a boost to Warren as she seeks to solidify her climb in the polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as the leading alternative on the left to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party national director, said in a statement. \u201cOur job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.\u201d As part of the group\u2019s endorsement process, Mitchell grilled five presidential candidates \u2015 Warren, Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2015 on live broadcasts that gave members the opportunity to submit questions or ask them live. Warren distinguished herself in her interview by, among other things, promising to repeal the 1994 crime bill authored by Biden. The group\u2019s interview with Booker proved more contentious, with an extended discussion of his ties to controversial Garden State political bosses. Sen. Kamala Harris of California canceled her interview with the organization, citing a scheduling conflict, a decision that prompted the group to take her out of the running.\u00a0The group had ruled out all but those six candidates based on their answers to a questionnaire. The endorsement, reflecting the views of 61% of Working Families Party members and leaders in a ranked-choice voting system, is a particularly sharp disappointment for Sanders, who picked up the group\u2019s backing in the 2016 election cycle, but received just 36% of the vote from participating members this time around. The Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, Analilia Mejia, is the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Mitchell acknowledged Sanders\u2019 role as a progressive trailblazer in his statement on the endorsement. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d The endorsement nonetheless drew skepticism from Sanders supporters, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the endorsement process and talked of canceling their dues to the organization. Some Sanders supporters interpreted a Mitchell quote in\u00a0The New York Times in which he warned against progressives who hoped to defeat moderate Democrats with \u201cthought pieces or pithy tweets\u201d as a dig at them. Mitchell denied that was his intention in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI was talking about the work all of us have to do to defeat the far right and the corporate forces who want to capture the Democratic nomination \u2015 all those forces. We need to organize against them,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t take this occasion to choose to settle a score against a candidate who I think is amazing and doing great work.\u201d Mitchell acknowledged, however, that the endorsement causes pain to many Working Families Party members who are staunchly in Sanders\u2019 corner and raises the challenge of moving forward as a unified bloc. \u201cWe knew that this would be a hard vote and that there would be folks who would be very disappointed. And that\u2019s what happens when mature political organizations wrestle around really important decisions,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dWe\u2019re going to continue to organize and keep our eyes on the prize.\u201d Mitchell and the Working Families Party also stand behind the fairness of the endorsement process. In the previous presidential election cycle, members of the group\u2019s national committee \u2015 the council of unions and grassroots groups that function as its key stakeholders \u2015 held the vast majority of votes in the endorsement process. This year, activists who are not on the national committee \u2015 both dues-paying members and supporters who do not pay dues \u2015 were allotted half of the votes. The roughly 50 activist leaders representing grassroots organizations on WFP\u2019s national committee had votes worth the other half of the total. And while activists who do not pay dues were permitted to cast ballots in the 2016 election cycle, Working Families Party claims it took specific steps to screen them this year, including through an email blast that required progressives to affirm their support for the group\u2019s agenda and proceed through an online portal for voting. In total, about 10,000 people cast ballots, according to the group. The Working Families Party has neither demographic data about the participants in its endorsement process, nor insight into the rationale of activists who opted for Warren over Sanders.\u00a0It likewise declined to provide a breakdown of votes for either candidate based on whether participants were activist leaders with privileged voting status, dues-paying members or mere sympathetic supporters. Mitchell said that, on a personal note, he appreciates Warren\u2019s ability to communicate progressive ideas to a diverse array of people. \u201cWe need a candidate that can break down these concepts in ways that encourage a multiracial alignment of folks to defeat Trump and defeat neo-fascism and I think she\u2019s uniquely positioned to do that,\u201d he said. Warren\u2019s endorsement last Monday of Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate running for Philadelphia city council, swayed some members of WFP\u2019s leadership with privileged voting status, according to a progressive strategist familiar with these leaders\u2019 thinking. The Working Families Party was founded in 1998 by a coalition of New York labor unions and community organizations hoping to establish a progressive foothold within the Democratic Party-run politics of the Empire State. In New York, where the group retains its largest presence, progressive Democrats have the chance to run on its ballot line as well as that of the Democratic Party as a show of strength from the party\u2019s progressive wing. As Working Families Party has matured, it has gotten bolder in its political stances and more distant from its roots in New York\u2019s labor unions. A decision by the group to endorse Cynthia Nixon\u2019s challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 Democratic primary at once prompted an exodus of nearly all of the labor unions backing the organization and freed it to chart a more independent path. Although New York remains its hub, the Working Families Party now has state-level affiliates in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, as well as local branches in four others. States with affiliates include the general-election battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Working Families Party, which often sets up PACs to boost candidates it endorses in state and local elections, has yet to spell out exactly how it will use its resources to buttress Warren\u2019s 2020 bid. Mitchell, who is African American and previously served as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that the group is well equipped to organize working-class voters and voters of color \u2015 some of the very people polls suggest Warren has had difficulty attracting. Referring to these voting blocs, Mitchell said, \u201cThere are a number of communities that often do not get heard and get taken for granted, unfortunately by a lot of Democrats. It\u2019s going to be our interest to lift them up.\u201d The endorsement from a powerhouse of New York politics comes ahead of a rally Warren is holding in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday evening. The Warren campaign chose the site for its proximity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, a sweatshop where a fire in 1911 killed 145 garment workers. Warren plans to discuss the resonance that the tragedy, which became a rallying cry for labor organizing in the city and across the country, has for her campaign and the movement she is trying to build.

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2015\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew thousands of New Yorkers to her presidential campaign rally Monday in Washington Square Park, where she discussed her plans to fight corruption and support workers nationwide. The Democratic presidential hopeful honored the scores of mostly immigrant women who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 \u2014 which occurred about a block from where Warren spoke Monday \u2014 and praised the women\u2019s trade unions that fought for change in the wake of the tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d Warren said, referring to the park\u2019s iconic arch looming behind her, which is named for President George Washington. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all. We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, 10-story building a block that way.\u201d Nearly 150 people \u2015 mostly Jewish and Italian female workers \u2015 died in March 1911 when the factory went up in flames and their bosses, fearing the employees might steal scraps of fabric, trapped them inside by locking the exit doors. \u201cIt was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history,\u201d Warren said. \u201cOne of the worst, but it should not have been a surprise.\u201d Working conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory were infamous, but the company\u2019s owners were wealthy, politically connected and corrupt, she said. \u201cThey made campaign contributions and talked with their friends in the legislature,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey greased the state government so thoroughly that nothing changed. Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price.\u201d \u201cDoes any of this sound familiar?\u201d she asked the crowd, which responded with an affirmative cheer. \u201cTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\u201d The Harvard law professor-turned-senator\u2019s rally in Manhattan is the culmination of a day filled with headline-generating announcements designed to cement her second-place standing in many early polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as the left\u2019s alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren unveiled a plan early Monday morning to combat Washington corruption that builds on legislation she introduced in August 2018 curbing, among other things, the influence of lobbyists. A few hours later, she received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a national progressive organization that backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 election cycle. At the rally, Warren also debuted the endorsements of two young, progressive New York state lawmakers, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who said that Warren would finish the fight against corruption that they were waging in New York\u2019s capital of Albany. Biaggi was part of a crop of six left-leaning Democrats who unseated a rogue faction of Democratic state senators aligned with the GOP who effectively kept the legislative chamber in Republican control. (Biaggi and Niou are part of a list of 14 New York City and state lawmakers who have endorsed Warren, according to the campaign.) Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, introduced Warren on stage before her speech, attesting to her potential appeal beyond the group of highly educated voters that polling suggests are her most ardent supporters. \u201cElizabeth Warren has proposed a whole host of solutions that meet the full scale of the crises we face ... Elizabeth Warren has a plan for it!\u201d he said. \u201cBut crucially, Sen. Warren realizes that you need more than plans; we need to meet this moment with a movement of working people.\u201d Warren\u2019s show of force Monday evening was seemingly aimed at showcasing her strength in progressive bastions that were once Sanders\u2019 exclusive stomping grounds. The Vermont senator drew massive crowds to a rally in the same park in April 2016, claiming some 27,000 people attended. Warren\u2019s campaign said more than 20,000 people attended her rally, making it her largest to date. A spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation told HuffPost that officials believe the park\u2019s capacity is 10,000, and that Warren\u2019s event had a permit for 8,000 to 10,000 people. The city said it could not corroborate Warren\u2019s crowd estimate. Sanders supporters often argue that their candidate is a more consistent and more effective champion of grassroots social movements than Warren, whose most famous campaign slogan \u2015 \u201cI got a plan\u201d \u2015 evokes a more technocratic approach than Sanders\u2019 \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d On Monday evening though, Warren also emphasized her commitment to building a grassroots movement capable of powering her plans to fruition. Warren turned the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory tale into a parable for inside-outside organizing \u2015 a term for policymaking that pairs mass mobilization with specialized legislative expertise and horse-trading. She described how one woman moved by the tragic spectacle of the fire was Frances Perkins, who went on to serve Franklin Delano Roosevelt as secretary of labor \u2015 both when he was governor of New York and later when he became president. Perkins is widely viewed as the architect of New York\u2019s first major labor reforms, as well as the social-democratic policies at the heart of the New Deal, including Social Security and a law establishing the first minimum wage. \u201cAs Frances Perkins put it: the Triangle Fire was \u2018the day the New Deal was born,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Warren went on to recount how the movements for the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s voting rights, labor rights, black civil rights and LGBTQ rights had all had to withstand skepticism of their power to effect change. But they persevered, she argued, just as Americans must now do to end corruption and restructure the economy. \u201cThey organized. They built a grassroots movement. They persisted,\u201d she said, referencing a famous complaint GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made about her. \u201cAnd they changed the course of American history.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign went the extra mile to paint her movement as an extension of Perkins\u2019 work. The podium from which she spoke was constructed by an all-female woodworking company run by a supporter using old barn wood from Perkins\u2019 historic home in Maine. Perkins\u2019 grandson,\u00a0Tomlin Perkins Coggeshall, procured the wood for the campaign and attended the rally. Some voters who supported Sanders in 2016 but showed up for Warren on Monday said they had gone with Sanders when it was a binary choice because they preferred him to Hillary Clinton. Astrid Clarke, a 49-year-old student and caregiver from Brooklyn\u2019s East New York neighborhood, thought Sanders was a better bet than Clinton in the general election last time. Now she \u201cloves\u201d Warren for her plans. \u201cI like the way it\u2019s people-centric and the way she can explain it so you know that it\u2019s hers,\u201d Clarke said. Other attendees said they had been Clinton supporters. One such Clinton supporter, Katie Carella, a 39-year-old children\u2019s publishing professional living in Manhattan, also emphasized Warren\u2019s \u201cplans.\u201d \u201cShe literally has a plan for everything,\u201d Carella said. \u201cI think we have to be asking for big structural changes in order to make any headway.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comments from Warren, and from a spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation.",

      "content": " For the third time in a row, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren pulled off a well-received debate performance, new polling finds. More broadly, the state of the 2020 campaign appears to remain much where it\u2019s stood since August: Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in the horse race polls, trailed by Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. A few other metrics suggest Warren may be positioned for further growth. And most primary voters remain very far from locked into a decision, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for things to change. Thirty-seven percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the debate last Thursday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, while just 9% said their opinions of her worsened. That\u2019s not as dramatic as her reception in the first and second debates, when half or more reported improved views, but it\u2019s still enough to place her ahead of her rivals this round. Three other candidates also saw their positive ratings for the debates significantly outstrip their negatives: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (31% had an improved view of him compared to 11% whose view worsened); former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (30% improved to 13% worsened) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (26% improved to 11% worsened). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 who aggressively challenged Biden onstage \u2015 saw the worst numbers (15% improved compared to 41% worsened), with the remaining candidates breaking more or less close to even. The standard\u00a0provisos about debate polling\u00a0remain\u00a0relevant here: Voters\u2019 preexisting opinions of the candidates help to shape their reactions; opinions remain fluid; and, of course, impressing voters in a debate doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into gaining even temporary ground in the horse race. Plenty of voters, as FiveThirtyEight notes, didn\u2019t even watch the debate. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only about 55% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they caught even clips of the event. Perhaps the clearest example of the debates affecting this race so far has been California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 brief surge following a strong initial performance, and her subsequent fall from the top tier of polling when she failed to match it in subsequent debates. By contrast, Sanders\u2019 poll numbers have remained basically stable since summer, while Warren\u2019s rise has appeared gradual and largely untethered to any specific incident. \u201cWe\u2019re practically raised to believe that debates impact election results in big ways. Millions watch, candidates spend countless hours preparing, media can\u2019t stop talking, and writing, about them.\u00a0And, after all, we\u2019re taught debates are the way we should be making voting decisions.\u00a0They\u2019ve just got to be game-changers,\u201d Democratic pollster Mark Mellman wrote. \u201cBut they\u2019re not ... Voters in the early states will get lots more direct exposure to the candidates through other mechanisms.\u201d To examine the broader state of the race beyond debate night, the new HuffPost/YouGov poll also asked voters to look over the full slate of Democratic candidates and pick whom they\u2019d be enthusiastic or upset to see nominated, and who they believe is capable of defeating President Donald Trump. Biden still holds a clear, if not overwhelming, lead on electability: A 66% majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters thinks the former vice president is capable of winning the general election, a recovery of nearly 10 points since this summer. A smaller 56% majority currently believes Warren can win, with half saying the same of Sanders. Fewer than one-third say the same of any of the other candidates. Warren, meanwhile, stands out on enthusiasm, with 48% saying they\u2019d be enthusiastic about having her as the Democratic nominee and only 9% saying they\u2019re upset by that prospect. The idea of a Biden nomination raises only slightly less excitement (41% would be enthusiastic) but higher discontent (25% would be upset); a hypothetical Sanders nomination leaves 39% enthusiastic and 17% upset. Although Warren has often looked particularly strong in YouGov\u2019s polling compared to other outlets, other recent polling shows similar results. FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos debate polling also gives Warren strong reviews for last week\u2019s debate. And in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this week, Warren led\u00a0both on enthusiasm and as the candidate with whom most primary voters would feel, at least, comfortable. Nearly all national polling that asks a straightforward horse race question \u2015 whom people would vote for if the election were today \u2015 shows Biden still ahead. But there\u2019s a significant variation on the exact size of Biden\u2019s lead, as well as whether Warren or Sanders now stands as his closest rival. One reason for that volatility is that the race remains exceptionally fluid. In\u00a0the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only 52% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they have even a good idea about whom they\u2019ll support, and in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 9% of Democratic primary voters said they\u2019d definitely made up their minds. There\u2019s still months until anyone starts voting, and things could change pretty quickly once they do. For now, \u201cundecided\u201d may still be the real front-runner.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the endorsement of the Working Families Party, one of the country\u2019s most influential progressive organizations. The decision came down to three main factors,\u00a0according to six people who participated in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process:\u00a0her more aggressive outreach to key decision-makers, her strong commitment to racial and gender equity, and the perception that she has broader national appeal. Warren \u201chas a long track record of working with our folks on issues from the foreclosure crisis to the sale of homes to Wall Street,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of the low-income activist group New York Communities for Change and one of two people who cast votes for Warren on behalf of the New York WFP state committee. \u201cA lot of it stems from how she has run her campaign. From the beginning, she centered racial inequality in her campaign. She went to Jackson, Mississippi, and talked to these issues head on. It was not an addendum.\u201d Since announcing its endorsement of Warren on Monday, the Working Families Party has been bombarded with complaints from Sanders supporters questioning whether the outcome of the vote reflected the views of WFP leaders \u2014 who they suspect put Warren over the top \u2014 or the group\u2019s more numerous dues-paying members and supporters. The votes of the former were represented by 56 delegates on the WFP\u2019s national committee, including Westin, and were weighted to make up half of the total endorsement vote. An estimated 10,000 of WFP\u2019s dues-paying members and other progressive activists who participated in the online ballot made up the other half. HuffPost spoke with Westin and five other WFP state and regional leaders whose votes in state-level plebiscites determined the way their national committee delegates voted. The goal of HuffPost\u2019s inquiry was not to assess the fairness of WFP\u2019s endorsement process, but to get a sense of why many delegates chose Warren. In addition to Westin, HuffPost spoke with Andrea Serrano, executive director of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, nonprofit Ol\u00e9; Stephanie Zucker, a WFP activist from near Morgantown, West Virginia; and three other New Yorkers: education activist Billy Easton, organized labor official Sandra Cuellar Oxford and fair housing advocate David Schwartz. Easton, Oxford and Schwartz cast votes that bound New York\u2019s delegates to Warren; Zucker and her fellow West Virginia WFP committee members voted to have their national delegates endorse Warren as well. Serrano would not say how the New Mexico WFP affiliate voted, but described what people who participated in the process found attractive in Warren\u2019s candidacy. As with the four other candidates the WFP considered endorsing, Sanders sat for a public, live-streamed endorsement interview, where he was questioned by WFP national organizing director Nelini Stamp and WFP activists. But Sanders did not participate in a later video conference call with WFP national delegates and members of the WFP\u2019s state committees.\u00a0On that call, presidential candidates could make their case for an endorsement directly to the people with a say in the matter. Warren and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro availed themselves of the opportunity; Sanders did not. \u201cIt was an opportunity for Bernie and his people to make their pitch. It\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d said Oxford, a WFP leader in upstate New York. Sanders\u2019 absence did not sway Oxford per se, who cited other reasons for her vote for Warren. But for other WFP leaders, it reflected Warren\u2019s greater affinity for the political art of courting allies, an activity that critics and supporters alike say Sanders has been less invested in over the course of his career. \u201cThis is the thing about Warren, you see it in her selfie lines: She\u2019ll put in all of the work to try and connect with a voter, to try and secure an endorsement \u2015 like she was trying to do in the WFP process \u2015 and to make her case,\u201d said Westin, who voted for Sanders in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process for the 2016 election cycle. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s actually a quality that we need in terms of somebody who is going to beat Trump.\u201d Prior to the endorsement process, Warren had likewise exhibited a knack for politicking that was unmatched by Sanders. A week before the WFP revealed the results of its endorsement process, she endorsed Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate for one of two at-large Philadelphia city council seats that are effectively reserved for non-Democrats, and currently occupied by Republicans. Warren also endorsed Stephen Smith, the WFP-backed progressive running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in West Virginia. Sanders, whose political director Analilia Mejia previously ran the New Jersey Working Families Party, could have one-upped Warren by endorsing both Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, the second WFP candidate for Philadelphia city council. Instead, he endorsed neither of them. \u201cSupporting progressive Black and other women of color for office is always a positive thing,\u201d Serrano said. The Sanders campaign did not immediately provide an explanation for Sanders\u2019 decisions not to participate in the video conference call, or endorse in the Philadelphia city council races. Sanders has worked hard to dispel the perception, formed during his 2016 presidential run, that he is insufficiently committed to addressing injustices like racism and sexism on their own terms, rather than strictly as manifestations of economic inequality. He hired a more diverse contingent of senior campaign staff; featured race more prominently in his stump speech; took pains to court influential Black leaders in early primary states like South Carolina; and produced, among other things, a far-reaching criminal justice reform platform that seeks to redress racist practices. But several of the WFP leaders who spoke to HuffPost still consider Warren to be more genuinely committed to combating racial inequity, in particular, as a form of injustice that must be addressed independent of structural economic problems. Warren\u2019s remarks in Detroit in July about countering the effects of historic housing discrimination in Black neighborhoods stood out to Easton, who runs the Alliance for Quality Education in Albany, New York,\u00a0and considers racial justice the most important issue in the race. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a white candidate for major office be crystal clear and direct and so effective, breaking down the concept in a way people can understand,\u201d he said. Serrano argued that, by contrast, Sanders\u2019 attempts to broaden his message outward from the economy had been inadequate. \u201cIt is not OK to separate class from race and gender \u2026 People have tried to say, \u2018Do better on this subject,\u2019 and it just doesn\u2019t seem to last,\u201d she said. Conversely, some of the WFP stakeholders cited Warren\u2019s identification as a capitalist seeking to put a check on the economic system\u2019s most oppressive features, rather than replace it, as both more in line with their own thinking, and evidence of her broader national appeal. Zucker, who is a part owner of her family\u2019s veterinary hospital, described Warren\u2019s vision as \u201ccapitalism with a conscience\u201d and said she shares that view. \u201cI\u2019m fully in support of [Sanders\u2019] policies in the vast majority of areas. But I think Elizabeth Warren is doing a better job of communicating what I believe is their shared vision of a just economy.\u201d Others spoke more generally about what they see as Warren\u2019s success expanding beyond a core group of left-wing supporters. \u201cI really feel that Elizabeth Warren would have a better shot at unifying the left and the center. We can\u2019t just think we\u2019re going to go as far left as we can and bring the center along with us,\u201d Oxford said. \u201cI feel that Elizabeth has been somewhat more conciliatory and offered a larger tent to those who definitely won\u2019t vote for Bernie.\u201d Sanders supporters point to polling that has shown higher levels of support\u00a0for Sanders than Warren among working-class voters and, until recently, Black voters, as evidence that he is better equipped to build a winning, national coalition. But Warren\u2019s supporters in the WFP believe that her base of support will continue to diversify as more Americans pay attention to the primary race. \u201cMy membership is low-income people of color and my membership absolutely loves Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Westin said. \u201c[Former vice president] Joe Biden and Bernie have been big names for years. People are just tuning into the race.\u201d Given the complexity of the WFP\u2019s endorsement process, it is not surprising that it has generated some skepticism. Sanders partisans \u2014 acting with some encouragement from the Sanders campaign \u2014 have urged the WFP to release a breakdown of the vote that would show whether Warren won the endorsement thanks to the national delegates or had enough support to win among the dues-paying members and associated activists who voted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they want to release it?\u201d wrote Matt Bruenig, a founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a left-wing think tank. \u201cYou hate to speculate about such things, but the only answer is because the member votes went for Sanders while the leadership votes went for Warren, and the organization is embarrassed to reveal the degree to which the leadership overruled the membership.\u201d The WFP says it is refusing to release the figures because to do so would create an artificial division in the status of different voters, when all of the votes cast are equally legitimate. In some cases, the distinctions might be hazy anyway. Schwartz, Zucker and Easton all voted in the online general membership ballot in addition to casting their state committee votes. More broadly, the WFP defends its practice of granting its most committed activists and partner organizations an outsize say in its endorsement, particularly given the grassroots constituencies they each represent. By contrast, an assortment of sympathetic progressives who were not previously involved in WFP were free to participate in the larger membership vote if they affirmed the WFP\u2019s values through the completion of an online form by Sept. 6. Some Sanders supporters mobilized people to participate on Reddit. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee leveraged its considerable email list to encourage its activists to cast votes for Warren. The WFP also noted that in the 2016 endorsement process, the votes of national delegates were weighted to make up 87.5% of the total vote share \u2015 far more than in the 2020 endorsement process. Those national delegates represented a group of WFP stakeholders that was less diverse and more conservative, including a number of labor unions that departed the organization in 2018 in protest of its endorsement of Cynthia Nixon\u2019s candidacy\u00a0for New York governor. The WFP only ended up endorsing Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, over many of those stakeholders\u2019 protestations, because 87% of the dues-paying members and other activists \u2014 who got the remaining one-eighth of the vote not held by national leaders \u2014 backed Sanders. Part of Bruenig\u2019s argument for the WFP to release the breakdown of its vote, is precisely that the organization released a breakdown of Sanders\u2019 share of the non-leadership vote when it announced its endorsement in Dec. 2015. But the WFP released the figure in the 2016 election cycle as a show of force for Sanders amid deep skepticism from within the WFP\u2019s national stakeholders. The fury expressed by many Sanders supporters toward the WFP endorsement reflects the realization of socialists who got involved in politics thanks to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign that they are not as closely aligned with the national WFP as they previously thought. In New York City in particular, members of the Democratic Socialists of America have worked closely with the WFP. New York City DSA, which endorsed Nixon at the WFP\u2019s urging over the objections of many of its members, provided an essential army of door knockers for her ultimately unsuccessful campaign. But while there is considerable overlap, DSA members are more uniformly socialist in their political outlook than the average WFP activist. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is the most conservative presidential contender for whom they are willing to consider mobilizing their membership to support. For example, Sanders has been far more consistent and emphatic than Warren in his support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which is perhaps the single highest policy priority of DSA members. \u201cThe split is between people who came into politics long before 2016 and have been doing progressive politics as a profession for a long time, and the movement that was sparked by the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Michael Kinnucan, a member of the NYC DSA. \u201cHis campaign got thousands of people involved in American politics at the rank-and-file level, in DSA and elsewhere, and that movement has begun to reshape American politics. Those folks do feel betrayed that the power and potential of that movement is not recognized by some people in the Working Families Party.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The attempt to pile on Elizabeth Warren has begun. The senator from Massachusetts, who has firmly joined Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential field\u2019s top tier, has faced a barrage of critiques in recent days from campaigns who often claim she has received a free pass from the media. Many of these attacks happen without ever mentioning Warren\u2019s name. Candidates \u2015 including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana \u2015 often talk about how Democrats need to have more than Warren\u2019s signature policy plans in order to win. A staffer for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) suggested Warren hadn\u2019t done enough to help Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms. (She donated $11 million to other candidates and progressive causes.) Others have been more direct: The always-colorful, oft-quoted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, attacked Warren as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for touting her decision not to hold high-dollar fundraisers after holding them in the past. But the attacks that could land the most damage focus on Warren\u2019s trustworthiness on health care, the No. 1\u00a0issue for voters in both the Democratic primary and in the general election, according to polling. Though Warren has rolled her out own detailed policy plans on everything from gun control to child care to rural economic development, she is the only leading candidate to avoid releasing her own health care plan, instead endorsing Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation while saying she remains open to alternatives. The position has left her vulnerable to attacks from Sanders supporters as well as from opponents of Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance and require the government to pay for Americans\u2019 health coverage. Warren\u2019s steady rise in the Democratic primary has come, in large part, from her ability to appeal to both the party\u2019s mainstream and left-wing branches, but health care is an issue that could turn chunks of both groups against her and undercut her central image as a candidate with a brilliant idea for every problem. \u201cI support Medicare for All. I think it\u2019s a good plan,\u201d Warren told CBS after the Sept. 12 Democratic debate in Houston when asked if she would roll out her own health care plan. But she quickly added: \u201cI support a lot of plans, other things that people have come up with it. When they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I got to think of mine first.\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d Buttigieg, appearing on CNN on Thursday, noted that Warren has avoided explicitly stating if she would support higher taxes on middle-income earners of the kind needed to fund a single-payer system. Two days earlier, during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert was unable to pin Warren down on the need for higher taxes to fund Medicare for All. Warren instead stuck to her formulation that under her plan net\u00a0\u201ccosts\u201d would go down\u00a0for the vast majority of Americans because of the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said of Warren\u2019s refusal to directly answer Colbert\u2019s questions. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it\u2019s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms.\u201d (Buttigieg, who rolled out his own health care plan on Thursday, has said only that he would fund an expansion of health care coverage by closing corporate tax loopholes, without further details.) Biden echoed this line of attack during a Friday event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggesting Warren and Sanders were hiding the effect of Medicare for All. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d he told a voter who questioned why he wasn\u2019t supporting Medicare for All. Buttigieg, along with Biden and other moderate Democrats, has long argued that Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s stated preference for Medicare for All is politically unwise and would cause chaos for tens of millions of Americans with private health insurance. But the recent attacks have focused squarely on the question of tax increases. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally dishonest, because for people\u2019s pocketbooks, Medicare for All will be a tax decrease, and the people saying this know that,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a prominent Warren backer. \u201cIt\u2019s an insurance company and Republican talking point.\u201d Green also claimed Warren\u2019s \u201crefusal to take the bait\u201d was helping her with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans will inevitably make unfair attacks in the general election. We can\u2019t live in fear of that. But we don\u2019t need to give them Democratic validators.\u201d Warren is a relatively recent convert to single-payer, signing on to Sanders\u2019 legislation only in September 2017. Since then, she has continued to work on interim fixes to the private health insurance system. In March 2018, she backed legislation \u2015 co-sponsored by Sanders \u2015 designed to tighten regulations on private insurers and keep them in the Affordable Care Act exchanges. When she first began running for president, she discussed protecting Medicaid more than pushing for single-payer. But at the first Democratic debate on June 27, she made her stance clear: She was\u00a0\u201cwith Bernie on Medicare for All,\u201d including the elimination of private health insurance. Warren reiterated her stance in the two subsequent debates and an interview released earlier this month with dying progressive activist Ady Barkan. Barkan, who has his used his struggles with ALS to help illustrate the need for single-payer health care, specifically pressed her to explain her greater reluctance on the topic closer to the start of her campaign. \u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those,\u201d Warren told Barkan. \u201cSo the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d One advantage for Warren is that the National Nurses United union, a major institutional backer of Medicare for All that endorsed Sanders in the 2016 cycle, has not yet endorsed in the 2020 presidential primary. Asked whether the union considered Warren\u2019s stance adequate, NNU spokesperson Chuck Idelson would not respond directly, instead saying that if the union decides to endorse in the race, it will \u201ccertainly explain\u201d how the endorsement is \u201cconsonant\u201d with its priorities. But Warren\u2019s remarks have failed to assuage left-wing Sanders supporters \u2015 many of whom are associated with the Democratic Socialists of America or Jacobin magazine \u2015\u00a0 who don\u2019t think they can count on her to enact a policy they believe is the bedrock of a robust, contemporary welfare state. They point to small signals from Warren \u2015 her failure to give the plan a prominent place on her campaign website or to give it more than a passing mention in most of her speeches \u2015 as reasons to be skeptical. Natalie Shure, a leading Medicare for All advocate and dues-paying member of the Boston chapter of the DSA, argued Thursday on the popular left-wing YouTube show\u00a0\u201cThe Majority Report\u201d that Warren was not willing to \u201cfight tooth and nail for a robust, single-payer, Medicare for All health care system.\u201d In a follow-up interview with HuffPost, Shure said that Warren\u2019s unwillingness to explicitly embrace the need for middle-class tax hikes to fund Medicare for All is emblematic of her tepidness on the matter. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Shure said. That\u2019s a distinction from Sanders, who has staked his presidential run on the ability to galvanize a social movement \u2015 a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2015 capable of at least generating momentum behind Medicare for All, according to Shure. \u201cShe looks at her role differently than a Sanders presidency would look at his role,\u201d Shure said. \u201cHe would lead a movement to get it, which I think is necessary for anyone who wants it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d veto it if it came to her desk. She might even whip votes for it. But I don\u2019t think she is going to reach outside of electoral politics for it.\u201d Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Sanders stalwart who carried the single-payer bill in the House, put it more gently. Warren \u201chasn\u2019t eased up on it. She hasn\u2019t wavered, gotten weak in the knees,\u201d he said, referring to Warren\u2019s recent remarks affirming her support for the policy. \u201cBut I think it means something that Bernie carried the bill, wrote the bill and has been fighting for it even before it was a popular thing.\u201d",

      "content": " Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was impassioned, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg got personal and former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden was on the defensive at one point during an Iowa forum where 10 Democratic presidential contenders addressed LGBTQ issues Friday. Warren began her presentation with a moving tribute to 8 trans women of color who have been killed so far this year. She read each of their names. \u201cIt is time for a president of the United States of America to say their names,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe cost of inequality for trans people, particularly trans women of color, has now reached a moment of crisis, and it is time for everyone in America to speak out on this issue,\u201d she said. Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0of New Jersey said it\u2019s \u201cabout time we had a woke president\u201d on LGBTQ issues. He noted that when he was mayor of Newark he refused to officiate at any wedding until same-sex marriages were allowed. Quoting Martin Luther King Jr., Booker said, \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d Biden, meanwhile, had to fend off sharp questioning from Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist Lyz Lenz about his opposition in the 1990s to same-sex marriage \u2014 as well as the law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman and his support for the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy for gays in the military. Biden said he was the \u201cfirst person nationally\u201d to come out for same-sex marriage when he did so on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 2012. At one point he quipped to Lenz: \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d to which she responded: \u201cJust askin\u2019 the questions that people want to know.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0of California was grilled about her defense, as California\u2019s former attorney general, of a law that denied gender affirmation surgery for trans prison inmates. Harris said she got the policy changed by working \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d \u201cMy entire career I have been a proud ally\u201d of the LBGTQ community, she said. \u201cBack when some Democrats were talking about civil unions, I was performing marriages in 2004 at San Francisco City Hall. ... You have my commitment ... I will be always loud, proud and strong as an ally as we continue with our movement.\u201d Buttigieg, the sole openly gay candidate, said that to him \u201call politics is personal.\u201d He recalled serving in the military under don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell when sexual preference had to be hidden. \u201cI also remember the weight lifted when that was no longer a threat to my career,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet we know that so many Americans are still finding that they are treated as less-than, including trans military members right now who are willing to put their lives on the line for this country.\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0of Hawaii, who has apologized for anti-gay comments she made in the past, said her record fighting for equal rights \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d She also said she has trusted her life while serving in the military to LGBTQ service members. The candidates were united on several issues, including vowing to repeal President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the military and supporting the anti-discrimination Equality Act. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0of Minnesota and Marianne Williamson also spoke at the forum, which was sponsored by GLAAD, One Iowa, The Advocate and The Gazette. A second forum on LGBTQ issues, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month. The entire forum can be seen in the video at the top.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) closed the gap of support between her and former Vice President Joe Biden as the top contender for the presidential nomination in Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses, the first state in the country to vote in the race, according to the latest results of a key\u00a0poll in Iowa released Saturday night. In the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll, Warren was the first-choice candidate with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucus attendees \u2015 up 7 percentage points since the last poll in June. Biden, who has maintained a slight edge over his opponents in other polling, fell 3 percentage points, bringing him to second place with 20% of their support. According to the Register, support for Biden has fallen in the Iowa polls since last year. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is also running for the Democratic nomination, fell far behind both Warren and Biden in the Saturday\u2019s poll, taking third place at 11% \u2015 down 5 percentage points since June. All the other Democratic 2020 candidates polled in the single digits. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) rounded out the top five candidates, polling at 9% and 6% respectively. Despite Warren\u2019s and Biden\u2019s lead, there\u2019s still room for other contenders to crawl back up before the Iowa Democratic caucuses in February. Sixty-three percent of likely caucusgoers said in the poll that they hadn\u2019t fully made up their minds yet on their most favored candidates. Ann Selzer, the most respected pollster in the state, conducted the poll on 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers between Sept. 14 and Sept. 18. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Earlier Saturday, all of the 2020 Democratic candidates came together for an annual Steak Fry fundraiser for the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article referred to Bernie Sanders as a Democratic senator from Vermont. Sanders was elected as an independent, though he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.",

      "content": " Conservative commentator George Will wants President Donald Trump out of the picture, even if that means a Democrat wins next year\u2019s presidential election. Asked by the Daily Beast if conservatives would be better served by a Trump defeat, Will replied: \u201cYes, yes and yes. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d He also said such an outcome would lead to a battle for new ideas on the right. \u201cBut first, we have to clear the ground and remove this awful presence from our lives,\u201d he said. Will left the Republican Party in 2016 rather than support Trump, arguing at the time that the best thing for the conservative movement would\u2019ve been a landslide victory by Hillary Clinton.\u00a0He has only grown more critical of Trump and the Republican Party since then. \u201cIt\u2019s become a cult \u2015 it\u2019s become a cult because of an absence of ideas,\u201d Will said on MSNBC in June. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve jettisoned the ideas.\u201d In another interview over the summer, he warned the GOP that young voters now consider Republicans to be \u201cthe dumb party.\u201d In his latest comments to the Daily Beast, Will offered a compliment to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a potential 2020 Trump rival who is politically the opposite of Will. \u201cWhat makes Elizabeth Warren interesting and admirable is not that she\u2019s right \u2013 I think she\u2019s wrong about almost everything \u2013 but that she brings gravity to politics,\u201d he said, adding: I think it\u2019s still an open question of whether Republicans will bring ideas back to politics after we decide that we can\u2019t properly reduce political philosophy to, \u2018Only I can fix it.\u2019 That last quote was a paraphrase of a line in Trump\u2019s 2016 acceptance speech.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is set to begin a major advertising blitz, spending at least $10 million in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary. The campaign also plans to begin hiring staff in primary states that vote in March, including on all-important Super Tuesday. Building operations in the March states is crucial \u2015 three-fifths of the Democratic delegates will be awarded by the end of 2020\u2019s third month. The new spending, announced in a memo to supporters from campaign manager Roger Lau, shows how Warren plans to continue the momentum that\u2019s elevated her into the top tier of primary contenders, alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. The size of the advertising buy also highlights how Warren has been able to continue raising gobs of cash after deciding to stop attending high-dollar fundraising. \u201cOur biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,\u201d Lau wrote in his email. \u201cBecause we\u2019re 100% grassroots funded, we\u2019ve built our team to spend your dollars as effectively as possible to help deliver victory.\u201d Lau said the ad buy will mostly be on digital platforms rather than traditional broadcast television, and the campaign will produce the ads in-house rather than using a traditional media consultant. \u201cTake any of our big problems: Health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won\u2019t act,\u201d Warren says in a 15-second ad as President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Paul Ryan appear onscreen. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I know what\u2019s wrong, I know how to fix it and I\u2019ll fight to get it done.\u201d The Warren campaign also released a 60-second ad highlighting her roots in Oklahoma and the hollowing out of the American middle class, and a 30-second ad highlighting her work to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeat former GOP Sen. Scott Brown. \u201cLeave it to a liberal professor to highlight a speech she gave at a liberal university in the heart of liberal New York City,\u201d Republican National Committee Communications Director Michael Ahrens said, referring to the 60-second ad that uses footage from her Sept. 17 rally. \u201cWarren may have plans, but they would decimate millions of middle class jobs and eliminate health plans for 200 million Americans.\u201d Lau provided fewer details on the campaign\u2019s staffing plans in the March states, but highlights Illinois, California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida as places where it will make investments. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d he wrote. Warren has been steadily rising in the polls and attracting massive crowds to her rallies. She\u2019s eschewed exclusive fundraisers with wealthy donors generally favored by presidential candidates as a way to amass campaign cash, instead relying on grassroots outreach \u2015 more than 1 million donations from all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Warren has become known for her personal outreach to supporters. She calls donors out of the blue to thank them for their contribution, and stays for hours after campaign events to take selfies with people. Lau estimates that she has done more than 60,000 selfies and taken more than 600 unfiltered questions at 134 town halls in 27 states and Puerto Rico.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " As Sunday turned to Monday, Briahna Gray, national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, posted a series of criticisms of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Twitter. Gray began with subtlety, highlighting a speech the Vermont senator gave on the House floor in the 1990s in support of gay military veterans and service members. And, in what appeared to be a subtweet at Warren, she noted that Sanders delivered the speech at a time when \u201cyour fave was still \u2018evolving\u2019 (read \u2018triangulating\u2019) on gay rights.\u201d (In a follow-up conversation, Gray would not say to whom she was referring when she said \u201cfave.\u201d Warren supported same-sex marriage during her first Senate run in 2012, prior to former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cevolution.\u201d) Next, Gray noted that under Sanders\u2019 pro-union legislation, Warren\u2019s campaign would be forced into mediation for failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement so many months after recognizing its campaign staff\u2019s union. Finally, in a post shortly after midnight, Gray slammed Warren\u2019s refusal to endorse a national rent control law, echoing a critique voiced earlier in the weekend by left-wing activists. She suggested that it contradicted Warren\u2019s self-described can-do attitude toward other ambitious policies. Gray\u2019s comments in themselves were not out of the ordinary. Sanders campaign aides are notoriously feisty and independent on social media \u2015 a marked contrast with the boringly disciplined etiquette of other campaigns\u2019 staffers. But when HuffPost reached out on Monday to clarify whether Gray\u2019s remarks were part of a shift toward more explicit confrontation with Warren, the campaign directed HuffPost to Gray, who stood by her remarks. \u201cPrimary campaigns are about drawing contrasts between candidates so that voters can make an informed choice between them,\u201d Gray said in a statement. Sanders and Warren reportedly struck a non-aggression pact in December prior to launching their respective campaigns. The much-vaunted d\u00e9tente survived two nationally televised debates in which the two contenders shared a stage. They eschewed the moderators\u2019 efforts to drive a wedge between them in favor of teaming up against moderate rivals. Even in the course of a conversation about this article, the Sanders campaign wanted to emphasize his high regard for Warren. \u201cSen. Sanders respects Sen. Warren and values his friendship with her,\u201d Mike Casca, a senior communications adviser for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve been longtime allies in fighting to improve the lives of working Americans.\u201d But though Sanders himself has yet to criticize Warren, his aides and surrogates have been taking gradually bolder shots at the Massachusetts senator. The non-aggression pact is fraying. Gray\u2019s remarks follow more implicit steps in this direction by other Sanders lieutenants. Amid left-wing uproar over the Working Families Party\u2019s endorsement of Warren, top Sanders spokesman Mike Casca gave his blessing to calls for the WFP to release a breakdown of its endorsement vote that would show whether the group\u2019s national delegates overrode the will of pro-Sanders dues-paying members and activists. The following day, when Sanders received his millionth donor, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir noted that Sanders is the only candidate to rule out high-dollar private fundraisers for the primary as well as the general election. The observation was a veiled ding at Warren, who has said that in the interest of defeating President Donald Trump, she would resume courting wealthy donors during the general election. Just a few weeks ago, HuffPost reported that the Sanders campaign saw supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden as riper targets for persuasion. The campaign had a custom-made text message response for Biden backers, but only a generic one for voters leaning toward other candidates. But Warren\u2019s rise, reflected in everything from the WFP endorsement to new polling showing her winning more of Sanders\u2019 2016 voters than Sanders himself, has raised the specter of her supplanting Sanders as the go-to progressive alternative to Biden. The campaign aides\u2019 jabs at Warren, however tame and haphazard, provide an official imprimatur to a broader argument that Sanders surrogates and partisans have been making more openly for some time: that Warren\u2019s progressive bona fides are questionable and that she is a flawed general election candidate. Below is a summary and explanation of their various claims against her. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. The most recent pile-on against Warren kicked into gear over the weekend when she addressed the Iowa Center for Community Improvement Action Fund\u2019s candidate forum in Des Moines, Iowa. An activist pressed Warren on whether she would back national rent control legislation, which would cap annual rent increases across the country. Warren said that she would fight to ensure that localities are free from state laws that prevent them from pursuing rent control on their own, but would not back a national rent control law. \u201cWriting a rent control plan in Washington may work for Chicago, but it\u2019s not gonna work for Iowa City or it may not work for Dallas,\u201d she said. Warren introduced an affordable housing bill in March that would allot\u00a0$10 billion in grants that cities and regions could compete for, provided that they end restrictive land-use policies.\u00a0It would also give cities that enact tenant protections like rent control opportunities for additional cash. \u201cMy administration will also take whatever legal steps it can to stop states from preempting local efforts to enact tenant protection laws,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post outlining her housing plans. Warren would also invest $500 billion in building or restoring affordable housing \u2015 a figure she pays for by restoring the estate tax to its 2009 level. And she wants to create a home-buying assistance program for first-time buyers in historically redlined neighborhoods to narrow the Black-white wealth gap. Sanders, by contrast, would cap all annual rent increases at the higher of either 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation. Cities would be able to go further and landlords could apply for exemptions from the rule if they make major capital investments in a property. For some left-wing activists, particularly those living in expensive cities, making rent control \u201cuniversal\u201d \u2015 or at least expanding it \u2015 has become a priority nearly as urgent as achieving single-payer health care. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who volunteered for Sanders in 2016, introduced a rent control bill on Wednesday that also caps rent hikes at 3%. As a result, a video of Warren\u2019s exchange with the activist in Iowa posted by California-based labor organizer Brett Banditelli sparked biting criticism of Warren on social media. For example, Cea Weaver, who helped pass New York state\u2019s new rent regulations, suggested that Warren\u2019s lack of interest in national rent control reflected an elitist reliance on economic orthodoxy. Gray, the Sanders campaign aide, embedded Banditelli\u2019s video in her critical tweet as well. \u201cBernie says yes to [national] rent control [because] we can, we should, & we must,\u201d she wrote. Analilia Mejia, the Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, also highlighted the contrast between the two candidates\u2019 platforms on Twitter. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a comparison,\u201d she wrote. Beginning with the first Democratic presidential debate in June, Warren has repeatedly affirmed her support for Sanders\u2019 single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care legislation. When pressed about the bill\u2019s prohibition on all but very limited forms of private health insurance \u2015 a provision that has stirred the most political jitters \u2015 Warren has endorsed it time and again. Two presidential rivals, Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have, by comparison, backed away from Sanders\u2019 bill despite co-sponsoring it in the Senate. But some Sanders partisans note that Warren, a recent convert to the Medicare for All cause, still has not made it a major feature of her stump speech. She barely mentions the policy unless she is asked about it, and she has refused to explicitly say she would back middle-class taxes to pay for it. That has raised fears that Warren would not fight for it once in office, which Medicare for All proponents consider a prerequisite for its eventual passage. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Natalie Shure, a member of the Boston chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, told HuffPost. During a campaign event Wednesday in New Hampshire, Warren sparked a new round of skepticism when she described Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, which she has co-sponsored, as a \u201cframework.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got in Medicare for All is a framework, and it doesn\u2019t have the details, and you\u2019re right to be asking, but the most important part of your asking is to raise awareness so we get this right as we go through it,\u201d Warren said. The remark prompted a swipe from Sanders\u2019 senior adviser Warren Gunnels, who disputed Warren\u2019s word choice on Twitter. Medicare for All \u201cisn\u2019t a framework. It\u2019s a 100-page bill,\u201d he wrote. Bernie World skepticism of Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All is rooted in a broader suspicion of her more recent arrival at stances Sanders has held for decades. They argue that she is less trustworthy in general because she has admitted to being a registered Republican until the mid-1990s.\u00a0(Her research into the struggles of families declaring bankruptcy prompted her to leave the GOP, according to Warren.) Susan Sarandon, an Oscar-winning actor and prominent Sanders campaign surrogate, caused a stir in August when she took a veiled swipe at Warren while introducing Sanders at a campaign event in Iowa. Sanders, she said, \u201cis not someone who used to be a Republican. He is not someone who used to take money \u2014 or still takes money \u2014 from Wall Street. He is the real deal.\u201d Sarandon\u2019s remarks about taking money from Wall Street might refer to Warren\u2019s courtship of wealthy donors, including some from the financial world, during her 2018 Senate reelection campaign. She transferred over $10 million left over from that campaign to her presidential run before announcing that she would shun the fundraisers during the Democratic primary. (Warren\u2019s campaign has noted that big-ticket fundraisers accounted for only one-quarter of her total haul in 2017 and 2018.) John Cusack, another actor backing Sanders, introduced him at a rally on Tuesday in Chicago with members of several of the city\u2019s public-sector labor unions. He has echoed Sarandon\u2019s attacks on Warren\u2019s Republican past. \u201cNo ones [sic] been more consistent then [sic] Bernie for justice,\u201d he tweeted on Monday night. \u201cWarren was a republican as an adult -\u00a0 glad she figured out supply side economics was a hustle - but come on.\u201d In addition to their policy and ideology-based arguments that Warren is not radical enough, prominent Sanders supporters are also claiming that she is less competitive against Trump in a general election. The argument is twofold: First, they point to Warren\u2019s style on the stump and lower rates of support among Democrats without a college degree as evidence that she would have difficulty in a general election. Sanders had a narrow edge among voters with less than a college degree in an August poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, while Warren had a commanding lead over him among voters with advanced degrees. (Biden held the lead for voters at every education level except those with advanced degrees.) Krystal Ball, a co-host of Hill TV\u2019s digital show \u201cRising,\u201d made the case on Monday that Warren\u2019s appeal is stronger among more educated and successful Democrats because her focus on \u201cplans\u201d appeals to their meritocratic faith in common-sense problem-solving. Warren\u2019s failure to resonate with working-class voters despondent in the country\u2019s institutions make Ball \u201cterrified\u201d that Warren will lose to Trump, the pro-Sanders commentator said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got a plan for that\u2019 is like a magical elixir to\u201d highly educated Democrats, Ball said. \u201cIt says, \u2018The experts have been consulted, the white paper has been drafted. We the ascenders of the meritocracy will decide what is to be done about these poor, struggling denizens of the working class.\u2019\u201d Ball\u2019s characterization of Warren is not entirely accurate. She regularly denounces the political and economic system for being \u201crigged\u201d in favor of the super-rich, and has lionized grassroots movements like the one that emerged from the tragic fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911 as models for the kind of structural change she hopes to usher in. And some analysts have noted that newcomers tend to fare worse among working-class voters at the start of primary contests, because those voters follow the news less consistently. When those candidates go on to win their party\u2019s presidential nomination and the general election though, working-class voters have tended to come along. Former President Barack Obama, for example, trailed Hillary Clinton with white working-class voters for much of the primary, but thanks to a populist message, ultimately won enough of their votes to prevail twice in states like Ohio. The second line of attack that Sanders supporters raise against Warren is their objection to her past identification as a Native American in various informal legal settings. Warren has apologized for producing a DNA test in October that showed she likely had traces of Cherokee heritage. She has also affirmed that she is not a person of color. But for some Sanders supporters, who appear to consider the dustup an electoral liability, Warren\u2019s apology is not enough. In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Josh Fox, an anti-fracking activist and filmmaker backing Sanders, said Warren\u2019s identification as Native American \u201cwhen she was actually a descendent of colonialists is a huge self-inflicted mistake.\u201d Fox went on to incorrectly assert that Warren had not even apologized. (In fact, she has apologized for the DNA test, as well as identifying as Native American in various professional legal listings.) \u201cWhy isn\u2019t owning a mistake like this possible? I think it would make her more sympathetic and more human to be honest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf she just said- \u2018hey I was wrong about this, and I am being bullied by Donald Trump and etc.\u2019\u201d This piece has been updated with more information about Warren\u2019s proposed affordable housing bill.",

      "content": " Jonathan Van Ness\u00a0has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the 2020 Democratic primary. The 32-year-old revealed his HIV-positive status in a New York Times profile last week, ahead of the Sept. 24 release of his memoir. Then, during an interview\u00a0Wednesday, Van Ness told Build Series that he realized he had a \u201csignificant role to play\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to support people living with HIV after publicly sharing his status. (Both Build Series and HuffPost are a part of Verizon Media.) \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren for president,\u201d the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star said. He revealed that his support for her was cemented after a difficult experience seeking medication last month. Van Ness said he misplaced his daily HIV medication while he was traveling between New York and Philadelphia. \u201cI just was not thinking, so I left my medicine in New York City and I got to Philly and realized I didn\u2019t have my medication,\u201d he said. He visited a pharmacy late at night and, after dealing with his insurance company, had to pay $3,500 for the prescription. He was frustrated, both by the inconvenience of being unable to simply get a single replacement pill, and by the high cost, which he would have been unable to afford three years ago. \u201cHow the fuck do I have $3,500 sitting around in my fucking checking account?\u201d Van Ness added, noting three years ago \u2014 before he appeared on \u201cQueer Eye\u201d \u2014 his financial situation was much different. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that skipping dosages could give \u201cHIV the chance to multiply rapidly,\u201d which could weaken the immune system, and goes on to say that in most cases individuals who miss a dose can \u201ctake the medicines as soon as you can ... (unless your pharmacist or health care provider has told you something different).\u201d On Wednesday, Van Ness tweeted about his support for Warren, writing that health care \u201cshouldn\u2019t be for profit, ever, it\u2019s a human right.\u201d Van Ness then tweeted a video of a phone call he had with Warren, in which he describes how impressed he was with her remarks on health care at the Democratic debate on Sept. 12, where the candidate also discussed high\u00a0prescription drug costs. Warren supports the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal\u00a0introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which would provide all Americans health care through the government. She has received some criticism for not releasing her own health care plan and, when\u00a0asked after the debate if\u00a0she is going to, Warren said, \u201cI support Medicare for All, I think it\u2019s a good plan. ... Other things that people have come up with, when they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I gotta think of mine first,\u2019 it\u2019s what best for the American people.\u201d In his Build Series interview, Van Ness addressed the dangers of HIV stigmatization, noting that there\u2019s \u201cso much more work to be done.\u201d He said he reads stories of people \u201cdying from HIV/AIDS-related deaths all over the world, due to lack of treatment, stigmatization, no access to facilities...\u201d \u201cIf I was in one of those places, the person that people love so much, the ball of sunshine ... If I was born 20 years before I was born there\u2019s a really good chance that I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Rep. Katie Porter is in a bit of an awkward spot. The California Democrat, a protege and former student of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has yet to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary \u2015 even as Warren has emerged as a leading candidate in the race, drawing ever-larger crowds on the campaign trail and beating out former Vice President Joe Biden in recent polls. One reason for Porter\u2019s reluctance could be that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is still very much in the race. Porter shares a history with Harris, too: As attorney general of California, Harris appointed Porter to be the state\u2019s independent monitor of banks, and Porter has spoken of Harris as another mentor in her political rise. Harris has more to gain from Porter\u2019s endorsement, given her plunge in the polls over the last month, including surveys conducted of Democratic voters in California. In the latest University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies poll of the state, Warren led the field with 29% of likely Democratic primary voters. Harris trailed with just 8%. Even as Porter has stayed neutral, other California Democrats have gotten off the sidelines and backed various candidates in the presidential primary. \u201cI adore Elizabeth and Kamala,\u201d Porter told HuffPost recently. \u201cI think either of them would be terrific presidents. I\u2019m very enthusiastic and supportive of both of them, and that\u2019s where it stands.\u201d Spokespersons for both the Warren and Harris campaigns did not respond to a request for comment. Porter received endorsements from both senators in her long-shot 2018 bid for Congress in the heart of Orange County, California, which was once a conservative bastion before Donald Trump came along. In Congress, Porter teamed up with both senators to tackle issues touching on consumer protections and corporate malfeasance. A bicameral bill she co-sponsored with Warren and other senators sought to bolster the power of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, whose creation Warren spearheaded. Porter also introduced legislation with Harris that would strengthen the power of state attorneys general to monitor banks. Other Democrats are likely weighing similar decisions as they watch the 2020 jockeying ahead of the pivotal Iowa caucuses. Rep. Mike Levin, another first-term California Democrat, told HuffPost he doesn\u2019t anticipate endorsing until the California primary. \u201cYou can count me in the \u2018anybody but Trump\u2019 column,\u201d Levin said. Biden currently has the most support from prominent members of the party, according to The New York Times\u2019 endorsement tracker, including many from states that are not his native Pennsylvania or Delaware. Harris, meanwhile, has the backing of four California representatives, including first-term Rep. Katie Hill. \u201cThere are many senators running for president and many members of Congress know them personally. There\u2019s nothing easy about backing someone who\u2019s not your hometown senator,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant and onetime aide to former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Porter, meanwhile, says she\u2019s not focused on the ins and outs of the presidential race. But she would like her constituents to hear from as many candidates as possible ahead of California\u2019s March primary, which will take place three months earlier than when the balloting occurred in 2016, in order to increase the state\u2019s role in shaping the 2020 race. \u201cThere are a lot of delegates to be had in California, and in particular my area of Orange County \u2015 we just flipped it to the Democrats \u2015 so there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm there, and I would love to have candidates to come and visit,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAnd I would welcome any of them to do that.\u201d",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " ROCK HILL, S.C. \u2015 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came to historically Black Clinton College in this suburb of Charlotte hoping to woo the voters she needs to complete a coalition that can claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: African Americans. Warren\u2019s slow and steady rise in polling has been largely powered by white voters with college degrees, though more recent polls have shown gains across basically every demographic within the Democratic Party. But one of her biggest rivals for the nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, still has a substantial lead among African American voters nationally and in this crucial state, the first in the south to cast its primary ballots. Compared to Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 the overwhelmingly white states that vote first and second in the primary \u2015 Warren has spent little time in South Carolina. A local reporter noted it had been more than a month since her last public event in the state, and a candidate tracker from the Charleston Post and Courier shows her attending just 12 events in the state before Saturday, compared to 17 for Biden, and more than 30 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third leading contender for the nomination. (Two African American candidates \u2015 California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2015 lead the way with 36 and 39 events, respectively.) Warren\u2019s supporters in South Carolina say if she picks up her pace in visits to the state, African American voters will embrace her message of battling political corruption and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care and free public higher education. \u201cWe\u2019re still a high-touch community, even in a high-tech society,\u201d said state Sen. Wendy Brawley, an African American who predicted Warren could win the state. \u201cShe gets that she needs to show up where we are.\u201d Warren\u2019s stop at Clinton College showed the promises and challenges that face the former Harvard Law professor. The crowd of roughly 1,000 people was mostly white, and attendees of all races largely said they arrived at the event already in her corner. Warren\u2019s pitch barely varied from her standard stump speech: She walked voters through her famous policy plans while nearly totally avoiding two hot topics of the day \u2015 the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and the details of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She did note her higher education plan would funnel an additional $50 billion to historically Black colleges like Clinton. It\u2019s not new for Warren to be courting African Americans. Some Black progressive activists have been raving about her since at least April, and she\u2019s often held listening sessions with Black leaders as she tours the country. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, what\u2019s broken and how to fix it,\u201d Warren told reporters when asked about the majority-white crowd and what she needed to do to win over Black voters. But it does appears Warren is ready to invest more time and resources in the state. She\u2019s opening a campaign office in Rock Hill next week, her campaign said. But while the Warren team is eager to talk up the strength of their field operations in Iowa and New Hampshire, they declined to reveal how many staffers are on the ground in the Palmetto State. (In total, Warren has 300 staffers, and 60% of those are in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.) Biden\u2019s campaign has 41 staffers on the ground here. Brawley and other Warren backers in the state pointed to two Warren policies they believe could help court Black voters: Her education policies \u2014 including the elimination of student debt \u2014 could woo younger Black voters, while her proposal to make sure no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare would attract Black women of all ages. \u201cIn my district, when you have grandparents raising their grands, when you have people working two jobs to keep a roof over their heads, not having childcare is a real issue,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThese are pocketbook issues that really matter, that can change people\u2019s lives if we give them even a little attention.\u201d Casey McClure, a 26-year-old who said she \u201cloved everything about\u201d Warren, suggested Biden\u2019s lead in the state was due to a generation gap. \u201cIt\u2019s the older voters,\u201d she said, noting she had met Biden during one of his earlier stops in the state. \u201cShe needs to get the young people out to vote.\u201d But there are some signs the gap might be closing. \u201cI love Joe, but he might not be as spunky as he used to,\u201d said McClure\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name. A Quinnipiac University poll this week saw Warren essentially tied with Biden, and building beyond her base of college-educated white voters. She earned the support of 27% of Democrats and Democratic-learning voters nationally, compared to 25% for the former vice president, and 16% for Sanders. That included a lead among college-educated white voters, liberals, voters aged 35 to 50, and those making more than $50,000 a year. She also tied Biden among white voters without a college degree. Among white voters overall, Warren led Biden 33% to 23%. But among Black voters, Biden\u2019s advantage was substantial: Forty percent said they support him, while only 19% backed Warren. That still represents a marked improvement for Warren. In July, the same poll found just 4% of Black voters supported her, while 53% supported Biden. A CNN poll of South Carolina voters released Sunday morning, however, painted a much grimmer picture for Warren. The poll showed Biden earning 37% of the statewide vote to Warren\u2019s 16%, with Sanders at 11%. Among Black voters, Warren tallied just 4% of the vote compared to Biden\u2019s 45% and Sanders\u2019 13%. Biden and his allies have long viewed Black voters as a crucial backstop for his campaign. While Sanders turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2016, his campaign floundered as Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s eventual nominee, routed him among African Americans. The primary schedule is similar this year. Fourteen states are holding their primaries on March 3, so-called Super Tuesday, when more than 40% of the Democratic delegates are up for grabs. Six of those states, including delegate-rich Texas, are at least 10% Black. But state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, another Warren backer, suggested Biden and others shouldn\u2019t count on South Carolina\u2019s voters to stay static, and noted the results in Iowa and New Hampshire could sway their votes. \u201cI know South Carolina for some of the other campaigns is considered to be a firewall state, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think African-American voters are not monolithic, and I think they\u2019re going to make decisions that best suit their community.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other politicians who have called for big tech companies to be broken up, and predicted the social media giant will prevail even if Warren wins the presidency in 2020. \u201cThere might be a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they\u2019re not being handled well,\u201d Zuckerberg told Facebook employees in Q&A sessions in July, according to leaked audio recordings published by The Verge on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that, even if there\u2019s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies. I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d He continued: Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in \u2026 It\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight. Warren responded to the disclosure by reiterating her plan to break up tech giants, tweeting Tuesday: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Facebook has repeatedly come under fire for privacy concerns, potential antitrust violations, its role in election interference and the dissemination of hate speech, online abuse and disinformation. Warren has called for big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to be broken up,\u00a0warning of their threats to competition, privacy and free speech. \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u200a \u2015 \u200atoo much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren wrote in March. \u201cWe need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\u201d Several other Democratic candidates have taken similar positions, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has said she would \u201cseriously take a look at\u201d breaking up Facebook, calling it \u201cessentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\u201d Part of Warren\u2019s plan would involve more regulation of \u201canti-competitive mergers,\u201d like Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram. \u201cUnwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market \u2015 which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\u201d Warren said in March. According to the leaked audio, Zuckerberg reassured employees that \u201cthe rule of law\u201d is on Facebook\u2019s side. He said \u201cthe case is not particularly strong\u201d against the company, arguing that election interference and the spread of hate speech could be \u201cmore likely\u201d if social media giants were \u201cmore fragmented.\u201d Read more of Zuckerberg\u2019s comments here.",

      "subtitle": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has a new plan for a progressive tax on lobbyists in Washington.",
      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a\u00a0plan to crack down on lobbying in Washington: She wants to institute a progressive tax on \u201cexcessive\u201d lobbying expenditures. The proposal from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was first listed among her proposals to rein in Washington lobbying in September, but she is now providing extensive details. She would place a 35% tax on annual lobbying expenses above $500,000 for corporations and trade organizations. The tax rate will increase to 60% for expenses over $1 million and then 75% for spending exceeding $5 million. The income generated by the new tax will be placed in a \u201cLobbying Defense Trust\u201d that will be used to help fund congressional support agencies, such as a reinstated Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Budget Office, and heavily lobbied executive branch agencies. It would also create an Office of the Public Advocate to help regular people better influence government decision-making. The general idea is that a tax on lobbying creates a market-based mechanism to discourage corporate spending that seeks to gain from making back-room deals rather than creating wealth. Currently, there is a strong incentive for corporations and other special interests to spend heavily on lobbying to obtain beneficial treatment. All combined,\u00a0more than $3 billion was spent on reported lobbying expenditures in each of the past 10 years. Corporations make up the largest share of this spending. Total revenue from the proposed lobbying tax would have raised $10 billion over the past 10 years, according to an analysis provided by the Warren campaign. Fifty-one corporations would have been hit with the highest proposed tax rate of 75% for spending above $5 million. These companies and trade groups include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Koch Industries, Exxon, Boeing, Microsoft, Pfizer, Walmart, Google and Facebook. The lobbying tax is one of many proposals Warren has introduced to crack down on corruption in Washington. She has proposed banning elected lawmakers and top officials from lobbying, expand the definition of lobbying to increase disclosure, ban foreign lobbying and ban lobbyists from donating or raising campaign money, among other things. The thinking behind Warren\u2019s tax on lobbying expenditures is slightly different \u2015 maybe even opposed to \u2015 the restrictions on lobbying usually considered by Congress. It can be argued that some of these restrictions have simply had the effect of making lobbying less transparent \u2015 as more people involved in the influence industry find loopholes to evade registering as lobbyists. The tax, however, is simply a mechanism to deter excessive lobbying \u2015 or at least impose a cost on it. This is what Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, thought when he proposed a tax on lobbying in his 2012 book, \u201dA Capitalism for the People.\u201d The Warren campaign consulted him when crafting the proposal. \u201cIf you tax lobbying in a progressive way then it reduces the influence of the largest companies on the important decisions,\u201d Zingales told The Economist in a 2012 interview. \u201cPeople lobby because there\u2019s a high return, but if you start taxing them and using some of that money to subsidise the opponents then it evens out.\u201d And that is Warren\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said in a post explaining the new tax policy. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2015 but in that case, all the better.\u201d",

Whelly claims he met Warren through a male escort website, Cowboys4Angels, and that their first tryst occurred on Aug. 8, 2018, in Massachusetts. But he offered no verifiable evidence to back up his story and Rolling Stone later reported that the Cowboys4Angels chief executive said, after checking his records, that \u201cthis guy never worked for me.\u201d Wohl and Burkman have made clear in the past their avid support for President Donald Trump, but even the pro-Trump\u00a0Daily Caller noted that Whelly had a hard time keeping a straight face while discussing his allegations. Warren, meanwhile, won the day with a witty response that embraced her \u201ccougar\u201d past, telling the world it made her who she is. Twitter users thought Warren\u2019s cougar tweet was the cat\u2019s meow: Wohl, though only 21, already has defined the term \u201ccheckered past.\u201d As a teenager, the Southern California native was involved in financial scams and banned for life by the National Futures Association.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2015 in a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June, sources familiar with the phone cal told CNN on Thursday. The report comes hours after Trump suggested, while speaking to reporters, that China investigate Biden, appearing to openly ask another foreign government to influence an American election despite Congress investigating Trump for doing the same thing with Ukraine\u2019s president. According to CNN\u2019s report on the June 18 call, Trump brought up the \u201cpolitical prospects\u201d of Biden and Warren, the latter of who had recently started rising in the polls. In that same call, he promised not to speak out on the ongoing Hong Kong protests as China and the U.S. negotiate a trade deal. A record of the call was moved to a highly secure server, CNN reported. The alleged conversation \u2014 and how it was archived \u2014 bears significant similarity to a phone call Trump had around the same time with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed the leader to investigate Biden while also reminding him that the U.S. had provided Ukraine with a lot of foreign aid. That interaction prompted a whistleblower to raise concerns about Trump\u2019s behavior, which has since sparked a formal House impeachment inquiry, which Trump has repeatedly denounced as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The White House did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but officials told the press in June that the call with Xi involved discussion of \u201cthe importance of leveling the playing field for U.S. farmers, workers, and businesses through a fair and reciprocal economic relationship.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and now has $25.7 million to spend as the 2020 Democratic race enters its final stretch before primary season. The haul is second only to fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders raised $25.3 million from July to September, while former Vice President Joe Biden raised just $15.2 million. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who trails the other top fundraisers by significant margins in public polling, raised just over $19 million. \u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position \u2014 to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth\u2019s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,\u201d campaign manager Roger Lau wrote. It is all but certain that Warren and Sanders \u2015 two left-leaning progressives who have chosen to bypass high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign \u2015 will be the two candidates with the most successful third quarters. Warren, in particular, faced skepticism over her decision to bypass high-dollar fundraising \u2015 an area where she had excelled prior to the 2020 presidential race. \u201cElizabeth didn\u2019t sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cInstead, she got to spend her time traveling across the country, hosting town halls, taking tens of thousands of selfies, and hearing directly from people about what\u2019s on their minds.\u201d Warren, whose steady rise now has her essentially tied with Biden in most public polling, had 943,000 donations from 509,000 different individual donors. The average donation was $26, and the campaign said more than 300,000 people donated for the first time during the third quarter. Among lower-tier candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised $10 million and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker raised $6 million. Other candidates, including former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, have not yet released their fundraising totals.

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " SAN DIEGO \u2015 A new poll confirms that a tight three-way race is developing in California\u2019s key Democratic presidential primary, with one candidate showing impressive momentum: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A\u00a0survey released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed\u00a0Warren the choice of 23% of likely primary voters, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 21%. When the Democratic race was first taking shape in the spring, a Quinnipiac Poll had shown Warren in single digits in the Golden State, far behind Biden, Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Indeed, as Warren\u2019s support has surged in California \u2015 as it has nationally \u2015 the prospects for Harris in her home state have taken a hit, again reflecting national trends. Perhaps the new poll\u2019s most striking finding is that Harris trailed well behind the pack with just 8% support, another sign of trouble for her struggling campaign. \u201cWarren may well be a beneficiary of Harris\u2019 collapse,\u201d said veteran California Democratic strategist Garry South. \u201cSince her very impressive debut (as a White House candidate) in Oakland in January, Harris has done little in California to solidify whatever support may have been potentially there for her.\u201d Voters like Cindy Henderson, an author who showed up to hear Warren speak Thursday as the candidate made her first campaign stop in San Diego, give a glimpse into the race\u2019s current dynamics. \u201cI was actually a Kamala fan,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cJust something in the last two or three months, I\u2019m just kind of dropping off [on her]. I think she\u2019s not quite ready. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much depth yet. The more I hear and watch what Elizabeth does, it\u2019s just like, OK, she\u2019s a rock star. I\u2019m loving her message.\u201d Warren drew about 8,500 people for her rally in downtown San Diego. (A rally for Sanders was attended by an estimated 6,400 people at the same venue in May). Like most of Warren\u2019s audiences, her Thursday crowd was predominantly white \u2015 which aligns with how her support breaks down in public opinion surveys, as well. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll\u00a0released in late September showed her leading the California race with 29%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 20%. But Warren trailed both of those two with Latino voters. Warren mostly stuck to her populist stump speech on Thursday, laying out her plans to take on Washington corruption, special interests and big corporations. She appeared to choke up at one point as she recalled the family struggles that marked her childhood in Oklahoma, including the time her mother lost her job. The story is a big hit with many voters, who cite it when discussing the candidate. At one point, after discussing her plan to break up big tech companies, Warren called out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees in recently leaked audio the company would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to defeat her efforts. \u201cAnd yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you,\u201d she said, to cheers and applause from the audience. The true contours of the Democratic battle will emerge in February when the narrative-driving nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina take place. But right around the corner comes primaries in 14 states on March 3, Super Tuesday. And California is the day\u2019s dominant contest, with 416 convention delegates allotted. That\u2019s why so many of the main Democratic contenders are paying frequent visits to the state to meet with voters \u2015 as well as well-heeled donors. Also, early mail-in voting begins a month before the actual primary date. And conquering California presents unique challenges for a politician: its\u00a0population is decidedly more diverse than that in the earlier-voting states, campaign ads are far more expensive than in those other locales and gaining media attention is difficult. In terms of having the money to compete, Warren and Sanders are well-primed as the race enters the final stretch before primary season. Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and has $25.7 million cash on hand. Sanders, hospitalized earlier this week in Nevada because of a blocked artery, raised $25.3 million from July to September (his campaign didn\u2019t release a cash-on-hand figure). Their figures are especially impressive because both candidates have opted against holding fundraisers focused on big-dollar donors during the primary campaign. Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, reported a lackluster $15.2 million raised over the past three months, far less than his second-quarter haul of $21.5 million. He could be in trouble if his fundraising continues to taper off. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee announced raising a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a record-setting haul. His war chest will only grow as Democrats spend several months \u2015 and maybe more, in the case of a lengthy primary battle \u2015 determining their nominee. Warren dismissed Trump\u2019s haul on Thursday, telling reporters she didn\u2019t think \u201cscooping up a bunch of money from rich people and buying a bunch of TV ads\u201d is \u201chow democracy works anymore.\u201d She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be about going out and building a grassroots movement.\u201d Given Warren\u2019s steady rise in the primary race, the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, looms particularly large for her. As the frontrunner in several of the race\u2019s most recent national polls, she\u2019ll likely have a bigger target on her back. Even as Warren received enthusiastic backing at her San Diego rally, interviews with some of the undecided voters at it underscored some of the doubts she still most overcome. Corinne Lytle-Bonine, an environmental consultant who voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, acknowledged she was giving Warren a strong look this time around. \u201cHaving the nomination be another old white man is a hard pill to swallow when it feels like women have been the ones really carrying the Democrats through 2018,\u201d Lytle-Bonine said. She added that \u201cI think Warren has some establishment credentials that Bernie doesn\u2019t, and may make her more electable in the general election.\u201d Still, Lytle-Bonine questioned why Warren has been hesitant to acknowledge whether the middle class would see a tax hike if, as president, she would push into law \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d government health care plan Sanders has introduced and that she supports. Several of Warren\u2019s rivals have criticized her for repeatedly dodging the question; she\u2019s brushed off the attacks as unfair Republican framing. \u201cI wish that she would\u201d directly deal with that issue, Lytle-Bonine said. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know what is holding her back. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard answer to say \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll raise taxes, however, all of your out-of-pocket expenses (for health care) go away.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a plan to reform federal judicial misconduct on Monday, a day after the one-year anniversary of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial confirmation to the Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interests, strengthen our nation\u2019s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for judges who violate these rules,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate wrote in her announcement of the plan for an impartial and ethical federal judiciary. Warren\u2019s plan includes closing a loophole that allows federal judges to escape investigations for misconduct when they resign from office or are elevated to the Supreme Court \u2015 a loophole that Warren has\u00a0railed against in the past. \u201cMy plan extends the authority of the Judicial Conference to former judges so that individuals under investigation cannot simply resign from the bench to avoid accountability,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis provision would allow the judiciary to reopen the investigations into Alex Kozinski,\u00a0Maryanne Trump-Barry,\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, and any other judge who benefited from this loophole.\u201d Kozinski was a judge on the federal 9th Circuit accused in 2017 by at least 15 law clerks of sexual misconduct. But, as Warren noted, the investigation into Kozinski\u2019s behavior was dropped when he retired. Trump-Barry, President Donald Trump\u2019s sister, resigned as a federal appellate judge in April, ending a probe into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in the Trump family\u2019s alleged tax fraud schemes. When Kavanaugh rose to the Supreme Court, sexual assault and perjury complaints against him were dismissed. \u201cThe basic premise of our legal system is that every person is treated equally in the eyes of the law \u2015 including judges,\u201d Warren said on Monday. \u201cOur judiciary only functions properly when it lives up to this promise, and it risks eroding its legitimacy when the American people lose faith that judges are ethical and fair-minded.\u201d Warren also unveiled several proposals she hasn\u2019t mentioned publicly before. They include\u00a0prohibiting judges from deciding for themselves whether they should recuse themselves from a case due to conflict of interest;\u00a0requiring Supreme Court justices to give written explanations of their decisions when a party asks for a recusal; and\u00a0giving strong disciplinary tools to judicial ethics watchdogs, such as allowing them to take away nonvested pension benefits from judges. Warren\u2019s plan also proposes extending the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to the Supreme Court, which is currently not covered by such guidelines. Explaining the need for this provision, Warren cited the 83 ethics complaints\u00a0lodged against Kavanaugh that were dismissed upon his confirmation to the Supreme Court, as well as the lack of action after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0failed to disclose payments\u00a0his wife received from a conservative judicial activist group. \u201cBecause the Supreme Court is not covered by a Code of Conduct, no procedure exists to file new complaints\u201d against Kavanaugh, Warren said. She added that\u00a0\u201cquestions are often raised about the behavior of Supreme Court Justices, such as Justice Thomas\u2019s 13 years of financial disclosures that failed to list $690,000 in payments to his wife from the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing judicial activist group \u2015 but these actions are beyond the scope of current rules.\u201d Such lack of oversight, Warren said, has gone on for long enough. \u201cThese changes will not only allow us to ensure accountability for bad actors, including reopening inquiries into the conduct of offenders like Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey will also hold the vast majority of judges who act in good faith to the highest ethical standards, and in the process, begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair and impartial federal judiciary.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan comes almost exactly a year after the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, following explosive allegations that he sexually assaulted at least three women when he was younger.",

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren visited Michigan\u2019s most polluted ZIP code for the first time last week. The Massachusetts senator toured a community center and a school in the 48217 ZIP code in southwestern Detroit, where playgrounds sit sandwiched between the Great Lake State\u2019s only oil refinery and car manufacturing plants. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) guided the Sept. 29 visit, of which the campaign shared video with HuffPost. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d Warren says at the start of the video, turning to Tlaib in the backseat of an SUV. \u201cThat\u2019s what my people smell every day,\u201d the congresswoman says. \u201cI thought the smell was normal. I really did. I didn\u2019t realize that it was killing us.\u201d Just as gobbling fatty snacks at the Iowa State Fair is a rite of passage for top-tier presidential hopefuls, a pilgrimage to the 48217 is now becoming a touchstone for any contender who wants to be taken seriously on the nation\u2019s environment. Warren, citing a packed scheduled, passed on a chance to visit the area in July, when community activists invited all 20 candidates participating in the second round of Democratic primary debates in Detroit. Of the three who agreed to come \u2015 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2015 only Inslee, then running as the race\u2019s long-shot climate candidate, showed up. It was Inslee\u2019s third time in the 48217. Warren, a potential front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she\u2019d adopt much of Inslee\u2019s book-length stack of climate proposals when the Evergreen State governor dropped out to run for reelection at home in August. Now she\u2019s covering the same ground, visiting the kind of frontline community that could lend her credibility as her campaign courts older Black voters, a key demographic to winning the nomination. The area, crisscrossed by highways and choked by air emissions, made a powerful backdrop for Warren just days after releasing a meaty proposal to restore union membership. The policy outline came out just as the United Auto Workers union was preparing for a long-haul strike against Detroit giant General Motors. After photographing legally questionable flaring \u2015 when excess gas is vented into the air and burned \u2015 at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery next door to the Kemeny Recreation Center, Warren drove by Salina Elementary School, where Tlaib says officials only recently installed air filtration systems to protect students from cancer-causing particulate matter spewed from the neighboring AK Steel plant. \u201cThese big corporations have enough muscle with the government that they squeeze it to get tax breaks. So the cost of running these schools and keeping these roads paved fall disproportionately on you,\u201d Warren says to a trio of activists. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only paying the cost in terms of what you breathe, what your children breathe, your bodies \u2015 you\u2019re also paying the cost out of pocket.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Less than a week after suffering a heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) addressed hundreds of campaign staffers on Monday afternoon to offer his gratitude for their work and assure them he is more committed than ever to winning the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cIronically, I will tell you that I feel more strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began,\u201d he said, according to the campaign. The mood amongst the staffers who were on the brief call was boisterous,\u00a0according to three people who were on the call who requested anonymity to speak without authorization. One of the campaign aides described being moved by Sanders\u2019 reminder that their campaign \u2014 which boasts the slogan, \u201cNot me. Us.\u201d \u2014 was about the hopes and dreams of millions of working people seeking a better life. \u201cYou work so fucking hard on these things, that it\u2019s good to hear the person you work for have this really kind of humbling approach to it all,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe said \u2018Don\u2019t take your eye off the ball\u2019 in a way that really got people moving.\u201d The call embodied the broader response that the campaign has had since Sanders was hospitalized late Tuesday night with chest pain that ended up being a \u201cmyocardial infarction,\u201d or heart attack: That Sanders is well on his way back to full health, that his fight for Medicare for All is more personal than ever, and that he has no plans to slow down his campaign. \u201cThe working class Americans who are the core of Bernie\u2019s movement wake up each day and battle adversity of all kinds, and we believe they will be drawn even closer to the senator as he continues to fight for a shared vision to transform our country so it works for all of us \u2013 not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Monday. Sanders, 78, was treated in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the insertion of two stents to unclog one of his arteries. On Friday, he emerged from the hospital alongside his wife Jane with a triumphant fist in the air, recorded a video for his supporters on social media, and returned home to Burlington, Vermont. He and his wife took a walk in the rain on Monday, which CNN captured on camera. In addition to facing the politically tricky task of persuading primary voters that a septuagenarian heart attack survivor is up to the task of winning the White House, the Sanders campaign is already working to quiet skepticism of its immediate response to his ailment. Nearly three days passed between Sanders\u2019 hospitalization and the announcement on Friday that he had suffered a heart attack. Sanders\u2019 team maintains that they provided the accurate medical information as soon as it was available; they were not sure of the diagnosis until he was discharged from the hospital. In keeping with a mid-September promise, Sanders will be releasing his full medical records in the near future, though the campaign did not provide any additional details about timing. The Sanders campaign did its best to continue with business as usual in the days following his hospitalization. Over the weekend, the campaign dispatched three of its co-chairs \u2015 former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, California Rep. Ro Khanna and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz \u2015 to barnstorm the early primary states with a packed schedule of events. And early Monday morning, the campaign released Sanders\u2019 plan to get corporate money out of politics, including the cash-riddled presidential nominating conventions. Sanders will have his first chance to demonstrate his vitality at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15. The Vermont senator does not have any public events planned prior to the debate; he canceled a scheduled appearance at an LGBTQ town hall on CNN this Thursday. In the meantime, the campaign is keen to showcase the strength of Sanders\u2019 support network, which appears to have been inspired by his hospitalization to redouble their efforts on his behalf. The campaign announced on Sunday that its staff and volunteers had met its goal of making 1 million phone calls to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and California in ten days\u2019 time. According to an aide, the campaign experienced a spike in volunteers on Wednesday after news of Sanders\u2019 hospitalization broke, pushing the phone call tally up to 1.3 million. The figure is not surprising given the frenzy of emotion among his supporters following his hospitalization. A number of Sanders partisans with significant social media followings downplayed the significance of the stent procedure and highlighted the speed of Sanders\u2019 recovery. And the campaign racked up 8,000 donations on Wednesday, according to co-chair, Rep. Ro Khanna of California. One of the donors was RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of the National Nurses United union, and a prominent campaign supporter, who chipped in $100. \u201cIt was like a rallying cry. It was incredible,\u201d DeMoro said of the outpouring of support for Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between having a movement as opposed to just a campaign.\u201d Sanders supporters, many of whom have lost faith in more conventional politicians, are famously passionate in their support for Sanders. The prospect that a health scare could damage his standing in the polls prompted so much renewed involvement due to supporters\u2019 belief that Sanders is uniquely equipped to defeat Trump and solve the country\u2019s problems, according to Jim Zogby, a pollster and top Sanders surrogate. \u201cPeople all of a sudden woke up and said, \u2018Bernie might not be in the mix \u2015 this can\u2019t be,\u2019\u201d said Zogby, who also runs the Arab American Institute. \u201cHe comes back to an invigorated campaign with a staff and a support base that has doubled down in their efforts to make this happen. Because they realize that for them \u2015 and for me \u2015 he\u2019s the critical choice.\u201d Calls for Sanders\u00a0to drop out of the race \u2015 however few they were in number \u2015 only riled up Sanders\u2019 supporters, many of whom already firmly believe that the established media and political classes will stop at nothing to prevent Sanders from winning. The Thursday release of \u201cRising Up,\u201d a five-minute video created by Matt Orfalea, a Sanders activist not affiliated with the campaign, added to the dramatic \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative that has long animated Bernie World. Orfalea\u2019s video, which many called an advertisement, showed numerous clips of pundits, reporters and comedians mocking Sanders on a series of topics, juxtaposed with footage of him doing the opposite \u2014\u00a0greeting supporters with a smile, listening sympathetically, speaking to crowds of diverse voters. The spot, which featured some of the do-it-yourself charm of the 2016 campaign, earned plaudits from prominent Democrats who are not supporting Sanders but are nonetheless sympathetic to claims of media bias against him. In just a few days, the video racked up over 6.3 million views on Twitter alone \u2015 far more than Sanders\u2019 first official campaign ad, which came out days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s something that deeply resonates and it was released at the perfect moment, when Bernie needed it the most,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any presidential candidate, said of the video. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of things voters don\u2019t just watch but also share.\u201d A question on the minds of some poll watchers is nonetheless how Sanders\u2019 heart attack affects the campaign of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70, a fellow progressive who has surpassed Sanders in national and early primary-state polls. In a gesture of solidarity, Warren\u2019s campaign bought dinner on Wednesday for Sanders\u2019 staff at his campaign headquarters in Washington. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. But two prominent Warren supporters suggested that Sanders\u2019 continued presence in the race could only help her candidacy. Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, argued that the presence of another left candidate is mutually beneficial. It increases the legitimacy of their shared ideas, and is liable to dissuade super-rich donors from erecting a super PAC to take out either one of them, he posited. \u201cIf you knock one out, you help the other,\u201d Green said of such a scenario. \u201cAnd if you run ads hitting both of them, you just elevate them as the two most clear and transformational progressives.\u201d Murshed Zaheed, a partner at the progressive communications firm Megaphone Strategies who previously worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed Green\u2019s sentiments, likening it to a progressive race to the top. \u201cThere\u2019s no coincidence that both of them are smashing the neoliberals in this race in terms of fundraising,\u201d said Zaheed. \u201cCompetition makes each one better.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Back then, teaching was the national model for discriminating against pregnant workers and getting away with it.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is on the offensive against a report that questions a compelling piece of her origin story: her account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because she was six months pregnant. Although the reports don\u2019t contain evidence that Warren is lying, they show there is no written evidence she was fired from her elementary school job and they open the door to the possibility that she voluntarily resigned to raise a family. What\u2019s missing, though, is a crucial fact about the time period when Warren says she was shown the door: In 1971, teaching wasn\u2019t just another profession where women experienced pregnancy discrimination. It was the national model for how employers could systematically discriminate against pregnant workers and get away with it. School districts\u00a0around the country followed\u00a0plain-as-day policies that terminated pregnant teachers or forced them to take unpaid leave, usually around the fifth month of pregnancy when they were obviously pregnant. A National Education Association survey in 1970 found that\u00a0a majority of school districts had such a policy, and that most of those policies came with no guarantee that a teacher would get her job back after giving birth. That placed school teachers on the front lines of the fraught legal and cultural battles for better protections for working women, writes legal historian Deborah Dinner. National women\u2019s groups took up the treatment of pregnant teachers as an organizing cause. Women\u2019s legal advocates recruited teachers as civil rights test cases. The Supreme Court\u2019s first pregnancy discrimination case, argued in 1973, pitted three pregnant teachers against a \u201cfive month\u201d policy. That case, and the questions it left unanswered, became the basis for the landmark Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. In other words, when a pregnant Warren left her teaching job, pregnancy discrimination against teachers was rampant, controversial and inextricable from the much larger battle on the overall status of working women. The question isn\u2019t why her school board would lie about forcing her out \u2014 it\u2019s why wouldn\u2019t it? Warren\u2019s story of being shuffled out of her first teaching job goes like this:\u00a0In 1971, she was a teacher \u2014 her dream job \u2014 at a special-needs school for public school students at Riverdale Elementary in New Jersey. In April, when she was pregnant but not obviously, the school renewed her teaching contract for another year. By the summer, she was six months pregnant \u2014 \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d \u2014 and the job was no longer hers. \u201cThe principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u201d she said at a recent town hall. In some recent appearances, she has dropped the \u201cshowed me the door\u201d line, but she defended her characterization in an interview\u00a0with CBS News. \u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else,\u2019 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren said. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, cast doubt by noting that Warren had once described her exit differently: \u201c[I] said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview. (Warren told CBS that she wasn\u2019t comfortable opening up about the discrimination aspect until recently.) And it pointed to contemporaneous reports from 1971 that also paint her exit as voluntary. A local news item said Warren was \u201cleaving to raise a family,\u201d while another said the school board hired Warren\u2019s replacement after she \u201cresigned for personal reasons.\u201d Of course, what really matters here is whether Warren had a choice to keep her job at all. And to read just those two news items is to miss the reality that in 1971, it was the de facto or actual expectation in the majority of American school districts that a teacher who became pregnant would resign. \u201cVoluntary resignations\u201d were many teachers\u2019 only alternative to automatic dismissal \u2014 and Warren\u2019s school district was reportedly no exception. \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Trudy Randall, a retired Riverdale Elementary teacher, told CBS. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d Certainly, by 1971, Warren\u2019s principal would have known that to openly fire her because she was pregnant was to court trouble. \u201cIn the early 1970s,\u201d the country at large was embroiled in a \u201cmajor cultural and legal debate over the rights of pregnant workers,\u201d according to a history of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. The American Federation of Teachers denounced mandatory pregnancy dismissals at its annual convention in 1970. By the next year \u2014 the year Warren left her job \u2014 the federation and the National Organization for Women were coordinating local name-and-shame campaigns against school boards with retrograde policies. One district that found itself under fire was a school board in New Jersey, the state where Warren had worked. In 1972, the state civil rights commission slapped down a policy forcing teachers to leave school at five months pregnant. An Associated Press story from that time reported the ruling to mean \u201cpregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey\u2019s classrooms.\u201d Because teaching was one of a few career options reliably available to women, the treatment of pregnant schoolteachers was at the heart of the broader societal clash over pregnant workers.\u00a0Schools were also a special battleground because teaching jobs were mostly government jobs \u2014 it gave pregnancy discrimination against teachers the sheen of authority. Among the very first federal cases against pregnancy discrimination was brought in 1973, by a Minnesota teacher named Margo Seaman, who sued her school district for forcing her, when she was seven months pregnant, to take a semesterlong leave of absence. Seaman was able to stay in her job but lost her fight for back pay, in no small part because her teacher\u2019s union had capitulated in 1971 to a policy \u201cproviding for permanent \u2018termination\u2019 of a teacher after five months of pregnancy, with no guarantee of reinstatement.\u201d And in 1974, the Supreme Court took up its first pregnancy discrimination suit, which the legal professor Nicholas Pedriana\u00a0called \u201ca typical early pregnancy discrimination case\u201d: \u201cPublic school teachers who became pregnant were required to take maternity leave beginning in the fifth month of pregnancy.\u201d The case,\u00a0Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, involved three teachers from two school districts in Ohio and Virginia who were pregnant in 1970 or 1971 and were forced to take many months of unpaid maternity leave with no guarantee of getting their jobs back. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the five-month rule was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The questions that case left unanswered \u2014 namely, whether pregnancy discrimination was a form of gender discrimination and subject to an even wider array of civil rights laws \u2014 led eventually to the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. At the heart of all of these legal fights and retrograde school board policies were traditional ideas about gender, Dinner writes: the notion that pregnancy, a visible sign of women\u2019s sexual activity, wasn\u2019t classroom-appropriate; that pregnant women couldn\u2019t work without endangering their health and their pregnancies; and that new mothers shouldn\u2019t work but focus on their families. Those ideas started to crumble in the 1970s. But they still persist, and, making it all the more difficult to dismiss Warren\u2019s story, they still result in routine pregnancy discrimination against professional women today. Today, the idea of putting a visibly pregnant CEO on the cover of a magazine is still considered trailblazing. Today, the idea that pregnant women place special burdens on their co-workers is still pervasive. Pregnant women often find themselves \u201cmommy tracked,\u201d and paid or promoted less than their peers for equivalent work based on the assumption that their futures belong to their families. \u201cPregnancy discrimination remains pervasive, especially for women in low-wage and physically demanding jobs,\u201d said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization for women\u2019s rights. \u201cIt is a key barrier to gender equality in the workplace, often snowballing into devastating economic consequences for women.\u201d And it is still prevalent in the teaching profession. Religious schools, for instance, have fought for and often won the legal right to fire pregnant teachers who are unmarried or who conceive using methods, like IVF, opposed by some faiths. Denine Hasan, who is a New Jersey schoolteacher like Warren was, said she wasn\u2019t at all surprised by Warren\u2019s account. Hasan says that she, too, was shuffled out of her position when she became pregnant \u2014 during the 2012-13 school year. Like Warren, she wasn\u2019t outright fired. Instead, she says, she was assigned to a new school, given unprecedented negative reviews and treated with hostility or punished when she asked for medically recommended accommodations for her high-risk pregnancy. Officials informed Hasan, who was not tenured, that her contract would not be renewed when she went on maternity leave. (The Asbury Park School District has not admitted wrongdoing, and didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.) \u201cI don\u2019t think I would get pregnant again. Because you\u2019re just fearful. What\u2019s going to happen? Am I going to lose my job?\u201d Hasan told HuffPost. \u201cWomen are always viewed differently than men,\u201d she continued. \u201cIts natural for us to bear children, and then to be put in situations where now we\u2019re losing jobs because we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s natural. It\u2019s like we can\u2019t win.\u201d Emily Peck contributed reporting",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is standing firm in the face of scrutiny, and so are her supporters, who are sharing their own stories on Twitter of when they faced discrimination because of pregnancy. The 2020 presidential candidate tweeted Tuesday to reiterate that she had been edged out of her first teaching job when she became pregnant. She had been responding to unsubstantiated accusations that she had actually voluntarily resigned. \u201cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\u201d she added. The conservative website Washington Free Beacon on Monday surfaced the minutes from an April 1971 board of education meeting showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u2019s teaching contract, two months before her exit in June. This does not necessarily contradict Warren\u2019s story, which is that her contract was renewed in April but that by June, when she was six months\u2019 pregnant, the principal \u201cshowed her the door.\u201d \u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours \u2015 \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else\u2019 \u2015 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren told CBS News on Monday. The Washington Free Beacon also cast doubt on Warren\u2019s account by noting she had once described her exit from the job differently in a 2007 interview, when she said:\u00a0\u201c[I] said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d When asked to explain this, Warren told CBS she wasn\u2019t comfortable delving into the discrimination aspect publicly until later in her career. On Tuesday, after Warren\u2019s tweets, people on Twitter shared their own experiences of job discrimination due to pregnancy, or those of their friends and family. Here are some of those stories: Yep. In the late 90s, after 3 years of stellar reviews/promotions, I was suddenly fired within a month of telling my boss I was pregnant. They said I lied when I\u2019d called in sick one day (morning sickness), but went to visit family later. I was young+scared, so I didn\u2019t fight it. Do you have a similar story of job discrimination due to pregnancy? Get in touch with HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel.",

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a sweeping climate justice plan on Wednesday morning, vowing to ramp up research on the health effects of pollution and discourage the transfer of public water services to for-profit companies. The 12-page memo marks the Massachusetts senator\u2019s eighth climate-related proposal since launching a presidential campaign built on an ambitious slate of policy plans at the start of the year. The latest proposal collects much of Warren\u2019s existing ideas on improving racial equity and reducing pollution and reframes them in what looks like an ambitious, nearly 5,900-word blueprint on how to implement a Green New Deal. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo. \u201cThe Green New Deal commits us to a \u2018just transition\u2019 for all communities and all workers. But we won\u2019t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d The document borrows heavily from the plan laid out by former climate candidate Jay Inslee, who quit the Democratic presidential primary in August to run for reelection as Washington\u2019s governor, including efforts to quantify pollution inequity between communities and apply that data to decisions on where to invest Green New Deal money. Warren also proposes turning the White House\u00a0Council on Environmental Quality, a currently sleepy office tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, into an environmental justice hub. The Warren plan offers fewer wonky details on which agencies should do what work than the Inslee proposal did. But notably included in the senator\u2019s release are calls to increase research funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, putting an end to the privatization of water delivery. Under her administration, Warren would \u201cfully fund\u201d the CDC\u2019s \u201cenvironmental health programs, such as childhood lead poisoning prevention, and community health investigations\u201d and would \u201cprovide additional grant funding for independent research into environmental health effects.\u201d Her campaign declined to share an exact dollar figure. It\u2019s a relatively novel idea to include the CDC in a campaign climate plan, something the other leading environmental champions in the race have omitted so far. Yet it\u2019s likely to be popular. In February, representatives from four dozen public health groups sent a letter to House lawmakers pleading for an increase in federal funding for the CDC\u2019s \u201ccritically underfunded\u201d lead and climate programs. The CDC is the fourth-most favorably viewed federal agency and has some of the most bipartisan support, a Pew Research Center poll found in September. Yet the CDC\u2019s operating budget fell nearly $1 million between the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. Warren\u2019s plan goes beyond just researching the effects of lead poisoning. Citing the recent lead contaminations in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, she said her administration would \u201cend decades of disinvestment and privatization of our nation\u2019s water system \u2015 our government at every level should invest in safe, affordable drinking water for all of us.\u201d Ramping up federal spending on water infrastructure is a staple of Democratic campaigns at this point, particularly as Newark\u2019s former mayor, now-Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is running for the presidential nomination. But curtailing the transfer of control of public services from government agencies to private companies is another issue altogether. The private water industry serves 73 million Americans, according to National Association of Water Companies data. For-profit water services put public health at risk, a 66-page paper by University of Louisville law professor Craig Anthony Arnold argues, because the profit motive incentivizes companies to provide better services to customers who pay more and to maintain infrastructure with an eye to the length of the firm\u2019s contract. Detroit\u2019s debt-choked public utility threatened to shut off water to nearly 17,500 households that were behind on bills last year, only to decrease the shutoff rate 70% this year. In the timing of the 2018 shutoffs, just as the city was looking to privatize its utility, the left-wing think tank Centre for Research on Globalization saw\u00a0an effort to streamline a troubled facility before selling it off to profiteers. Other cities are actively opposing such privatization. Last November, Baltimore became the first big city in the United States to ban water privatization with an amendment to its charter. Wednesday\u2019s proposal did not make clear whether a Warren White House would take explicit steps to discourage municipalities from switching to private water. But the campaign said an influx of federal funding to overhaul water infrastructure should make switching to private water services far less appealing. Income and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure Americans can expect to face. Black neighborhoods, on average, have air that\u2019s 48% more polluted than that in white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and Black Americans are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. The journal Environmental Research published a study last year that determined Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risks of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said in an interview posted Tuesday she will not hold big-money fundraisers at any point during her presidential run. Warren had previously said her plan to bypass the standard grip-and-grin fundraisers with expensive tickets only applied to the primary. But in an interview with CBS News, Warren said she wouldn\u2019t do high-dollar fundraisers during the general election if she wins the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cI will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,\u201d Warren told CBS News. \u201cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward. Either you think ... electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u2019s about a grassroots let\u2019s-build-this-from-the-ground-up.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments, first highlighted by The New York Times, represent a shift. \u201cMy presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it,\u201d she wrote in a February\u00a0Medium post announcing her decision not to hold fundraisers during her primary campaign. \u201cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u201d she told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes at the time. The decision to extend that policy to the general election could put her at a financial disadvantage when running against President Donald Trump, whose campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the third quarter of 2019. But she said Trump\u2019s big cash hauls would not deter her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not going to do the big-dollar fundraisers. I\u2019m just not going to do it,\u201d Warren told CBS. \u201cThe whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d In a statement, Warren\u2019s communications director, Kristen Orthman, said that the candidate would continue to attend fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and other Democratic candidates, and that those fundraisers would be open to the press. She also said that Warren \u2014 like almost every other Democratic candidate for president \u2014 would continue to turn down donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees. \u201cNo special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite our campaign. Our campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign \u2015 funded by working people chipping in a few bucks here and there,\u201d Orthman wrote. \u201cAs we have said from the beginning and has been our practice throughout the primary, Elizabeth will also continue to do everything she can to build our party infrastructure and strengthen Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\u201d Orthman also promised \u201ca more comprehensive campaign finance plan in the coming weeks to permanently break the stranglehold that the money-for-influence racket has on our politics.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign, which raised nearly $25 million in the third quarter, has relied so far on online donations. She and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have been able to out-raise the majority of the other contenders for the Democratic nomination while relying almost exclusively on online fundraising. But raising money for the general election is a different exercise. While Warren\u2019s rivals for the nomination are limited to $2,800 donations in the primary, recent court rulings have turned presidential fundraising for the general election into a much more expensive game, where fundraiser attendees can give a combined total more than $300,000 to the presidential campaigns, national party committees and various state parties.\u00a0Warren\u2019s pledge means that she could still attend fundraisers that raise large sums for the Democratic National Committee and state parties, but she would not be able to give special access to high-dollar donors at those events. Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, said Warren\u2019s decision meant \u201cthe Democratic Party just went bankrupt.\u201d \u201cA Presidential nominee is not just responsible for fundraising for his/her campaign,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey are the de-facto head of ... the Democratic Party and for all 50 State Parties. The Democratic Party cannot raise the money they need without the candidate doing every [thing] he/she can.\u201d End Citizens United, a Democratic group named after the infamous Supreme Court decision and dedicated to limiting the influence of money in politics, praised Warren\u2019s decision. \u201cElizabeth Warren has been unafraid to take on our rigged political system in her campaign and put forward bold ideas to take on the corporate special interests and Big Money donors that dominate our politics,\u201d said Tiffany Mueller, the group\u2019s president. \u201cHer commitment to small-dollar fundraising sends a powerful message to the American people about who she will fight for as President.\u201d Warren, along with Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, is in the top tier of candidates competing for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has bypassed high-dollar fundraisers throughout his career, though he has held a few events open to both large- and small-dollar donors during his current presidential bid. Biden has raised much of his campaign war chest through traditional high-dollar fundraisers. Some Biden allies, most notably former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, have attacked Warren\u00a0for attending high-dollar fundraisers in the past. The Warren campaign has pointed out that her decision to skip fundraising events has freed up the candidate to spend more time with rank-and-file voters, including her now-famous selfie lines. The head of Priorities USA, the Democratic Party\u2019s largest super PAC \u2015 which can collect and spend unlimited amounts of money, provided it does not coordinate directly with a candidate\u2019s campaign \u2015 said that Warren\u2019s announcement would not impact its plans. Both Obama\u2019s reelection campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign helped the group raise money with high-dollar fundraisers. \u201cFull speed ahead for Priorities USA,\u201d Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s chairman and chief strategist, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year,\u201d he added. The story has been updated with comments from End Citizens United and Priorities USA.",

      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " On Monday, a conservative news outlet published what some took to be damning evidence that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is a liar: Documents showing that Warren resigned from her public school teaching job in 1971, despite her story on the presidential campaign trail that she was fired or pushed out. \u201cBy the end of the first year I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u201d she said in June. What exactly happened became the subject of intense interest after the documents went up. Warren stood by her account, and teachers who worked at the school backed her up on what conditions were like for pregnant women. Additionally, all the historical evidence of the lack of protections for women at the time make clear that not only is there no evidence Warren was lying, but also that her experience was shared by many other women who were working in teaching or other professions. CBS News pressed Warren on whether she was \u201cfired\u201d or \u201cforced to resign,\u201d trying to get the terminology right. But the exact wording is almost beside the point. Discrimination \u2015 whether it\u2019s against pregnant women, members of the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities or so many others \u2015 doesn\u2019t always come with a clear-cut firing that lists the exact reason. Warren may have \u201cresigned,\u201d but it was clear that that was her only course of action. Employers now, just as they could then, can make workplaces so inhospitable for an employee that they essentially have no choice but to resign on their own or start looking for another job. It\u2019s still discrimination; it\u2019s known as \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d and can be considered the same as termination. \u201cThe employer doesn\u2019t want to actually fire somebody and leave their fingerprints on the adverse actions, so they make the circumstances of the job so unpleasant that [the employee is] left with no option other than to quit,\u201d said Lisa Banks, an attorney with Katz, Marshall & Banks who specializes in employment law. \u201cWe rarely have a smoking gun anymore,\u201d she added. \u201cEmployers tend to be savvy enough not to state outright the discriminatory motives for their termination.\u201d Emily Peck, a senior reporter at HuffPost, said that in the 1970s, her mother used a wheelchair while working as a social worker at a college. Officials decided to move her office up a flight of stairs. There were, however, no elevators in the building. She also \u201cresigned\u201d her position. HuffPost solicited stories of workplace discrimination on Twitter and heard from scores of people who were either outright fired or chose to resign after their workplace became unbearable. Many requested anonymity or that their first names be used so that they could speak freely. Maggie said that she received praise while working at a medical supply company \u2015 until she told her supervisor that she was pregnant. Almost immediately, she had a performance review and received dismal ratings, despite the top marks she had been getting previously. Maggie quickly began looking for a new job. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard to see where the boss/owner was going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was still super early in my pregnancy so plenty of time to come up with a reason to let me go. I couldn\u2019t take the risk.\u201d \u201cEmployers can make your life so terrible that people feel forced to resign because they\u2019re being to set up to fail. Anybody who you want to set up \u2015 you can create that paper trail, and people can tell that\u2019s happening to them, so often they\u2019ll resign rather than have a termination on their record,\u201d said Jenny Yang, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who served on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 2013 to 2018. Another woman working for a restaurant group heard a new chef make racist remarks. She notified her bosses, and a few days later, she \u2015 not the chef \u2015 was fired. They claimed she was \u201cno longer a good fit.\u201d Sacha said that when she became pregnant in 1999, she informed her boss at a tech company that she was pregnant. \u201cThe VP warmly congratulated me and rolled right along into how my next project would be recruiting and training my replacement. I was so stunned, I\u2019m not sure what happened next. Was I fired? Did I resign? I have no idea what HR records would reflect,\u201d she said. Yang said that while she was at the EEOC, it would have about 3,500 pregnancy discrimination charges a year, and in two-thirds of those cases, women would allege that they were fired as a result of their pregnancy. \u201cSo even today, it is very common that women experience termination when their employer learns of pregnancy. And sometimes, surprisingly, it\u2019s fairly obvious. Other times it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cMost employers know better than to say, \u2018Because you\u2019re pregnant, we\u2019re firing you.\u2019\u201d Debra Pickett\u2019s case played out far more publicly than most. In 2006, she was a prominent columnist with the Chicago Sun-Times, planning her return from maternity leave. (It wasn\u2019t even maternity leave, which she didn\u2019t get back then \u2015 it was disability leave, combined with some unpaid time off.) She wrote about current affairs, mixed with pieces about culture and her personal life \u2015 billed as what life was like for a single woman living in Chicago. Even on leave, she continued to write her column. But during that time, she, not surprisingly, started writing about her new baby as well. Editors moved her column from the coveted spot on A2, in the news section, to the features/lifestyle section. \u201cShe was a young, single Chicagoan,\u201d said features editor Christine Ledbetter at the time. \u201cThat was the mantra for the column. She morphed into what she morphed into. If she chose to write about her boyfriend and her baby, those are Lifestyles topics.\u201d The final straw, for Pickett, was an assignment she was given for when she came back: to go out and breastfeed her baby in public. A photographer would come along, and they\u2019d take note of the public reaction. \u201cIt was laughable,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIn lots of ways, defined and undefined, it was clear to me my position was shifting,\u201d she added. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be asked to travel, even though I would have. Things were being taken off the table.\u201d Pickett resigned. She recognized that she wasn\u2019t fired, demoted or given a pay cut. \u201cIt was better to just make a graceful exit,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really felt like the only option that I really felt like I had.\u201d This issue of discrimination is now before the Supreme Court as well. On Tuesday, the nine justices heard arguments over whether federal law forbids job discrimination on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. The Civil Rights Act forbids firing someone for race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The question is whether \u201csex\u201d encompasses sexual orientation and gender identity protections. In 29 states, there are no sexual orientation or gender identity workplace protections. Congress has failed to pass legislation that would explicitly write protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community into federal law. One in 10 LGBTQ workers have left a job because the environment was not accepting, according to a report by the Human Rights Campaign. One in 5 searched for a new job, and another 1 in 5 have stayed home from work because their place of employment felt unwelcoming. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s pretty damn common for LGBTQ people to face significant obstacles for being LGBTQ,\u201d HRC spokeswoman Charlotte Clymer said. One man told HuffPost that for three years, he was a prominent anchor on a local TV morning show. But as people at the station started learning he was gay, things quickly began to change. The breaking point came one evening, when a co-worker saw him at a gay bar. The next morning, his bosses informed him that he was off the morning show and demoted, with a pay cut, to a nighttime reporting position. \u201cYou\u2019re called in and you\u2019re told, you\u2019re off your show, and you say, \u2018Why?\u2019 They say, \u2018We\u2019re going to go in a different direction.\u2019 But the ratings are good, so why? And they won\u2019t say, but you know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know.\u201d",

In a 12-page memo, the Massachusetts senator outlined dozens of ways a Warren administration would \u201cfight for LGBTQ+ equality in solidarity with the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning.\u201d The measures include things like working to pass the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people, and amending the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure it can\u2019t be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Warren said she would reverse the Trump administration policy that bans transgender people from serving in the military, as well as appoint a special envoy to the State Department to oversee LGBTQ human rights. \u201cI have opposed the Trump Administration\u2019s shameful ban on transgender service members from the start, and I will reverse it on Day One,\u201d the senator wrote in her plan. Warren\u2019s plan highlights the recent murders of transgender people in the U.S., most of them trans women of color, and states \u201cit is time for a president to say their names and honor their memory.\u201d The senator included a number of measures aimed at reducing violence against trans women of color, including reversing the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s proposal to allow homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to their services. Warren released the plan ahead of her participation in a Thursday town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign that will focus on issues affecting the LGBTQ community. The senator is also expected to join the Las Vegas Pride Parade on Friday. Thursday\u2019s plan comes on the heels of a sweeping climate justice proposal Warren released on Wednesday and which reads as an ambitious blueprint of how to implement a Green New Deal. Like her LGBTQ plan, Warren\u2019s climate proposal looks at addressing the intersections of multiple issues \u2015 in this case how race and privilege play into conversations about the environment. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo.",

Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked the 2020 presidential candidate how she would respond if an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d supporter approached her on the campaign trail and said: \u201cMy faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2018then just marry one woman.\u2019 I\u2019m cool with that,\u201d Warren fired back. \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d The audience erupted with cheers and laughter: In response to a follow-up question from CNN moderator Chris Cuomo, Warren said that, despite growing up in a conservative household, she couldn\u2019t really recall a time where she felt differently about same-sex marriage. She cited the lyrics of a song she learned in church:\u00a0\u201cThey are yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight Jesus loves all the children of the world.\u201d She said that, although her exposure to same-sex couples was gradual during her upbringing in Oklahoma, the hatefulness that could be directed at the gay community shocked her, particularly from people of faith. Warren also tackled how Democrats could expect to pass the Equality Act, medical care for transgender people in the military and correctional facilities, cost-reduction for HIV medications, and decriminalizing HIV transmission, among other topics. She had just released a wide-ranging LGBTQ policy plan Thursday morning.",

The platform has also faced heavy scrutiny over the\u00a0role it played in the widespread dissemination of misinformation\u00a0about candidates including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Democratic presidential race that had been largely static through the summer has tumbled into a chaotic fall, shaped by unpredictable events and the deepening impeachment crisis surrounding President Donald Trump. Less than four months before voting begins, front-running candidates are facing urgent questions about their ability to challenge Trump, prompted by a health scare for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an uneven response by Joe Biden to the president\u2019s efforts to tie him to the impeachment inquiry and nagging questions about liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2018s electability. Lower-tier candidates are struggling just to be heard. The uncertainty is heightening anxieties among Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020. Although impeachment could imperil Trump\u2019s presidency, the process has also highlighted Trump\u2019s skill at discrediting his opponents, sometimes with baseless conspiracy theories. And Democrats appear no closer to sorting out what tactics, what ideology and what person is best-suited to overcome that. Progressive candidates like Sanders and Warren are surging in fundraising and drawing support from a wide swath of voters, according to polls, but face opposition from moderates who question whether now is the time to start the kind of sweeping \u2014 and divisive \u2014 economic and societal reforms they are pushing. It\u2019s a concern some moderates say has only increased against the backdrop of impeachment. \u201cThe divisions we have in the country threaten the health and stability of our democracy. President Trump has fractured so many norms,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cLike a patient getting over an illness or injury, we have to first heal the nation\u2019s divisions and reestablish our norms before we have the needed strength to successfully embrace and implement an array of big ideas.\u201d Vilsack, a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 race. He\u2019s been courted by, and consulted with, numerous candidates, and has spoken regularly with Warren. The Massachusetts senator has energized voters with a menu of detailed policy proposals, a folksy, relatable way of explaining them and a swell of small-dollar donations that brought in more than $24.6 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s increasingly turning her into a target for candidates who see her calls for overhauling health care and rebalancing wealth in America as outside the mainstream. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is trying to break into the upper rung, has focused in particular on Warren\u2019s health care plan, the Sanders\u2019-authored \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer system that Buttigieg describes as a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d But it\u2019s more than the policy Buttigieg is arguing against. \u201cWe have to be able not only to thrill a debate audience or a Twitter following but actually make something happen, which tells us that having the smartest policy is only half the battle when it comes to what will actually make a difference,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview. For now, Warren advisers are happy to have Sanders still in the race to help absorb those blows rather than becoming the sole target of the attacks. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey bolster each other\u2019s ideas.\u201d The confidence Sanders\u2019 campaign felt last week after announcing a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter \u2014 the highest in the race \u2014 was lessened after the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack. He told reporters this week that he planned to scale back his campaign, then said he had misspoken. He\u2019ll return to the campaign on Tuesday for a debate in Ohio. His advisers privately acknowledge that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry was escalating \u2014 may have helped limit the political fallout because attention was focused elsewhere. But they also understand that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 chief strategist, dismissed any long-term concerns, noting that the 2020 contest includes several older candidates, including the 73-year-old Trump. \u201cThere are a number of older candidates in the race, including the sitting president of the United States, and I can tell you with confidence, there\u2019s only one we can say with assurance whose arteries are completely open,\u201d Weaver said, referencing the stent procedure designed to clear Sanders\u2019 clogged arteries. Biden, 76, stands as the strongest obstacle to Warren and Sanders, fundamentally opposed on policy and pitching a more conciliatory approach to governing. The former vice president was already facing questions about whether he was out of step with the party\u2019s activist liberal base and up for the challenge of taking on Trump before he got pulled into the impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son. Although Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden are so far without foundation, the president and his allies have aggressively pressed the charges. Biden responded forcefully this week, but only after days of hand-wringing among supporters and advisers who worried he appeared ill-prepared for combatting the kind of asymmetrical political warfare at which Trump excels. Still, Biden backers contend that the mere fact that Trump has appeared focused on trying to take down Biden allows the former vice president to strengthen his electability argument by previewing what a one-on-one race with the president would look like. \u201cHe\u2019s able to go out there every day and make this Biden vs. Trump argument,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for Biden. That\u2019s the fear for some lower-tier candidates \u2014 that the head-to-head fight between Trump and Biden, and the grassroots support of Warren and Sanders, block out their opportunities for a late surge. Everyone is at risk, including those who have had flashes of success in recent months but are now languishing in the single digits in many polls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Buttigieg said there is no secret strategy for those candidates seeking to break out during this intense fall stride toward the first votes other than engaging in a \u201crespectful and robust\u201d debate of ideas. \u201cWhere there\u2019s an important difference, people need to understand that,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a set of \u201ccorporate accountability and democracy\u201d plans on Monday that radically reimagine the role of corporations in U.S. society \u2015 and should shake up an already vibrant debate about corporate power within the Democratic primary field. By far the boldest of the proposals is Sanders\u2019 plan to force large corporations to grant workers ownership of 20% of the shares issued by the company and 45% of the seats on the board of directors. The proposal would apply to all publicly traded companies, as well as privately held corporations with annual revenue of at least $100 million or balance sheets with the same amount. The package of reforms, which also includes a number of less spectacular changes to tax and regulatory laws, is perhaps the senator\u2019s biggest move so far to back up his identification as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d The Vermont independent has generally used that term to describe his support for New Deal-style, welfare-state liberalism, but with this proposal, he is getting closer to the kinds of economic democratization envisioned by members of the Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cFor more than 40 years, the largest and most profitable corporations in America have rigged the tax code and our economy to redistribute wealth and income to the richest and most powerful people in this country,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe American people are saying enough is enough.\u201d \u2015 Sanders argues that if workers have a greater say in their corporate employers\u2019 practices, those companies will be less likely to offshore jobs, overpay CEOs and pollute the communities in which they\u2019re located. \u201cEmployees in worker-owned companies are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else,\u201d his campaign states in its official description of the policy. \u201cThey play a central role in determining what the company does and how it is run.\u201d But critics of worker-owned companies, including some socialists, have noted that even those companies are subject to the competitive demands of a global, for-profit market. That means that worker-owners are often under pressure to embrace exploitative practices even if those practices negatively affect them and their co-workers. Still, Sanders believes that more worker-owners would at least be a monumental improvement on the status quo. With that in mind, he would also force corporations to give their workers the right of first refusal to buy the company before it is shuttered or sold. Companies that automate jobs or outsource them to cheaper workers in other countries would have to give the affected American employees shares in the company. And he would create a U.S. employee ownership bank, which would provide loans to workers trying to buy the companies that employ them, as well as centers to teach the advantages of worker ownership to employees and those business owners looking to sell. In addition, Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability plan features an array of changes to corporate governance, tax law and antitrust enforcement. Sanders would ban large-scale stock buybacks and force corporations to obtain new federal charters requiring them to weight the interests of the diverse array of stakeholders rather than just shareholders. He is calling for the restoration of the top corporate income tax rate of 35%, which was cut to 21% under President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut legislation, and the closing of loopholes and tightening of disclosure requirements to crack down on the use of offshore tax havens. Other Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker\u00a0of New Jersey, have said they are open to raising the top corporate tax rate to the high 20s, but not to its pre-2017 level. Sanders also plans to toughen up antitrust enforcement on U.S. corporations by overhauling the Federal Trade Commission; writing merger rules that weigh impacts on workers and innovation, rather than just price competition; and barring companies from forcing workers into non-compete agreements and other anti-competitive practices. As Sanders scrambles to improve his standing in the polls and regain momentum after his\u00a0heart attack at the start of the month, he has been releasing a steady stream of ambitious policy proposals, most of which relate to his signature issue of economic inequality. In the past few weeks, he has put out plans to eliminate medical debt, curb CEO pay\u00a0and get rid of corporate money in politics. Sanders\u2019 obvious competitor in the Democratic contest for progressive economic ideas is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has surpassed him in both national and early-state polling. The closest analog to Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability and democracy reforms is Warren\u2019s Accountable Capitalism Act, a bill she introduced in August 2018\u00a0that requires 40% of corporate board members to be chosen by employees. She does not yet have a plan to devolve corporate ownership to workers as well. Corporate reform has been a strong suit for Warren, but Sanders evidently believes it is an area where she can be bested. Warren drew criticism from left-wing commentators for a Friday tweet from her Senate account\u00a0that detractors thought painted an overly rosy picture of labor-management relations prior to the country\u2019s rightward economic shift in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cFor most of America\u2019s history, when our companies did better, our workers did better \u2015 and America built a thriving middle class,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Accountable Capitalism Act will help realign our skewed market incentives so companies & workers can once again do well together.\u201d The Sanders campaign still sees the types of working-class voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden as ripe targets for persuasion. But his team has grown increasingly willing to draw distinctions between him and Warren, signaling a weakening of the truce they had reportedly negotiated before launching their respective presidential campaigns. In an interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl that aired on Sunday, Sanders began to underscore their differences. \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, \u2018Enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWe need real change in this country.\u201d",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " It\u2019s a question every Democratic presidential candidate knows is coming, and yet it always trips them up. They have struggled at every Democratic primary debate so far this year when asked if they support higher taxes not just on the rich but on the middle class, as part of Democrats\u2019 ambitious domestic policy agenda. Debate moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at the Houston debate last month about universal health care:\u00a0\u201cWill middle-class taxes go up?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about health care,\u201d Warren said, launching into an explanation about how middle-class Americans would pay less under a universal health care system. Warren implied that taxes would go up, but refused to give Stephanopoulos a direct answer. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also avoided saying \u201cyes\u201d to the tax question that night. At the debate in June, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) blanched when asked if he\u2019d support a top marginal tax rate of 70%, saying meekly that he supports a tax code \u201cthat is fair to everyone.\u201d And this is the guy who offered a \u201chell yes\u201d when asked if he would confiscate people\u2019s assault weapons. The tax question is a trap, premised on the idea that raising taxes is always bad politics. The moderator already knows the candidate\u2019s position. Both the moderator and the candidate believe that answering with a simple \u201cyes\u201d would launch a thousand Republican attack ads. Not answering doesn\u2019t work either. After the September debate, TV analysts and the Republican National Committee bashed Warren\u00a0for not disavowing taxes and not embracing them. The question also ignores the underlying math. Under the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal that many candidates have endorsed in some form, the $3.5 trillion cost of the U.S. health care system would shift to the government, which currently pays about half of that total. Many households would pay higher taxes \u2015 in lieu of forking out for insurance premiums, copays and surprise medical bills. A single-payer system would have lower administrative costs, meaning that households would end up spending less on health care overall. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fair question because the thing people don\u2019t like about taxes is it means they have less money,\u201d said Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing think tank People\u2019s Policy Project. \u201cBut Medicare for All, as proposed, would mean that middle-class people would have more money, not less money.\u201d A fairer question would be to ask candidates to explain how they\u2019d convince voters of the tax tradeoff\u2019s benefits. Warren tried to do so last month while sidestepping the direct inquiry about a tax increase: \u201cFor hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.\u201d It might have been the best possible response, considering the circumstances, but it\u2019s worth examining the underlying assumption: Are middle-class tax increases really political poison? Vanessa Williamson, a scholar and Brookings Institution senior fellow who has done extensive research on public attitudes toward taxation, doesn\u2019t think so. Williamson previously studied the tea party backlash to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, interviewing activists who ostensibly hated taxes and deficits. She found they actually had favorable attitudes toward big government programs like Social Security and were more motivated by fears that Obama would shower government benefits on populations they considered undeserving, including immigrants and people of color. Williamson noticed that tea partiers frequently prefaced their gripes by saying, \u201cAs a taxpayer ...\u201d and it made her wonder: If these people hate taxes so much, why are they so proud of having paid taxes? Her research found that the seemingly anodyne concept of being a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is full of connotations heavily shaped by politics. \u201cPeople use the rhetoric about taxpaying to get at these bigger issues of who counts as an American and does the government represent people like me,\u201d she said in an interview. In other words, people are less angry about paying taxes than they are about what the government does with that money \u2015 and their understanding of \u201cgovernment\u201d is highly flexible. If a tax is linked to something people like, such as roads, schools, Social Security and Medicare, they don\u2019t hate it at all. Decades of white identity politics have had a major impact. Surveys have shown that someone who believes African Americans are entirely to blame for their economic disadvantages is also far more likely to dislike taxes and oppose public spending. Some of the evidence that people don\u2019t simply hate taxes has been hiding in plain sight. Overwhelming majorities of Americans have told pollsters for years that taxpaying is a civic duty and tax evasion is wrong. Again and again, nearly two-thirds of voters\u00a0tell Pew\u00a0that it bothers them \u201ca lot\u201d that corporations and the wealthy don\u2019t pay their fair share, while less than a third are bothered by what they themselves pay. Majorities of Americans consistently\u00a0tell Gallup that they think their own federal income tax burden is fair. Williamson thinks trends may even suggest a greater willingness to vote for\u00a0more taxes. According to her analysis, voters approved only 20% of tax-increase measures on statewide ballots in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, but in the last decade, voters have approved half of the dozens of tax-hike initiatives that made it onto their ballots. In 2012, for instance, voters in several states endorsed higher income taxes and taxes on marijuana sales. A HuffPost/YouGov survey this month found that 44% of Americans approve of a single-payer program in which all Americans get health insurance through a government plan, while 36% oppose.\u00a0If the program were financed with a tax on households worth more than $50 million, Americans were even likelier to support the proposal, with 50% in favor and 33% against. But if it were financed with a payroll tax, only 36% favored the idea and 39% opposed it. Republicans sometimes play identity politics by claiming that half of Americans don\u2019t pay taxes. Running for president in 2012, Mitt Romney said that 47% of the country pays no federal income tax, is hooked on welfare and will never vote Republican. \u201cAmericans perceive themselves as taxpayers but imagine that many other people, and especially lower-income people, do not pay taxes,\u201d Williamson wrote in her 2017 book, \u201cRead My Lips: Why Americans Are Proud to Pay Taxes.\u201d \u201cThe belief that many Americans are getting government benefits without paying into the system encourages opposition to social safety net spending.\u201d One reason that politicians can manipulate views on taxes is that the tax system itself is confusing.\u00a0Romney was correct that a significant percentage of Americans pay no federal income tax, but income tax is just part of the federal tax code. Even people who owe no income tax have Social Security and Medicare taxes automatically taken out of their paychecks, and those two payroll deductions represent more than a third of all federal revenue. (Federal income tax is also\u00a0incorrectly withheld from the paychecks of some low-wage workers who don\u2019t owe it and who ultimately never get it back in the form of a refund.) The payment of Social Security and Medicare taxes, however, doesn\u2019t get highlighted every year when Americans fill out their tax returns, and many people seem to believe, incorrectly, that someone who doesn\u2019t pay income tax isn\u2019t paying taxes at all. In fact, anyone who earns a paycheck is a federal taxpayer since Social Security and Medicare taxes are taken from a worker\u2019s very first dollar of income. In most states, anyone who buys almost anything at a store pays a state sales tax. One recent analysis argues that if you count state and local levies, the poor pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rich do. But comments like Romney\u2019s reinforce the notion that those taxes don\u2019t count \u2015 and surveys show that Republicans who follow the news are likelier to underestimate the share of Americans who pay taxes. There\u2019s another\u00a0womp-womp reason that Democrats have no good answer to the tax question: They helped lay this trap for themselves. When Democrats created Social Security retirement insurance in the 1930s \u2015 probably the most successful and popular social program in American history \u2015 they paid for it with a new payroll tax. But instead of calling it that, they often described the funding mechanism as \u201ccontributions\u201d made by workers that would eventually pay them an annuity. And when Democrats pushed higher income taxes on the middle class in the \u201940s and \u201950s, they stressed that this was only to pay for wars or to control inflation. During World War II, the Roosevelt administration hired Walt Disney to make propaganda cartoons that\u00a0literally blamed Adolf Hitler for higher taxes. This kind of tax rhetoric has had long-term consequences, according to Molly Michelmore, a historian at Washington and Lee University. Democrats \u201cfailed to link these new tax burdens to a coherent theory about the mutual obligations of the state and its citizens,\u201d Michelmore wrote in her 2012 book, \u201cTax and Spend: The Welfare State, Tax Politics, and the Limits of American Liberalism.\u201d In the \u201960s and \u201970s, the media increasingly focused on sensational stories about welfare fraud. Rather than defend public aid, Democrats turned to tax cuts to stimulate economic growth, which they said would reduce welfare caseloads.\u00a0Amid complaints about the freeloading poor, Republicans positioned themselves as the true defenders of taxpayers. Even as Congress cracked down on cash assistance, it expanded Social Security and added a new health insurance program, Medicare, funded from payrolls. And lawmakers nurtured tax preferences for things like homeownership and employer-sponsored health insurance \u2015 tax cuts that ultimately became pillars of middle-class American life. The tax expenditure for employee health insurance is one of the biggest of them all. It amounted to more than $300 billion in 2018 \u2015 about the size of four food stamp programs. Thus, Social Security and Medicare became \u201centitlements\u201d earned by a lifetime of labor, the concept of direct assistance turned toxic, and enormous tax expenditures remained essentially hidden. When\u2019s the last time you heard someone say they were grateful for the exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance from their taxable income? \u201cLiberals created this discourse,\u201d Michelmore said told HuffPost. Today, Democrats still want to reduce material hardship in the U.S., but their ideas often use the tax code, lest anyone think they\u2019re giving out cash rather than creating market incentives.\u00a0Democratic candidates and members of Congress have put forward a variety of proposals that would use taxes to slash child poverty, reduce child care costs and make housing more affordable. \u201cThis is not a massive new federal program,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said of one such bill\u00a0earlier this year. \u201cIt cuts child poverty by 40%, but it does it as a tax credit.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible to come up with a defense of taxing and spending. The simplest and most famous is a 1927 quote from Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201cTaxes are what we pay for a civilized society.\u201d (The most infamous argument was Obama\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that\u201d gaffe from 2012, in which he mangled a much better articulation \u2015 by Warren \u2015 of how entrepreneurs benefit from publicly funded infrastructure.) Still, neither Williamson nor Michelmore thinks it would be wise for Democratic candidates to embrace taxes in response to an unfair debate question,\u00a0given the way that criticism of \u201ctax and spend\u201d policies leverages decades of unhelpful political messaging. In an open letter to CNN, Tax March, a coalition of liberal organizations like the Center for American Progress and Americans for Tax Fairness, asked for no more \u201cquestions in which proposals like Medicare-for-All are colored as being a possible tax increase on the middle class.\u201d\u00a0The group also tried to call out the network in a national commercial, but they said that CNN, which hosted the July debate and is set to co-host the October one, refused to air the ad. It did play on local TV in Washington, D.C., and in Ohio, where the October debate is happening. Sanders sometimes acknowledges that Medicare for All would come with higher taxes. At the June debate, he said the middle class \u201cwill pay more in taxes but less in health care [costs] for what they get\u201d under his proposal. In the September debate, when he was asked the question\u00a0again, he thought better of his answer, stressing instead that nobody would pay more than $200 per year for prescription drugs under his plan. Joe Biden bashed him anyway, saying people would pay higher income taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s a reality,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a bad idea if you like it. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Massachusetts Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren began her campaign with a challenge to the other Democratic presidential candidates: No super PACs, and no self-funding. Now, as she firmly ensconces herself in the top tier of 2020 candidates, she\u2019s issuing another challenge: Every other Democratic presidential candidate should reveal the names of any donor or fundraiser who has a title with the campaign, and should report the date, location and host committee of any event they hold to raise funds. She also proposes making such disclosure mandatory if she becomes president. \u201cIf Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so \u2015 but they shouldn\u2019t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post Tuesday announcing her new campaign finance policy. \u201cVoters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition \u2015 and how much it costs.\u201d Warren has long made the corrupting influence of money in politics a signature issue. Her new proposal is meant to serve as both a contrast with top rival Joe Biden, who has relied on ties to wealthy donors to fund his campaign war chest, and as preparation for the general election, where Warren hopes to showcase her support for good government measures against President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption. It\u2019s also another signal Warren\u2019s top priority as president would be changing Washington\u2019s internal rules in ways that make progressive successes more likely. \u201cOur democracy shouldn\u2019t be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. It belongs to all of us. When we use our voices and our votes, we can make real change \u2015 big, structural change,\u201d Warren wrote on Medium. \u201cThat\u2019s why getting big money out of politics and addressing corruption in Washington are so important. These reforms make it possible to do everything else we need to do \u2015 from addressing climate change to forgiving student loans.\u201d Warren is also proposing a sharp limits on corporate PACs, making it more difficult to set up super PACs dedicated to a single candidate, banning lobbyists from donating to or fundraising for any candidate, significantly reforming the Federal Election Commission, lowering the maximum donation to a federal candidate or committee, and establishing a publicly financed matching program for small donations. Warren promised not to take donations of more than $200 from executives at \u201cbig tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,\u201d and to turn down corporate donations to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee next summer. Last week, she announced she wouldn\u2019t hold any fundraisers for her campaign during the general election, but would attend fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee, state Democratic parties and other candidates. The chances of Biden and other candidates who use big-money fundraisers to pad their campaign coffers complying with Warren\u2019s challenge to reveal extensive details about their donors and fundraisers are essentially zero \u2015 although the details of many fundraisers leak to the press regardless, and Biden has allowed journalists to cover his fundraisers. But the Warren campaign may view the challenge as a potential way to set herself apart from Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg or other candidates if the race turns ugly. Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third-leading candidate in the Democratic race, both rely nearly exclusively on small-dollar online fundraising, and have not held high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign. Beyond her own personal pledges, Warren also wants to sharply limit corporate PACs. Many Democrats in recent years have pledged to not take money from corporate PACs, which are created by companies to bundle donations from executives and funnel them to politicians. Warren would make corporate PAC donations to candidates illegal. She\u2019s also proposing making it illegal to consider campaign contributions when appointing ambassadors. Politicians in both parties have used plum diplomatic gigs as a way to reward major campaign donors. And she\u2019ll close a loophole that has allowed some foreign companies to influence American elections. She also wants to make it much harder to run a super PAC backing a single candidate. Often, these super PACs are run by operatives who are longtime allies of a politician, and are able to anticipate the candidate\u2019s plan and use the candidate\u2019s authority when courting voters. Warren would bar anyone with a \u201cpolitical, personal, professional, or family relationship\u201d with a candidate from running a super PAC backing them. Warren would also lower the maximum contribution to a candidate from $2,800 to $1,000, and limit donations to political parties \u2015 which right now can reach into the hundreds of thousands \u2015 to $10,000. At the same time, she would use \u201cpenalties coming from corporate malfeasance and major tax crimes\u201d to fund a program that would provide a 6-to-1 match of any donation under $200. \u201cLowering contribution limits, combined with 6-1 matching funds for small dollar contributions, will shift incentives for candidates: it will make it less valuable to spend time raising money from big dollar donors and more valuable to spend time with ordinary voters,\u201d Warren wrote. And Warren is proposing changing the structure of the Federal Election Commission, which has been gridlocked in recent years. Instead of a six-person board of three Democrats and three Republicans, she would create a board of two Democrats, two Republicans and a lone independent, making tie votes far less likely. She\u2019s also proposing increasing the FEC\u2019s funding for investigations, and giving it more power to impose fines.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate gives the three Democratic front-runners a chance to answer recent doubts about their campaigns, while nine other candidates \u2014 the largest political lineup on a single stage \u2014 get a new shot at the political spotlight in hopes of rising or at least remaining relevant. Former Vice President Joe Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months but will have to answer persistent though baseless allegations by Republican President Donald Trump of overseas wrongdoing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has climbed to co-front runner but faces new questions about her biography. And Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is out to prove he has the stamina for hours on stage, less than two weeks after a heart attack forced him to temporarily suspend campaigning. The other candidates will be struggling just to get noticed \u2014 trying to make up ground in a race that kicks officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. The debate marks the first time the candidates meet since the House moved forward with the Trump impeachment inquiry. While they are united on that issue, the debate again exposes a political party that\u2019s yet to coalesce around a unifying message or messenger. The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years. The White House hopefuls represent the political and personal diversity that has come to define the Democratic Party of 2019, including four women, four people of color, an openly gay man and an age range that spans four decades. Age was already a concern for the 78-year-old Sanders, the oldest presidential hopeful, even before he was taken to a Nevada hospital earlier this month and had two stents put in to clear a clogged artery. Sanders and his allies insist the health scare has only strengthened his commitment to the 2020 contest \u2014 and his case for his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan. \u201cBernie is a political marathon runner,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 confidante RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of National Nurses United. \u201cI think the debate is going to be a great reassurance to the public.\u201d In an email to supporters, Sanders wrote, \u201cTonight\u2019s debate is important, no doubt about it, and I am ready.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign said she went for a walk as part of her usual debate day routine \u2014 but the senator was likely to face far more scrutiny than in previous intraparty face-offs. Biden, 76, and others have jabbed at Warren\u2019s intense focus on detailed liberal policies that may be difficult to implement with a divided Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has highlighted the absence of a specific Warren health care plan. She has embraced Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan instead. Republicans, meanwhile, have raised questions about whether Warren, 70, was actually forced from her teaching job because of a pregnancy nearly a half century ago, a claim that has become a core part of her personal message. Critics have pointed to past speeches and documents that suggest she left on her own. Warren is standing by her story. The issue is particularly threatening because it\u2019s not the first time she has been accused of embellishing her biography. Warren has already apologized for claiming Native American heritage decades ago. While it showed distant tribal ancestry, it also sparked a rebuke from some Native Americans. \u201cThe good news is that most attempts to attack Warren actually make her stronger,\u201d said Adam Green, a Warren supporter and co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Biden enters the fourth round of Democratic debates under the weight of intensifying questions from Trump about his family\u2019s work overseas. Without providing evidence, Trump has repeatedly said that Biden\u2019s 49-year-old son, Hunter, improperly profited from work in Ukraine and China while the elder Biden was vice president. The president also insists that Biden used his office to protect his son from allegations of wrongdoing. Hunter Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday morning he did nothing wrong while engaging in foreign work as a Washington lawyer specializing in corporate governance. But he also noted he failed to take into account the potential implications for his father\u2019s political career. Joe Biden has promised to bar family members from occupying any office within the White House if elected \u2014 a departure from Trump. Many other candidates, meanwhile, are fighting for political survival. Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris are trying to crack the top tier. Also debating are New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Making his debate debut \u2014 and likely angling for a splash \u2014 is billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party\u2019s rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate. Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September\u2019s debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday\u2019s a record. Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights. Buttigieg further sharpened his critique of Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All on Tuesday by releasing an online ad naming Warren and Sanders. Buttigieg has described Warren as \u201cevasive\u201d in how she would finance her health care vision and suggests in the new ad that Medicare for All would force millions of Americans, including workers covered by union contracts, off private insurance. \u201cI\u2019m not pushing Medicare for All whether you want it or not,\u201d says the 37-year-old mayor \u2014 the kind of critique Warren may face more of on the debate stage. ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

In the first moments of the Democratic presidential debate, Warren asked voters to \u201clook what happened as a result\u201d of the failure of lawmakers to charge Trump with obstruction of justice based on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller issued the probe\u2019s report in late March. \u201cDonald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke the law again this fall,\u201d Warren said, referring to the president\u2019s push for foreign countries to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, another of the Democratic presidential contenders. \u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be able to break the law over and over without consequence.\u201d Impeachment dominated the opening minutes of the debate, with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper pressing the issue with each of the 12 candidates on stage at Otterbein University, Ohio. In their support for the start of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the candidates were unusually united. Asked if Congress had any choice but to impeach Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) replied with a forceful, \u201cNo they don\u2019t.\u201d Sanders slammed Trump as \u201cthe most corrupt president in the history of this country,\u201d a line echoed shortly afterward by Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Sanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to \u201cdo the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate\u201d \u2015 something McConnell has not committed to doing if the House refers articles of impeachment as a result of its ongoing inquiry. Harris was one of several candidates touting her support of not just the impeachment inquiry but of the need to remove the president. \u201cI know a confession when I see it. He did it in plain sight,\u201d Harris said, referring to Trump openly calling for Ukraine and China to investigate Biden. \u201cHe has given us the evidence. It\u2019s just being observant.\u201d Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas said, \u201cIf there is not justice, we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country.\u201d Other candidates were more cautious, supporting impeachment but making clear they were not eager for the issue to take center stage or appear \u201chyperpartisan,\u201d in the words of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro endorsed the impeachment process but quickly twisted away from the question to tout their positions on economic issues or foreign policy. \u201cThis has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cWe have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, not rips us apart.\u201d",

      "content": " WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2015 Public polls are mixed about whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is now the leading candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field. But the behavior of the other candidates on the stage at the fourth Democratic debate on Tuesday night indicated she is. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas all took shots at Warren in the first hour of the debate at Otterbein University in this suburb of Columbus. Buttigieg and Klobuchar both attacked Warren for her support of a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, arguing she was lying to voters about whether middle-class taxes would go up. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d Warren responded by repeating her standard answer when challenged on this point and pledging she wouldn\u2019t support a plan that raised overall costs on middle-class families. She also attacked Buttigieg\u2019s health care plan as insufficient to cover all Americans. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, whenever someone hears the term \u2018Medicare for all who want it,\u2019 understand what that really means: It\u2019s Medicare for all who can afford it,\u201d she responded. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard. It\u2019s the way we get health care coverage for every single American.\u201d Klobuchar made perhaps the most sustained attack on Warren, trying to challenge her on specific issues and on the very essence of her candidacy. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d Klobuchar said. O\u2019Rourke made perhaps the most unexpected attack on Warren, arguing she hasn\u2019t made it clear if her plans would increase taxes on the middle class and \u201cis more focused on being punitive or pitting one part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up.\u201d (Warren has proposed a 2% wealth tax on the richest Americans.) \u201cI\u2019m really shocked that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive. I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d Warren responded, again repeating she wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on middle-class families.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stood her ground on her plan for a wealth tax on Tuesday, saying that billionaires should be able to pitch in 2 cents \u201cso every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d \u201cSo, I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your tax plans, and we\u2019ll know what your values are,\u201d she said at the Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times in Westerville, Ohio. The candidates were asked about supporting a wealth tax on billionaires, a plan that only Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have proposed and openly advocated for. Warren\u2019s plan would impose a 2% tax on households with net worths of more than $50 million, with an additional 1% on wealth above $1 billion. The Massachusetts senator claims the tax plan would cover universal child care, universal pre-kindergarten, billions in funding for historically black colleges and better teacher pay. But more moderate Democrats have shied away from the proposal, fearing it wouldn\u2019t win them the election. \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s why does everyone else on this stage think it\u2019s more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a moderate Democrat, used Warren\u2019s answer to go after the candidate, who is currently one of the party\u2019s front-runners and surging in polls. Klobuchar has not yet reached the polling threshold to qualify for the fifth Democratic debate in November. \u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, who made his first appearance on a debate stage Tuesday. \u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump,\u201d the Minnesota senator added, hinting that Warren\u2019s approach will not help Democrats beat the president. Warren responded by defending being more radical in her ideas and explaining that a wealth tax would yield more than an income tax. \u201cThe rich are not like you and me,\u201d Warren told Klobuchar. \u201cThe really, really billionaires are making money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. \u201cI understand that this is hard,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cBut I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard. Not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " Despite repeated demands by a moderator and her Democratic presidential opponents, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts refused to take the bait on a question about tax hikes on the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio. Moderator Marc Lacey asked Warren if she supported higher middle-class taxes to pay for a national health care program known as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2015 at least the third time essentially the same question has come up at a Democratic debate. Warren gave the same answer she\u2019s given many times before:\u00a0\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d she said. Warren focuses on \u201ccosts\u201d because her Medicare for All vision would trade higher taxes for lower household costs, and she doesn\u2019t want to focus on the taxes in isolation. Conventional wisdom holds that middle-class tax hikes are political poison, and research has shown that messaging about tax hikes can leverage negative voter attitudes on government spending and race.\u00a0Warren has apparently decided a direct answer isn\u2019t worth it. Lacey pressed Warren, asking if she would explicitly acknowledge, as has rival White House contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), that Medicare for All would involve higher taxes. She again refused, stressing instead that overall costs would go down for middle-class families. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who on some issues has positioned himself as a centrist among the Democratic candidates, pounced. \u201cWe heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is why people in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington.\u201d Warren has not outlined exactly how she would pay for Medicare for All, but by refusing to rule out tax increases, she has implied they\u2019d be part of her plan. On Tuesday, she came closer to such an acknowledgment when she said, \u201cWe can pay for this.\u201d Possible funding options that Sanders has suggested in the past include higher payroll taxes and higher taxes on the wealthy. A HuffPost / YouGov poll this week found that pairing Medicare for All with a tax on the super-rich made the health care proposal more popular. Sanders offered a more forthright explanation of the taxes-and-benefits tradeoff under Medicare for All, a proposal he originally sponsored in the Senate. \u201cPremiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.\u201d Sanders said, adding that the overwhelming majority of Americans would pay less overall. \u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cThey will go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase will be substantially less \u2015 substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota praised Sanders for being direct. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this, and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we\u00a0 owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\u201d It was faint praise for Sanders because Klobuchar \u2015 along with Buttigieg \u2015 doesn\u2019t support Medicare for All.",

      "author": "Emma Gray",
      "content": " At Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Elizabeth Warren got into a heated exchange over the best way to tax the wealthiest Americans. This exchange was tense but fairly mundane \u2015 a Democratic moderate going after a progressive who is leading in the polls. And it wasn\u2019t the first time that Klobuchar had gone on the attack against Warren during the night. Earlier, Klobuchar referred to the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan that Warren supports as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Neither candidate held back in her critiques of the other (see: Warren\u2019s pointed smirk when Klobuchar referred to her as just \u201cElizabeth\u201d), and both Warren\u2019s and Klobuchar\u2019s answers on taxes and health care made clear their differing political priorities and world views. The only thing out of the ordinary about it was that both of these candidates are women. And there was something wildly refreshing about seeing a primary debate stage with enough women on it that they could get into vigorous, healthy \u2015 and yes, heated, even tense \u2015 arguments over policy. \u201cAmy Klobuchar\u2019s simmering hatred for Elizabeth Warren is not feminism, but it doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d tweeted feminist conmentator Shelby Knox. \u201cFeminism is having 4 women, 2 of them [women of color], on the #demdebate stage, running for president. They don\u2019t have to get along.\u201d Klobuchar and Warren represent just half of the women who qualified for Tuesday\u2019s debate \u2015 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) also joined the 12-person debate stage. Harris and Warren debated each other about big tech and whether Twitter should suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account. Klobuchar chimed in to talk about monopolies. None of these disagreements were over \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d per se. (It\u2019s also worth noting that all the candidates \u2015 not just the women \u2015 were asked directly about abortion rights by moderator Erin Burnett.) These candidates represent a diversity of not just political ideology but of personal experience. They span generations, racial identities and religious identities. They bring different strengths and weaknesses to the table. In short, they are like any other set of Democratic presidential candidates, gender being only one relevant detail of their lives and political careers. When there isn\u2019t a singular woman inadvertently tasked with representing all American women, female politicians are free to simply be politicians. This is something that Hillary Clinton struggled with during the 2016 presidential campaign. She was THE woman, saddled with all of the baggage of institutional sexism and misogyny, and all the weight of being THE FIRST. She just didn\u2019t\u2026 look presidential. She was just a little\u2026 shrill. A little\u2026 cold. A little\u2026 nasty. A woman could absolutely \u2015 should absolutely \u2015 be president. Just not her. But when there are more women out there campaigning, these baseless, sexist digs simply don\u2019t land in the same way. \u201cEvery woman [who] runs makes it easier for the next woman,\u201d Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for EMILY\u2019s List, told HuffPost in January, \u201cin part because it changes the way we look at candidates.\u201d There is also a pressure, when there is just one woman candidate, for all women to line up behind her. In 2016, Gloria Steinem was criticized for suggesting that younger women were supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) because that\u2019s where \u201cthe boys\u201d were. Understandably, many young female voters felt offended at the idea that their politics must align with Clinton simply because they shared a gender identity with her. Again, not having just one and only woman candidate relieves this pressure and allows the women running for president to make it crystal clear that women are by no means a monolith. In January, when the presidential primary was just kicking off, I wondered whether \u201cin 2020, the sheer number of them out on the campaign trail and on the debate stage, expressing a variety of political views, even arguing with each other while displaying a variety of demeanors, will force voters to look at women politicians as individual candidates, rather than as avatars for 52 percent of the population.\u201d If Tuesday night\u2019s debate is any indication, we\u2019re on our way there.",

      "content": " More than two-thirds of the way into the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden took a casual swipe at his rivals without specifying whom he was speaking about exactly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d When a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d What happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms. Sanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Sanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage. Then it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. \u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d Warren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d Biden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " The fourth\u00a0Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night confirmed what has been evident in the polls for some time: Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(D-Mass.) has overtaken former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden as the front-runner in the race for the party\u2019s nomination. The other candidates on stage in Westerville, Ohio, treated the senator from Massachusetts as the new favorite, hammering her repeatedly over her evasiveness when confronted with questions about her health care and wealth inequality plans. Biden, in contrast to the previous debates, often seemed like more of an after-thought. The former vice president still got in his hits against President Donald Trump, but his rivals mostly ignored him. Here are some key takeaways from the debate. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang all took shots at Warren. Buttigieg and Klobuchar got that bandwagon going early when they criticized Warren for\u00a0not giving a straight answer to a question about whether middle-class taxes would go up under \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government-sponsored health care proposal she has backed. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d Klobuchar quickly piled on:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but ... the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d Warren responded by repeating her usual answer when challenged on this point, focusing on the bottom-line effect the plan would have on middle-class families and pledging she wouldn\u2019t support a proposal that raised overall costs for them. Republicans have also attacked Warren over not being willing to address the question, which she has dismissed as \u201cRepublican framing.\u201d Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke also went after Warren over her proposal to levy a 2% wealth tax on the super-rich. \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth; nobody on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said. In a nod to Tom Steyer, the wealthy hedge fund manager who just recently entered the presidential race and was participating in his first debate, Klobuchar wryly added, \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect the billionaires.\u201d O\u2019Rourke joined in by accusing Warren of being \u201cmore focused on being punitive or pitting one part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up.\u201d Yang called out Warren for not addressing the threat automation poses to U.S. workers. That prompted several other candidates to address his signature universal basic income proposal \u2015 perhaps the biggest coup for his campaign so far. Biden didn\u2019t directly answer if it was wrong that during his tenure as vice president, his son Hunter served as a board member for the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings \u2015 which spurred Trump\u2019s controversial phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president, which in turn could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything to do with Ukraine. ... We always kept everything separate,\u201d Biden said about his son\u2019s work overseas. \u201cThere would be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made ... the fact of the matter is this is about Trump\u2019s corruption.\u201d Hunter Biden acknowledged in an interview with ABC airing Tuesday that it was \u201cpoor judgment\u201d on his part to join the venture, and conceded it was likely that his last name helped him professionally. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker actually gave a more succinct answer in defense of Biden, noting the hypocrisy of Trump and Republicans seeking to attempt to make hay of the matter, given the financial conflicts of interest that cloud the Trump administration. \u201cWe are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies, and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman,\u201d Booker said, referring to Joe Biden. Buttigieg and Klobuchar may have delivered their best debate performances yet. Buttigieg, in particular, seemed to put more sustained effort into positioning himself as an alternative for centrists to Biden. He played up his small-town roots by recalling driving past closed factories while growing up in the post-industrial Midwest. The 37-year-old also repeatedly expressed his aversion to Washington elites, calling out \u201csenators\u201d and \u201ccongressmen\u201d who have not gotten many things done during his \u201centire adult life.\u201d During a conversation on foreign policy and Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw troops in Syria, Buttigieg drew applause after he called for the U.S. to stand by its allies. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. Buttigieg made another nod to more moderate voters when he called out O\u2019Rourke for not giving more details on how the Texan\u2019s proposed mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns would work. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage \u2015 political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg, a military veteran, told O\u2019Rourke in one sharp exchange. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t look or sound like a guy who had a heart attack two weeks ago. He was as animated as ever,\u00a0landing sharp blows against Trump and other Democrats on stage. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d the 78-year-old said when asked about his health and age. After Booker jokingly interjected that Sanders supports medical marijuana, Sanders quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d The line elicited laughter and applause from the audience. But Sanders\u2019 best moment may have been a fast-ball at Biden after the former vice president asserted that he knew how to \u201cget stuff done,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t simply offer plans about how to do so. \u201cYou know what else you got done? You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill that\u2019s hurting middle-class Americans all over the country,\u201d Sanders retorted, referring to positions Biden took as a senator from Delaware. Steyer, whose focus is on combating climate change, started strong in the debate\u2019s opening act, saying that \u201cevery candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.\u201d That may have been his only good line of the night, however, as the debate hummed along and he barely made his presence felt. California Sen. Kamala Harris also needed a breakout moment \u2015 similar to the one she enjoyed in the first debate in June \u2015 to reverse her struggling poll numbers. She won applause and good marks from women\u2019s rights groups when she noted that none of the previous encounters had featured any direct questions about reproductive rights, calling the omission \u201coutrageous.\u201d Ultimately, this debate did feature such a query. But Harris, meanwhile, had nothing that would qualify as a standout remark or exchange.",

      "content": " The question of whether \u201cMedicare for All\u201d would be a winner for the middle class has been a big topic in the 2020 presidential campaign and it came up again in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate. By now, you may be familiar with the arguments. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), author of a leading Medicare for All proposal, openly concedes that it will require some new taxes to finance the cost of generous insurance for everybody. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has endorsed the Sanders bill, refuses to admit\u00a0that taxes would go up, presumably because she doesn\u2019t want to give Republicans fodder for an attack ad. But the underlying arguments from the two are actually the same. Whatever middle-class Americans ended up paying into a new Medicare for All system, Sanders and Warren say, it would be less than what they pay for the current system in the form of private health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs and lost wages. On Tuesday night, Warren turned that claim into a vow. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d Can she deliver on that promise? Can Sanders? Can any backer of Medicare for All? It\u2019s impossible to say definitively right now because the answer depends on some key details still missing\u00a0from the existing proposals. The Sanders bill, for example, doesn\u2019t specify which taxes it would raise. It also doesn\u2019t indicate exactly how the new program would pay doctors, hospitals and other providers of medical care. But you can get a sense of how Medicare for All might look in practice by looking closely at a structurally similar state-level proposal in New York that progressives have been promoting and that was the subject of a thorough analysis last year. The analysis found that the middle class really did come out ahead, although that determination came with a few, very important caveats that frequently get lost in these debates. The proposal is called the New York Health Act\u00a0and, like Medicare for All, it would wipe out nearly all existing insurance arrangements to enroll everybody into a brand-new, state-run program. Financing under the NYHA would come from taxes on payrolls and non-wage income (interest, dividends, etc.). Progressives have been pushing for the idea to get a serious hearing in the New York state legislature, now that Democrats finally have full control. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. But last year, the Rand Corporation, an independent think tank with its own model for projecting the effects of health care proposals, produced a detailed report on how the NYHA might work out in practice. It\u2019s not an easy calculation to make, because introducing such a system would inevitably cause so many changes, some of which would push in opposite directions from others. People would start using more health care services, for instance, because they had coverage for the first time or because the NYHA plan, like Medicare for All, would be more generous than existing coverage. That would tend to drive up the program\u2019s costs. On the other hand, the NYHA plan would simplify billing and administration, in part because doctors and hospitals wouldn\u2019t have to spend time communicating and haggling with private insurers. That would tend to reduce costs. In the end, Rand researchers determined, the NYHA as designed would reduce overall spending on medical care in New York state. And as long as taxes to pay for the program were sufficiently progressive, the benefits would flow primarily away from the rich and toward lower- and middle-income groups. Specifically, the richest 10% of New Yorkers would be paying more for health care on average, while the other 90% would pay the same or less. That sounds a lot like the kind of plan that Sanders and Warren promise \u2015 which is to say, it sounds a lot like a plan that would work out well for most Americans. But this is where those caveats come in. In a single-payer system like the NYHA or Medicare for All, the government sets prices for the suppliers and providers of medical care, including not just drug companies but also doctors and hospitals. That\u2019s why these sorts of proposals can show such big savings. The NYHA doesn\u2019t actually specify what the plan would pay doctors and hospitals, so Rand researchers had to make some assumptions. They figured that, at the outset, health\u00a0providers would be paid at rates that matched the average of what all the different payers in New York (Medicaid, private insurance, etc.) pay now. But over time, Rand researchers assumed, the new system would aggressively limit year-to-year inflation, imposing the kind of cost discipline that does not exist now. This is how universal coverage systems in the rest of the world control costs. But here in the U.S., where such controls have never existed on such a widespread basis, lobbying groups representing the health care industry would fight hard to avoid such limits on their payments. And there\u2019s good reason to think those lobbyists would prevail \u2015 if not by killing Medicare for All outright, then by winning much more favorable terms on payment. That would inflate the program\u2019s cost, forcing the government to raise more revenue. But there are limits to how high taxes on high earners can go, because at some point \u201ctax avoidance\u201d \u2015 that is, people finding ways to shield income or qualify for lower rates \u2015 makes it difficult to increase revenue. \u201cCreating a single-payer plan where the wealthy pay more and everyone else comes out no worse or ahead would require a delicate balance of high tax rates for the wealthy that do not cause substantial tax avoidance and moderate to low tax rates for everyone else,\u201d Jodi Liu, chief author of the Rand report, told HuffPost. \u201cThe overall tax revenue needed would depend critically on how much providers are paid.\u201d Then there is the other big asterisk in the Rand report. It\u2019s one thing to say that, on average, people in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care. It\u2019s quite another thing to say that every single person in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care. In reality, for each income group, at least some individuals would likely find themselves paying more, not less, once a Medicare for All system took effect. Imagine, for example, a 30-year-old who today buys a minimalist policy directly from an insurer \u2015 say, one of the \u201cbronze\u201d plans with relatively skimpy benefits that barely meet the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage standards. Because that plan covers so little and because 30-year-olds pay lower premiums than older people, that bronze plan is probably pretty cheap. The bronze plan could easily cost less than the new taxes for Medicare for All and maybe a lot less, depending on how much money the 30-year-old makes and just how skimpy that plan is. The Rand analysis of the NYHA makes this quite clear. The report\u2019s appendix breaks down the effect that the plan would have within specific income groups. Within the middle income groups \u2015 those with annual income between 139%\u00a0and 400% of the poverty line, or about $35,790 to $103,000 for a family of four \u2015 there is always a fraction for whom the NYHA taxes are more than they would have spent for health care under the status quo. The percentage of people on the hook for higher costs would generally be fairly small.\u00a0But the \u201crate shock\u201d that came with the Affordable Care Act, when people suddenly discovered their insurance cost more than it did the previous year, also affected a tiny portion of the population. It created a huge backlash anyway. That doesn\u2019t mean the same thing would happen with Medicare for All. One reason the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rate shock led to so much anger is that the new Obamacare plans came with high deductibles.\u00a0Lots of people felt like they were paying more but not getting great insurance in return. The whole point of Medicare for All, like the NYHA, is to give everybody better insurance than they have today. Even people who felt worse off in the transition to Medicare for All might be grateful for the switch later on. That 30-year-old with a bronze policy today could be in real trouble if they got hit with serious medical expenses, given that deductibles on bronze plans can approach $7,000. And under Medicare for All, the 30-year-old would probably have more choices of doctors and hospitals. Bronze plans are famous for their tiny provider networks. All of this assumes that Rand\u2019s projections are basically on target \u2015 and that the New York plan is a reasonable proxy for how Medicare for All might work out in the nation as a whole. But projections can be wrong and New York, like any state, has plenty of idiosyncrasies that make extrapolating from it difficult. To the extent experts have tried to perform similar analyses on the Sanders proposal, the verdict has been mixed, depending in part on assumptions they made about missing details in the bill. In 2016, Kenneth Thorpe, an Emory University economist who had served in the Clinton administration, concluded that tax hikes necessary to finance the Sanders proposal would leave nearly three-quarters of working households that previously had private coverage owing more in taxes than they would have owed in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. But just this week, the Commonwealth Fund and the\u00a0Urban Institute released a new report about health care options and concluded that, in a plan that looks like Medicare for All, \u201chigher-income people will likely face the greatest increases in taxes, meaning their new tax burdens would likely exceed their savings; the reverse is likely true for lower-income populations.\u201d As Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost, \u201cA Medicare for All plan absolutely can be designed to fulfill the promise that the middle class would on average pay less for health care. But it requires some big trade-offs to do that.\u201d So far,\u00a0those trade-offs haven\u2019t gotten much attention.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " INDIANOLA, Iowa \u2014 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday she will roll out a plan to pay for an expansive single-payer health care system in the coming weeks, promising the plan would decrease overall costs for the middle class. \u201cI plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks, specifically, about the cost of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and how we pay for it,\u201d Warren said at the end of a town hall here at Simpson College. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of health care for middle-class families.\u201d Warren\u2019s aides have long suggested she was studying ways to pay for the health care plan originally backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of her leading rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. In recent days, Warren has faced criticism from lower-profile candidates in the race \u2014 especially South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 for her failure to explain how she would pay for the ambitious plan, which would replace private health insurance with generous, universal coverage paid for by the federal government. \u201cEverybody who is running for president right now knows that families are getting crushed by the high cost of health care,\u201d Warren told the crowd of nearly 500 people. \u201cThey also know that the cheapest possible way to make sure that everyone gets the health care that they need is Medicare for All.\u201d  Warren\u2019s statement came after her standard 40-minute stump speech and three questions from attendees, none of whom asked about Medicare for All. The addition appeared to be an attempt to short-circuit recent criticisms of her health care plan. Warren has previously promised, most recently at the Oct. 15 debate, that no middle-class family would see an increase in overall health care costs. And her aides have said since at least September that she was evaluating ways to pay for Medicare for All. She does not plan to significantly alter the details of the legislation she\u2019s co-sponsored with Sanders in the way Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) did with her own health care proposal over the summer. Warren said she had been working on the problem of how to pay for the legislation for \u201cmonths and months.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a little more work until it\u2019s finished,\u201d she said. For a campaign that has long prided itself on detailed policy proposals, releasing a plan to pay for Medicare for All \u2014 which is sure to generate intense scrutiny from the media and her rivals for the nomination \u2014 is a high-risk but likely necessary move. Whether or not a plan for Medicare for All would lower costs for the middle class would rely heavily on complicated details, including how progressive the tax system supporting the plan is and how aggressively the government is able to control the cost of health care. Estimates of how much the plan would cost vary wildly, as do estimates of how much switching to a single-payer system would increase or decrease overall health care costs. Buttigieg, in particular, has aggressively questioned how Warren would pay for the plan, and said she is being dishonest by not saying whether or not taxes would go up for middle-class families. Sanders has said taxes would likely go up, while overall costs would drop. But Warren has resisted the question, arguing that admitting taxes would rise is equal to accepting a dishonest Republican framing of the issue.\u00a0Warren has also attacked Buttigieg\u2019s plan for failing to cover every American, dubbing it \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,\u201d Buttigieg said at the debate. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward.\u201d Soon, Buttigieg will get his answer.",

      "subtitle": "The sweeping plan also takes aim at charters, suggesting they divert precious resources away from traditional public schools.",
      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released a sweeping K-12 education plan Monday, unveiling proposals designed to chip away at school segregation, beat back high-stakes testing and crack down on charter schools. The detailed plan also seeks to equalize school funding between low and high-income areas and decrease the influence of police in schools. It proposes a new education grant program funded at a whopping $100 billion over 10 years \u2014 the equivalent of $1 million for every school in the country \u2014 for schools to use on programs or resources of their choice.\u00a0Her plan would be paid for by a wealth tax on fortunes above $50 million. In recent months, Warren\u2019s views of K-12 education have been a source of source of speculation and scrutiny. Soon after announcing a run for the presidency, she unveiled an expansive college and child care plan. But she disclosed fewer details on her plans for K-12, touching on an opposition to charter schools and pledging to appoint a public school teacher as the U.S. secretary of education. However, her newly released plan is extensive, taking direct aim at some of the most entrenched sources of inequality in K-12 education. On the issue of school segregation \u2015 a polarizing issue that even liberal politicians often shy away from \u2015 Warren pledges to encourage states to use a portion of their federal funds on school integration projects. Under a Warren administration, the departments of Education and Justice will crack down on wealthier, whiter communities\u00a0that try to break away from their more diverse school districts and hoard resources \u2015 a phenomenon called school district secession. \u201cBroad public affirmation of the Brown v. Board of Education decisions in the 1950s and recent debates about historical desegregation policies have obscured an uncomfortable truth \u2015 our public schools are more segregated today than they were about thirty years ago,\u201d states the plan, titled, \u201cA Great Public School Education for Every Student.\u201d Notably, Warren also pledges to \u201celiminate high-stakes testing.\u201d High-stakes testing came to prominence during the Bush administration, after the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, which tied schools\u2019 test scores to a series of carrots and sticks. The Obama administration continued to center high-stakes tests as federal officials encouraged states and districts to tie teacher evaluations to test scores. Warren\u2019s plan represents a stark departure from this line of thinking. She pledges to ban test scores as a significant determinant in personnel terminations, school closures and other \u201chigh-stakes decisions,\u201d noting that \u201cthe push toward high-stakes standardized testing has hurt both students and teachers.\u201d The plan also sounds off on charter schools, one of the most controversial issues in education, by taking a hard line against them. Charter schools \u2014 public schools that are funded with taxpayer dollars but privately operated \u2015\u00a0 were once a darling of both mainstream Democratic and Republican circles, but have faced increasing scrutiny from liberals in recent years. Warren pledges to fight to ban for-profit charter schools, which represent around 15% of the sector. But she also goes after nonprofit ones, promising to end a federal program that provides funding for new schools and opposing provisions that allow them to sometimes evade the same level of transparency and accountability as traditional public schools. The plan seeks to ban nonprofit charters that\u00a0employ or outsource operations to for-profit service providers\u00a0and calls for the IRS to investigate these schools\u2019 nonprofit tax status. \u201cEfforts to expand the footprint of charter schools, often without even ensuring that charters are subject to the same transparency requirements and safeguards as traditional public schools, strain the resources of school districts and leave students behind,\u201d the plan says. Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who released his education plan in May, similarly took aim at charters in his plan, framing them as an issue of racial justice.\u00a0His plan drew ire from some education reform groups that argued he was actually doing children of color a disservice. \u201cSenator Sanders is literally saying I\u2019m going to stand in the schoolhouse door and prevent kids from going [to charter schools], like a segregationist,\u201d Amy Wilkins, senior vice president of advocacy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, told HuffPost at the time. He is trying to \u201cprevent kids, many of whom are low-income, or of color, from having a choice.\u201d Sanders, like Warren, also focused on curbing school segregation. Their plans stand in contrast to another Democratic nominee frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, who has\u00a0historically supported programs that curtailed desegregation bussing. Warren has framed public education as a deeply personal issue. She spent a short amount of time as a special education teacher when she was in her 20s, but said she left the classroom after\u00a0being discriminated against as a pregnant woman. Other aspects of Warren\u2019s plan include quadrupling funding for Title I \u2015 the federal program that provides money to schools with high proportions of low-income children \u2015 as well as raising pay for educators, fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and helping to expand school employees\u2019 collective bargaining power. She frames the recent wave of teacher protests around the country as a feminist issue, and she has pledged to enact a law that would make sure public employees can collectively bargain in each state. So far, \u201cA Great Public School Education for Every Student\u201d has garnered praise from the leaders of both of the nation\u2019s teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association. \u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan for our nation\u2019s public schools would be a game changer for our public schools and the 90 percent of America\u2019s students who attend them,\u201d\u00a0Randi Weingarten, the president of AFT, said in a statement. \u201cLike so many of the other candidates\u2019 education plans we have praised, this one is bold and thorough and lays out tangible steps and resources that are critical for all students to thrive.\u201d \u201cWhat distinguishes this plan is that it is obvious it\u2019s drawn through the lens of someone who has spent time as a teacher in a classroom,\u201d\u00a0Weingarten added.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman who was a prominent surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his 2016 presidential run, announced Wednesday that she is backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Democratic primary. Warren \u201clistens before she speaks. She is willing to admit when she\u2019s wrong and make swift and necessary changes. She speaks her truths instead of poll-tested talking points,\u201d Flores wrote in a Medium post announcing her endorsement. \u201cAnd when Elizabeth speaks, she speaks to people like me.\u201d The endorsement comes as a boost for Warren as Sanders,\u00a0her progressive rival in the nominating contest, is experiencing something of a resurgence. Sanders, who had been faltering in polls before he suffered a heart attack at the start of the month, delivered an energetic debate performance on Oct. 15. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0announced their endorsement of Sanders shortly thereafter. Flores is one of a number of elected officials, mostly at the state and local level, who backed Sanders\u2019 last bid but are now throwing their support behind Warren. The most high-profile defector is Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, the first member of Congress to endorse Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, who announced his endorsement of Warren in August. Flores, an attorney who now runs the Los Angeles-based digital media company Luz Collective and serves on the board of the Women\u2019s March, made national waves in March after\u00a0accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of unwanted affectionate touching while she was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014. Before he spoke on her behalf at a rally in Las Vegas, Flores said that Biden came up behind her, smelled her hair and kissed her head without asking permission. At the time, at least one prominent Democrat speculated without evidence that Sanders put Flores up to it, which both Flores and the Sanders campaign immediately denied. Warren was one of the first presidential candidates to say she believed Flores and that the former Nevada lawmaker deserved an apology from Biden. Flores does not mention Biden in her post. In her endorsement, Flores, the daughter of working-class Mexican immigrants, said she identified with Warren\u2019s personal story of overcoming economic hardship. She was particularly impressed with Warren\u2019s remarks at the \u201cShe the People\u201d summit in April, which she said reflected a sensitivity to the intersecting forces of poverty, sexism, racism and religious bigotry. (Sanders, whom Flores does not reference in her essay, elicited groans at the same gathering for citing his experience in the 1960s civil rights movement in response to a question about his specific plans to help women of color.) \u201cNot a single candidate has all the answers or all of the solutions, but when I hear Elizabeth Warren speak, I hear a woman who takes our struggles with her everywhere she goes,\u201d Flores wrote. \u201cI hear a woman who understands that the American people can\u2019t afford anything less than bold solutions. I see a woman who has proven time and time again that she doesn\u2019t just have tenacity and the intelligence to lead this country and defeat Trump, she has the heart and the courage.\u201d In an interview with HuffPost, Flores also praised Warren\u2019s record of political and policy accomplishments, including the development of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cWhen you can point to that kind of a success record, it\u2019s not so much about being pragmatic, it\u2019s literally who can put forward a bold progressive agenda and has proven that those things can be executed,\u201d she said. Although Flores served as one of Sanders\u2019 appointees to a Democratic National Committee panel that convened in 2017 to recommend reforms to the party\u2019s presidential nominating process, her decision not to endorse the Vermont senator is not entirely surprising. In April 2018, Flores resigned from the board\u00a0of Our Revolution, the nonprofit that emerged from Sanders\u2019 2016 bid, in protest over what she saw as the group\u2019s insensitivity to Latinx priorities. And earlier this year, Flores told HuffPost\u00a0that she was keeping her options open given the abundance of candidates running. The Warren campaign declined to comment about whether and how they plan to deploy Flores as a surrogate. Flores\u2019 home state of Nevada holds its Democratic caucus on Feb. 22, and voters in her adopted state of California cast their primary ballots on March 3 \u2014 aka Super Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try to help Elizabeth Warren be the next president of the United States in whatever way possible,\u201d Flores told HuffPost.",

      "author": "Ariel Edwards-Levy",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are both largely seen by their party as capable of pulling out a win next year against President Donald Trump, according to a national HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after last week\u2019s primary debate. Sixty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden is capable of winning the general election, with a virtually identical 59% saying the same of Warren. Polls taken after the previous three debates had given Biden an edge of between 6 points and 13 points\u00a0on that metric. Roughly half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters currently think Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is capable of winning, with a third or fewer saying the same of any of the other candidates included in the survey. Overall, 71% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters name two or more candidates as capable of beating Trump, with 53% saying there are three or more viable options. There are a few different ways for pollsters to ask questions about electability \u2015 and when the question is about who has the highest chance of winning, Biden generally continues to dominate. In Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent survey, for instance, 48% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say Biden has the best chance of beating Trump, with just 21% saying the same of Warren. But other polling also suggests that Biden is no longer the only candidate that most Democrats think is capable of pulling out a win. In last week\u2019s Economist/YouGov poll, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters thought Biden would probably beat Trump, with 55% saying Warren would probably win and 54% saying the same of\u00a0 Sanders. Overall, 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say they have a least a good idea of whom they\u2019ll vote for, up from 52% who said the same in September. About a third say they\u2019re still making up their minds. An 83% majority currently say they\u2019re at least satisfied with the 2020 Democratic field, with 45% describing themselves as enthusiastic. As in previous surveys, Warren stands out as a potential consensus candidate, both garnering the broadest enthusiasm and causing the least consternation among members of her party. About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters pick her as someone they\u2019d be enthusiastic to see nominated, with just 9% saying they\u2019d be upset. She\u2019s trailed most closely on this metric by Sanders (37% enthusiastic, 19% upset), Buttigieg (30% enthusiastic, 15% upset) and Biden (37% enthusiastic, 25% upset). Gabbard attracts the most resistance among the candidates included in the survey, with about a third saying they\u2019d be upset to have her as the nominee. Thirty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the primary debate last Tuesday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, with an equal number saying the same of Buttigieg, and a quarter saying they\u2019d left with an improved view of Sanders.

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) flew into rainy Chicago on Tuesday morning to join the city\u2019s teachers and support staff in their sixth day of striking for a better union contract deal with the city and Chicago Public Schools. Warren, who is running for president in the 2020 election, joined the Chicago Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union Local 73 on the picket line at DePriest Elementary School on the West Side to voice her support for unions and public school educators. \u201cI\u2019m here to stand with Chicago teachers. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s librarians,\u201d Warren told the cheering crowd outside the school. Joining her were CTU President Jesse Sharkey and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. CTU and SEIU were in their sixth day of striking and fourth day of no classes on Tuesday as the unions continued negotiating with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and CPS on issues like smaller class sizes; more nurses, social workers and special education teachers; affordable housing; and better pay. There has been no academic instruction in the schools since Oct. 17, but buildings have stayed open to provide meals and safe places for children who need them. CPS is the third-largest school district in the nation, with 25,000 teachers serving more than 300,000 students. The size of the district has given the strike nationwide significance as the relatively new mayor clashes with Chicago\u2019s public school teachers. \u201cI\u2019m here because the eyes of this nation are upon you,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey have turned to Chicago for you to lead the way, for you to show how the power of standing together is the power of making real change in this country.\u201d In her campaign, Warren has called public education an issue that\u2019s personal. The senator was a special education teacher at a public elementary school in New Jersey when she was in her 20s, but she said she left after being discriminated against for being pregnant. \u201cA long time ago, I stood where you stand. I was there on the frontlines with the children,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI remember what it was like to see a child\u2019s eyes light up. I remember what it was like to be one of the most important people in a child\u2019s life.\u201d Warren\u2019s visit comes just one day after the presidential candidate unveiled her sweeping education plan to tackle segregation, high-stakes testing and for-profit charters for kindergarten through 12th grade. At the center of her plan is fighting continued segregation in the education system, a battle that schools in Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides have historically dealt with. \u201cI believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I got a plan for that.\u201d In addition to supporting public schools, Warren said she was also in Chicago to stress the importance of unions and worker rights. \u201cBecause the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power. The unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,\u201d she said. Warren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s questions on whether she had spoken to Lightfoot about the strike and whether standing with the unions has affected her relationship, as a Democratic presidential candidate, with a major city\u2019s mayor. Lightfoot downplayed Warren\u2019s alliance with the unions at a news conference Tuesday morning. \u201cShe has her right to come in. I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That\u2019s who we are as a party,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what\u2019s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.\u201d On Monday, Lightfoot and school district CEO Janice Jackson wrote a letter to Sharkey urging the union to end the strike and go back to work while negotiations continue, and she said at a news conference that teachers are asking for too much money. Sharkey, who earlier hoped negotiations could wrap up by the end of the week, told reporters Monday night that the mayor\u2019s remarks \u201cdashed my hopes\u201d on the walkout ending soon. Chicago Public Schools announced that the union did not end its strike as of 4 p.m. Tuesday, leading to the walkout\u2019s continuation Wednesday and students\u2019 fifth day out of class. The teachers union is calling for a national day of action on Thursday, asking teachers nationwide to show support for Chicago\u2019s teachers. \u201cThe nation turns to you to show how people who fight from the heart, people who are told: \u2018Quit now, give up,\u2019\u201d Warren told strikers, \u201c[they] don\u2019t give up. They stay in the fight for what they believe, and they change the course of American history.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "There\u2019s one plan the top 2020 Democratic contender doesn\u2019t need.",
      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren is famous for, among other things, plans. That\u2019s great. She publishes good plans. In case you haven\u2019t been paying attention, these include universal child care, a wealth tax, worker representation on corporate boards, student debt cancellation and a new international trade paradigm, to name five. Warren\u2019s plan schtick is effective because each one helps convince voters that a big, relatively simple idea is also politically and economically feasible. Warren has actually thought through how her ideas would be implemented in great detail, hired experts to troubleshoot problems that might arise, and then rolled out a sophisticated proposal. The difference between a plan to cancel student debt and just saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to cancel student debt!\u201d is that the plan helps persuade people who are afraid of change that this stuff will actually work. A lot of people find it hard to muster the courage to believe in a better world. Warren is helping them get there. But there\u2019s one plan that Warren doesn\u2019t need and that won\u2019t help her get elected \u2015 and that\u2019s a plan to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal without significantly raising taxes on the middle class. For some reason, moderators at Democratic primary debates are obsessed with the way presidential candidates label different elements of the cost structure in their health care proposals. They keep asking Warren if Medicare for All will \u201craise taxes.\u201d Warren keeps answering by saying she will lower the amount that middle class families have to spend out of pocket. This is a perfectly responsible answer. Under any credible Medicare for All plan, people will stop paying private health insurance premiums and start paying the government for Medicare. Taxes will go up; premiums will disappear. Warren is saying she will not have the government make middle class families poorer \u2015 they will pay less in new taxes than they will save in eliminated premiums. So far, so good. But the moderators want to goad Warren into saying the words \u201cI will raise taxes,\u201d and they are going to keep asking her the same dumb Medicare for All question until Warren says exactly that. It is a badge of honor in the news industry for a journalist to make a politician say something she does not want to say, and Warren does not want to say, \u201cI will raise taxes,\u201d because it will be used out of context in Republican attack ads. But instead of sticking to her guns, Warren is caving to the tax obsessives. According to The Washington Post, she\u2019s airing proposals from economists to develop a detailed plan laying out exactly how she\u2019d pay for every last dime of her Medicare for All proposal. Among other things, her campaign is considering calling the fees for the plan \u201cpublic premiums\u201d rather than \u201ctaxes.\u201d This is a big mistake. Running down the Medicare for All pay-for rabbit hole is a loser\u2019s game that misunderstands the appeal of her plans, and it plays to the dying worldview of the conservative elite. The how-will-you-pay-for-it crew isn\u2019t going to stop haranguing her until she says something made for a GOP attack ad. That\u2019s how the game works. Warren\u2019s 2020 fans aren\u2019t deficit-obsessed economists who want to make sure every new penny of government spending is matched by a new penny in taxation. Most economists aren\u2019t deficit-obsessed economists \u2015 the deficit has been ballooning steadily for 40 years and none of the bad stuff that economists worried about 40 years ago has come to pass. It does not matter one economic iota whether Americans pay for health insurance through premiums or taxes. It\u2019s not even the most important metric for something like Medicare for All \u2015 What\u2019s the impact on wages? On poverty? GDP? All of these are more relevant, but nobody is asking Warren for details about those, and she isn\u2019t going to put them up. And of course the actual numbers on any new health care proposal will not be dictated by whatever Warren puts in a document in October 2019. President Warren would still have to move the legislation through the House \u2015 where Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hostile to some of Warren\u2019s ideas \u2015 and the Senate \u2015 where Republicans have a host of procedural tricks at their disposal. Warren\u2019s plans work when they convince voters her ideas are feasible \u2015 not because voters think every damn decimal point is going to become law. You either believe the basic story Warren has sketched on Medicare for All, or you don\u2019t. She\u2019s not changing that basic story \u2015 she\u2019s changing the way she describes the details. The details matter, of course. But they\u2019re a matter for 2021. The next time TV moderators badger Warren about Medicare for All and the deficit, she should call out their charade.",

I really am not, truly.\u201d The latest Federal Election Commission filings show Sanders with $33.7 million in cash on hand at the end of September, and Warren with $25.7 million. Both far surpassed Biden, who had just under $9 million. Even South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been polling well below the top three, had $23.4 million. Polls show the still-crowded Democratic primary race has tightened as Warren has risen in the last month. Surveys released this week\u00a0conflict on whether \ufeffBiden or Warren leads the race. Biden brushed off that ambiguity, too, asserting it\u2019s him. \u201cI know I\u2019m the front-runner,\u201d he said. \u201cFind me a national poll with a notable \u2015 a couple exceptions.

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " INDIANOLA, Iowa \u2015 During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, the campus of Simpson College in this suburb of Des Moines was Bernie Sanders territory. In fact, every college campus in Iowa was. The Vermont senator won the votes of 84% of Democratic voters under the age of 30, according to caucus entrance polls. They were the base of a coalition that nearly toppled Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But polling, as well as interviews with campaign operatives and with students at four campuses across the state, shows these same voters are up for grabs in 2020. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with their proposals to wipe away student debt and promises of systemic change, are the leading candidates among young Democrats, but there is also substantial support for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and interest in New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both of whom are trotting out a youthful, optimistic message. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke brings a similar appeal. Businessman Andrew Yang\u2019s outsider status is attractive, as is the potentially history-making candidacy of California Sen. Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Joe Biden has pockets of support, but some students were dismissive of his candidacy. Almost every campaign is hyping their sustained outreach to young people, and many have staffers in Iowa dedicated to it. If one candidate is able to bring together young voters in a fashion similar to Sanders \u2015 or even to President Barack Obama, who won a majority of those votes in what was essentially a three-way race in 2008 \u2015 that candidate could reap significant political rewards. But if the under-30 crowd splits their votes among multiple candidates, it could benefit Biden, who has strong support among the oldest, most reliable voters in Iowa. The headline battle at the moment is between Warren and Sanders. On a swing through Iowa in October, Warren visited four college campuses in a three-day period. Her campaign aides downplayed the idea that the trip was meant as a play for Sanders-supporting young voters \u2015 and plenty of attendees at the events had at least flecks of gray in their hair \u2015 but it did give the campaign a chance to highlight the students backing her. Simpson College\u2019s student body president, Jailyn Seabrooks, introduced Warren at the event. Seabrooks, who decided to become a political science major the day after the 2016 election, said the number of presidential candidates was \u201coverwhelming\u201d for students voting for the first time. \u201cWe want someone who\u2019s talking about our issues,\u201d said Seabrooks, who cited Warren\u2019s stances on student debt and veterans\u2019 issues as her reasons for backing the senator. \u201cAnd we want someone who\u2019s not patronizing us. We don\u2019t need jokes, we don\u2019t need dances or TikToks. We have serious problems that we want to talk seriously about.\u201d College students and other young voters traditionally played a microscopic role in the Iowa caucuses, where participation can require hours of commitment. That changed in 2008. Obama\u2019s campaign heavily targeted high school and college students, and caucus turnout among young people jumped 135% compared to 2004. Obama won the support of 57% of the voters under the age of 30, compared to 14% for former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and 11% for Clinton. (Obama won 38% of the overall vote in the state.) There are limits to how far popularity, even overwhelming popularity, with young voters can take a candidate. Even though Sanders won 84% of those under 30 in 2016, according to entrance polls, those voters made up less than one-fifth of the total caucus electorate, and he lost the overall vote to Clinton, albeit by less than a percentage point. Still, operatives for many Democratic campaigns believe youth voter turnout could spike again, likely as part of an overall jump in primary turnout. During the 2018 midterm elections, young people cast ballots at double the rate they voted in 2014. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything to dissuade me from the fact that young people are going to be more engaged,\u201d said John Della Volpe, who conducts regular polls of college-age voters for Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics. \u201cI imagine this is going to carry over into the caucus.\u201d On campuses across Iowa, students who spoke to HuffPost were keenly aware of how much influence they could have over who becomes the nation\u2019s next president. Seabrooks noted that five of the last six presidents had visited Simpson, which has only 1,250 undergraduate students. At a Warren town hall at Drake University, a sophomore business major named Max McPartland said he would be \u201cstupid not to come out and experience this.\u201d McPartland, who was interested in Warren but planned on caucusing for Buttigieg, said he had considered many of the candidates \u2015 but not Biden. \u201cHe just seems bureaucratic. He\u2019s been in Washington a lot longer. He\u2019s just out of touch,\u201d said McPartland, who was standing in line for a photo with Warren. \u201cNot a lot of big, new ideas.\u201d That sentiment is not an isolated one, and it\u2019s one the Biden campaign is working to overcome. Jesse Harris, one of the Biden campaign\u2019s top advisers in the Hawkeye State, emphasized Biden\u2019s success in passing legislation on issues that students care about, including gun control and climate change. \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned one thing from the past couple of years, it\u2019s that experience does matter. And that understanding how government works matters,\u201d Harris told HuffPost. \u201cIf you want to rejoin the Paris accords\u201d \u2015 the international agreement to fight climate change abandoned by the Trump administration \u2015\u00a0 \u201cJoe Biden can do that faster than any other candidate because he has the experience internationally.\u201d Harris was also quick to note that 64% of caucus-goers in 2016 were over the age of 45. Sanders, meanwhile, is fighting to hold on to as much of his base as possible: He has a statewide campus organizing director and 8 paid campus organizers, and his campaign trained more than 1,300 college-age volunteers over the summer. While the democratic socialist was never going to replicate his utter dominance of Clinton among young adults, his base still skews youthful. (The campaign boasted on Wednesday about Sanders\u2019 victory in an unscientific straw poll of high school voters in Iowa.) \u201cWe believe students will caucus for the only candidate who\u2019s spent his entire life taking on the greed and corruption of the corporations who caused the climate crisis, profit from student debt and reap the biggest rewards of a rigged economy,\u201d\u00a0Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said. Zoe Swinton, a senior at the University of Iowa who heads up Hawks for Bernie \u2015 the university\u2019s teams are the Hawkeyes \u2015 said the proposals the senator is best known for, especially his push to wipe out student debt, continue to draw students to his campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s offering plans that are more extreme than any other candidate on issues we care about like climate change and student debt,\u201d Swinton said. But she also said she spends time debunking some myths about the senator. She often explains to students \u201cwhat democratic socialism actually is, how progressive policies can actually work.\u201d Sanders and Biden do share a hurdle: the perception of them as old. Sanders is 78, Biden is 76. Warren is 70, but not a single student expressed concerns about her age. Addie Cosgrove, who works for the Biden campaign on Drake University\u2019s campus, said she dismisses concerns about Biden\u2019s age: \u201cI don\u2019t really see this as an issue myself because Joe Biden isn\u2019t that much older than Elizabeth Warren. They\u2019re all the same age.\u201d Swinton said she counters students\u2019 concerns about Sanders\u2019 health by pointing to his rally and parade performances across the country. \u201cThe heart attack was a scare for some people. But he honestly seems rejuvenated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a four-year term. He can last.\u201d Most of the Democratic presidential campaigns are focusing their student organizing efforts at Iowa\u2019s three largest campuses \u2015 Iowa State in Ames, the University of Iowa in Iowa City and Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls \u2015 while also reaching out to students at Drake, smaller liberal arts colleges like Grinnell College, Northwestern College and Simpson, and larger community colleges in the Des Moines area. And seemingly every campaign is engaged in aggressive outreach: Warren has the endorsement of eight former and current presidents of College Democrats chapters. Booker held a press call with student reporters at the beginning of the year, and two of his top Iowa staffers worked at the youth-focused advocacy group NextGen America during the 2018 election cycle. During this year\u2019s back-to-school weeks, Buttigieg purchased Spotify and Pandora ads, interrupting students\u2019 playlists with his pitch. Getting an exact handle on how college students, and young people in general, are planning to cast their ballots can be difficult, with different public pollsters setting different age brackets. The last iteration of the Des Moines Register\u2019s Iowa Poll found Warren leading Sanders among voters under age 35 by a 27% to 22% margin, with every other candidate under 10%. A national poll conducted weekly by CollegePulse and Chegg, a textbook rental company, looks only at college students. It found Sanders with a consistent lead until earlier this month, when Warren went ahead 30% to 28%. Biden drew 10%, Yang was at 9% and Buttigieg drew 7%. And of course, plenty of students remain undecided. Luke Hoffman, a junior math, physics and education major, was standing in line at Warren\u2019s Drake town hall with his friend Rachel Fischer, a junior biology major. Fischer was not shy about her support for Warren: \u201cI love her already. All of my friends are tired of hearing me talk about Elizabeth Warren all the time.\u201d But Hoffman wasn\u2019t ready to commit to Warren just yet. And he has another voice in his ear: His roommate is the head of Bulldogs for Pete. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the location of the University of Northern Iowa.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday unveiled a plan to pay for\u00a0 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that, at least on paper, fulfills the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s ambition of financing the program with no new taxes on the middle class. The plan, modeled on the bill from rival 2020 Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, envisions wiping away most existing insurance arrangements, private and public, in order to enroll nearly all Americans into a new government-run program that would cover all necessary medical expenses. It is designed both to cover those who don\u2019t have insurance and to make health care more affordable for those who already do. The 9,000-word, 21-page plan is sprawling \u2015 including everything from an expansion of Warren\u2019s signature wealth tax to incentives for unionization to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants \u2015 and contains aggressive measures to contain the spiraling cost of health care almost certain to generate opposition from doctors, drugmakers and hospitals. It would be funded using heavy tax increases on the wealthy and a new per-employee tax meant to replace what business previously spent on health insurance. \u201cHealth care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values,\u201d Warren writes in the introduction to her proposal. \u201cThat system is Medicare for All. Let\u2019s be clear: America\u2019s medical professionals are among the best in the world. Health care in America is world-class. Medicare for All isn\u2019t about changing any of that. It\u2019s about fixing what is broken \u2013 how we pay for that care.\u201d A big question hanging over Medicare for All \u2015 and, increasingly, Warren\u2019s candidacy \u2015 has been how to finance this massive new program, as the burden of paying for medical care shifts from businesses and individuals to the federal government. Warren, like Sanders and other Medicare for All advocates, has always said that all but the richest Americans would come out ahead financially, taking into account both the costs of the new system and the savings, compared to the old one. The proposal she released Friday explains exactly how she envisions that happening, and in so doing fills in some blanks that the Sanders bill had left. The decision to do so comes with no small amount of political risk: The more detailed a health care proposal, the bigger the target for the health care industry, outside experts, and her political rivals to poke holes in the plan and question its math. But Warren\u2019s aides determined it was necessary, both to fulfill her campaign\u2019s implicit promise to have detailed plan for seemingly every important policy, and to fend off increasingly feisty attacks from her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The complicated plan, like any version of Medicare For All, is unlikely to become law, even if Democrats manage to win the presidency and both chambers of Congress in 2020, due to the unified opposition of Republicans and significant dissension within the Democratic ranks. But it could serve as an aggressive opening bid from a theoretical Warren administration on a proposal to expand health coverage and bring down the cost of care. Under Medicare for All, individuals wouldn\u2019t have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket costs, and employers wouldn\u2019t have to pay for their workers\u2019 insurance, because the federal government would be paying for basically all medical bills. A key question about such a transition has been exactly how much new money the federal government would need to pull off this dramatic shift and, then, where the government could find those dollars. On the cost of a new plan, estimates have varied. One of the more widely cited has come from the Urban Institute, a well-respected think tank whose researchers have estimated that moving to Medicare for All would require about $34 trillion in new spending over the next decade. Warren\u2019s plan uses the Urban Institute estimate as a benchmark, but anticipates creating a program that would require a lot less new money: Medicare for All would need only $20 trillion in new money over the next decade, according to the Warren campaign. What accounts for the difference? A big chunk, about $6 trillion, would come from asking states to contribute the money they already spend on Medicaid and other health programs they run. The rest, roughly $8 trillion, would be through additional savings in health care relative to what the Urban Institute\u2019s projection assumed. Some of these savings would be in the form of more aggressive price controls, like paying hospitals at 110% of Medicare rates rather than 115%, as Urban Institute used in its estimates. The Warren campaign is also assuming greater savings on prescription drugs, on the theory that her proposal (which would effectively break patents when drugmakers won\u2019t accept lower reimbursements) would be more effective at reducing prices than the scheme the Urban Institute considered. Some of the additional savings reflect more optimistic assumptions about the benefits of simplicity; Warren\u2019s campaign is assuming more than twice as much savings from reduced billing and overhead than Urban Institute researchers did. Some of the additional savings come from a belief that changing the way hospitals get paid (for example, by moving to \u201cbundled payments\u201d that give hospitals more incentive to be efficient) would generate big savings. Over the coming days and weeks, experts will get a closer look at these details and, inevitably, challenge assumptions that the Warren campaign has made \u2015 or point out tradeoffs that aren\u2019t so obvious at first blush. The optimistic projections of health new efficiencies are likely to meet a skeptical reception from other experts who will say they are not realistic, as either policy or politics. The calls to limit spending on doctors, hospitals and drugmakers are likely to spark a debate over whether such controls would undermine quality or timeliness of treatment, even as they eliminate financial barriers to care. The Warren campaign cites evidence backing all its claims, but that doesn\u2019t mean the evidence is persuasive. \u201cA big part of the financing for Warren\u2019s plan comes from more aggressively containing health care costs,\u201d Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost after reviewing the plan. \u201cOn the one hand, it would be quite disruptive to the health care system to constrain prices this much. On the other hand, every other developed country in the world provides universal coverage at a much lower cost than we spend now, which makes Warren\u2019s plan look pretty reasonable and achievable. We would still be by far the most expensive health care system in the world, but somewhat less expensive than we are now.\u201d And how would Warren pay for that $20 trillion in new government spending? The bulk of the money \u2015 about $8.8 trillion \u2015 would come from a health insurance tax levied on businesses, essentially taking the money they now send to private companies for health care and redirecting it to the government. Warren aims to make the tax equal to roughly 98% of what companies pay now. Another $1.4 trillion would come from taxing the additional income Americans would earn instead of the deductions that come out of their paychecks. A collection of taxes on financial firms, wealthy Americans and corporations \u2015 including the repeal of the Trump tax cuts, a financial transactions tax, a tax that would force American corporations to pay 35% on income they\u2019ve earned anywhere in the world, and an increase of Warren\u2019s proposed tax on fortunes over $1 billion to 5% \u2015 would bring in an $6.8 trillion. Another $2.3 trillion would come from \u201cimprovements in tax enforcement,\u201d with a final $1.2 trillion coming from additional revenue from immigration reform and from ending the overseas contingency operations fund. Each of the campaign\u2019s tax proposals would generate significant opposition on their own. Immigration reform alone, for example, would amount to a titanic political fight. The Warren campaign has enlisted a number of boldface names in health care and economics to affirm the plan\u2019s technical feasibility. Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and former Institute for Health Improvement president Donald Berwick vouched for the campaign\u2019s cost estimates. Johnson, Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and University of Michigan professor Betsey Stevenson vouched for the revenue proposals. Both Berwick and Stevenson served in the Obama administration \u2015 Berwick as administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, Stevenson as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Pressure on Warren to release such a plan increased after the October Democratic debate, when a number of candidates \u2015 including former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2015 amplified existing criticisms of Warren\u2019s lack of specifics on health care,\u2015 the top issue for voters in both the general election and the primary. The release of Warren\u2019s plan on Friday was never likely to satiate her primary rivals, and it didn\u2019t. \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does. Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers,\u201d Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement, referring to the plan\u2019s tax on employers. \u201cThe mathematical gymnastics in this plan are all geared towards hiding a simple truth from voters: it\u2019s impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle class tax increases.\u201d But Warren plans to use the heavy amount of details in her plan to begin knocking other candidates, especially Biden and Buttigieg, for the lack of detail in their own health plans, and for their plans\u2019 failure to cover all Americans. \u201cEvery candidate who opposes my long-term goal of Medicare for All should explain why the \u2018choice\u2019 of private insurance plans is more important than being able to choose the doctor that\u2019s best for you without worrying about whether they are in-network or not,\u201d Warren writes in the Medium post outlining her plan. \u201cWhy it\u2019s more important than being able to choose the right prescription drug for you without worrying about massive differences in copays. Why it\u2019s more important than being able to choose to start a small business or choose the job you want without worrying about where your health care coverage will be coming from and how much it will cost.\u201d A significant part of Democratic opposition to Medicare-for-All has come from organized labor, whose members fear giving up often generous health benefits they have negotiated for. Warren\u2019s plan aims to overcome that worry by promising a tax break to companies willing to take the savings from no longer having to pay for health care and turn them into additional wages or pensions. \u201cThat way, my plan helps unions that have bargained for good health care already, and creates a significant new incentive for unionization generally by making collective bargaining appealing for both workers and employers as a way of potentially reducing the employer\u2019s Employer Medicare Contributions,\u201d Warren writes.

Unlike others, I\u2019ve never represented a corporation. I\u2019ve never represented a special interest. And I started my career fighting for the people.\u201d Harris, whose campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, tweeted the line shortly after her speech, making clear that she was taking aim at \u201cothers in this race.\u201d Harris would not specify Saturday whether the comment was directed at Warren, asserting that \u201cthere are half a dozen or more people in the race who\u2019ve worked for corporations\u201d and that \u201cI haven\u2019t examined her work,\u201d according to The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel. Though Warren has made standing strong against corporate power a cornerstone of her campaign, starting in the late 1980s, while working as a Harvard Law School professor, Warren represented large corporations as one of the country\u2019s foremost bankruptcy experts. On Monday, The New York Times took stock of her career, recalling her list of clients that included Dow Chemical, aircraft manufacturer Fairchild, and Travelers insurance. In 1995, Warren took on the case of LTV Steel, a Cleveland-based conglomerate which was battling the Clinton administration to avoid financing health benefits for retired coal miners. As the Times noted, the issue reared its head during her successful 2012 Senate run when Republican incumbent Scott Brown unearthed her past in a political ad that pointed to a Boston Herald report labeling her a \u201chired legal gun\u201d for LTV. However, not all of Warren\u2019s clients have strayed from her campaign message. In May, Warren released a history of her legal work, showing that she once testified as an expert witness against tobacco giant Philip Morris. She also testified on behalf of asbestos victims against major retailer Sears. Warren is not alone in her previous work for corporations, as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was employed by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. from 2007 to 2010. A spokesperson for Warren\u2019s campaign did not comment on Harris\u2019 remarks.

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Bristling at Elizabeth Warren\u2019s suggestions that he\u2019s a milquetoast moderate with small ideas, presidential candidate Joe Biden countered Saturday that he offers a \u201cbold\u201d vision for the country and warned that Democratic primary voters should not get distracted by the party\u2019s increasingly tense battle over ideological labels. It was a departure from Biden\u2019s usual campaign speech and signaled perhaps a new phase of Democrats\u2019 search for a nominee to take on President Donald Trump, with Warren, the leading progressive candidate, and Biden, the top choice for most moderates and establishment liberals, ratcheting up the intensity three months ahead of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cThe vision I have for this country, there\u2019s nothing small about it. It is like going to the moon,\u201d Biden told supporters in Des Moines, as he hit the high points of a policy slate that would increase the federal government\u2019s spending and scope on everything from health care to the climate crisis. Without naming Warren, the former vice president said his ideas \u2014 such as a \u201cpublic option\u201d to compete alongside private health insurance, as opposed to Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d plan run altogether by the government \u2014 actually set the progressive standard in 2020 for a simple reason: They\u2019re more achievable. \u201cI\u2019m not promising anything crazy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a vision \u2014 a vision of how we can get things done.\u201d With reporters afterward, Biden zeroed in on Warren\u2019s estimated $20 trillion price tag for the first decade of single-payer insurance. \u201cGetting that plan through, even in a Democratic Congress,\u201d Biden predicted, \u201cwould be difficult.\u201d Biden\u2019s latest volleys came barely 12 hours after Warren used Iowa Democrats\u2019 annual fundraising gala to draw sharp distinctions in the Democratic field, though she, like Biden, avoided naming opponents. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d the Massachusetts senator told thousands of voters sporting t-shirts and waving signs as their preferred candidates took turns on center stage at a downtown Des Moines arena Friday night. Even if \u201csome people in our party don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d Warren argued, the nation is in \u201ca time of crisis\u201d not just because of Trump\u2019s divisiveness but more so because of an economic and political system rigged against the working class. \u201cIf the most we can promise is \u2018business as usual\u2019 after Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said, \u201cthen Democrats will lose.\u201d The senator doubled-down Saturday, insisting in Vinson, Iowa, that sweeping plans are good politics and perhaps necessary to upend Trump. \u201cWe need big ideas to inspire people, to get them to turn out for the caucuses, to turn out and vote,\u201d Warren said. Asked hours later, after an event in Dubuque, if she was suggesting candidates like Biden weren\u2019t being ambitious enough, Warren responded: \u201cNope. I\u2019m just out here talking about what I\u2019m running on.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about my vision for what it means to build an America going forward that doesn\u2019t just work for a thin slice at the top, but an America that works for everyone,\u201d she said. Still, at the very least, Biden\u2019s reaction suggests frustration over Warren\u2019s apparent momentum, even as he and his aides maintain that his philosophical approach will be successful among both Democratic primary voters and the general electorate. Biden\u2019s proposals, to be clear, put him to the left of recent Democratic nominees, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. But on most points, he falls short of the proposals on the left flank that Warren and her fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, have set. Rather than obliterate private insurance, Biden touts a government plan to compete alongside private firms. Rather than government covering all four-year college tuition, Biden pushes two years a taxpayer-paid tuition. On climate, he backs most long-term goals of the left\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d but on a longer timeline and with an initially less aggressive crackdown on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIt\u2019s made to look like \u2018Well, Biden is coming off with some moderate proposal,\u2019\u201d Biden said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing moderate about making sure everyone has health care. There\u2019s nothing moderate about getting to net-zero emissions. There\u2019s nothing moderate about fundamentally changing the school system in America so we can effectively complete in the 20th century.\u201d The difference in his proposals, Biden argued: \u201cI tell you straight up how we\u2019re going to pay for it and how much it\u2019s going to cost and how it\u2019s going to get done.\u201d The dynamics Biden faces were crystallized as young climate activists interrupted him and chided him for not doing enough to take on the oil and gas industry. \u201cLet her speak,\u201d the candidate said as his supporters tried to drown out one of the activists. Yet as the small group chanted, sang and ultimately departed, Biden grew more frustrated. \u201cIf you\u2019ll notice, they left before I answered her question,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what is going on that\u2019s wrong with our party right now. Everything is taken in contexts that are not accurate.\u201d As his voice calmed, he sought again to widen his appeal. \u201cThe way we win is we unify, we come together as Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have basically the same hopes and dreams. The question is, practically, how we get there. But it\u2019s not a lack of vision.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Vinson and Dubuque, Iowa. ___ Follow Bill Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.",

      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren threw Larry Summers out of the Democratic Party establishment six years ago. He hasn\u2019t forgotten. It was 2013, and President Barack Obama had nominated Summers to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. For the controversial economist, then 58 years old, the job would have been the capstone to a remarkable political comeback. Seven years earlier, he\u2019d been forced out as president of Harvard for giving a speech arguing that women were genetically predisposed to mediocrity in the sciences. Shortly after, his reputation as a financial genius was sullied by the 2008 banking crisis. But Summers\u2019 work putting together the 2009 economic stimulus package had thrilled Obama, who believed he was ready to assume the most powerful position in the global economy. Progressive activists were furious with the nomination. The National Organization for Women and other feminist groups launched a public relations campaign against Summers. And a freshman senator from Massachusetts began piecing together opposition on the Senate Banking Committee, which would have to approve Summers\u2019 appointment prior to a full Senate confirmation vote. The reaction stunned Obama. In a private meeting of Capitol Hill Democrats, he told lawmakers that an unreasonable left wing was making Summers into a \u201cwhipping boy.\u201d After\u00a0months of bitter conflict, four Senate Democrats joined Warren in opposition to Summers, leaving him one vote short on the committee. He withdrew his name from consideration and retreated to the op-ed pages, where he remains a popular figure among the dying breed of very wealthy Democrats. But the 2020 presidential primary has given Summers an opportunity to audition for relevance at the top of the Democratic Party once again. And he\u2019s made his case by reopening his feud with Warren. For most of the past year, Summers has been the antagonist-in-chief against one of Warren\u2019s signature Big Ideas \u2015 her call for a 2% wealth tax on fortunes larger than $50 million. Through op-eds, CNBC interviews, conference appearances and Twitter screeds, Summers has mustered every bit of ridicule he can for the wealth tax and the economic experts the senator has relied on to develop it. He\u2019s bad-mouthed the underlying data on wealth inequality, emphasized the sophistication with which the rich avoid paying taxes, and declared the entire project a hopeless political dead end. Speaking to an audience at the Peterson Institute for International Economics last week, Summers was frank about his overarching rationale: \u201cI do not think a focus on wealth inequality as a basis for being concerned about a more just society is terribly well-designed. ... I don\u2019t think wealth is a particularly sensible way for judging or assigning taxes.\u201d So far, the public doesn\u2019t seem to be buying what Summers is selling. According to a New York Times poll from July, 66% of American adults support Warren\u2019s wealth tax, up from 61% in February. Even most millionaires support the idea, according to one CNBC survey. The fight over the wealth tax is much more than an academic dispute over deficit projections and growth estimates. It\u2019s the latest round in an ongoing power struggle at the highest echelons of the Democratic party about how Democrats understand justice itself \u2015 and whether economic inequality really matters. It is an ideological battle in which Summers and Warren have long been the most important players \u2015 first as intellectuals engaged in academic research, and later as powerful figures in Washington. It\u2019s a contest not only over who will control the Democratic Party for the next few years, but what it means to be a Democrat. Though Warren has rolled out at least half a dozen ambitious plans to reshape the American economy \u2015 universal childcare, student debt cancellation, worker representation on corporate boards and more \u2015 the wealth tax is the intellectual keystone in her policy arch. Warren knows it; she even dressed up her dog Bailey as \u201c2 cents\u201d for Halloween \u2015 the amount her wealth tax would take from every dollar over $50 million stashed away in personal fortunes. The wealth tax isn\u2019t just about raising money. It\u2019s the policy that connects Warren\u2019s 21st century agenda to what she likes about America\u2019s 20th century inheritance. In Warren\u2019s telling, the Democratic Party cracked the code for shared prosperity in the 1930s with three basic principles: accountability for powerful corporate interests, high taxes on the rich, and major investments in what we now call public goods \u2015 education, the environment, scientific research and infrastructure. \u201cIt worked for half a century,\u201d Warren told an audience in 2014. \u201cYou take a look at the numbers, and GDP just keeps going up year over year over year. But here\u2019s the key. At the same time, median family income \u2015 that family right in the middle \u2014 income just kept going up the same. In other words, as our country got richer, our families got richer. And as our families got richer, our country got richer.\u201d But starting in the 1980s, everything changed. The government deregulated Wall Street, cut taxes on the rich and retreated from public investments, making way for the magic of financial markets. The results for the economy as a whole were uneven \u2015 the heady Bill Clinton boom years were followed by the destruction of the 2008 financial crisis. But through it all, most families were on a steady downward trajectory. For everyone outside of the top 10% of incomes, real wages actually declined between 1980 and 2016. \u201cWe tried it for 30 years, and it didn\u2019t work. In fact, the consequences were nearly catastrophic,\u201d Warren said. Warren has been drilling her history lesson into Democratic audiences for a decade. In 2015, she started supplementing her narrative with data demonstrating that much of this shared postwar prosperity was systematically denied to Black Americans. Though the incomes of the typical Black family increased from the 1940s to the 1970s, they were substantially lower than the incomes for the typical white family, and the gap between black and white families only began to narrow in the 1960s.\u00a0When income inequality began to diverge once again in the 1980s, the racial wealth gap exploded \u2015 tripling between 1984 and 2009. The key for reviving the ideas of the New Deal and the Great Society, Warren suggests, is to ensure that everyone will actually be included in the 21st century revival. The wealth tax is essential to that vision. As designed by economists Emanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealth tax is not merely intended to raise revenue \u2015 it\u2019s a direct attack on the fortunes of the super-rich. Where most economists and politicians have focused on levying taxes to maximize the amount of money governments can put to use on social projects, Saez and Zucman are forthright about using the tax code to reduce both the size of major personal fortunes and the political influence of the super-rich. Easing inequality through the tax code is a social priority in its own right. What governments actually do with the money is up to them; Saez and Zucman want to use the taxes to take the rich down a peg. \u201cAn extreme concentration of wealth means an extreme concentration of power,\u201d\u00a0they write in their new book \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice.\u201d \u201cThe power to influence government policy. The power to stifle competition. The power to shape ideology.\u201d Advocates of a carbon tax, they note, do not seek merely to raise revenue, but to reduce carbon emissions. The same goes for high taxes on the rich. \u201cThey are not aimed at funding government programs in the long run ... Quasi-confiscatory tax rates redistribute economic power.\u201d Enormous disparities of wealth \u2014 whatever their effect on growth, productivity or innovation \u2014 are inherently anti-democratic and harmful to the social fabric. Warren often downplays the radicalism of her proposal \u2015 it\u2019s just 2 cents! \u2015 as she emphasizes its historical antecedents. But while Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to establish a maximum income by taxing the highest annual earners at rates of over 90%, this wealth tax is really something new. The United States has a lot of taxes that hit rich people as they increase their fortunes. There\u2019s a progressive income tax, an estate tax on inheritances, the capital gains tax on financial investments, and corporate taxes, which disproportionately hit the wealthy. But America has never gone straight to the source and taxed wealth itself \u2015 the total fortune squirreled away in bank accounts and investment vehicles. If either Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has rolled out a similar proposal, can make it happen, adding wealth to the list of taxable items could prove as socially transformative as the introduction of the income tax in 1913. For Summers, Warren\u2019s historical narrative is intensely personal. Though she typically blames Republicans for the era of \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d the governing disaster was bipartisan. Summers\u2019 uncle, Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson, advised the Kennedy administration to move away from FDR\u2019s 90% tax rates in the 1960s. From the mid-1980s onward, the dominant economic policy voice in the Democratic Party belonged to Summers. Nobody disputes the force of Summers\u2019 intellect. By the time he entered the Clinton administration in 1993, Summers had already authored over 100 peer-reviewed papers \u2015 an extraordinary figure for an economist of any age, much less for a man who was then under the age of 40. A typical Summers paper was concerned with a Big Idea, and his early research reshaped the way economists understood unemployment, corporate investment and the stock market, just to name three. Where economists had generally believed the unemployed to be between jobs for a few weeks at a time, Summers discovered that an enormous proportion of people looking for a job had been searching for years \u2015 people stuck in a long-term, life-altering rut. Where economists believed that the economy carried a fundamental, healthy \u201cnatural\u201d load of unemployed people, Summers published research detonating the empirical case for any natural level of unemployment whatsoever. Summers imagined himself to be making progressive breakthroughs. There were, according to his work, far more people being left behind by the economy than policymakers had realized. And there was paltry evidence that the economy as a whole operated according to the logic of business cycles independent of government policy. The length and depth of recessions \u2015 even their very existence \u2015 were things that public officials could ameliorate. Things would not automatically get better on their own. The government had a responsibility to act. But Summers also shared a host of basic assumptions with conservative ideologues. He believed sophisticated financial markets could reliably direct the world\u2019s resources where they were needed most. And he believed that poverty and inequality were very different problems. Often, Summers concluded, the public as a whole was made better off by policy changes and business innovations that left small numbers of people reaping enormous rewards. And so throughout the Clinton administration, Summers supported financial deregulation in the name of progress. Policy changes that allowed private financial barons to generate greater wealth were good. Growing the pie created a bigger body of economic activity that could be taxed to fund social safety net programs. Well-designed taxes were intended to maximize the money available for government programs while incentivizing socially productive business innovation. Their effect on inequality \u2015 something better addressed through anti-poverty programs, if at all \u2014\u00a0was an afterthought. To Summers, there was no need to worry about financial institutions abusing the privileges they received from deregulation. Testifying before Congress in 1998 on the need to deregulate derivatives, Summers maintained: \u201cThe parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves.\u201d It seems almost laughable from this side of the AIG collapse, but at the time, most members of Congress were eager to agree with Summers. But not everyone. And certainly not everyone in academia. Some of the most important economic research from the 1980s and 1990s was taking place not in economics departments, but in law schools \u2015 specifically, the law schools where Elizabeth Warren was working. Combing through decades of consumer bankruptcy filings, Warren discovered something that surprised her. Most people who filed for bankruptcy weren\u2019t just thoughtless spendthrifts who had over-consumed their way into disaster. The vast majority were flipped from financial stability into economic ruin by a single personal tragedy \u2015 a divorce, a massive medical bill, a job loss. These were problems that financial markets were not good at resolving. You couldn\u2019t expect young couples to buy divorce insurance. There was no derivative that a household could buy to protect itself from the local factory moving to Mexico. People would find themselves short of cash, and they would be vulnerable. When they got desperate, they\u2019d turn to bottom-feeders like payday lenders to pay the bills. But these operators would only aggravate their problems, and short-term cash wouldn\u2019t help anybody find a job or eliminate their medical debt. Warren quickly realized that the shortcomings of financial markets weren\u2019t limited to consumer finance. If the existence of payday lenders didn\u2019t address the core source of trouble for American families, why should multi-trillion-dollar corporate debt markets be a panacea for American business? To this day, Warren insists that she believes in markets as a vehicle for prosperity. But what she means by \u201cmarkets\u201d is very different from what Summers means. For Warren, a \u201cmarket\u201d is something governments define and police, with clear rules of fair play and social benefits that can be measured. If those benefits fail to materialize, the government has a responsibility to restructure the market. For Summers, markets are just what happens between consenting corporations when government is absent. This was the heart of Warren\u2019s opposition to his appointment in 2013. To Warren, Summers\u2019 record of advocacy for Wall Street \u2015 never mind the millions he made working for the hedge fund D.E. Shaw during the George W. Bush presidency \u2015 made him unfit to helm the Fed, the most important financial regulator on the planet. The dispute between Warren and Summers that cost him the Fed job was, in comparison to the wealth tax, a minor affair. They disagreed about the need to regulate financial markets and big Wall Street players. Warren was able to rally even corporate-friendly Democrats Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) to her cause on that question. What\u2019s happening with the wealth tax in 2019 is more fundamental. Summers disputes the basic moral, political and economic cases for targeting wealth inequality as a social problem. Protect the poor, fine. But don\u2019t tell Summers that the existence of big fortunes is a big problem. At the Peterson Institute forum last month,\u00a0Summers assailed the idea\u00a0of discouraging billionaires from \u201cinvesting the money in the ways they think are most productive.\u201d They were, after all, \u201csmart enough to accumulate it in the first place.\u201d What\u2019s more, Summers insists, a wealth tax makes billionaires more likely to spend their money on faux-charitable contributions \u2015 nonprofits like right-wing think tanks and conservative magazines that regular folks would recognize as essentially political expenditures. These contributions escape the wealth tax and further entrench the political and social power of the super-rich. There are two basic problems with Summers\u2019 reasoning here. He isn\u2019t really arguing against a wealth tax per se \u2014 he\u2019s arguing against any tax that hits the wealthy at all. Progressive income taxes, capital gains taxes and estate taxes succumb to the same logic. The rich would just divert their income to socially destructive forms of spending to get more bang for their buck. But Summers is not arguing that the United States should give up on other forms of taxation. In fact, he\u2019s claiming we should double-down on them. He believes the better and \u201cmore progressive\u201d alternative to the wealth tax is a higher tax on capital gains, and particularly inheritances. There is no justification, he says, for the super-rich passing down their wealth to their children, who do not automatically inherit their parents\u2019 business acumen. But the estate tax in particular seems more easily gamed than the wealth tax. Why would enormously rich families go to endless creative lengths to avoid a modest annual wealth levy but just shrug their shoulders at a massive, one-time estate tax? They wouldn\u2019t. Saez and Zucman aren\u2019t naive. They know that previous efforts to establish a wealth tax in Europe have mostly failed. But they\u2019ve studied those policies and think they understand why they fell apart. Most wealth taxes kicked in too low, they argue. By taxing people with about $1 million in wealth instead of people with much higher levels, those wealth taxes generated opposition among people who were doing just fine, but who weren\u2019t really rich. If you\u2019ve been paying a mortgage in an expensive neighborhood for a long time, it\u2019s not hard to rack up $1 million in assets. This created a common political bond between the super-rich and the much more numerous upper-middle class, which joined forces to get wealth taxes repealed. The other problem is basic enforcement. Countries in the European Union who tried a wealth tax were simultaneously allowing Swiss banks to help rich people shield income and assets from tax authorities. If you actually police international bank accounts, as the United States has done since 2010, you might get better results. And indeed, if the super-rich were confident they could get around a wealth tax without too much trouble, they\u2019d have no reason to make a fuss about Warren\u2019s proposal. And yet everywhere you look, there\u2019s a billionaire furious about it (see: Michael Bloomberg, Leon Cooperman, Howard Schultz, Steven Schwarzman). Ultimately, the same question applies to Summers himself. If you really want to pursue a more progressive tax code, why strangle a new type of tax in the crib? Maybe it would work, maybe it would need to be tweaked, maybe it would need to be supplemented by other progressive taxes. The original income tax of 1913 was just 1% and applied to only the top 3% of households. Does Summers really think the next Democratic president would be better off with fewer tools to deploy against the super-rich at his or her disposal? But Summers isn\u2019t really arguing over money or numbers or even the future. He\u2019s arguing about the past, seeking the perfect dataset that will show he was right all along, that he and the Democratic Party didn\u2019t squander decades of progress by forging an alliance with the super-rich.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Few objects symbolize America\u2019s unique place in the world better than the automobile. Residents of the United States drive more than 37 miles per day, nearly twice as much as the average Swede or Norwegian. America has 1.16 cars for every licensed driver and spends roughly $534 per person each year building and maintaining its road network.\u00a0Three out of four\u00a0U.S. workers drive to work alone; fewer than 1 in 20 walk or bicycle. America\u2019s unique enthusiasm for the automobile has become one of the greatest challenges to solving climate change. Transportation is now the greatest source of greenhouse gases in the United States. And while utility companies are phasing out coal in favor of renewable energy, the auto industry is moving in the opposite direction. In March, the International Energy Agency\u00a0reported that America\u2019s oil use was rising more quickly than any other nation. In 2016, the average American drove 1,300 more miles\u00a0than they did in 1992. Nearly every advance in fuel economy has been wiped out by more driving, bigger cars \u2014 or deliberate sabotage by the Trump administration. And yet, no prominent Democrats have proposed policies to reverse this trend. The 2020 presidential candidates have put forward ambitious targets for weaning power plants off of fossil fuels, closing federal lands to drilling and dramatically increasing subsidies to electric vehicles. None of them, however, has acknowledged the urgent necessity for America to kick its driving habit. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine addressing the climate crisis in any meaningful way without taking on automobiles,\u201d said Clayton Nall, a political science professor at Stanford University who specializes in infrastructure spending. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to convert vehicles to electric. And even if it was, it\u2019s not likely to happen on a timeline that will address the carbon emissions problem. It\u2019s a real blind spot.\u201d The absence of meaningful plans to reduce car use is conspicuous. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections show that the United States needs to electrify its vehicle fleet and significantly reduce driving by 2030 to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. In 2018, the California Air Resources Board estimated that even a tenfold increase in electric vehicle sales would still require residents to drive 25 percent fewer miles each year to reach the state\u2019s emissions targets. Both reports suggest taking drastic action to reduce car use. This could include raising gas taxes, increasing investment in public transit or implementing \u201cdecongestion pricing,\u201d a toll for drivers to access heavily trafficked urban neighborhoods. Other countries have begun removing parking spots and\u00a0closing down urban highways in major cities. Some have banned cars from entering their urban cores altogether. Last year, the EU committed to a 35 percent reduction in car emissions by 2030. So far, these ambitious commitments haven\u2019t been taken up by the Democratic Party. In July, the $287 billion highway bill\u00a0passed out of the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee with the support of Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). The transportation spending package, the largest in history, will primarily fund the construction of new roads. Numerous studies have shown that building new roads does not reduce congestion and simply encourages Americans to drive. Despite a\u00a0$420 billion maintenance backlog, the bill dedicates just $6 billion to helping states fix existing roads. \u201cEven if you look at the most ambitious figures in the Democratic Party, there\u2019s less ambition to reduce driving than there needs to be,\u201d said Nall. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the only issues where they\u2019re taking the safe route.\u201d Most Democratic presidential candidates have kept their commitments to reducing transportation emissions undefined. Former Vice President Joe Biden, for example,\u00a0says he\u2019ll help local governments fund \u201calternative and cleaner transportation options,\u201d but doesn\u2019t specify further. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a climate plan that includes a section on \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d but doesn\u2019t set any targets or policies. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), the only candidate to include the phrase \u201creduce car usage\u201d in any published plan, offers no specifics on how such a reduction would happen. Other candidates are strangely unambitious. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has no aversion to laying out bold visions when it comes to health care and education, has set a target of increasing public transit ridership by just 65 percent over the next decade \u2014 an increase that would still see\u00a0fewer than 1 in 10 Americans taking a bus or train to work. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s plan proposes $10 billion in new public transportation spending per year, an amount that could cover\u00a0as little as 11 miles of new urban subways. Leah Stokes, a University of California, Santa Barbara, professor who specializes in climate politics, said that while the Democrats\u2019 plans are modest improvements over the current reality, they don\u2019t go very far in addressing climate change. \u201cNo one is proposing the radical reduction in driving that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if these plans were implemented, they wouldn\u2019t dramatically change the energy demands of the transportation system.\u201d Electric vehicles are the only area of climate policy where Democrats are comfortable being ambitious. Sanders says he\u2019ll electrify the entire transportation sector by 2030. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Warren have committed to converting all new vehicles to electric power by 2030. Buttigieg and Harris set the target at 2035. Stokes says that all of these plans make the same mistake, however: \u201cThey stick to status quo density and they do nothing about the fact that the vast majority of Americans drive to work by themselves.\u201d Americans\u2019 carbon footprint depends more on where they live than what they drive. Residents of lower Manhattan, for example,\u00a0emit less than half as much carbon as residents of Nassau County, New York, a commuter suburb with larger homes and higher rates of car ownership. Providing Nassau residents with electric vehicles would have some effect on their carbon footprint, but the effect would be much larger if they simply moved closer to jobs, services and shopping. There is also the problem of time. Americans own roughly\u00a0272 million cars. Only around\u00a017 million, or 6%, are purchased new each year. Even if the candidates\u2019 plans to reach 100% of new vehicles running on electric power by 2030 came true, it could take another decade before they reached the penetration necessary to significantly reduce emissions. Sanders\u2019 plan aims to speed up this process by offering a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d-style grant program that would purchase electric vehicles for low- and medium-income drivers. Over 10 years, the plan would cost $2.1 trillion, enough for roughly 54 million EVs at today\u2019s average price of $36,600 each. It is the largest single expenditure in Sanders\u2019 $16.3 billion climate plan. Matthew Lewis, a climate and urban policy consultant in Berkeley, said Sanders\u2019 plan is an inefficient way to spend such a large outlay. \u201cEven as a symbolic victory, it\u2019s not much of a victory,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Congratulations, you just threw away enough money to build a great public transit system in every city in the country.\u2019\u201d Rapidly expanding America\u2019s electric vehicle fleet has implications for the climate. Stokes estimates that meeting the Democrats\u2019 targets would require roughly doubling America\u2019s electrical capacity. Studies have found that if this additional capacity came from coal-fired power plants, the resulting rides wouldn\u2019t be much better for the climate than hybrid vehicles. Plus, the production of electric vehicles is itself a carbon-intensive process that involves mining cobalt and lithium for the battery and smelting steel for the frame. \u201cDepending on how much you drive, a car that\u2019s 10 to 12 years old might actually be better for the environment than replacing it with an electric vehicle,\u201d Lewis said. Then there are all the knock-on effects. One of the most reliable statistics in urban planning is that when gas prices fall, Americans drive more. Buying electric vehicles for millions of Americans could encourage them to spend more time on the road, worsening congestion and encouraging even more emissions. And electric cars are still cars: All of the other negative impacts of driving \u2014 from pedestrian deaths to the health effects of long commutes to the harmful \u201cmicroplastics\u201d shed by rubber tires \u2014 would remain firmly in place. \u201cNo matter what, transitioning to clean energy has to involve a systematic reduction of energy demand,\u201d said Daniel Aldana Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who runs a\u00a0research project on Americans\u2019 carbon footprints. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cyou solve one problem and end up with a bunch of new ones.\u201d The most obvious explanation for Democrats\u2019 four-wheeled blind spot is that reducing car use is politically unpopular. \u201cCampaigning against cars is like campaigning against hamburgers,\u201d Cohen said. Densifying cities is\u00a0controversial and public transit is stigmatized throughout most of the country. There are also more complicated incentives at play. Electric vehicle subsidies enrich automakers, whose unionized workers tend to lean left. The first two states to vote in the Democratic primary, Iowa and New Hampshire, are full of rural voters unlikely to find gas taxes and bike lanes appealing. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a dense city, then it\u2019s a viable conversation,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about anywhere else, it\u2019s a chicken or egg paradox\u201d \u2014 before politicians can propose denser housing or better public transport, they need a base of constituents who want them. In most of the United States, however, decades of disinvestment and sprawl have made it all but impossible for those constituencies to form. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live in a place where anything other than driving is a viable option,\u201d Cohen said, \u201cthen the specter of losing your car or cheap gas is pretty terrifying.\u201d The features of the Democratic base also play a role. A senior climate adviser who has worked in both politics and civil society (and declined to be identified because her views could jeopardize her current position) said environmental advocacy groups generally don\u2019t lobby Democrats to include reductions in car use in their platforms. Donors and civil society groups simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s an efficient use of their resources. \u201cThe theory in climate advocacy has always been to go after the gettable tons first,\u201d she said. That means prioritizing areas where federal regulations can reduce carbon emissions quickly and painlessly. At the federal level, that means tightening regulations on power plants. Promoting urban density, public transport and reductions in driving just aren\u2019t worth the political capital it would cost to achieve them. Policies to reduce driving also pose a communication challenge. It\u2019s hard to connect seemingly unrelated policy areas like housing density to carbon emissions. Many Americans think of climate change as a problem caused by fossil fuel companies, not their own commuting habits. \u201cPoliticians are good at talking about how to spread around goodies, but it\u2019s much harder to talk about everyone sharing in the pain of conservation,\u201d Nall said. But perhaps the greatest challenge is how few voters can imagine living in places that don\u2019t require driving. \u201cAmericans struggle to understand what public transit would do for their lives,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBecause the transit is shitty in so many places, they assume it will always be shitty and will make it harder for them to get around.\u201d On the bright side, international experience indicates that a future with less driving may not be the dystopia voters and politicians fear. Restrictions on cars in European cities have been\u00a0overwhelmingly popular.\u00a0Decongestion charges in Stockholm and London were loathed before they were implemented but beloved soon after. In 2016, Barcelona closed streets to cars in a single neighborhood. Now, after citywide demand, it is replicating the\u00a0\u201csuperblock\u201d program in five more. Things may even be changing in the United States. After a yearslong legal battle, New York City finally banned cars from a\u00a0heavily trafficked east-west thoroughfare to clear the way for buses. The plan has earned\u00a0rave reviews from transit riders. Opponents\u2019 predictions that extra traffic would spill over into nearby streets have not come to fruition \u2014 cutting off the roadway seems to have incentivized New Yorkers to get where they\u2019re going some other way. Reducing transportation emissions and battling climate change, Lewis said, will require doing a lot more projects like New York City\u2019s. \u201cWe need to do the reverse of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cRight now I have to drive a car because the transit is such a mess. We have to make it so I have to take the bus because driving is a mess.\u201d Illustration: Doug Chayka for HuffPost If it matters to you, it matters to us. Support HuffPost\u2019s journalism here.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " A slew of elections on Tuesday, covering territory from the Mississippi Delta to the wealthy Virginia suburbs to the city of Philadelphia, and offices from city council to governor, will collectively serve as a test of just how nationalized American politics has become. In Mississippi and Kentucky, two men \u2015 one a local political legend, the other the son of a popular former governor \u2015 will seek to convince their neighbors to turn against the Republican Party they trust wholly at the national level and elect Democrats to the governor\u2019s mansion. In Virginia, Republicans hoping to cling to control of the state legislature are counting on a pair of damaging local political scandals to matter more than suburban voters\u2019 support for gun control and loathing of President Donald Trump. And in Philadelphia, a local political machine is seeking to defeat a progressive whose campaign received a major boost from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who was previously the communications director for the Democratic Governors Association, said results from last year\u2019s midterm elections only point to things getting tougher for candidates trying to swim against the political tides. \u201cThe real story of the 2018 election was that everyone went to their political homes, turnout was through the roof, and places that were Republican were Republican, places that were Democrat were Democrat,\u201d Leopold said, arguing it would be a strong performance for Democrats if they win just one of the three governor\u2019s races this year in Louisiana, Kentucky and Mississippi. \u201cThat\u2019s the playing field we\u2019re in now during the Trump era, with hyper-vigilance and hyper-involvement. That makes red states redder and blue states bluer.\u201d Not a single federal office is up for grabs Tuesday. But the election results could also offer previews of key political questions ahead of the 2020 presidential election: Do Republicans stand any chance of reclaiming the suburbs in the Trump era? Can Democrats \u2015 conservative or otherwise \u2015 possibly hope to win back rural white voters in significant numbers? Here are the elections to watch on Tuesday. The two headline elections on Tuesday night are battles for governorships in Kentucky and Mississippi, both states where Democrats\u2019 decadeslong grip on state government finished its long decline during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Trump won both states by double digits in 2016, but this year, Democrats have managed to mount robust and well-funded campaigns in both states. In Mississippi, Democrats have something of a dream candidate: Jim Hood, the state\u2019s mulleted, four-term attorney general known for helping consumers win big settlements against insurance companies after Hurricane Katrina. Hood, who is one of just three statewide elected Democrats in the Deep South, is facing Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a fairly standard issue southern Republican of the country-club variety. Public polling has shown Hood with a chance of victory, and Republicans are worried enough about the outcome to deploy Trump to Tupelo \u2015 Hood\u2019s home base \u2015 to help lock down conservative voters ahead of the election. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a far-left Democrat running Mississippi \u2014 wait a minute,\u201d Trump told the state\u2019s voters on Friday night. \u201cHow\u2019s this guy, you know, I can\u2019t believe this is a competitive race. It\u2019s, like, embarrassing. I\u2019m talking to Mississippi, you know? I\u2019m talking to Mississippi. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Hood, who opposes abortion rights and supports gun rights, bears some similarities to Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. As Edwards did during the campaign that led to his upset victory four years ago, Hood has focused on Medicaid expansion as a political winner that would deliver health coverage to 100,000 more residents in a state with one of the highest uninsured rates in the country and played up his moderate bona fides.\u00a0(He\u2019s also\u00a0hammered Reeves as a political insider\u00a0and career politician \u2014 which is likely an effective charge, though not as effective as Edwards\u2019 attack on then-GOP Sen. David Vitter for picking \u201cprostitutes over patriots.\u201d) \u201cThey know I\u2019m a moderate and I\u2019m gonna get things done,\u201d Hood said of the state\u2019s voters ahead of Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cThey know nothing crazy is gonna come through that legislature, it\u2019s gonna be a conservative legislature.\u201d Part of Hood\u2019s effort to distance himself from his party, however, has meant declining to endorse Democrat Jennifer Riley Collins,\u00a0a former state American Civil Liberties Union director and retired Army colonel who is running to replace him as attorney general. She would be the first African American elected statewide in Mississippi since the Reconstruction era. (Mississippi is 38% African American, and its politics are sharply polarized along racial lines, requiring Democrats to make inroads with conservative whites to win.) In an interview, Riley Collins downplayed Hood\u2019s decision, and played up what her victory would mean for the state: \u201cIt means Mississippi is no longer a closed society. It means Mississippi is now open to all of its citizens,\u201d she said, adding that \u201covercoming barriers is nothing new for an African American woman in Mississippi.\u201d Both Hood and Riley Collins have an additional barrier: They\u2019re competing with Republicans under a Jim Crow-era law requiring a candidate to win not only a plurality of the vote, but also a majority of the state\u2019s legislative districts. If they don\u2019t, the state legislature gets to determine the victor. The Democratic candidate in Kentucky, Attorney General Andy Beshear, has not run as far from party orthodoxy as Hood has. The son of a popular former governor, he supports abortion rights, and,\u00a0by emphasizing education and health care, his campaign has largely reflected those run by successful 2018 congressional candidates. Beshear\u2019s relatively standard campaign has forced his unpopular opponent, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, to aggressively nationalize the race. Bevin\u2019s abrasive style \u2014 he once accused striking teachers of abetting child molestation \u2014 has alienated Kentucky voters. (Campaigning for him on Monday night, Trump declared: \u201cHe\u2019s such a pain in the ass, but that\u2019s what you want.\u201d) Bevin has repeatedly attacking Beshear for his abortion stance, linking him to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and dubbed him \u201cthe Hunter Biden of Kentucky\u201d during one debate. \u201cIn Kentucky, if you turn it into a shirts-and-skins exercise, it should be better for Republicans because there are more of us than them,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP political strategist based in Louisville. Public polling points to a close race in Kentucky, which is dominated by rural white voters, but Jennings noted Republicans are on a substantial winning streak in the state, outperforming expectations in 2014, 2015 and 2018. Democrats, similarly, are aware of how quickly a Kentucky election can turn against them: What appeared to be a close race in 2015 turned into a 9-point Bevin blowout. Remember when Virginia Democrats\u2019 scandals dominated national news? The state\u2019s Republicans hope you do. In early 2019, revelations about Gov. Ralph Northam allegedly wearing blackface and two sexual assault allegations against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax rocked the party, which had been steadily turning the state blue for more than a decade.\u00a0(Fairfax has denied the sexual assault allegations.) But 10 months later, the scandals have done little to dampen Democratic expectations. The party, backed by millions in outside spending from liberal groups and donors, is optimistic about taking back\u00a0the three seats they need to control the House of Delegates and the two seats necessary to capture the state Senate. Trying to stave off a dive into policymaking irrelevance, Republicans have resurrected the scandal. In a race for a GOP-held Senate seat in Loudoun and Prince William counties, two of the nation\u2019s wealthiest jurisdictions, Republican Geary Higgins is airing an ad alleging that his Democratic opponent, current state Del. John Bell, \u201csilenced\u201d two women who accused Fairfax. Other Republicans around the state have made similar attacks in mailers. On a conference call hosted by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Bell said the scandals were a non-issue for voters. \u201cI haven\u2019t had to explain it to a single voter. And voters see it for what it is: a complete distraction,\u201d he said, before firing back at Republicans: \u201cDid they get permission from those victims? I don\u2019t think they did. They completely used their tragedy.\u201d Bell, meanwhile, has joined almost every Democrat running for the legislature by placing a heavy emphasis on gun control. In his television ad, he picks up a bullet on a high school football field to highlight his efforts to overturn a law allowing firing ranges within 100 yards of a school. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the NRA, especially when it comes to keeping our kids safe,\u201d he says in the 30-second spot. And while Higgins and other Virginia Republicans spent the summer and early fall portraying themselves as moderates, he\u2019s ending the race with attempts to fire up conservatives. Higgins held a Monday afternoon rally with right-wing talk show host Mark Levin, and was endorsed by Trump just after midnight on Monday. Bell was confident that the president\u2019s endorsement would backfire in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Northam in 2017 and Sen. Tim Kaine in 2018. \u201cI wished he had done it about two weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve helped me even more.\u201d The Working Families Party, a national progressive group backed by unions, is looking to make a big splash in Philadelphia on Tuesday. It\u2019s fielded candidates for two at-large city council seats reserved for members of minority parties (i.e. not Democrats). Historically, Republicans have won those seats, but the WFP is hoping to \u201ckick the party of Trump out of city hall.\u201d The Democratic political machine in the city, led by former Congressman Bob Brady, has resisted this effort. When Councilwoman Helen Gym, a rising star in the city\u2019s Democratic circles, backed the candidacy of Kendra Brooks, a public education advocate who is running as an independent with the backing of the WFP, Brady lashed out at Gym for breaking party ranks. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid and she shouldn\u2019t do it, and I think it\u2019s going to hurt her in the long run,\u201d Brady told The Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cThey\u2019re taking votes from a Democratic candidate and that\u2019s our slate, and anybody that\u2019s taking votes from a Democrat is the opposition.\u201d But Brooks soon received an even more high-profile endorsement: Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, announced her support of Brooks in September. That endorsement set up a natural political science experiment: Do Philadelphia voters care more about their longtime party machine? Or about the preferences of a leading national progressive politician? In an interview, WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell argued that victories by Brooks and Philadelphia\u2019s other WFP-endorsed candidate, Nicholas O\u2019Rourke, would have an outsized impact. \u201cIt would change the politics of Philly dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll mean progressives [on the council] have a bloc.\u201d He said if their efforts in Philadelphia are successful, they could bring the strategy to other jurisdictions that have city council seats reserved for non-Democratic candidates, including Washington, D.C. \u201cWe want this to be a showcase of independent political power that could take hold in any city in the country,\u201d Mitchell said.",

During an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cHalftime Report,\u201d the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors spoke out against President Donald Trump\u2019s behavior while also opposing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe and arguing that the fate of Trump\u2019s administration should be determined on Election Day next year. \u201cHis deportment is not presidential and we need a unifier in that position because the country is being torn apart,\u201d Cooperman said. \u201cI am not in favor of all this impeachment inquiry. I want the American people to decide in November 2020 what the future should be.\u201d Asked by host Scott Wapner why he was becoming noticeably emotional, Cooperman then began tearing up. \u201cI care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Taking note of the interview, Warren tweeted that Cooperman cares about his fortune, pointing out that he\u2019s a shareholder in student loan company Navient, which has been sued by several states for allegedly cheating borrowers. \u201cI care about an entire generation of students being crushed by student loan debt \u2015 deferring their American dream because they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI care about making sure every American has the opportunity to succeed.

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " A Kentucky federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by several Covington Catholic High School students against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.). U.S. District Judge William Bertelsman granted a motion Tuesday to dismiss the Aug. 1 lawsuit, which alleged that eight Covington Catholic students were defamed during a January field trip to Washington, D.C., that went viral after MAGA hat-wearing students appeared to intimidate an indigenous activist. The lawsuit listed a dozen public figures \u2015 including journalists and social media-savvy academics \u2015 but Bertelsman\u2019s dismissal only applies to Warren and Haaland. Motions to dismiss the lawsuits against Warren and Haaland were \u201cgranted on the basis that the claims against them are barred by sovereign immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act,\u201d the ruling stated. The rest of the claims in the lawsuit were transferred back to Kentucky state court, according to Robert Barnes, an attorney who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the students. Other defendants who were listed in the lawsuit included New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, historian Kevin Kruse, actress Kathy Griffin and Republican political commentator Ana Navarro. \u201cWe will be appealing the dismissal of the two elected officials,\u201d Barnes said of the judge\u2019s decision regarding Warren and Haaland. \u201cPoliticians are not immune from libel; getting elected to federal office is not a license to libel.\u201d The lawsuit surrounds a now-viral incident\u00a0in which indigenous activist Nathan Phillips sang and played a drum at the Indigenous People\u2019s March at the Lincoln Memorial on Jan. 18 while Covington Catholic students surrounded him.\u00a0The students chanted in what many considered a mocking manner and performing the offensive tomahawk chop. Many interpreted video footage of Covington student Nick Sandmann\u2019s smirk and close proximity to Phillips as an attempt to intimidate the activist, though the teen has maintained that he was trying to defuse the situation. The students were in Washington to participate in the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally. Reacting to the incident, Haaland tweeted that Phillips was \u201cbeing harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens.\u201d Haaland and Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) became the first Native American women elected to Congress last year. \u201cThis Veteran put his life on the line for our country,\u201d Haaland also tweeted. \u201cThe students\u2019 blatant display of hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.\u201d Warren had tweeted that Phillips \u201dendured hateful taunts with dignity and strength, then urged us all to do better.\u201d The lawsuit alleged that Haaland and Warren\u2019s tweets were libelous. Sandmann and his family filed a separate lawsuit in February accusing The Washington Post of making defamatory statements about him in its coverage of the incident in Washington. That lawsuit accused the newspaper of \u201ctargeting and bullying\u201d Sandmann because he\u2019s a \u201cwhite, Catholic student wearing a red \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 souvenir cap.\u201d Bertelsman originally dismissed that suit in July, saying that the statements Sandmann alleged were defamatory were not and are protected by the First Amendment. But the judge ruled in October that the case could proceed into the discovery phase, saying that \u201cjustice requires\u201d further review of three of the 33 statements cited in the lawsuit. Sandmann\u2019s family also sued CNN and NBC over their coverage of the incident. Both networks have filed motions to dismiss the pending lawsuits. President Donald Trump recently tweeted his support for the teenage Sandmann, calling the Post \u201cthoroughly disgusting\u201d and saying the student \u201ccould now have a good chance of winning.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over their competing health care plans, writing in an essay Tuesday that she was taking a dangerous \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to the issue. In a post on Medium, the Democratic presidential hopeful also zeroed in on comments his rival made last week that he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary\u201d and \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d by criticizing her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. Warren\u2019s proposal is bolder and more progressive than Biden\u2019s, but also more expensive. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cBut at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Biden, who pitches himself as more able to win over moderate voters in crucial swing states than Warren or the other major contenders in the Democratic race, emphasized throughout the piece that Warren\u2019s comment \u201cis no way to bring the country together. This is no way for this party to beat Donald Trump\u201d in next year\u2019s presidential election. Warren\u2019s remarks came after Biden\u2019s campaign launched an attack on her Medicare for All plan, accusing her campaign of using \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d to hide that its $21 trillion cost would require tax increases on the middle class. Biden, by contrast, is proposing an expansion of former President\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and allowing people to keep their private insurance if they want to. The two will face off over health care and other issues more at a Nov. 20 debate alongside that also will feature at least seven other candidates.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the 2020 presidential race, breaking with fellow first-term progressive women of color who call themselves \u201cthe Squad.\u201d \u201cAt a time when so many people find their lives threatened and their dreams denied, we need bold, compassionate leaders who put power back in the hands of people,\u201d Pressley said in an email to supporters on Wednesday. \u201cI am so grateful to call Elizabeth Warren a friend, a partner in good, and my Senator. I am proud to endorse her candidacy for President.\u201d The other \u201cSquad\u201d members \u2015 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.),\u00a0Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) \u2015 endorsed Warren\u2019s progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), last month. Pressley released a video announcement along with her emailed statement and said she would join Warren on the campaign trail on Thursday in North Carolina. \u201cI have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums,\u201d Pressley said in the video. \u201cAnd she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.\u201d Warren retweeted Pressley\u2019s video on Wednesday, writing: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be fighting alongside you to put power in the hands of the people.\u201d Pressley\u2019s endorsement grants Warren a high-profile congressional backer and may also boost her standing with Black voters in her quest to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Last year, Pressley became Massachusetts\u2019 first Black woman elected to Congress. She was the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. The current Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has a substantial lead among Black voters nationally and in South Carolina \u2015 the first state in the South to hold its primary. Black voters comprise more than 60% of the state\u2019s electorate. Warren has done considerable outreach to Black progressive groups\u00a0over the last year, but has struggled to overtake Biden. Pressley\u2019s endorsement comes a day after Biden published an essay that appeared to escalate his feud with Warren over their competing health care plans, and characterized Warren as elitist and condescending. Biden and Warren, along with at least seven other Democratic candidates, will face off at a Nov. 20 debate in Georgia.",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in the heart of Washington\u2019s lobbying world on Wednesday, criticizing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being too aggressive and unwilling to give Republicans a chance. \u201cWith Donald Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to see a number of my Republican colleagues have an epiphany. Mark my words. Mark my words,\u201d Biden said. On the same day Biden made his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was just a few blocks away at the White House, boasting about how he blocked Merrick Garland from getting a seat on the Supreme Court. Garland, of course, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away. McConnell successfully blocked Garland from even getting a hearing \u2015 all long before Trump came into office. Biden spoke at Sidley Austin, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful law firms literally located on K Street (which has long been shorthand for Washington lobbying). Sidley Austin also has a lobbying practice. Biden, like the rest of the major 2020 Democratic candidates, is not taking money from federal lobbyists. Biden has been going after Warren in recent days after she said he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Her comments came in response to\u00a0Biden\u2019s criticism of how she will pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Biden said the next president is going to inherit a \u201cdivided nation,\u201d and he made the case that he, and not someone like Warren, can make it better. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take two things: One is somebody who in fact, knows how to reach across the aisle and get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the people that are running against me tell me I\u2019m na\u00efve, one said I should be in the Republican primary, God love her. That\u2019s not the way you get things done, man. You don\u2019t go in and tell people that they disagree there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with them.\u201d The attendees applauded at Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden has made these \u201cepiphany\u201d comments before. \u2033[T]he thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke,\u201d he said in May. \u201cYou will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d This belief is central to Biden\u2019s pitch: Trump is so bad, and Biden is so good at working across the aisle that bipartisan comity will just suddenly break out if he\u2019s elected. Even in the Obama years, Biden was hopeful that Republicans would finally come around.\u00a0In November 2012, he predicted that if Obama won a decisive reelection, he could get Republicans to work alongside the administration and that people would see the \u201cfever break.\u201d Republicans showed little willingness to work with Obama after his reelection. On clean energy, Republicans used a failed green energy startup, Solyndra, to question all of the administration\u2019s energy initiatives and cast the president as corrupt. And Republican senators blocked Garland in 2016. Biden recently said he was open to a super PAC backing him. Those entities can raise and spend unlimited sums and often rely on checks worth tens of thousands of dollars from wealthy donors. Many of Biden\u2019s opponents have shunned super PACs this cycle, and two of his progressive competitors \u2015 Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 also don\u2019t do high-dollar fundraisers.",

      "content": " Microsoft founder Bill Gates has joined the chorus of famous billionaires who are skeptical of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy, claiming it would leave him counting what he has left. Speaking at The New York Times DealBook conference on Wednesday, Gates didn\u2019t sound excited by the prospect of the senator from Massachusetts clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how open-minded she is,\u201d Gates said, adding that he didn\u2019t think she would\u00a0\u201ceven be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.\u201d Forbes estimates that Gates has a net worth of $106.8 billion. He has the second-largest fortune in the world, just behind Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. Warren\u2019s signature plan calls for a 2% wealth tax on fortunes larger than $50 million and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion to pay for some of her other bold ideas, such as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She estimates her tax would apply to just 75,000 households, and it\u2019s popular among voters \u2015 even millionaire voters. But Gates thinks it goes too far. \u201cI\u2019ve paid over $10 billion in taxes. I\u2019ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20 billion, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cBut when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I\u2019m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,\u201d he continued, adding that he thought high taxes for the rich would stifle American innovation. Warren tweeted at Gates later that day, saying she actually would be happy to meet with him and that her plan would not result in him paying $100 billion in taxes (which is around his entire net worth). Gates, whose company battled with the government for a decade over efforts to break it up, also stressed that he didn\u2019t approve of Warren\u2019s plan to break up big tech companies. In one of his more shocking remarks, Gates also refused to say whether he would vote for Warren over President Donald Trump in a 2020 matchup, saying he\u2019d pick \u201cwhoever I decide would have the more professional approach.\u201d Gates joins other mega-wealthy people in his criticism of Warren\u2019s tax plan. Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman sent the senator a letter last month saying\u00a0 she had\u00a0\u201cproceeded to admonish me (as if a parent chiding an ungrateful child) to \u2018pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream.\u2019\u201d Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said Warren \u201cvilifies successful people\u201d and said we should instead \u201capplaud successful people.\u201d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " DECORAH, Iowa \u2015 When Pete Buttigieg begins his stump speeches to the throngs of voters who gather to hear him at town halls across Iowa, he doesn\u2019t start with his plan for a particular policy or elucidate a specific critique of President Donald Trump. Instead, with a pastoral touch drawn from his liberal Episcopalian faith, the 37-year-old Democratic presidential contender, who\u2019s also the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asks his audience to imagine the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cI want to ask you to really visualize the first day when the sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told a flock of about 1,000 voters on Saturday night in the college town of Decorah, about 15 miles south of the Minnesota border. Unlike rivals to his left, like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Buttigieg does not ask voters to recognize the supremacy of corporate power and political corruption as much as he wants them to confront the difficulty of healing a country polarized along partisan lines. Uniting the country, he argues, is a prerequisite to expanding health care coverage, tackling climate change, boosting wages and narrowing the racial wealth gap. But for such a monumental challenge, the request Buttigieg issues to his audience is relatively modest. He wants people to summon the patience and courage that they bring to discussions with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table. The day after the election, he wants them to call their friends and relatives who voted for a different presidential candidate and discuss something non-political. And most of all, he wants them to put their trust in him as the person most capable of leading Americans toward these solutions while easing the rancor of the current political moment. \u201cI believe that the right president, the president that I seek to be, can gather together an American majority to get these things done,\u201d he said in Decorah on Saturday. \u201cThe good news is the American people are ready \u2015 you can feel it. Not everybody. But most of us are ready for solutions to these problems.\u201d If the pitch sounds familiar, that\u2019s because like virtually every element of the latest iteration of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s designed to emulate the rhetoric, tactics and spirit of former President Barack Obama. During Obama\u2019s first run, he paired a progressive policy platform with soaring descriptions of the United States\u2019 common fabric and appeals to overcome the partisan divisions that separated \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states.\u201d He preached an optimistic faith in the power of the country to renew itself that was just vague enough for moderates and progressives alike to see their values in his platform. And he too was a young, relative political newcomer and would-be barrier-breaking minority, who took his articulate stump speech to the rural-most corners of the first-in-the-nation caucus state. (Where Obama was the country\u2019s first Black president, Buttigieg would be the country\u2019s first openly gay president.) Where Obama preached \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d Buttigieg is calling for \u201chope\u201d and \u201cbelonging.\u201d Where Obama joked about an end to \u201cScooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence and Karl Rove politics,\u201d Buttigieg relishes an \u201cend to this chaos and corruption and the tweets.\u201d In his barnburner speech at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s massive Liberty and Justice rally and dinner in the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday night, Buttigieg made the comparison explicit to an audience of 13,000, at least a few thousand of whom were his most dedicated supporters. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock doors for a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said, referencing Obama. \u201cAnd we knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d he continued, prompting roars of approval from his blue-and-yellow-clad fans. But the differences between Buttigieg and Obama are just as obvious. Buttigieg has only served as mayor of a city of just over 100,000 people, and he lost both times he sought higher office. (He ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017). And though over one-quarter of the population of South Bend is Black, Buttigieg\u2019s tenure has been rocked by\u00a0race-related scandals, including the July police killing of a Black man accused of trying to steal cars, which sparked heated protests. His support among non-white Democratic primary voters is in the low single digits, according to public polls. He\u2019s also more popular with older voters, despite being the only candidate who is a millennial. Obama, of course, had a strong base of young people who fueled the excitement and energy of his run. What\u2019s more, while Obama courted voters on the activist left, Buttigieg has by turns confused them and spurned them outright.\u00a0Early on, he called for the aggressive measure of adding more justices to the Supreme Court, but more recently, he said that his vision of an expanded bench would encourage the confirmation of \u201cswing\u201d justices like Anthony Kennedy or David Souter \u2015 two men who were chosen by Republican presidents. The comments were widely interpreted as endorsements of Kennedy and Souter, though that did not appear to be his intention. He\u2019s also been especially hard on Warren and Sanders\u00a0for backing a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan that would effectively end the vast majority of private health care coverage. In September and October when Warren declined to say how she would finance Medicare for All \u2014 and whether it would require tax increases \u2014 Buttigieg effectively called her a hypocrite. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d he said in a CNN interview in September.\u00a0(Warren subsequently released a detailed financing plan that did not raise middle-class taxes.) When HuffPost asked him in Iowa last weekend whether his pugnacious rhetoric marked a break with his previous comments, Buttigieg insisted that he has been consistent. \u201cI continue to believe that Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what. I think I\u2019ll be better at fending that off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I hold my views on health care policy is because I think it\u2019s the right answer.\u201d In another discussion with reporters in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg also reiterated that his comments about Kennedy and Souter were in reference to a hypothetical scenario in which the Supreme Court is expanded.\u00a0He believes that a larger court could be capable of accommodating swing justices and could transcend the \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d of the present bench. \u201cI was not saying that in the current Supreme Court structure, I would appoint people with the judicial philosophy like Kennedy or Souter,\u201d he said. \u201cA better example would probably be Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of a justice whose judicial philosophy largely matches my own.\u201d Notwithstanding Buttigieg\u2019s glaring differences with Obama, he is trying to cultivate the kinds of voters who remain enamored of the former president\u2019s eloquence and sunny disposition. Call it the \u201cWest Wing\u201d lane. He is the kind of candidate that Democrats of varied ideological leanings can see as the personification of their ideal of politics \u2015 a place where intelligence, uplifting rhetoric and an inspiring personal story are enough to vanquish the demons of division that plague the country. Many attendees of Buttigieg\u2019s town halls volunteered comparisons to Obama unprompted, while some cited other iconic Democratic presidents. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of his charisma,\u201d said Barb Neal, a retired banker from Mount Vernon, who attended the Decorah town hall, by way of explaining the Obama comparison. \u201cHe just gives me hope. He\u2019s so positive. So many of them are so negative \u2015 just bashing the other side, and he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Mary Thomsen, Neal\u2019s sister, who still works as a banker, chimed into agree. \u201cHe reminds me of Obama. For some reason he also reminds me of John F. Kennedy,\u201d she said. Of course, former Vice President Joe Biden has, more than any other candidate, sought to capitalize on his direct ties to Obama. He frequently references \u201cmy friend Barack\u201d in his stump speeches. And his strong support among Black voters in the early primary state of South Carolina is widely attributed to positive memories of his partnership with the country\u2019s first Black president. In trying to channel Obama \u2014 rather than generate good will by association with him \u2014 Buttigieg appears to be having success with many of the Iowa voters who are looking for a more moderate contender, but may be underwhelmed by Biden\u2019s performance on the trail. Buttigieg trounced the former vice president in third quarter fundraising (though the mayor\u2019s haul still fell short of Warren and Sanders\u2019 totals). And he has been rising in Iowa\u2019s polls even as Biden has continued to drop. Several Iowa Democrats at Buttigieg\u2019s events in small towns across the northern part of the state over the weekend described concerns about either the effect of Biden\u2019s age on his public speaking abilities, or the negative publicity surrounding his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine. Laura Swalve, a former school psychologist from Swea City who came to see Buttigieg at the VFW hall in Algona on Monday, described herself as a \u201cfan\u201d of Biden\u2019s. But while clarifying that she does not think he is senile, Swalve worries that he\u2019s \u201cjust not as quick\u201d as he used to be. \u201cI honestly think his age sometimes comes through, like in the debates, when he kind of didn\u2019t know how to say things,\u201d she said. For Bill Paup, a retired schoolteacher from Cedar Falls who came to a Buttigieg town hall in Waverly on Sunday, the appearance of wrongdoing related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine was enough to push him toward other options. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not valid concerns, but just like in 2016, it doesn\u2019t take a valid concern to bury somebody,\u201d Paup said. \u201cIt just takes a lot of noise. And he\u2019s got that.\u201d The Liberty and Justice Celebration is the last of several Iowa political confabs that punctuate the six-month period of campaigning leading up to the Iowa caucuses, which are due to take place this year on Feb. 3. Only candidates who purchase the state party\u2019s voter file or have field offices in the state are permitted to speak. They are also welcome to purchase tickets for their supporters to attend and cheer them on in the stands. (In other words, raucous applause is often less spontaneous, and more sponsored.) In November 2007, Obama\u2019s memorable speech at the fundraiser \u2015 then known as the Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2015 set the tone for the homestretch of Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign, which culminated in his historic victory on caucus day. Buttigieg sought to make his speech \u2015 and delegation \u2015 at Friday\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration a similarly impressive turning point. Festivities began with a rally in downtown Des Moines and a march to the dinner that the Buttigieg campaign said included 2,300 people. Although the campaign \u2015 like other campaigns \u2015 coordinated the participation of many Iowa activists, there was also a delegation of some 1,000 members of the ad hoc, internet-based, grassroots group, \u201cBarnstomers 4 Pete,\u201d who attended the event on their own dime. Ariana Wyndham, an undocumented immigrant who can remain in the country thanks to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program and who lives in Warren, Ohio, is a leader of the group. She drove to Des Moines with her husband Peter, a crane operator, for the dinner festivities and a few days of canvassing and bonding with fellow activists. Speaking to HuffPost on the concourse of the Wells Fargo arena, Wyndham, covered in Buttigieg swag, described suffering from anxiety and depression after Trump\u2019s election. Without the right to vote, she felt powerless to get involved in politics until she found out about Buttigieg. She was particularly drawn to the account Buttigieg gives in his book, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d of reviving South Bend, a struggling post-industrial city that reminded her of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it can be done everywhere and it should be done everywhere.\u201d The following days were a show of force from Buttigieg designed to capitalize on his strong reception at the Liberty and Justice Celebration. On Saturday, after answering the questions of building trades union leaders at a multi-candidate fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg embarked on a three-day bus tour across rural northern Iowa, welcoming reporters onto his bus for extended group interviews in between campaign stops. Over the course of six town halls, Buttigieg spoke to crowds ranging from 275 people on the low end to upwards of 1,000, according to estimates provided to the campaign by building managers. The turnout was significant considering that all but one of the events took place in towns with a few thousand people. (His fourth stop was in Mason City, which has a population just under 28,000.) The campaign has one of the most extensive field presences in Iowa with over 100 staff on the ground and some 20 offices. Buttigieg has ramped up his investment in digital advertisements in the state as well, spending over $48,000 on Facebook ads targeting Iowans in the past week alone \u2014 more than any other Democrat running for president \u201cIn a lot of the towns that not just campaigns but a lot of economists have written off, Mayor Pete\u2019s team has shown up,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat running to represent several of the towns Buttigieg visited in the U.S. House and who has not endorsed in the presidential primary. \u201cFor months it was Warren. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve switched strategy or something. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m now seeing Pete more.\u201d For Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who tagged along with Buttigieg for a tour of an ethanol plant in Mason City, Buttigieg\u2019s itinerary was still more evidence that he was walking in the footsteps of Obama, who won Iowa twice. All but one of Buttigieg\u2019s bus tour stops was in a county that Obama won at least once and then went for Trump in 2016. \u201cObama was the model. He was everywhere,\u201d Judge said. Buttigieg has not shied away from the obvious differences between himself and Obama. At a town hall in Mason City on Sunday night that was attended by about 500 people, nearly all of whom were white, a voter asked Buttigieg how he planned to increase his support with Black voters. \u201cThe way to win any vote is to deserve to win it. My job is to make sure there is no confusion about where we stand,\u201d he said. To that end, he has unveiled a multi-pronged plan, named after the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, tailored to address the particular challenges facing Black communities \u2015 from difficulty obtaining credit to start a business or buy a home to encountering racial bias in the job market or the health care system. He also devoted a segment of his stump speech each stop in rural Iowa to confronting the country\u2019s legacy of anti-Black racism. The impact of racism \u201cis as important to discuss with mostly white audiences as it was with the NAACP gathering I was at early today,\u201d he told another predominantly white audience in Decorah on Saturday night. \u201cThis could wreck the entire American project \u2026 as long as we allow it to be the case that this is two different countries in your health and your access to housing or ability to get a job,\u201d depending on whether you are white or Black. And when Buttigieg lists mayoral peers to whom he looks for inspiration and guidance, two of the first names to come up are Michael Tubbs and Randall Woodfin, the young Black leaders of Stockton, California, and Birmingham, Alabama, respectively. For the most progressive voters in the Democratic primary, however, Obama\u2019s presidency is a cautionary tale, rather than a model. For example, they see a president whose embrace of corporate-friendly international trade agreements was wrongheaded and politically damaging, and whose Wall Street-cozy cabinet prevented him from adequately addressing the post-2008 housing crisis. But when asked to make the case that he would deliver on his progressive economic promises despite the support he enjoys from corporate America, Buttigieg again turns to Obama. \u201cThese same criticisms were leveled against President Obama,\u201d said Buttigieg, noting that Obama received campaign contributions from corporate leaders, including many Wall Street executives. \u201cIf you think about with respect to Wall Street, he delivered the strongest regulations and accountability that there had been there in a generation.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, Buttigieg\u2019s embrace of conciliatory politics of the kind Obama employed in his first term risks turning off voters disappointed in the Republican-driven gridlock of the Obama era. HuffPost asked Buttigieg on Monday how he would navigate shepherding policy priorities through Congress even in an optimistic scenario where Democrats control the Senate thanks to conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u201cThis is the interesting thing \u2015 you look at a Joe Manchin, some of these kind of swing-state senators, their orientation may be moderate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pro-corporate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have trouble with a lot of moderate senators on the idea of paid family leave, for example, or making sure that the tax code is more beneficial to the working- and middle-class versus the very wealthy.\u201d Later that day, Buttigieg fielded a similar question from a voter at a town hall in Algona about how he would defend his policies from Republican attacks. He addressed the less favorable \u2015 and arguably more likely \u2015 scenario of a Congress that is at least partly controlled by Republicans. Buttigieg\u2019s proposed solution: Holding political rallies in the states and districts of lawmakers obstructing the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right? And when we\u2019re talking about a measure, that\u2019s not just a new policy and something that people support, even in a conservative area, I believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures \u2015 it would be good for their constituents and reminding their constituents what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. Perhaps fittingly, it was a tactic that Obama also tried. And notably, it didn\u2019t work.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has taken a lot of heat in the past week over her long-awaited plan to pay for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government-run health care program,\u00a0that she says doesn\u2019t include raising taxes on the middle class. Her moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination immediately panned it as unrealistic, however, accusing Warren of relying on \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d to fund the multitrillion-dollar proposal. Even Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee weighed in on Wednesday, saying it would never get enacted. But a group of bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d is also voicing skepticism about another, relatively smaller feature of Warren\u2019s plan: its reliance on the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, a similarly controversial policy fight in Washington. The group of eight senators shepherded a sweeping immigration bill with a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in 2013 only to watch it fail in the House, which was controlled by Republicans at the time. It is the last major immigration reform bill that has passed in the sharply divided Senate, eliciting deep skepticism on Capitol Hill about the prospect of another bipartisan breakthrough in the near future. \u201cCandidates can talk about controversial issues in more positive terms than those of us who have to roll up our sleeves and try to work on them day to day,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was a member of the group. Fellow Gang of Eight member Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) was similarly dubious of the financing plan, telling HuffPost that \u201cgetting that done and getting the savings are two different things.\u201d While cost estimates for Medicare for All have varied, Warren\u2019s campaign pegged the number at the low end of $20 trillion in new money over the next decade. The program would be financed with new taxes on corporations and the wealthy, but also in other ways like the increased revenue generated by legalizing undocumented immigrants and increasing legal immigration. Using the 2013 immigration bill as a model, Warren\u2019s campaign estimated that it would generate $400 billion toward paying for Medicare for All, even when taking into account the cost of providing health care for newly legalized immigrants. Durbin doubted, however, that all those savings would actually come to fruition. \u201cThere was a lot of money involved but we had it directed toward a certain purpose. I wouldn\u2019t sign up for Elizabeth\u2019s idea until she explained to me how we\u2019d be able to balance it out,\u201d he said. Republican members of the Gang of 8 were even more unconvinced about Warren\u2019s plan to pay for Medicare for All in part by passing comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running for president, you have a plan like that \u2015 you just make it up,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who himself once ran for president in 2016. To Rubio\u2019s and Durbin\u2019s point, most proposals laid out by presidential candidates tend to fudge the numbers a bit. They\u2019re often better viewed as a road map of the candidate\u2019s values and priorities once in office \u2015 when the real sausage-making begins. Take Donald Trump, for example. The president promised as a candidate that Mexico would pay for his border wall. Instead, he declared a national emergency and took the money from the Pentagon. The 2017 $1.5 trillion tax cut law, meanwhile, is nowhere near paying for itself as Republicans and the White House repeatedly promised before the deficit hit $1 trillion. But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) identified another hurdle to Warren\u2019s proposal: how to get either immigration reform or Medicare for All through the Senate even if Democrats win control of the chamber next year. Warren says she has a plan for this: eliminating the long-standing Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold on legislation, to push many of her proposals through Congress. But to get rid of the filibuster, she\u2019ll have to get some of her recalcitrant Democratic colleagues on board, too, who fear what Republicans would do in a scenario in which they once again control both Congress and the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy lift,\u201d said Graham, who also served on the Gang of 8. The South Carolina Republican did have a suggestion for Warren on how to finance her plan, though. \u201cPut climate change in there, too. Get some carbon free money,\u201d he quipped earlier this week. Warren, for her part, responded to criticism of her plan on Thursday with one of her favorite arguments. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said in an interview in South Carolina, when asked about Clinton\u2019s remarks.",

Warren then added:\u00a0\u201cSo, I\u2019m out here every day trying to talk to people about [my campaign], trying to bring more people into the fight, but if you\u2019ve got more ideas \u2015 I was told what I needed to do was smile more,\u201d she said with a sarcastic smile, prompting laughter from the audience. \u201cI see this as a lot of women, and a lot of men, want us to have a country that works for not just a handful but a country that works for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on.\u201d Warren has mocked the \u201csmile more\u201d line before \u2015 a common directive to put down serious women, infamously wielded against Hillary Clinton during her 2016 run for president \u2015 recalling how experts advised her to do so to improve her chances in the presidential race.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Center for Popular Democracy Action, an influential network of progressive community organizations, announced Tuesday that it has narrowed down the number of presidential contenders it is considering for an endorsement:\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The political arm of the Center for Popular Democracy, which is composed of 41 groups representing low-income and working-class Black and Latinx people, plans to issue its first-ever presidential endorsement in early December. It will reflect its belief on which candidate inspires low-income voters of color the most and is best equipped to deliver on progressive priorities, such as criminal justice reform, immigration reform, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a Green New Deal \u2015 key planks in the organization\u2019s\u00a0federal policy platform. The coalition\u2019s imprimatur is likely to be an asset for candidates in the early primary states of Nevada and California, which are home to several of its member organizations, as well as the general-election battleground states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. \u201cIt was Castro, Warren\u2019s and Bernie\u2019s responses that really struck home for our network and our affiliates,\u201d said Natalia Salgado, political director of CPD Action. \u201cThe core thing, the moral compass for us, throughout this whole process, is our federal platform, which is all of the issues that matter to our affiliates.\u201d CPD Action\u2019s board and staff came up with the shortlist from a wider array of candidates topping the polls at the time of its July conference: former Housing Secretary Castro; Sens. Sanders of Vermont, Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden. It graded all eight of the candidates based on their policy positions and their willingness to engage with the organization\u2019s evaluation process. Sanders, Warren and Castro all received an A. Biden and Harris, whom the group claims declined to engage at all, got an F. Booker and Buttigieg received a C, and O\u2019Rourke, who dropped out earlier this month, got a D. Each of the 41 member organizations, which include state affiliates of the immigrant rights group Make the Road, will get a single vote to decide which of the three finalists to endorse. A candidate must obtain a majority of the 41 votes to earn the endorsement, leaving open the remote possibility that the network will not endorse anyone. Even as prominent labor unions with closer ties to the Democratic establishment have been slower to back particular presidential candidates in the 2020 election cycle, newer and more independent progressive groups have been eager to weigh in. The Working Families Party, which shares some of CPD Action\u2019s member organizations, endorsed Warren in September. The blessing provided Warren with something of a shot in the arm since it represented a break with the group\u2019s support for Sanders in the 2016 presidential campaign. The backing of CPD Action could amount to a similar coup for its chosen candidate. For one thing, the network and its member groups have developed a reputation for some of the most pugnacious activism in the liberal landscape, suggesting it would bring considerable grassroots mobilization to its preferred candidate. The network\u2019s Local Progress project created a nationwide progressive caucus for like-minded municipal lawmakers; its Fed Up campaign mounted the first left-leaning movement to pressure the Federal Reserve; and its bird-dogging of senators during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh became a rallying cry for the resistance to Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation. Ady Barkan, the ALS-stricken attorney who conceived of many of the group\u2019s most innovative initiatives, has become one of the country\u2019s best-known and most compelling advocates for Medicare for All. \u201cWe are going to lend all of our political weight to that \u2015 that includes media and digital support. Once we\u2019ve endorsed, we\u2019re going to create an in-state strategy within each state where we\u2019re going to throw down, focus our fundraising on places we think are critical for the candidate to win,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use that network to bring in bodies from noncompetitive states like New York into competitive states.\u201d But more than any one issue or activism tactic, CPD Action plans to amplify the voices of low-income communities of color, which play a marginal role in the earliest stages of the presidential primary process. Iowa and New Hampshire, which host the first-in-the-nation caucus and primaries, respectively, are overwhelmingly white. Liberal activists \u2015 and at least one 2020 candidate, Castro \u2015 have lamented the outsize role the two states have on the nomination process given how unrepresentative they are of the demographics of the country, to say nothing of the diverse Democratic primary electorate. CPD Action\u2019s endorsement is also something of a counterweight to those Democratic campaigns and strategists who progressive activists fear have been insufficiently attentive to the potentially decisive role of increasing Black and Latino turnout in the key states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. They worry instead that Democratic candidates and consultants are focused on catering to the largely white swing voters who backed former President Barack Obama in 2012 and President Donald Trump in 2016 to the exclusion of infrequent voters in communities of color who are more predisposed to back Democrats. \u201cWhat makes us unique in comparison to other organizations is that you have people who are going to have a say in this who live in the most highly incarcerated ZIP code in the country in Milwaukee,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got undocumented workers in Virginia who otherwise aren\u2019t legally allowed to vote but are going to have a voice in our process. You\u2019ve got even some white folks who feel disaffected by what\u2019s going on in this country who are going to have a say in this process.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a super powerful way to go into this presidential process by having people like that that the Democratic Party has always said, \u2018Ehhh, I don\u2019t know \u2015 (A) we legally can\u2019t talk to them, or (B) I don\u2019t really want to waste our time on them,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re saying no, they\u2019re worth the time.\u201d",

      "content": " Democratic presidential front-runner Elizabeth Warren called for a ban on federal agencies and courts using industry-funded \u201cjunk science.\u201d The policy memo was part of a broad campaign proposal to limit the influence of big business on regulations, but it came as a direct rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to limit the research that regulators use to write rules. In a Medium post published Tuesday morning, the senator from Massachusetts vowed to enact rules requiring industry players who submit non-peer-reviewed research to agencies or courts to disclose who funded the studies. Any studies found to present conflicts of interest \u201cwill be excluded from the rulemaking process and will be inadmissible in any subsequent court challenges unless the research has passed rigorous, independent peer review,\u201d Warren wrote. The plan calls for establishing a White House Office of the Public Advocate to oversee the implementation of the rules. The proposal depends on the passage of the\u00a0Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, sweeping legislation that Warren introduced in August. Warren pitched the proposal as a way to prevent companies like Exxon Mobil and its network of front groups from shaping rules on climate-changing pollution by obscuring scientific consensus with contrarian research papers that serve its financial interests. The proposal comes as the oil giant is facing mounting lawsuits over its decades of seeding doubt over carbon dioxide\u2019s role in heating the planet even as its own scientists confirmed that reality in internal documents. It\u2019s not a playbook the fossil-fuel industry wrote. Tobacco companies infamously used the same tactics \u2015 and, in some cases, the same public relations firms \u2015 to delay regulations on cigarettes, not by debunking the link between smoking and diseases such as lung cancer, but by presenting a false picture of uncertainty over the science. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that the companies peddle misinformation on purpose,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cBut the consequence is even worse when it comes to new regulations.\u201d The policy, if Warren were elected, would mark a dramatic reversal from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists\u2019 calls to rapidly transition the United States off oil, appointed industry-linked climate science deniers to key advisory positions as he gutted federal rules to curb pollution. In October 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency banned scientists who received funding from the agency from serving on its advisory boards, clearing the way for industry-friendly researchers to dominate the critical oversight panels. In April 2018, the agency proposed a new rule barring its regulators from using peer-reviewed research that grants anonymity to subjects, a standard practice in public health studies. The EPA said in September it planned to advance the so-called \u201ctransparency rule\u201d in early 2020. But on Monday night, The New York Times reported that the EPA planned to widen the scope of the proposal, requiring scientists to disclose all of their raw data, including confidential medical records, before the agency can consider the academics\u2019 conclusions. \u201cOver and over again with the Trump administration, we have seen their enthusiasm for attacking the science that underlies some of our most critical environmental rules,\u201d said Kristy Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the nonpartisan Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear effort to put science on the sidelines, to ignore the latest science and to essentially deceive the public about the state of the science.\u201d A public advocate position, she said without commenting directly on the Warren proposal, could help restore public trust in the federal rulemaking process.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a new campaign ad aimed at her billionaire detractors this week, the latest effort to tout her wealth tax on America\u2019s richest citizens. The spot, which will air on CNBC on Thursday, directly targets four prominent billionaires who have been critical of the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s plan to impose an annual two-cent tax on net worth over $50 million (and a 6% tax on assets over $1 billion). Clips show a frustrated Leon Cooperman, a hedge fund manager worth an estimated $3.2 billion; Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein; and entrepreneur Peter Thiel. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal: You built a great fortune? Good for you. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. Getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us paid to build,\u201d Warren says in the minute-long ad. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is when you make it big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance.\u201d Warren has made the wealth tax a core component of her candidacy to unseat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, saying the measure would help pay for about $20.5 trillion in new federal spending to change the American health care system. The senator has also said the tax would help fund many of her ambitious plans, including universal child care and prekindergarten, as well as tackle student loan debt and bankroll universal higher education. Her campaign also released an online calculator last week to show how much billionaires would pay under the proposal (which includes a link to show how much former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire mulling his own presidential bid, would pay). The ad has not gone over well with some of those featured in the spot. Cooperman unleashed his ire in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, saying Warren represented \u201cthe worst in politicians\u201d for trying to \u201cdemonize wealthy people because there are more poor people than wealthy people.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know who the f**k she\u2019s tweeting. I gave away more in the year than she has in her whole f**king lifetime.\u201d Many billionaires have also taken to the airwaves in recent weeks to voice their displeasure with Warren\u2019s plan, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates (\u201cI\u2019m not sure how open-minded she is,\u201d he said) and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t vilify people who\u2019ve worked hard to accomplish things,\u201d he said in a recent interview). The plan would, in fact, dramatically redistribute wealth across America. Because it\u2019s an annual tax, those with the biggest coffers would see their wealth reduced over time, and newly minted billionaires would have trouble creating massive fortunes to hand down for generations, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Warren\u2019s campaign took another shot at the billionaire class later in the day, releasing a \u201cBillionaire Tears\u201d mug for a mere $25. \u201cSavor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do: universal childcare, student debt cancellation, universal free college, and more,\u201d a description of the mug says.",

      "content": " Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein fired back on Thursday after Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0released a campaign advertisement attacking him and other billionaires critical of her plan to raise taxes on the wealthy. Blankfein, who headed the Wall Street bank during the 2007 financial crisis and is now senior chairman, tweeted that he was \u201csurprised to be featured\u201d in the ad because he aligns with Warren \u201con many issues.\u201d \u201cVilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country,\u201d Blankfein wrote. Then, in an apparent dig at Warren\u2019s oft-criticized claims of Native American ancestry, he added: \u201cMaybe tribalism is just in her DNA.\u201d Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Warren\u2019s ad, titled\u00a0\u201cElizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,\u201d premiered Thursday on CNBC. It calls out Blankfein, along with hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman, former TD Ameritrade CEO Joe Ricketts and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Cooperman also took a swipe at Warren\u2019s ancestry claims during an interview with CNBC on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another fabricator in the White House,\u201d he said. Warren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Warren has struck a nerve among some of the country\u2019s most prominent billionaires with her signature plan to tax the wealthy. Her proposal calls for a 2% wealth tax on fortunes larger than $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion, to pay for things like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and universal child care. The tax, popular among voters \u2015 even millionaire voters \u2015 would apply to just 75,000 households, Warren estimates. But a chorus of billionaires have sharply criticized Warren for targeting their fortunes. \u201cShe uses some pretty harsh words, you know, some would say vilifies successful people,\u201d Jamie Dimon,\u00a0CEO and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this month on CNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t like vilifying anybody. I think we should applaud successful people.\u201d Microsoft founder Bill Gates\u00a0spoke out against Warren\u2019s tax plan at The New York Times DealBook conference earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019ve paid over $10 billion in taxes. I\u2019ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20 billion, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I\u2019m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,\u201d he continued, noting that he thought high taxes for the rich would stifle American innovation. Cooperman, in an interview with Politico last month, said: \u201cI believe in a progressive income tax and the rich paying more. But this is the fucking American dream she is shitting on.\u201d He later\u00a0complained to Warren in a letter\u00a0that she has \u201cproceeded to admonish me (as if a parent chiding an ungrateful child) to \u2018pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a new plan on Friday to pass major legislation expanding health care within 100 days as president and to get a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d government-run health care system enacted by her third year in office. The proposal lays out a vision towards universal health care coverage, but one that also acknowledges the difficult political constraints standing in the way to getting it through Congress under a new Democratic administration.\u00a0It would quickly put in place the building blocks of Medicare for All, which could also serve as a backup plan in case her efforts to establish a universal, government-run health care program fail. Under the plan, Warren would use her executive authority both to drive down the price of prescription drugs (in some cases, by threatening the patents of drugmakers charging high prices) and to reverse changes implemented by President Donald Trump that have undermined the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions. But the plan also has a major legislative component, including the creation of a new, government-run insurance plan. It would be free to all children and all people with incomes less than twice the poverty line, and open to everybody else, who would pay varying, income-based premiums. By design, it would be more generous and generally cheaper than private insurance for many, and probably most, people. The same legislation would also open up the existing Medicare program to people 50 and older, while improving the financial assistance available to people buying insurance through HealthCare.gov and the state exchanges. Such legislation would encounter stiff opposition from the same groups that would fight Medicare for All. But Warren\u2019s campaign says she plans to use a legislative process called budget reconciliation that requires only a simple majority in the Senate to make it law. Republicans recently used budget reconciliation to push through their tax cuts and attempted to used it to pass repeal of the Affordable Care Act. By shifting millions of people to a public health care system gradually, Warren hopes her proposal will help build support for a full-fledged Medicare for All program down the line while offering people immediate health care relief in the short term. However, it\u2019s hard not to view Warren\u2019s new plan through a political lens given the tightening Democratic primary, one in which her impressive rise to the front of the pack in public opinion polls appears to have leveled off\u00a0less than three months from the Iowa caucuses. By delaying the elimination of private health insurance under Medicare for All until later in her presidency, Warren is attempting to blunt attacks from moderate rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, as well as inoculate herself against a Republican onslaught during a general election campaign against Trump. The delayed timeline, meanwhile, would also give Democrats who are uncomfortable with Medicare for All and its elimination of private insurance an opportunity to get on board with her candidacy. The new plan may open her to criticism from Medicare for All supporters, as well. Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for example, has not said he will wait as long as three years to pass his Medicare for All proposal, creating some daylight between the two progressive senators ahead of next week\u2019s presidential debate in Georgia. The three-year timeline, meanwhile, could be fraught with political risk. There are many political variables to consider alongside Warren\u2019s plan to wait until after the 2022 midterm elections to pass Medicare for All, but the Senate map in 2022 looks better for Democrats than the one next year, which could boost Warren\u2019s prospects of getting the program passed. But if the party fails to capture the upper chamber in 2020, a difficult task, it would make much of these calculations moot altogether. Finally, Warren\u2019s reliance on budget reconciliation to pass a public health insurance option acknowledges the difficulties in eliminating the filibuster, which she has called for if Democrats win the Senate next year. If it were easy to convince her Democratic colleagues to get rid of the long-standing 60-vote supermajority requirement, her plan wouldn\u2019t require budget reconciliation at all. But red-state Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, for example, recently ruled out ever supporting eliminating the filibuster. And they\u2019re not alone. Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report.",

      "subtitle": "But the Vermont senator declined to criticize his progressive Democratic rival.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " In an effort to distinguish himself from rival presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders\u00a0emphasized on Friday that if elected president, he would immediately pursue the complete enactment of a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health care system, including the elimination of the vast majority of private health insurance coverage. Sen. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who two weeks ago introduced her own plan to finance Medicare for All without raising middle-class taxes, announced earlier on Friday that she would also pursue implementation of her plan in stages. She said she would move immediately to introduce a public option and lower the Medicare eligibility age to 50 and then, in the third year of her presidency, she would begin phasing out duplicative private health insurance. Speaking at a campaign rally-cum-press conference in Oakland, California, where he was formally accepting the endorsement of the National Nurses United labor union, Sen. Sanders staked out a contrasting approach. \u201cWith National Nurses United at my side, during the first week of our presidency, we are going to introduce the legislation that will bring Medicare for All to everyone in this country,\u201d the Vermont independent said to a cheering crowd of nurses clad in the union\u2019s signature red T-shirts. The 150,000-member union, which is especially strong in California, is perhaps the country\u2019s leading institutional proponent of Medicare for All. While it had been considering throwing its weight behind Warren, the union cited Sanders\u2019 decades of consistent support for a single-payer health care system in explaining its endorsement. Asked at the press conference whether Warren\u2019s plan is a departure from his plan, Sanders answered diplomatically. \u201cI will let Senator Warren speak for herself, but this is what I believe,\u201d he said before being cut off by the knowing laughs of the nurses assembled before him. Addressing the laughter, he joked, \u201cSee, that\u2019s being very tactical.\u201d He explained that he does not see any value in deferring a confrontation with the private insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies that will stand in the way of a single-payer system. \u201cThat\u2019s a fight that\u2019s going to have to happen,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI will engage that struggle on day one of my administration, not put it off for several years.\u201d Of course, Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All legislation features a four-year phase-in period\u00a0during which he would gradually lower the Medicare eligibility age before making the program completely universal. But unlike Warren, he has decided not to decouple the plan\u2019s most controversial feature \u2015 the abolition of private insurance for practices covered by the new, expanded Medicare program \u2015 from the expansion of coverage. And by refusing to postpone implementation of the full Medicare for All legislation to the third year of his presidency, he does not risk \u2015 as Warren\u2019s left-wing critics fear of her plan \u2015 facing a more hostile Congress and being forced to defer the policy\u2019s enactment indefinitely. The gentle tone of Sanders\u2019 remarks about Warren reflect a non-aggression pact that the two candidates struck prior to announcing their plans to run for the White House. Sanders\u2019 campaign aides have shown signs of straying from the terms of that accord, but Sanders himself has rarely, if ever, offered anything more than veiled criticism of Warren. But Medicare for All is still something of a political obstacle course for Warren, who has scrambled to respond to a monthslong drumbeat of pressure springing from her initial embrace of Sanders\u2019 legislation. She released her plan to finance the single-payer legislation after weeks of questions from journalists and attacks from more moderate rivals demanding to know whether her plan to finance the plan would lead to middle-class tax increases. Before relenting and producing a plan to pay for Medicare for All that limited the tax increases to the wealthy and corporations, Warren had been reiterating that the vast majority of Americans\u2019 underlying costs would go down under her plan without specifying whether that meant that the elimination of out-of-pocket costs would offset a tax increase. (Sanders has openly stated that his health care plan will raise taxes on middle-income earners, but justified it on the grounds that the tax increases would be lower than overall savings.) The presidential campaign of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a moderate contender who perhaps exerted the most effective pressure on Warren, continued to blast her in a Friday statement. Campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith argued that Warren\u2019s decision to embrace the public option, which Buttigieg has labeled \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d was an effort to \u201cpaper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance- whether they like it or not.\u201d \u201cDespite adopting Pete\u2019s language of \u2018choice,\u2019 her plan is still a \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach that would eradicate choice for millions of Americans,\u201d Smith continued. This story has been updated with additional information about Warren and Sanders\u2019 plans.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on Friday warned the Democratic field of White House hopefuls not to veer too far to the left, a move he said would alienate many who would otherwise be open to voting for the party\u2019s nominee next year. Though Obama did not mention anyone by name, the message delivered before a room of Democratic donors in Washington was a clear word of caution about the candidacies of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The two have called for massive structural changes \u2014 and in Sanders\u2019 case \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 that would dramatically alter the role of government in people\u2019s lives. The centrist wing of the party has warned for months that a far-left nominee could alienate moderate Republicans and independent voters needed to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it\u2019s important for us not to lose sight of that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff. They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.\u201d Obama has largely refrained from publicly opining on the Democratic primary, which has exposed a growing rift between an ascendant progressive wing of the party and old-guard centrists like his former vice president, Joe Biden. But on Friday he said he felt compelled to weigh in because some of the loudest and most strident voices, particularly on social media, aren\u2019t representative of where most in the party are at. Immigration and health care are two issues he cited as cases where Democratic candidates are out of sync with public sentiment. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d Obama said. Obama delivered his remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democrats who raise large sums for the party. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the party who narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race last year. He also sought also to ease jittery Democrats who have been wringing their hands over the size of the sprawling field, which some worry will lead to a prolonged contest that will leave the eventual nominee with limited time to prepare for the general election. \u201cI just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNot only did I win ultimately a remarkably tough and lengthy primary process with Hillary Clinton, but people forget that even before that we had a big field of really serious, accomplished people.\u201d",

But instead of taking the fight directly to the company, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are planning to send a letter Tuesday to Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, pressing their case, HuffPost has learned. In the letter, which was coordinated by the women\u2019s advocacy group UltraViolet, the senators say they\u2019re concerned about the message it sends to sexual assault survivors if the Democratic debate happens without the network\u2019s parent at least agreeing to conduct an investigation into allegations of harassment, assault and a cover-up at NBC News. Sen. Kamala Harris signed on to the letter on Tuesday morning. Calling the allegations \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d the senators write: \u201cWe, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors.\u201d On the issue of sexual harassment, it\u2019s crucial for Democrats to distinguish themselves from Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, they write. \u201cDonald Trump has been credibly accused of sexual harassment and sexual abuse by dozens of women. We, as a party, have to offer voters a clear and unquestionable difference come November when it comes to these important issues,\u201d they write. \u201cWe can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.\u201d The candidates join a rising chorus of voices calling for NBC to truly get to the bottom of a swirl of allegations, including claims of harassment and assault that led to the firing of \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer and questions over the way Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct was handled. Current and former NBC employees, media critics and women\u2019s rights advocates, including UltraViolet, have demanded a thorough transparent accounting of what happened. UltraViolet is also demanding the firing of NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC executive Phil Griffin and anyone in leadership that enabled abusers. \u201cAll news organizations, their management and their journalists make mistakes, sometimes very damaging ones,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post. \u201cThe ones who are committed to the truth \u2014 and to their own all-important credibility \u2014 swallow hard and do the right thing: They dig out the facts, relentlessly publish them and, when appropriate, punish the miscreants.\u201d In his book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Farrow offers a detailed account of how top executives at the network actively kept him from reporting rape allegations against Weinstein. He also writes that Lauer\u2019s problems were an open secret at NBC for years before he was fired. After CBS News and Fox News faced similar allegations, both networks brought in outside law firms to investigate company culture. In contrast, NBC went with company lawyers, releasing a report last year that largely cleared the network of any wrongdoing. The network said last month that it won\u2019t do any additional investigation. \u201cWe are very confident in the report that was conducted,\u201d NBCUniversal spokesperson Hilary Smith told The Hollywood Reporter.\u00a0\u201cWe fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation. Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture.\u201d Smith also noted that a team of women conducted the internal investigation and none worked in the NBC News division. The network declined to comment further to HuffPost for this story. \u201cNBC\u2019s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault,\u201d the senators write in their letter. \u201cYet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable.\u201d The letter stops short of threatening to pull out of the Democratic debate if Comcast declines to investigate. Through a spokesperson, Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder of UltraViolet said that the DNC shouldn\u2019t partner with the network again on debates if there\u2019s no investigation. Warren and Booker did not respond immediately to HuffPost\u2019s request for further comment. Here\u2019s the full text of the letter: Dear Chairman Perez: The latest allegations of sexual assault and harassment by former NBC employees perpetrated by NBC executives and on-air talent as well as a cover-up by NBC\u2019s management are deeply troubling. We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors. NBC\u2019s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable. That\u2019s what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management\u2019s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk. Donald Trump has been credibly accused of sexual harassment and sexual abuse by dozens of women. We, as a party, have to offer voters a clear and unquestionable difference come November when it comes to these important issues. We can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership. It is critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks. Signed, Senator Cory Booker Senator Kamala Harris Senator Bernie Sanders Senator Elizabeth Warren This has been updated to reflect that Sen. Harris also signed on to the letter as of Tuesday morning.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Democrats are skeptical that their leading 2020 presidential candidates will be able to accomplish much of their stated agendas, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night. Just 41% of Democrats think former Vice President Joe Biden will be able to accomplish all or most of his policy goals, and the numbers are lower for other candidates: Only 33% say the same of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s agenda, while 30% of Democrats are confident in Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 ability to enact his political revolution and just 28% believe South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg can enact most of his plans. The lack of confidence comes as each of the three leading candidates doubles down on their own personal theories of how to enact the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda \u2015 and as each of those theories runs into stark challenges. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who wants to change Washington\u2019s internal rules to make progressive change easier, might not have support among Democrats to get rid of the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster threshold. Biden is continuing to tout his ability to work with Republicans amid widespread skepticism. And Sanders, a Vermont independent who is counting on popular support to pressure a Congress reluctant to embrace his ambitious policies, has seen support for his signature policy fall as the campaign advances. Meanwhile, Buttigieg \u2015 who trails the other three in national polling but is running strong in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 is still articulating how his plans to pass legislation would differ from unsuccessful tactics used by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found a plurality of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (43%) thought a reform approach, including weakening the power of lobbyists and corporations to influence policy, was the most effective way for Democrats to pass laws if they win the presidency in 2020. That approach, typically associated with Warren, was more popular than Biden\u2019s preferred method of finding common ground with Republicans. Thirty percent of Democrats supported a compromise approach. The least popular was Sanders\u2019 preferred method of enlisting ordinary people to pressure elected officials to support progressive goals. Only 12% supported this method. There are ideological differences: 51% of liberals preferred a reform approach, and just 25% want to find common ground with Republicans. Among moderates and conservatives, 44% prefer looking for common ground with Republicans, while 28% want to weaken lobbyists and corporations. There\u2019s also a significant age gap: Democrats older than 65 have a strong preference for working with Republicans. These divides were clear at a Warren rally Sunday in Las Vegas. The candidate ran through her ambitious agenda: a wealth tax on fortunes of more than $50 million, substantial investments in early childhood education, an elimination of student debt, a sweeping anti-corruption law. But audience members varied wildly in how much of her agenda they expected her to accomplish and whether her plan to win political victories was the best. Dylan Jaramillo, an electrical engineer who said he\u2019s likely to support businessman Andrew Yang in the primary, said he liked Yang\u2019s (and Biden\u2019s) emphasis on working with Republicans to get things done. \u201cJoe Biden is probably the most realistic one,\u201d he said, predicting Warren would achieve \u201cmaybe 30%\u201d of her goals. Jenna Wurtzberger, an adjunct professor, attended the rally with Byron McDonald, a delivery driver. Both supported Warren\u2019s push to get rid of the filibuster and thought Biden\u2019s hopes to work with Republicans were far-fetched. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk sense with Republicans at this point,\u201d Wurtzberger said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched enough of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d McDonald said in agreement. \u201cFor Biden, that seems a little pie in the sky.\u201d But McDonald still wasn\u2019t totally sold on voting for Warren. \u201cI support big ideas. But I worry not everyone likes big ideas as much as I do.\u201d Warren\u2019s pitch on how she would transform her famous plans into reality has shifted slightly. In her stump speech, she no longer mentions her work with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids. She also now spends more time invoking famous social movements of the past, suggesting a similar movement can push Congress to adopt her ambitious liberal agenda. And some of the roadblocks for Warren\u2019s theory have reappeared. Three Democratic senators \u2015 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2015 recently reiterated their opposition to ending the filibuster, which would force Warren to somehow court GOP support for her plans. (In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters were ambivalent about the filibuster: 29% said it was a good rule, 25% said it was a bad rule and 46% were unsure. Among Democrats, however, 27% said it was a good rule and 33% said it was bad.) Sanders and Biden, meanwhile, have stuck to their guns. Biden, who was widely mocked for predicting Republicans would have an \u201cepiphany\u201d after Trump\u2019s presidency, repeated the line at a fundraiser at K Street law firm in Washington, D.C. Sanders remains committed to a broad political revolution. The new entrant into the top-tier of the race, Buttigieg, has expressed elements of each theory of change put forward by the other leading candidates. Like Warren, he supports eliminating the filibuster. Like Biden, he emphasizes reuniting the country and working with Republicans. And like Sanders, he talks about applying public pressure on reluctant politicians. \u201cThere\u2019s a big airplane that comes with the Oval Office, right?,\u201d Buttigieg said at a town hall in Iowa earlier this month. \u201cI believe the best use of that airplane\u2019s to fire it up, fly it into the district or the state of a senator or a member of Congress getting in the way of one of these measures.\u201d But when asked how his approach would differ from that of Obama, who saw his agenda curtailed significantly by both Republicans and intra-party opposition, Buttigieg struggled to answer. \u201cHe operated under the constraints of being the last Democrat of the Reagan era. And he also faced constraints of a Congress that was not acting in good faith,\u201d Buttigieg said during his bus tour in Iowa. \u201cAnd the part about Congress acting in bad faith has only gotten worse among Republicans.\u201d \u201cI think the dynamics of the country have become more favorable,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, just 12 years \u2015 I don\u2019t know what percent of the country is different over a 12-year period. But just 12 years\u2019 worth of people who have arrived and left. That means that this country has shifted \u2015 plus 12 years of experience as a country on what works and what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Ultimately, Buttigieg concluded, he would have a mandate if he won the election. \u201cYou look at how the New Deal came about, it\u2019s not that FDR promised something even bigger than the New Deal and then he got there and that was the compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a much more kind of dynamic set of things that happened. On health care, in modern times, you could look at the example of the [Affordable Care Act]. You could also look at the example of the Clinton health care reform agenda in the \u201990s. And the biggest lesson I draw is that if we\u2019re really explicit about what we want to do now, then you arrive in office with a mandate to do it.\u201d Daniel Marans and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 15-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

      "author": "",
      "content": "When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential primary front-runner, revealed Friday that she was willing to defer the most controversial element of her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan \u2015 the replacement of nearly all private insurance with a single government program \u2015 until the third year of her presidency, she found herself in the unenviable position of taking fire from both her left and her right. The democratic socialists who make up the policy\u2019s most ardent champions saw confirmation that her commitment to achieving single-payer health care is weak at best, while her centrist critics saw a political concession that did nothing to diminish their central problem with her plan. It was a beleaguered position that essentially matched where Warren was some six weeks ago, when pressure was mounting for her to release a more detailed Medicare for All plan. Her campaign had hoped that by first releasing a plan on how to finance the ambitious program without raising middle-class taxes and then two weeks later promising to enact it gradually, that it would quiet some of the critics and allow her to move forward with her campaign. But as even some sympathetic analysts admit, in the short term, Warren has done neither of those things. Wednesday\u2019s debate is an opportunity for her to finally reverse that dynamic and put her moderate rivals on the defensive for the first time in roughly two months. But doing so might require Warren to be more aggressive than she was at earlier debates, according to interviews with some of her allies. Joe Dinkin, national campaigns director for the Working Families Party, a major progressive group that endorsed Warren in September, called for her to use the debate to return to her campaign\u2019s core themes of fixing a political system riven with greed and corruption. \u201cShe needs to be herself,\u201d Dinkin said. \u201cThat means she needs to explain to people in the way that only she can how our economy and our democracy have been twisted and distorted, who is responsible and how we\u2019re going to come together to fix it. That\u2019s the campaign that is inspiring people and expanding the progressive movement.\u201d Warren is indeed at her most comfortable discussing the broad theme of a \u201cgovernment that works great for those with money and connections and doesn\u2019t work much for anyone else.\u201d If there\u2019s a single policy she ties most closely to that theme, it\u2019s the wealth tax she hopes to levy on multimillion-dollar estates to fund priorities like free public college, student debt cancellation, paid family leave and public child care. The fee itself \u2015 originally \u201ctwo cents\u201d on every dollar of assets above $50 million \u2015 is so popular with her base it has become a call-and-response line at her rallies. Unlike abolishing private health insurance, it polls high in the broader population as well. And it has baited billionaire financiers and technology executives into lashing out against her \u2015 and in some cases even embarking on quixotic candidacies seemingly designed to blunt her momentum. The increasingly melodramatic hand-wringing of some of these superrich Americans has been the silver lining in a cloudy month for the Warren campaign. Warren\u2019s plan to boost Social Security benefits is also fertile terrain for populist campaigning without entering the notoriously perilous thicket of health care policy. To that end, her campaign released a new television advertisement in Iowa on Tuesday touting the proposal, which would immediately increase the program\u2019s monthly payments by $200. But the moderators of the previous four Democratic debates allotted significant time to the narrow question of Medicare financing, and given the ongoing skirmishes over Warren\u2019s plan, they are unlikely to let up on Wednesday night. (After a town hall in Las Vegas on Sunday, the media continued to pepper Warren with questions about the policy, including questioning how it played with African American voters.) Ruy Teixeira, a demographer and public opinion expert at the Democratic Party-aligned Center for American Progress who doubts the political wisdom of Warren\u2019s decision to embrace the elimination of most private health insurance, recommended that she bring it back to the big picture. \u201cShe probably has to keep coming back to, \u2018You say blah blah blah about my overall Medicare for All plan and how I would pay for it \u2015 what I really want to talk about is what I am going to do when I am elected to help the American people get better health care.\u2026 My plan for doing that is better than anyone else\u2019s,\u2019\u201d said Teixeira, author of \u201cThe Optimistic Leftist: Why the 21st Century Will Be Better Than You Think.\u201d A majority of Americans tell pollsters that they support Medicare for All as a vague concept. But when they are informed that such a plan would mean eliminating private health insurance, support typically drops below 50%. Nearly two-thirds of swing voters in the battleground state of Michigan called a Medicare for All plan that eliminates private health insurance a \u201cbad idea,\u201d according to an October poll conducted by the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s really not debatable at this point how it plays politically,\u201d said Teixeira, who has not endorsed anyone in the primary. \u201cPeople are very risk averse.\u201d Warren\u2019s problem is clearly as much about electability as it is about policy. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, wrote last week that House candidates who backed Medicare for All in the 2018 midterm elections performed about 5 percentage points worse than candidates who did not, adding ammunition to the centrist argument. But Warren (and Sanders) got some backup from a somewhat unlikely source: Guy Cecil, the head of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, which is neutral in the primary, said it had tested attacks on Medicare for All and other Democratic health care plans. In all scenarios, the Democrats\u2019 approach to health care remains more popular than the GOP\u2019s support of a total repeal of Obamacare, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cThe reality is we maintain an advantage even after the attacks on Medicare for All,\u201d Cecil said. And Medicare for All defenders are fighting back, arguing the polling numbers just show the need to push a counter-narrative about the program\u2019s benefits. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is backing Warren, co-hosted a press call on Tuesday showcasing original polling data on Medicare for All. The polling, which the Democratic firm GBAO conducted on behalf of the PCCC\u2019s think tank arm, the Progressive Change Institute, as well as Business for Medicare for All and Public Citizen, examined rebuttals to critiques of Medicare for All that emphasized it would abolish private insurance. In the survey, two-thirds of voters continued to favor Medicare for All when an attack noting that it would eliminate private health insurance was rebutted either by reminding voters that the change would be gradual or that it would give Americans a lifetime of portable insurance regardless of their employment status. Green believes that Warren \u201claid a trap\u201d for other candidates by laying out her fully baked Medicare for All plans right before the debate. \u201cIf [her rivals] take the bait and get immersed in petty attacks on the details while she stays focused on the big-picture ways her plan avoids medical bankruptcy for families, voters will say she won this debate \u2015 just like they did in prior debates where other candidates obsessed over less relevant details,\u201d he said. Getting into the details might be hard to avoid for Warren, though, given the comparisons that the first stage of her plan has drawn to the \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal introduced by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Warren has promised to use budget reconciliation to pass a new, public health insurance option in her first two years in office and lower the eligibility age of traditional Medicare to 50. The heart of Buttigieg\u2019s plan includes the former feature, though not the latter. The parallel has become especially popular among Warren\u2019s critics on the socialist left. Simon Narode, a college student in Eugene, Oregon, who supports Sanders, compiled a viral video highlighting similarities in the two candidates\u2019 public statements about Medicare for All over time. And Warren has struggled to turn the tables on her centrist rivals. During the last debate, she attacked Buttigieg\u2019s plan \u2015 which would not provide health insurance for every American \u2015 as \u201cMedicare for All who can afford it.\u201d The line has not caught on. And Warren has generally bypassed chances to bash her primary rivals. Mike Lux, a progressive consultant who has endorsed Warren, suggested that she should welcome a competition with Buttigieg. \u201cEven Warren\u2019s interim proposal is substantively better than Pete\u2019s,\u201d he said, noting that, unlike Buttigieg, Warren also plans to use executive action to immediately lower prescription drug prices, including by threatening pharmaceutical patents. \u201cPete and the other folks attacking her on health care have taken a lot of money from the health care industry,\u201d Lux added. Teixeira also suggested that she cast doubt on Buttigieg\u2019s experience implementing complex policies and his credibility as a fighter for ordinary people. \u201cThat could play into pushing her new transition plan \u2015 \u2018I know how to get this done and I\u2019m totally committed to it,\u2019\u201d he imagined her saying. \u201c\u2018And what do you know how to do, Mayor Pete?\u2019\u201d That might be an easier task after video resurfaced on Tuesday of Buttigieg addressing a tea party group in 2010, when the conservative activist movement was seeking to torpedo the Affordable Care Act. Dinkin, of the Working Families Party, would not say that Warren should herself go on the attack against Buttigieg. But he predicted that Buttigieg will \u201chave to answer\u201d for his presence at the tea party event.",

      "author": "Jonathan Cohn",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rhetorical journey on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d has been circuitous and, at times, painful for even some of her supporters to watch. Early on, the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential hopeful suggested she thought of Medicare for All in more aspirational terms. During a March\u00a0interview on Bloomberg television, she said her goal was \u201caffordable coverage for every American\u201d but that there are \u201cdifferent ways we can get there.\u201d It was a variation on a line she used two months earlier, during a CNN event: \u201cWhen we talk about Medicare for All, there are a lot of different pathways.\u201d Warren also declined for months to issue her own detailed proposal, telling questioners simply that \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d even though she was rolling out plans for just about every other issue. In just the last three weeks, that has changed, first when she unveiled a detailed plan to\u00a0finance\u00a0Medicare for All and then, late last week, when she proposed a two-step process for putting such a system in place. Step one would be a set of executive orders, along with new legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and create a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d open to anybody. The goal would be to make that happen within the first hundred days. Step two would be pursuit of comprehensive Medicare for All legislation that would make enrollment in the new government plan mandatory. Warren says that second step, the full vote, would not come until 2023. Many progressives have interpreted that as a retreat \u2015 and confirmation\u00a0Warren that lacks the conviction of Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who is also running for president and has been Medicare for All\u2019s loudest, most consistent advocate. Sanders responded to Warren\u2019s announcement by reiterating his commitment to introducing Medicare for All legislation in the first week of his presidency, suggesting those progressives may be right about which candidate is more committed to the concept. But does that mean Warren\u2019s approach is a less reliable way to help people pay for medical bills and, ultimately, to make health care a universal right? That is a lot less clear. The differences between Warren and Sanders are obvious to anybody who has watched them campaign. Medicare for All is dear to Sanders and a core part of his identity in a way that it simply hasn\u2019t been for Warren, whose passion has always been more with fighting corruption and regulating Wall Street. It is no coincidence that the first program she proposed in her presidential campaign was for a different kind of welfare state expansion, a universal child care\u00a0initiative, or that health care has generally gotten less attention in her stump speeches than countless other issues. Still, it is not as if Warren doesn\u2019t care about health care. The academic work that first brought her national attention and got her interested in politics focused on bankruptcy, a subject in which medical bills came up frequently. And her progressive bona fides are beyond reproach, or at least they should be. Since coming to the Senate, her voting record has consistently been on the very progressive edge, surpassing even Sanders, according to the site VoteView. When Warren finally decided to develop her own health care plan, according to recent reporting\u00a0in The New York Times, she turned to two of the country\u2019s best known Medicare for All advocates: Donald Berwick, who was chief administrator of Medicare and Medicaid during the Obama administration, and Steffie Woolhandler, who was co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. Those contacts say a lot about Warren\u2019s instincts on policy.\u00a0And the first step of her two-step proposal is designed to be a lot more ambitious than it might sound at first blush. Her proposed executive actions include threatening the patent rights of drug companies that won\u2019t lower the prices of expensive and essential drugs. Her proposed legislation would create a public option, open to anybody, that for a large swath of the population would cover medical care with zero out-of-pocket costs. The actual details of Warren\u2019s proposed legislation are something of a mishmash that would likely require substantial modification before Congress could take it up. As Jon Walker\u00a0put it\u00a0in The American Prospect, the proper way to think about her proposal is probably as a \u201cstatement ... on her legislative strategy, her priorities, and her view of what is possible.\u201d But that statement is precisely what many progressives are questioning. Enacting\u00a0any major health care bill would be difficult for a new Democratic president after the next election, given the inevitable opposition of industry groups and slim Senate majority Democrats would have even under the best circumstances. Warren\u2019s smartest progressive critics recognize this. Warren\u2019s error, according to the progressive critique, is in conceding policy ground upfront rather than laying out an ideal vision and bargaining back from there. \u201cIt may be necessary to accept half a loaf in the negotiation stage,\u201d The Week\u2019s Ryan Cooper wrote on Monday, \u201cbut\u00a0only\u00a0then, and only because moderates wouldn\u2019t accept anything better.\u201d It\u2019s a reasonable argument. As the saying goes, there\u2019s no point in compromising with yourself. But you can\u2019t compromise with anybody if you never get to the negotiating table in the first place.\u00a0And that is a real danger of promoting Medicare for All right away: that it will alienate voters Democratic candidates need in order to win in 2020. The prospect of eliminating private insurance spooks a lot of Americans, as polls have shown pretty consistently. The issue isn\u2019t so much that people love their existing coverage. It\u2019s that they\u2019re wary of an untested, hypothetical public insurance alternative, especially at a time when trust in the federal government is at historic lows. In October 1964, when Lyndon Johnson was running for president on a promise to enact the original Medicare program, 77% of Americans believed the government did the right thing all or most of the time, according to the National Election Survey. Since then, NES, Gallup and Pew Research have asked versions of that question repeatedly and the number has fallen dramatically. As of this March, it was down to 17%. Executive actions to lower drug prices and the creation of a successful, but voluntary public insurance program could help restore some of that lost faith in the federal government \u2015 or, at the very least, it could persuade people that giving up private coverage isn\u2019t so risky. That would likely make Medicare for All an easier political sell. Whether Sanders or Warren has the better of this argument about health care strategy is impossible to say. No Democratic candidate in recent memory has built a grassroots movement for specific legislation in the way Sanders has. It may be that such a focused, impassioned campaign on behalf of Medicare for All would persuade skeptical voters and overwhelm industry critics in a way that past reform efforts have not. It\u2019s also impossible to say whether Warren\u2019s position will protect her from charges that she would take away private insurance, given her past statements and promise to pursue full Medicare for All legislation in three years. It may be that the only way to avoid that political vulnerability is to steer clear\u00a0of any commitment to Medicare for All in the near future, as former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, have. And finally it is impossible to say how consequential a candidate\u2019s position on Medicare for All will ultimately prove in the general election. Other issues will be vying for attention and public perceptions about Medicare for All vary quite a lot depending on which arguments break though in the media. But while primary voters ponder these unknowables, and watch Wednesday night\u2019s debate, they might want to step back and consider how much the top 2020 Democratic contenders actually agree about health care. Each one has promised reforms that would offer more financial protection against medical bills, introduce some kind of new public insurance plan, and give the federal government more power to reduce the price of medical care. That\u2019s a pretty strong consensus for some pretty ambitious initiatives that could help a whole lot of people. The differences among the candidates are important, and a presidential nominating race is precisely the forum in which to argue about them. But eventually the primaries will end. At that point, the debate will be between a president trying to take health insurance away from tens of millions, through repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and one trying to carry on the Democratic Party\u2019s historic quest for universal coverage.\u00a0That surely is the choice that matters most.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Ady Barkan, a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d advocate dying of ALS, endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president on Wednesday, boosting the 2020 hopeful\u2019s progressive credibility as she seeks to quiet doubts about her health care plan. \u201cI believe that she, more than any other person in America, has the skills, the temperament, and the knowledge to lead us toward a more just and equitable future,\u201d Barkan\u00a0wrote in The Nation. In the opinion piece, Barkan was keen to express his admiration for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), calling the chance to pick between the two candidates a \u201cdifficult and wonderful choice to have.\u201d But he cited Warren\u2019s attentive and methodical style of policymaking as a driving factor behind his decision. \u201cI believe in Warren because during her whole career, she has fought to put economic and political power in the hands of working families,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen up close how she confronts a problem: She listens to the people most affected, does her homework, and then comes up with a plan. A brilliant, workable plan.\u201d Crucially for Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Barkan also hailed her Medicare for All plan, which has drawn fire from critics on her right and her left. \u201cWhat matters most to me is that Warren is all in for Medicare for All,\u201d he wrote. Barkan, a 35-year-old attorney who pioneered the left\u2019s first contemporary campaign to pressure the Federal Reserve, has become something of a folk hero in progressive circles. Since being diagnosed with ALS, which is slowly paralyzing him to death, in October 2016, he has devoted every remaining moment he has to defeating President Donald Trump, winning the \u201cbattle with fascism,\u201d and furthering his vision for a more economically, socially and racially equitable country. Barkan has focused his efforts in the 2020 election cycle on trying to get as many candidates as possible to embrace a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system. Barkan sought in-person interviews solely devoted to health care policy with the Democratic candidates at his home in Santa Barbara, California.\u00a0 And with the help of a computer that translates his eye movements into words, Barkan grilled Sanders, Warren, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. (Barkan publicly lamented that the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden would not make Biden available.) Through his Be A Hero Fund, Barkan posted the videos of each of the interviews online. In his discussion with Warren in September, it was clear that they had an existing relationship dating to Barkan\u2019s days as a Federal Reserve activist. He nonetheless pressed her to explain her late conversion to the Medicare for All cause and reluctance to emphasize it during the early part of her presidential bid. \u201cI think it was more ... focused on transition than on endpoint,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cBut there are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those. So the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d Barkan\u2019s endorsement is particularly welcome for Warren on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta. Warren will join nine of her rivals onstage at 9 p.m. Eastern time at the close of one of the roughest periods for her campaign since she took the first steps toward launching it in late December 2018. Facing a drumbeat of pressure to clarify whether she, like Sanders, would get behind middle-class tax hikes to fund Medicare for All, Warren released a detailed financing plan\u00a0at the start of November that appeared to spare those in the middle class. Barkan rushed to her defense when some left-leaning experts and activists argued that its structure was actually more regressive than some explicit middle-class taxes would be. Then, on Friday, two weeks after the release of her financing plan, Warren revealed that she planned to pursue the proposal in stages. She would begin her presidency by using budget reconciliation to enact a public option and lower the Medicare eligibility age to 50. In a second stage, she would fold everyone into one expanded and improved Medicare program, ending private health insurance for things already covered by the new Medicare. The possibility of a timeline in which Warren would defer the most controversial element of her plan until after the first midterm elections of her would-be administration confirmed in the minds of many on the left that she was insufficiently committed to the end goal of single-payer health care. Not so for Barkan, who noted that her lowering of the Medicare eligibility age would move faster than Sanders\u2019 four-year transition, which lowers the age to 55 in its first year. \u201cHer plan says clearly that by the end of her first term, everyone will have comprehensive guaranteed Medicare \u2015 whether you are rich or poor, young or old; that there will be no co-pays, premiums, or deductibles; and that we will bring down the costs of health care because private insurance companies will no longer be able to put profit over patients,\u201d Barkan wrote in The Nation.",

      "content": " A slew of Democratic candidates for president drew attention on Twitter to Latina Equal Pay Day on Wednesday \u2015 a day that marks how far into the year Latina women on average have to work in order to earn what their white, male counterparts earned the previous year. Women who work full time, year-round in the United States were paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts in 2018, according the National Women\u2019s Law Center. For women of color, the wage gap is even wider, with Black women making 62 cents, Native women 57 cents and Latina women 54 cents for every dollar paid to white men. These wage gap figures are not broken down by job or industry, as it is meant to reflect the multiple barriers women face to equal pay, not only including lower pay for performing the same job as men, but also the underrepresentation of women in higher-paying jobs, bias against women who have to care for children or family and a lack of workplace policies to support them. While Equal Pay Day for women broadly is commemorated on April 10, Latina Equal Pay Day is Nov. 20. Many Democratic hopefuls took to Twitter Wednesday to call out the \u201cshameful,\u201d per Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and \u201coutrageous,\u201d per Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), status quo of Latina women getting paid almost half as much as white men on average. Former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro nodded to his hard-working mother, adding: \u201cMillions of Latinas are doing the same, working hard, and still only making 54 cents for every dollar made by a white man.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called out her \u201cequal pay plan,\u201d which would ensure \u201ccorporations will pay women fairly \u2014 or pay the price.\u201d Harris\u2019 sweeping proposal, released in May, would require companies to prove that their pay practices are fair or face fines. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released her message in English and Spanish, saying in the latter (translated by HuffPost): \u201cFrom raising the federal minimum wage to combating systemic discrimination and protecting the right of Latina women to unionize, I\u2019m ready to fight from day one to close the wage gap.\u201d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Presidential candidates opened the fifth Democratic debate on Wednesday by addressing the public impeachment hearings that have gripped Washington this week with new revelations about President Donald Trump\u2019s attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. But even as they cheered the House impeachment inquiry and argued that Trump needed to be removed from office, most Democrats on the debate stage in Atlanta, Georgia, used the question about impeachment to pivot to their core campaign message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, deftly tied the hearings to her recently released plan to tackle corruption. \u201cHe wrote a check for a million dollars and that tells us what is happening in Washington... We are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder,\u201d Warren said, referring to bombshell testimony from Trump donor turned European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00a0earlier in the day. Sondland, who was appointed in 2017 after donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u00a0delivered devastating testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday morning that implicated Trump and a number of top administration officials in what he acknowledged was a \u201cclear quid pro quo\u201d scheme to exchange official acts for millions of dollars in U.S. government funds. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Democrats need to move forward with the impeachment inquiry, but he also said they must be ready to bring the country together after Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe must confront Donald Trump for his wrongdoings. That means impeachment. But we must do more. I\u2019m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble of his presidency, pick up the pieces, and unify a divided nation,\u201d Buttigieg said. He continued on that theme by noting that each Democratic presidential candidate is \u201crunning to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden used the moment to tout his strength among people who view him as most able to beat Trump in 2020. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee, that\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his family. He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin also \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to be president.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tied impeachment hearings to her \u201cjustice\u201d campaign platform and her biography as a former prosecutor in California. \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Harris said, before taking a swipe at Buttigieg, over his \u201ctender moment\u201d comment seconds earlier. \u201cUntil we get to that tender moment, justice is on the ballot.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), meanwhile, argued that Trump\u2019s presidency is putting democracy at risk. \u201cThis is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests, in front of our country\u2019s interests, and this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man,\u201d Klobuchar said.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Wednesday during the Democratic primary debate that they would not necessarily reject Democrats who have anti-abortion views, while reaffirming they strongly believe in the need for reproductive justice. Moderator Rachel Maddow asked the two presidential hopefuls if there is room in the Democratic Party for recently reelected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who in May signed a bill banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy \u2015 one of the strictest such laws in the country. Warren and Sanders emphasized that they support access to abortion. But neither senator definitively said they would not support a Democrat who didn\u2019t share their views. Warren responded by saying abortion access is important, and she called it both a human right and an economic right. \u201cProtecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party,\u201d she said. Maddow nudged Warren to answer the question. The senator didn\u2019t offer a direct response, saying instead that it\u2019s not on her to dictate who is or is not in the party. \u201cI have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I\u2019m not here to build fences.\u201d Sanders said he believes men have to stand up and support abortion access. He also called out the GOP for being the party of small government \u2015 except where reproductive health care is concerned. \u201cIt is women who control their own bodies, not politicians,\u201d he said. Although Sanders has always supported abortion rights, he faced criticism from some reproductive justice advocates in 2017 after throwing his support behind anti-abortion Democrat Heath Mello, who was running to be mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. \u201c[Supporting] a candidate for office who will strip women \u2015 one of the most critical constituencies for the party \u2015 of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of advocacy group NARAL Pro Choice America, said at the time. Sanders and Warren aren\u2019t the only candidates who have spoken up about the party\u2019s divide over abortion. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a big tent party,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0told HuffPost in May.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell [national Democratic organizations] what to do.

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " ATLANTA \u2015 One of the officials at the center of the House impeachment investigation is Gordon Sondland, a man with no diplomatic experience who paid $1 million to Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and was rewarded with the title of U.S. ambassador to the European Union. He\u2019s part of a long, bipartisan pay-for-play system in which ambassadorships are handed out to a president\u2019s biggest donors who are eager for a spot on the world stage. (Sondland was confirmed without objection from the Senate in June 2018.) Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has pledged to break this tradition. Some of the other Democratic presidential candidates, however, aren\u2019t quite ready to follow suit. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly commit that anybody I appoint to any position will be qualified and somebody who will do a good job serving the United States,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Thursday. Buttigieg has relied heavily on wealthy donors and big fundraisers, unlike Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have sworn off those types of events. Warren reiterated her commitment to not giving out ambassadorships as rewards for big donations during the debate Wednesday night. \u201cAnyone who gives a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask everyone running for president to join me in that.\u201d Her campaign released a digital ad on Thursday that made the same point. Some candidates have stepped up to the challenge. Sanders said in a tweet Thursday that it\u2019s \u201can outrage that throughout the history of this country, presidential administrations have been filled with wealthy campaign contributors.\u201d \u201cI will fill my administration with my donors \u2015 the working class of this country who give an average of $18 a piece,\u201d he wrote. A day earlier, his campaign co-chair Nina Turner told HuffPost that the pledge is irrelevant for Sanders anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s the only candidate up there that doesn\u2019t have to pledge that because he doesn\u2019t take money from multimillionaires and billionaires so they can\u2019t buy it,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cHis donors are the people. His donors are teachers and nurses and Walmart workers.\u201d Another Democratic presidential contender, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, released a statement Thursday stating his support for Warren\u2019s pledge. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious about reforming our democracy and taking money out of politics, it means eliminating the pay-to-play practices that have dominated diplomatic appointments in both parties,\u201d Castro said in his statement. \u201cIn my administration, only the most-qualified people will be considered for ambassadorships and appointments \u2014 not wealthy donors or big bundlers,\u201d he added. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign pushed back on Warren\u2019s pledge after the debate, telling HuffPost that being a big donor shouldn\u2019t disqualify someone from an ambassadorship. Hasoni Pratts, the national engagement director for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, pointed to Caroline Kennedy \u2014 the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and a former U.S. ambassador to Japan \u2014 as an example of a wealthy person who excelled in her role. \u201cShe has been a big donor all her life,\u201d Pratts said. \u201cWould you say that she should not be an ambassador?\u201d Pratts then essentially said that banning wealthy donors from getting ambassadorships would be discrimination. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should discriminate because of one particular thing,\u201d Pratts said. \u201cI will tell you that I don\u2019t think Mayor Pete has a specific criteria except for the best person for the job.\u201d Stephanie Morales, the elected commonwealth\u2019s attorney in Portsmouth, Virginia, and a surrogate at the debate for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), said the candidate didn\u2019t need to commit to the pledge Warren put forth. \u201cI think that\u2019s completely up to her,\u201d Morales told HuffPost. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of having different candidates voice their different opinions. As much passion as Sen. Harris put into her comments about Black women, she didn\u2019t turn around and say, \u2018Elizabeth Warren, you need to pledge to do these things.\u2019\u201d Billionaire Tom Steyer danced around the question after his speech at a National Action Network breakfast Thursday, but said he wouldn\u2019t nominate an ambassador simply because they\u2019d given him money. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang also suggested his ambassador picks wouldn\u2019t be dictated by their finances. But he stopped short of committing to Warren\u2019s pledge. \u201cI certainly think there are other ways to select ambassadors than solely on how much money they got,\u201d he told HuffPost after the debate on Wednesday. This story has been updated with additional comments from candidates and\u00a0 information about Sondland\u2019s ambassadorship.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in doing so. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign still needs to reach a contract agreement with the workers, who are joining the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2321, which is based in North Andover, Massachusetts.\u00a0The union will only represent campaign staff with the title of \u201corganizer.\u201d The agreement means three of the four leading Democratic presidential campaigns are now unionized. Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is not. Campaign unions began forming in earnest during the 2018 midterm elections, as the often-young workers who serve as field organizers looked for ways to secure better pay and benefits and more stable working hours. \u201cWe are proud to work for a candidate who has proposed a bold economic agenda that would restore workers\u2019 rights, expand collective bargaining rights, and make it easier for workers to unionize,\u201d Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we would live our values and support our staff if they wanted to form a union and today, we are proud to keep that commitment.\u201d In a statement, the leaders of the Buttigieg campaign union said they hoped their work to create a dialogue between campaign staffers would \u201cbenefit everyone; not only on this particular campaign, but for future campaigns and for individuals who seek to join the profession.\u201d \u201cWe believe in Pete and look forward to an America where all workers have the right to unionize without interference and to collectively bargain for fair pay and benefits,\u201d the organizers wrote. \u201cBecause we believe, as Pete does, in unions for all, we have chosen to unionize with IBEW Local 2321.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what exact benefits and guarantees Buttigieg campaign staffers will be able to secure. The Sanders\u2019 campaign contract, for instance, includes a $15 minimum wage and a guarantee of four days off a month.

      "content": " ATLANTA \u2015 Chanting protesters drowned out Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) moments after the presidential candidate kicked off her speech Thursday at a rally at Clark Atlanta University, one of the oldest historically Black colleges and universities in the country. \u201cWe want to be heard! We want to be heard!\u201d the demonstrators, wearing black T-shirts emblazoned with the words \u201cPowerful Parent Network,\u201d shouted from a set of bleachers in the school\u2019s gymnasium. The group, reportedly funded\u00a0in part by the Walton Family Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the mega-wealthy family that founded Walmart, is a proponent of charter schools, which are privately operated but publicly funded. Warren has been critical of such schools, and her proposed education plan calls for enacting a ban on for-profit charter schools and ending a federal program that gives money to some nonprofit ones. Charter schools would be subject to the same transparency and accountability rules as other public schools, according to Warren\u2019s plan. Fellow Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has also criticized charter schools. Warren, standing on a stage near the center of the gym on Thursday, tried to continue speaking over the protesters but eventually fell silent after a few minutes. Several hundred people packed the gym around her. Many of them chanted back at the protesters, \u201cWarren! Warren! Warren!\u201d and \u201cLet her speak!\u201d Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who endorsed Warren earlier this month and introduced her at the rally on Thursday, came back onstage to ask the protesters to let the senator continue her speech, which focused on Black washerwomen in the 1880s and their fight for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cNo one is here to quiet you, least not this Black woman,\u201d Pressley, referring to herself, told the protesters. \u201cThe senator is here to talk about the contributions fighters like you have made to history.\u201d \u201cIn this moment, there are many people that do not know this story because we have been rendered as a historical footnote in history, so I\u2019m going to appeal to you to not dishonor that history,\u201d Pressley continued, adding that Warren would meet them after the rally to hear them out. Some of the protesters then left the gym. Others stayed behind and refrained from chanting. A spokesperson for Warren\u2019s campaign confirmed to HuffPost that the senator met with the group following the rally. \u201cI\u2019m not against [Warren] \u2015 I\u2019m against her education plan,\u201d Sarah Carpenter, the group\u2019s executive director, told reporters outside the rally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to blow social media up because ... Black women vote, y\u2019all.\u201d In Warren\u2019s remarks, which came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential debate, she told the story of Atlanta\u2019s Black washerwomen, who formed a union in 1881 called The Washing Society, to demand better wages and rights. Warren also acknowledged the recent death of Clark Atlanta student Alexis Crawford, whose roommate has been charged with her murder. \u201cMy heart goes out to the Crawford family,\u201d Warren said Thursday. \u201cAlexis\u2019 story happens every day across this country. We need to take meaningful action to protect women, especially women of color.\u201d The progressive icon drew major applause when speaking about her support for reparations, canceling student debt and investing in HBCUs across the country. Zomia Echols, a student at Clark Atlanta, said Warren\u2019s performance left her feeling energized. She said Warren and Sanders are her top two picks. \u201cThe protesters today were very disrespectful people,\u201d Echols, 20, told HuffPost. \u201cIf you don\u2019t support her, why would you come in the first place? That really triggered me a lot.\u201d Warren handled the situation well though, she said. \u201cReally classy. I like that,\u201d Echols said. \u201cShe let them do what they had to do.\u201d HuffPost\u2019s Rebecca Klein contributed reporting.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to \u201chelp us escape this wicked administration.\u201d But first, the presidential candidate had to help the Showtime talk show duo out of an escape room game. (See the video above.) In a segment that aired Thursday, Warren and the comedians visited an escape room in Boston with a nautical premise: They were trapped in a haunted submarine run by an angry ghost captain. Their mission was to disarm a torpedo to get out alive. Warren pounced on a Popeye clue, but would it be enough to save them? The 2020 contender, who supports a $15 minimum wage, scolded the parties responsible for the submarine\u2019s doom. \u201cThey pay sailors their wages, this would have never happened,\u201d she said. Watch the trio try to free themselves above.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) added three progressive congresswomen to her roster of co-chairs for her presidential campaign on Friday: Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Deb Haaland (D-N.M) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.). All three women were elected in 2018 as part of a historic wave of women, and specifically women of color, who ran for Congress and won seats. Haaland became one of the first Native women in U.S. Congress and Pressley the first black woman sent to Congress from her state. In their new roles, they will be campaigning for Warren in various cities across the country, engaging with voters alongside her and on her behalf. In her Friday announcement, Warren called the congresswomen \u201crelentless advocates for working families\u201d and said it was an \u201cincredible honor\u201d to have them on her team. \u201cElizabeth and I both come from humble beginnings. We both were single moms, and we understand what it means to live paycheck-to-paycheck, struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Rep. Haaland in a statement, calling Warren a \u201cchampion for Indian country.\u201d Warren has previously spurred controversy around her claims of Native American ancestry, including releasing a DNA test last fall in an attempt to prove it. Warren has since apologized for the harm she\u2019d caused and proposed a sweeping plan for empowering tribal nations. Pressley on Friday applauded Warren\u2019s vision to combat income inequality and close the racial wealth gap, as well as work \u201cto dismantle structural racism.\u201d Earlier this month, the congresswoman endorsed Warren, who is her state\u2019s senator, breaking with other members of the \u201cSquad\u201d of freshman congresswomen who endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). On Thursday, Pressley spoke up at a rally for Warren at Clark Atlanta University, a historically Black university, when school choice activists disrupted the candidate\u2019s speech in protest. \u201cNo one is here to quiet you, least not this Black woman,\u201d Pressley told the protesters. \u201cThe senator is here to talk about the contributions fighters like you have made to history.\u201d",
