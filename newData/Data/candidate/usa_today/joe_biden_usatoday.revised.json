      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The two top Democratic contenders are carving out their lead in the sprawling primary field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are in a virtual tie in a\u00a0new Quinnipiac Poll published Wednesday, with Warren numerically ahead of Biden. This is the third poll in the past week that Warren has inched ahead of Biden, but the first poll nationally. Warren is at 27% among Democrat and Democratic-leaning voters nationally, according to the poll. Just last month, she was at 19% and trailing\u00a0Biden by 13 percentage points. Biden is at 25%, according to Wednesday's poll. He's dropped 7 percentage points from 32% last month. Wednesday's poll follows several early state polling where Warren has jumped ahead of Biden after trailing the former Vice President. Warren is numerically ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is closing in on Biden in Nevada. In all of the polls, Warren and Biden are within the margin of error. For Wednesday's poll, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,337 registered voters nationwide between Sept. 19 to 23, with 561 Democratic voters or Democratic leaning voters surveyed. Poll:More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada Sen. Bernie Sanders is the only other candidate to be in the double digits, standing at 16%. That is 1 percentage point up from August where he was at 15%. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 7%, up from 5% in August.\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris has fallen to 3%. She previously was at 7% last month. No other candidate is above 2% in this poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement that Warren and Biden are \"leaving the rest of the pack behind.\" \"After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\" he said. Malloy also points to the excitement Warren is garnering among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters. More:Trump administration releases transcript of call with Ukraine's President Zelensky amid impeachment inquiry According to the poll, 70% would be excited if she became the Democratic nominee, with only 18% saying they would not be excited.\u00a0 That is\u00a0higher than both Biden and Sanders. For Biden, 56% said they would be excited if he was the nominee with 35 percent saying they would not be excited. 55% of voters said the would be excited for Sanders as the nominee while 38% said the would not be. \"Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear,\" Malloy said.\u00a0\"She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas businesses while forcefully calling again for an investigation into\u00a0President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know. Trump should be investigated.\u201d \u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\" Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me ... Ask the right questions.\u201d The comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported\u00a0discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump, and\u00a0Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Explaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story:What to know about the Trump-Congress standoff over a whistleblower complaint Multiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the\u00a0inspector general overseeing that\u00a0community concerning a phone call Trump\u00a0made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether\u00a0Trump pushed for\u00a0Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country. Hunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article\u00a0published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma\u2018s board of directors. Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once. \u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article. The Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation. Before Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a \"fine and routine conversation.\" \"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster,\" Trump tweeted. Biden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up. \u201cBe prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,\u201d Biden said. The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma. But\u00a0Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told\u00a0Bloomberg News Service in May\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko\u00a0told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call\u00a0repeatedly pressured Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Hunter Biden\u00a0and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter. Previously:Joe Biden: Trump's reported effort to get Ukraine president to investigate him 'abhorrent' Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president\u00a0in March 2016 called on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees,\u00a0according to the New York Times.\u00a0Shokin was voted out by parliament, but\u00a0no evidence showing\u00a0Biden\u00a0intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced. Still, Trump in a\u00a0May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government. \u201cLook at Joe Biden \u2026 he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don\u2019t you dare prosecute,'\" Trump said in the interview.\u00a0\"'If you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son \u2014 then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be OK. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "NEW YORK\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will releasethe transcript of a July\u00a0phone call with\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of a controversy over whether he pressured Kiev to investigate Joe Biden. The White House is also weighing whether to\u00a0give Congress a whistleblower report that outlines concerns about Trump's interaction with a foreign leader, according to two administration sources speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. While talks over the report were ongoing, it was not immediately\u00a0clear when the report would be released nor how committed Trump is to releasing it. Trump's willingness to consider\u00a0freeing up the documents came as House Democrats decided to open an impeachment inquiry into the president's effort\u00a0to enlist Ukraine officials to dig up dirt on Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that Democrats would proceed with an impeachment inquiry in part because of Trump's refusal to provide documents\u00a0that would shed light on his communications with Ukraine about his political rival. \"The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\" she said. In a tweet, Trump promised to release \"the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation\u00a0with President Zelensky of Ukraine.\" An attorney for the unnamed whistleblower said his client applauds the decision to release the complaint \"as it establishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure process can work.\" \"We await the release of the complaint in its totality,\" the attorney said. The president confirmed reports Tuesday that he withheld aid from Ukraine days before his phone call with Zelensky in July, but denied he used the money as leverage to demand the Ukrainians\u00a0dig up dirt on Biden. He insisted that he delayed the congressionally approved money because he wanted other European countries to contribute more to Ukraine. The president had said earlier that he withheld the funds over concerns about corruption. A whistleblower in the intelligence community called attention to conversations between Trump and a foreign leader. Reports surfaced over the weekend that Trump asked Zelensky to look into allegations about the Biden family, specifically the former vice president's son Hunter. Critics have said the transcript, on its own, is insufficient to settle the matter. \"The release of the transcript is necessary but far from sufficient,\" said\u00a0Ned Price, a National Security Council spokesman in the Obama White House.\u00a0\"At its heart, this is about an urgent, credible whistleblower complaint involving 'multiple actions.'\u00a0The law says Congress must be provided with it. This will remain a cover-up until that happens.\" The transcript's release may be followed by testimony from the whisteblower, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Tuesday. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the whisleblower's attorney\u00a0asked to speak with the committee\u00a0and is working with the office of the Director of National Intelligence on how to proceed. \"We\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week,\" Schiff tweeted. Talks to release the whistleblower's statement \u2013\u00a0and allow him or her to testify to Congress \u2013 came as the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph\u00a0Maguire\u00a0is scheduled to go before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Maguire, who initially refused to share the complaint with Congress, defended his handling of the matter late Tuesday. \"I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\" Maguire said in a statement. \"I am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately.\" Trump later tweeted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo received permission from Ukraine's government to publish the transcript. Trump claimed Ukraine officials \"don't know either what the big deal is.\" The president has claimed for several days that the transcript of the call would clear up the controversy and that he hesitated\u00a0in releasing it only because of the precedent it sets for releasing the details of calls with foreign leaders. Explain it:What's going on with Trump, Ukraine and Biden? Confirmed:Trump acknowledges he delayed aid for Ukraine Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed claims for months that Biden as vice president sought the\u00a0ouster in 2016 of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0served on the board of directors. The push by the vice president came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from European diplomats and the U.S. State Department\u00a0because international leaders said Shokin did too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. Trump is scheduled to meet with\u00a0Zelensky on Wednesday.\u00a0\"There was no pressure put on\u00a0them whatsoever,\" he said Tuesday at the United Nations.

      "content": "A new national opinion poll conducted by Monmouth University shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as the leading Democratic presidential candidates, though the poll also shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection to be unchanged since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry. Among registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Biden as the Democratic nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came in third place at 15%. Shortly before the poll's release, Sanders was hospitalized after suffering chest discomfort at a campaign event in Las Vegas. \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d said campaign adviser Jeff Weaver. The poll shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection among registered voters at 39%, an identical finding to Monmouth's August poll. His approval rating was 43%, and his unfavorable rating was 56%. Both South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., polled at 5%. Author and activist Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang polled at 2%. All other candidates polled at 1% or less. This poll, one of the qualifying polls for the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, does not change the makeup of the debate stage. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and businessman Tom Steyer polled at 1%, and Yang's polled at 2%, all below the 3% debate qualification threshold. More:2020 White House hopeful Bernie Sanders hospitalized after suffering chest pains More:Poll: Only 4 in 10 Republicans think Trump mentioned Biden on Ukraine call even though he acknowledged doing so Monmouth also surveyed voters about the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged pressuring of the Ukranian government to open an investigation into Biden. According to the poll, 43% of registered voters believe Trump's allegation that Biden had interfered in a Ukranian\u00a0government investigation into his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, though belief in that claim breaks along partisan lines. 67% of Republicans believed Trump's claim, in comparison with 19% of Democrats, and 45% of independents. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murra argued this finding could spell trouble for the Biden campaign \"The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,\"\u00a0said Murray. The poll of 434 registered Democratic voters was conducted from Sept. 23-29, with a 4.7\u00a0percentage point sampling margin of error. For the results about Trump's approval and the Ukraine controversy, Monmouth surveyed 1,018 registered voters, with a\u00a03.1 percentage point sampling of error.",

      "content": "CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA \u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused\u00a0President Trump of\u00a0 \"abhorrent\" behavior\u00a0amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country. Biden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the\u00a0inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump\u00a0made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether\u00a0Trump pushed for\u00a0Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country. \"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,\" Biden said in a statement Friday evening. \"This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\" Asked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son. \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa ... wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,\" Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues.\u00a0\"So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president.\u201d Biden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line\u00a0that he found it \"concerning to me that a president would do something like that.\" \u201cIt\u2019s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,\u201d Biden said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it before. I\u2019ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should.\u201d The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that\u00a0Biden, as vice president, had pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group.

Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president\u00a0in March 2016 called on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times.

And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\" Earlier Friday, Trump called reports of\u00a0the whistleblower complaint against him\u00a0a \u201cridiculous story\u201d and said his communications with other leaders were \u201cat the highest level always appropriate.\u201d Asked by reporters Friday if\u00a0he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d He said\u00a0it \"doesn't matter\" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u00a0and that it should be done anyway. Trump again attacked Biden in a Tweet on Saturday morning. He said his conversation with Zelensky was \"perfectly fine and routine.\" He added that, \"nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.\" Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris came to Biden's defense and hammered Trump over reports that he sought foreign help to go after a political rival. \u201cHe has openly invited interference,\" the California senator told reporters prior to a speech in Waterloo, Iowa. \"And now we have information that suggests that, again, he has engaged in that kind of behavior. What he fails to understand is that he is the president of the United States, and that the office of the president of the United States is the people\u2019s office \u2014 not his office. And he may be afraid of a candidate in this election.\" \"Well then win on\u00a0merit, but\u00a0leave Joe Biden alone in terms of being in cahoots and collaborating with a foreign government to attack our democracy,\" Harris said. \"That\u2019s what this is about. It's\u00a0really basic. Donald Trump appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America\u2019s democracy.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president \"sober and serious stuff.\" \"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,\u201d Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter that Congress'\u00a0failure to impeach Trump following the release earlier this year of the Mueller report made it \u201ccomplicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.\u201d \u201cDo your constitutional duty and impeach the president,\u201d Warren added. \u201cA president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won\u2019t either. Today\u2019s news confirmed he thinks he\u2019s above the law. If we do nothing, he\u2019ll be right.\u201d",

He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China. \u201cWhatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump later added.\u00a0His campaign, midway through his remarks, began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Pelosi reiterated during her call with Democrats that though she thought ill of Trump's comments, that's not what the impeachment investigation was about, stating, \u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the Constitution.\u00a0 His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons.\" \"The inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office.\u00a0 We will honor ours,\u201d she continued, according to the aide. Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to review\u00a0whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to dig up dirt on the Biden's\u00a0by withholding foreign aid. \u201cI\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county.\u00a0 But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it,\u201d Pelosi stated.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Thursday called for President Donald Trump to release transcripts of phone conversations between him and President Xi of China after reports emerged that\u00a0Trump raised both her and former Vice President Joe Biden's political prospects. A phone call with Xi on June 18 was stored in the same highly-secured electronic system used to hold the\u00a0phone call with Ukraine\u00a0President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, CNN reported. Earlier Thursday, Trump publicly declared that\u00a0China should investigate Biden. \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Warren was reportedly\u00a0mentioned in the phone call as she was beginning to gain traction in the crowded field of 2020 contenders, often emerging as a front-runner along with Biden in polling. \u201cTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values.\u201d According to CNN, \"In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on\u00a0Hong Kong protests\u00a0as trade talks progressed.\" Biden responded on Twitter after Trump first mentioned China, accusing him of attempting to\u00a0\"rig the primary and pick your opponent,\" adding that the president\u00a0\"cannot extort foreign governments\" in his effort to win reelection. \"It\u2019s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security,\" Biden said. The demand for the release of the transcript\u00a0echoed California Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, who called on the White House to release documents\u00a0about Trump\u2019s conversations with Xi \"because we need to know what he has now said in private conversations, because we obviously know what he is saying in public.\u201d \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno on Wednesday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 While President Donald Trump rails against the Biden family with a claim at the center of the Ukraine whistleblower controversy, Trump's sons are taking aim at the news media's reaction to Joe Biden's son,\u00a0Hunter Biden. Eric Trump wrote in an op-ed that there is a double standard in the treatment of Hunter Biden when compared to the Trump children. \"If the situation were reversed, I would have been front page news in every newspaper, online publication, and cable news outlet for the rest of my life,\" Eric Trump wrote in The Hill on Thursday. \"Reporters would be camping outside of my door, my family would have been picked apart, my name would have been smeared in the news every single week, and my father arguably would not even be president of the United States today.\" Trump and his political allies have, without credible evidence, pushed the allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas company linked to Hunter Biden. The prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was considered by the United States and other international groups to be ineffective at combating corruption in Ukraine. And Shokin's inquiry into the gas\u00a0company focused on a time period before Hunter Biden joined Burisma Holdings. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases Joe Biden denies that he or his son Hunter engaged in any wrongdoing. He has repeatedly pointed to news reports that have found no evidence of Trump's claims. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal. An impeachment inquiry into the president is focusing on\u00a0a whistleblower's claim that Trump put pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens. Eric Trump criticized the media for its coverage of the Eric Trump Foundation, later renamed Curetivity, which raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over several years. A Forbes report he cites found that Eric Trump had lied about some of his organization's expenses and profited off the charity. \"But can you imagine, if they were willing to try and destroy a 'kid'\u00a0who dedicated his life to pediatric cancer and philanthropy, what the media would say if I had secured a $50,000 a month job on the board of a Ukrainian company, with no discernible duties, in an industry I knew nothing about, in a country where I did not even speak the language?\" Eric Trump wrote. \"What if my father on live camera threatened to cut off military aid to that country unless the prosecutor investigating that company for corruption was fired?,\" he continued. Donald Trump Jr., too, says that the media coverage has been hypocritical. \"If I went to China and I did that... and I came back with $1.50\u2014not $1.5 billion\u2014$1.50, we would solve the media problem because their heads would explode, there'd be no fake news media left,\" Trump Jr. said on Fox News. The Trump brothers are in charge of the Trump Organization\u00a0in a position\u00a0they have held since their father was inaugurated, though Donald Trump still holds an ownership stake\u00a0in\u00a0the company.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, must submit to questioning under oath about alleged fraudulent contributions\u00a0to GOP politicians and causes, a federal judge in Florida ruled\u00a0on Tuesday. The ruling was issued in a civil action seeking to recover about $510,000 from\u00a0Parnas. The\u00a0judge also authorized a family trust\u00a0to try to recover money Parnas\u00a0allegedly transferred\u00a0to organizations including\u00a0the pro-Trump political action committee America First Action,\u00a0the National Republican Congressional Committee and a campaign committee for Pete Sessions, a former Republican congressman from Texas. Those donations are the subject of a criminal investigation\u00a0involving\u00a0Parnas, a\u00a0Ukrainian-born Florida businessman, Igor Fruman, a Belarus-born business associate, and two other men. The four were indicted earlier this month on charges of campaign finance violations.\u00a0All four have pleaded not guilty. Parnas and Fruman figure\u00a0in the Trump impeachment inquiry. They\u00a0helped Giuliani seek damaging information in Ukraine about the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's 2020 presidential campaign challengers. They also\u00a0reportedly\u00a0assisted Giuliani in pushing for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Trump recalled her to Washington, D.C., in May. House committees have subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman to testify. On the ground in Ukraine:Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust The judge issued the ruling in response to a motion filed by a family trust that sued Parnas over an unpaid loan of $350,000. Parnassought\u00a0the money to invest in a movie called\u00a0\"Anatomy of an Assassin.\" The film\u00a0was never produced. U.S. District Court Judge Donald Middlebrooks ordered Parnas to undergo questioning \"about his assets and the alleged fraudulent transfers.\" The actions could enable the\u00a0trust to recover money\u00a0Parnas allegedly transferred to the committees even as he failed\u00a0to pay the judgment. However, Parnas is unlikely to undergo questioning in the civil debt recovery lawsuit\u00a0before the criminal\u00a0case is resolved. America First Action and the campaign committees will have an opportunity to file legal defenses and will\u00a0have the right to a jury trial before any decision is made to turn funds over to the trust. Attorneys representing Parnas and the congressional campaign committee did not immediately respond to\u00a0messages seeking comment. Matt\u00a0Mackowiak, a spokesman for Sessions,\u00a0declined to comment. Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, declined to comment beyond a written statement that said, \"America First Action\u00a0takes our legal obligations\u00a0seriously and scrupulously complies with the law.\" America First received $325,000 from a company tied to Parnas\u00a0in May 2018.\u00a0A national watchdog organization\u00a0contends\u00a0the Trump super PAC violated federal law by concealing the origin of that contribution\u00a0in a report to the Federal Election Commission. \"I think the evidence shows that America First Action violated the law,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, the director for federal reform at\u00a0the Campaign Legal Center, which alerted the FEC to the suspicious transaction during the summer of\u00a02018. Fischer said his group investigated the\u00a0contribution because it\u00a0fit the profile of a straw donation,\u00a0a transaction someone makes on behalf of another. That's illegal. America First Action\u00a0reported that the money came from a Parnas-Fruman company called Global Energy Producers. That firm was just five weeks old, had conducted no business, and\u00a0didn't\u00a0have enough income or investments to make the contribution, according to the Campaign Legal Center. The record of the wire transfer shows that America First Action actually received the money from a company called Aaron Investments I LLC, a different company connected to Parnas. The Campaign Legal Center's complaint\u00a0alleges the money originated from a private loan obtained by Fruman, passed through an attorney and contributed to America First Action by Aaron Investments. According to the campaign finance indictment, the\u00a0money\u00a0never passed through a Global Energy Producers account. FEC\u00a0Complaint:Pro-Trump super PAC hid the source of donation made by two Ukraine-linked associates of Rudy Giuliani, FEC complaint says The debt collection at the\u00a0heart of Tuesday's ruling stems from a 2015 federal lawsuit in\u00a0New York City. It\u00a0accused\u00a0Parnas and one of his companies,\u00a0Parnas Holdings Inc., of failing to repay $350,000 in\u00a0loans from\u00a0a Long Beach, New York, entity called Pues Family Trust IRS. In March 2016, a federal judge in New York City ordered Parnas and his company to pay the trust $510,434.70.\u00a0The trust registered the judgment in federal court in southern Florida, where Parnas and his company are based, in January 2019. But the trust has been unable to collect anything from Parnas and his company, filings in the case show. The\u00a0conspiracy case against Parnas and Fruman accuses them of scheming to circumvent federal law against foreign influence by funneling foreign money to U.S. political campaigns and committees.\u00a0Two other Parnas and Fruman associates, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, were also indicted in the case. They, too, have pleaded not guilty. The goal, according to the indictment, was to buy political influence.\u00a0Thousands of dollars in contributions linked to the alleged scheme were distributed to GOP congressional candidates across the U.S. Some of the contributions were used in a separate\u00a0effort to win support from government officials for a retail cannabis business that was planned in several states, the indictment alleges.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The\u00a0whistleblower's complaint that sparked an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump was released Thursday, revealing\u00a0concern that the president \"used the power of his office\" to\u00a0solicit foreign help to discredit one of his main political rivals. The whistleblower, who has not been identified publicly, detailed efforts by senior White House officials\u00a0to \"lock down\" access to records of a phone call July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The complaint, contained in a\u00a0letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, suggested that Trump's efforts \"constitute a serious and flagrant problem.\" Barr in firestorm:Attorney general thrust into spotlight of Trump Ukraine scandal \"The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,\" the whistleblower said. \"They told me that there was already a discussion ongoing with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood ... that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\" The complaint cites Trump's personal lawyer\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0as a \"central figure in this effort.\" \"Attorney General (William) Barr appears to be involved as well,\" the complaint says. A summary of Trump's call with Zelensky, which was released Wednesday by the White House,\u00a0indicated that the president repeatedly offered to enlist Barr\u00a0to help\u00a0Ukraine investigate Biden. The Justice Department said Wednesday that Barr was unaware until late last month that Trump\u00a0mentioned him in the phone call with Zelensky. Officials said Barr had no communication with Ukrainian officials. The complaint indicates\u00a0that the whistleblower did not know to what extent, \"if at all,\" Giuliani may have coordinated\u00a0his work with Barr. Acting Director of National Intelligence\u00a0Joseph Maguire\u00a0testified\u00a0before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday over his initial decision to block the complaint's transmission to members of Congress. After the complaint was filed Aug. 12, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, found it credible and urgent, the threshold necessary to inform lawmakers. Maguire and the Justice Department blocked Atkinson from immediately passing along its contents to Congress\u00a0as required by law. The standoff was resolved when the White House disclosed a summary of the\u00a0phone call, freeing the complaint to be transmitted to Capitol Hill. Outlined across nine pages, the complaint provides more details about Trump's call and the White House's alleged efforts to manage the political and legal implications if the communication was made public. The whistleblower described efforts to \"lock down\" information about the Zelensky call. \"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the whistleblower said. The complaint states that White House officials were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system where presidential call transcripts are typically stored. The complaint does not identify the White House officials or the lawyers. \u201cInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the whistleblower said. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d White House officials again denied that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine\u00a0and noted that the whistleblower acknowledged throughout the complaint having not personally witnessed many of the events\u00a0described. \u201cNothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2013 all of which show nothing improper,\"\u00a0White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \"The president took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelensky, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself. \u00a0That is because he has nothing to hide.\" The whistleblower describes communication\u00a0with more than a half-dozen U.S. officials that helped form the basis of the complaint. The complaint alleges repeated efforts by Giuliani to carry out Trump's stated goal: to push Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0in connection with the son's association with a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president and working with Ukraine's government. The complaint chronicles Giuliani's efforts,\u00a0beginning in the spring after Zelensky's election, to make Trump's case with the incoming Ukrainian administration. \"Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani's circumvention of the national security decision-making process to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kiev (the Ukrainian capital) and the president,\" the complaint says. Giuliani's actions were so alarming, the whistleblower said, that State Department officials spoke with the former New York mayor \"in an attempt to contain the damage to U.S. national security.\" \"During this same time frame, multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the president and President Zelensky would depend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to play ball,\" the whistleblower said. Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cIf you use your governmental position to get a benefit for yourself, whether political, monetary or otherwise, you can\u2019t do that. \u2026 This is about as serious as it gets,\u201d said Jeffrey Harris, who worked for\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0when Giuliani was the No. 3 Justice Department official during the Reagan administration. Paul Rosenzweig, a former Whitewater prosecutor under independent counsel Kenneth Star, said the case for Trump's impeachment is probably strengthened by a feature that Russia special counsel Robert Mueller did not have: Trump\u2019s own words. The administration's decision to release the summary of the president\u2019s call may have placed Trump in a precarious position in which his words can be used against him. \u201cThis is out of the horse\u2019s mouth. \u2026 Typically, admission by a defendant is the best form of evidence,\u201d said Rosenzweig,\u00a0a senior fellow at the R Street Institute.\u00a0\u201cIt seems to me almost impossible not to think that this is a big problem for the president. Instead of being able to say \u2018No collusion,\u2019 he now has to say, \u2018Yes collusion. Why does it matter?' \u201cIf the Mueller investigation had revealed that President Trump had had personal conversation with (Russia President) Vladimir Putin and promised him something \u2013 assistance in Syria in exchange for dirt about Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea \u2013 everybody would\u2019ve said that\u2019s collusion, that\u2019s conspiracy, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened here.\u201d Former federal prosecutors\u00a0said Giuliani\u2019s involvement indicates the president\u2019s desire to advance his own personal interest and political gain, not that of the United States. That Trump, according to the\u00a0whistleblower\u2019s allegations, used Giuliani to communicate with Ukraine shows a \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor in New York. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t acting as an envoy for the United States. He was acting as an envoy for an individual named Donald Trump. He does not have an official status. \u2026 He was carrying out personal business for Donald Trump.\"",

      "content": "Sponsored by AMERIND Risk Ten Democrats took the stage in Atlanta Wednesday for the fifth primary debate, featuring a fresh round of attacks on President Donald Trump amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry and public hearings. Candidates were asked right off the bat to weigh in on impeachment, and as in previous debates, discussion on top Democratic policy priorities was punctuated by candidates offering sharp criticisms of fellow rivals. Here are some of the top moments from the debate: The debate stage was set shortly after the closing of a full day of impeachment testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and moderators asked the candidates to dive in on the topic. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked how she would convince her Republican colleagues to vote to remove the president should he be impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, 'First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. More:Catch up on USA TODAY's coverage of Wednesday's impeachment hearings In light of today's testimony from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Warren took a stab at what she says is corruption in politics, dinging Trump for appointing Sondland to his post after \"he wrote a check.\"\u00a0Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said she would not appoint donors to ambassadorships, though the practice is longstanding in administrations from both sides of the aisle. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar called for holding Trump accountable. He is accused of improperly pressuring the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into domestic politics, including into 2020 frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that while Trump is \"likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America,\" his campaign cannot only focus on it. \"We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u2019re going to lose the election,\" Sanders said. In past debates, Democrats opened with lengthy exchanges on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said, but also noted that \"doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.\" Rather, she says, it's about asking those at the top to contribute to others. \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" Warren said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome\" and difficult to evaluate. Saying that all the Democrats on stage\u00a0support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Warren's wealth tax is also part of her plan to fund Medicare for All. After taking heat from 2020 rivals at previous debates for dodging the question of how she would fund for the policy, Warren released a plan that she says would not raise taxes on the middle class. Sanders and Warren defended their Medicare for All\u00a0approaches while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during the health care discussion. After Warren talked about the need for reform, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his health care plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. Biden supports a Medicare option that builds on the Affordable Care Act, and says that people don't want to lose their current health insurance plans. \u201cI trust the American people to make a judgement that they believe is in their interest,\" Biden said. Gabbard prompts brawl with dig at Democratic Party Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the\u00a0November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a\u00a0Twitter firestorm\u00a0between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Quick wit served several candidates on stage as they sparred with each other over policy issues, prompting laughter and applause from audience members and spreading widely on social media. And as Trump's rapid response team fired off emails to counter Democrats' points, they also fired off quips aimed at the president. Booker slammed Biden for saying this week that he was not prepared to support\u00a0legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said to Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. His earlier comments included that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug.\" That view has puts Biden at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties, according to polls. Booker also used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates in the polls for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in first\u00a0place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said, taking a stab at Trump. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d Before the debate even began, the Biden campaign mistakenly sent an email to supporters that was meant to go out after the debate had ended. \"I hope I made you proud out there,\" the email said. But that wasn't the end of it, as Biden turned some heads with comments he made on stage, after a respite in his notorious verbal flubs in public appearances. Biden\u2019s response to how he would address sexual violence drew laughter for an unfortunate choice of words. He started\u00a0by reminding the audience\u00a0he authored legislation to address violence against women. He argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said, but then added.\u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d The former vice president also\u00a0touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, then saying that he was endorsed by \"the only African American woman who'd ever been elected to the United States Senate,\" likely referring to\u00a0Carol Moseley Braun. The Illinois woman, the first black woman elected to the Senate,\u00a0served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself, incredulously, as the stage erupted and Biden quickly tried to correct by saying he meant to say \"the first,\" black woman elected.

The latter involved a video Trump posted attacking former Vice President Joe Biden that included an edited clip from the music video for Canadian rock band Nickelback's 2005 hit single \"Photograph,\" as well as a portion of the song. Twitter later removed the video over copyright concerns. \"This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner,\" reads Twitter's message in place of the video beneath Trump's tweet directing viewers to \"LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\" 'Did you hear me?':Furious Donald Trump blasts media over Ukraine, impeachment inquiry Perilous times for Trump:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds The video echoed\u00a0Trump's unsubstantiated allegations that\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden improperly used his influence in office to benefit his son\u00a0Hunter.\u00a0It opened with Biden telling reporters in Iowa, \"I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" before cutting to the clip of Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger holding aloft a framed photograph of\u00a0Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, on an apparent golf outing with two men, one of whom is labeled as a \"Ukraine gas exec\" in a video caption. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases But according to Fox News, that man is actually Devon Archer, Hunter Biden's business partner of several years. Politifact reported that their relationship dates back to at least 2008. Archer served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company\u00a0Burisma Holdings with Hunter Biden.\u00a0According to Fox News, the picture was taken in August 2014, about four months after Hunter Biden joined the board. No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has surfaced, but Trump's efforts to search for such proof is an the center of the impeachment inquiry that has been opened against him. According to a whistleblower complaint, Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and leveraged U.S. military aid to do so. Trump left the tweet up despite the removal of the video and opened a fresh tweet storm Thursday morning, posting more than 20 tweets and retweets before 8:30\u00a0EDT. The tweets included insults for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, whom Trump called a \"lying disaster\" and \"a lowlife who should resign\" and several retweets of conservative commentators' posts. Trump also complimented a Twitter user named \"Kellie\" for a post criticizing 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg that read, \"What an actress! 'I should be in school.'\u00a0She\u2019s getting the best education socialism can steal. I won\u2019t be held hostage by someone who just got a learner\u2019s permit. Sorry kiddo! Tell Al to try again.\" \"Keep up the great work Kellie!\" Trump tweeted in response. He also continued to hurl allegations against Biden, quoting Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who claimed new documents obtained by Fox News show that a Ukrainian prosecutor said he was pulled off of an investigation involving Hunter Biden's firm. Another retweet featured an Associated Press photograph of Biden kissing an unidentified\u00a0usher at a Little League World Series Championship game in August 2009. \"Biden to trump\u00a0\u2013 'I am creepy,'\" read the tweet.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of trying to \u201chijack an election\u201d after new details from an intelligence agency whistleblower\u2019s complaint  about a controversial call between the president and a foreign leader emerged Thursday. The complaint details allegations that Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son, but more notably draws out how high-ranking Trump administration officials allegedly tried to \u201clock down\u201d details of the call with Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected president Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cHe\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u201d Biden told a few dozen attendees at a campaign fundraiser in San Marino, Calif. The comments from Biden were perhaps his strongest admonishment of Trump to date\u00a0over the Ukraine controversy. In the July 25 call, Trump encouraged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to look into the Bidens dealings in Ukraine, according to a summary of the call released by the White House. Trump and Giuliani for months have accused, without presenting evidence to back up their\u00a0allegation, that Biden \u2014 while still serving as vice president \u2014 demanded the ouster of then-Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating an oligarch tied to a company called Burisma Group. At the time, Hunter Biden was on the board of Ukraine's\u00a0Burisma, a position that paid him $50,000 per month. The former president \u2014 who is now a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 says that Trump has been attempting to sully him and his family without any evidence. Biden quoted an excerpt from the whistleblower\u2019s newly-declassified complaint alleging that Trump was seeking election help from Ukraine. He also pointed to\u00a0a recent Washington Post report to make the case that there\u2019s not been \u201cone shred of evidence\u201d found showing wrongdoing by Biden\u2019s family. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing anybody in my family did wrong ... at all,\u201d Biden told the friendly crowd, according to a press pool report. A stain on Biden?\u00a0Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway? Impeachment:Donald Trump's wary White House deals with the threat of impeachment Biden made his comments hours after Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on the ongoing controversy that has spurred a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of Trump. The White House on Wednesday released a summary of a July 25 phone call that shows Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and the former vice president\u2019s son. The whistleblower\u00a0complaint\u00a0released Thursday alleged White House staff took to exceptional steps to \"lock down\" all records of the Trump-Zelensky call after the conversation. The declassified, partially redacted\u00a0nine-page report\u00a0alleges White House officials were \"directed\" to remove\u00a0electronic records of the phone conversation from an internal computer system where the material is typically stored\u00a0and instead the records were placed\u00a0in\u00a0a highly secure system reserved for classified information pertaining to national security matters.",

      "content": "The release of a summary of President Donald Trump's controversial phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president has intensified Democrats\u2019 contention that the president committed an impeachable offense\u00a0by asking a foreign leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But even as Democrats express outrage over Trump\u2019s apparent desire for Ukraine officials to dig up dirt on Biden, the impeachment inquiry has created\u00a0a complicated dynamic for the former vice president and top 2020 presidential contender, political analysts, voters and Democratic strategists say. The scandal has also put the spotlight on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s past work for a Ukraine energy company and given Trump the opportunity to raise doubts about Biden with voters, analysts say. No proof has emerged to support Trump's allegations about Biden and Ukraine. But as Trump's interaction with Ukraine percolates\u00a0in the headlines, potentially\u00a0for months to come, will the facts be obscured for voters? \u201cThere is a real concern for Biden that many people aren\u2019t going to take the time to sort out the issues and make a decision about what\u2019s right and wrong,\u201d says Karen Kedrowski, a political scientist at Iowa State University. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s really going to contribute to this general idea Trump\u2019s wants to push that there is something smarmy about Biden. It\u2019s exactly what Trump did to Hillary Clinton.\u201d The situation also comes amidst the release of a pair of polls \u2014\u00a0a national survey and one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa\u00a0\u2014 in recent days that show Biden in a dead heat\u00a0with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the battle for the Democratic nomination. While the nomination race is tightening, multiple polls have shown Biden leading Trump by a wider margin in a head-to-head race than any other Democratic candidate. As details of Trump\u2019s July 25 call in which he urged Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden became public, the former vice president and his campaign aides pushed back against unsubstantiated accusations floated by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy\u00a0Giuliani about the Bidens. Impeachment:What would it take to impeach Donald Trump? Here's how the constitutional process works Lawmakers get first look:'Deeply disturbing': Lawmakers read whistleblower complaint at center of Trump-Ukraine scandal More:'I would like you to do us a favor.' What Trump and Zelensky said in their July 25 phone call Trump and Giuliani contend that Biden, while vice president, forced the firing of Ukraine\u2019s then-top prosecutor Viktor Shokin because Shokin was investigating an oligarch connected to Burisma Group. Burisma is an\u00a0energy company where Hunter Biden previously held a seat on the board of directors that paid him $50,000 per month. But the Obama administration, along with several European nations, said they in fact pressed for the firing of Shokin because he was feckless in rooting out corruption in the Eastern European nation. The attempt by Trump to turn the focus on Biden and his son has enraged the former vice president and some of his surrogates. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t treason, what is?\u201d said South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a top Biden backer in the Palmetto state, which will hold the fourth primary of 2020 election cycle. \u201cThis is clear cut. (Trump) concedes he called a foreign power. He concedes he asked them to investigate the Bidens. He implied that the foreign aid was conditioned on him doing an investigation. If you recruit a foreign power to interfere in our elections, that\u2019s treason.\u201d Following the release of the summary of the Trump-Zelensky call, Biden on Wednesday called it \"a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath.\" Biden added in a statement that he hoped to turn the page as Congress moves forward with its impeachment inquiry and focus on presenting his vision to voters. \"I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families,\" Biden said. Biden, who spent more than 40 years in elected office, is fiercely protective of his family and speaks often of the inspiration of his late son Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general who died in 2015 of brain cancer while the former vice president was still in office. He more rarely speaks publicly of Hunter Biden, 49, a Yale-educated attorney who worked as an\u00a0executive for the Delaware-based banks MBNA, a top campaign contributor to Biden's senate campaigns,\u00a0and also did lucrative work as a lobbyist and was partner in a advisory\u00a0firm. Hunter Biden earlier this year\u00a0spoke to the New Yorker magazine about\u00a0his years-long struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. He was kicked out of the Naval Reserve in 2014 after a failed drug test. The younger Biden,\u00a0who divorced in 2016 after 23 years of marriage, also grabbed headlines after it became public that he was dating his late brother\u2019s widow, Hallie. This past spring, Hunter then\u00a0married a South African\u00a0woman named Melissa Cohen. Biden told supporters at a fundraiser in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles Wednesday\u00a0that he anticipated that Trump would go after his family members. Biden recalled that as he pondered\u00a0whether to make a bid for the White House\u00a0that his grandchildren asked for a family meeting where they told him they were worried\u00a0that he wasn\u2019t going to run. \u201cI was worried because I knew what was going to happen if I ran,\" said Biden recalling conversations he had with his grandchildren. \"And they said, \u2018But we understand Pop\u2019 and then they each gave their own story that they had written out a note as to how mean they knew it was going to be, but why (we)\u00a0had to do it.\u201d Biden's son:Hunter Biden: A brief bio of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Miriam Kenning, 69, a Democrat from Ottumwa, Iowa, stopped Biden as he campaigned last weekend at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines amid reports of Trump pressuring Zelensky to probe the Bidens. She squeezed Biden\u2019s arm, thanked him for his service during the Obama administration, and told him to keep up the fight. In an interview, Kenning expressed outrage that Trump would attempt to encourage a foreign leader to investigate Biden. But Kenning also had a measure of concern that Trump could benefit by sullying Biden\u2019s reputation with swing voters as the impeachment inquiry plays out in Washington. \u201cOf course it impacts me,\u201d said Kenning, who said Biden is among five Democratic White House hopefuls she is weighing caucusing for in February. \u201cI worry about them battering him over his son\u2019s life. I just think when I go and knock on\u00a0doors of the little old ladies \u2014 and how all they get their information from\u00a0the local (conservative) news stations' coverage about all of this. What I fear the old ladies will be saying to me is, \u2018Biden wasn\u2019t right. Something is wrong.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s reality. And that\u2019s what\u2019s sad.\u201d The Trump-aligned Great America\u00a0PAC announced Wednesday plans for a six-figure ad buy in which they\u2019ll highlight Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China while his father served as vice president. The ads, which the PAC dubbed \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d will air on Fox News and online. Biden\u2019s campaign has also expressed frustration with the Trump team\u2019s efforts to try to turn Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal into an issue for Biden. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called on Biden to release transcripts of his calls with Ukraine and China officials during his time as vice president. Biden campaign national press secretary TJ Ducklo slammed McDaniel\u2019s request as nonsensical. \u201cImagine our disbelief\u00a0that Republicans called for Joe Biden to break the law and release classified transcripts he doesn't have access to or permission to release, given their track record for holding politicians who commit\u00a0crimes accountable and their general ethical and moral conduct across the board,\u201d Ducklo said. \u201cWith their newfound sense of transparency, will they also ask President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, something he promised to do nearly 4 years ago?\u201d Sam Johnson, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, said that situation could potentially prove to be a great opportunity for Biden. \u201cHis selling point has been that he could stand up to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt could potentially offer Joe the opportunity to have a unique conversation with Trump where he could say, \u2018Look, my family did nothing wrong and this is not how you act presidential.\u2019 This is an opportunity for him to show voters that he could stand a step above primary candidates and a step above Trump above himself.\u201d For now, it seems unlikely that Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals will raise questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is trailing Biden in the polls, said unequivocally in a CNN interview Tuesday that he would not raise questions about the former vice president\u2019s son to make his case for his own candidacy. \u201cI don't think we should allow this kind of \u2018whataboutism\u2019 that allows what was clearly an egregious pattern of behavior by this president to turn into an excuse to allow them to say, \u2018Look over there. Look at this thing that happened,\u2019\" Buttigieg said. \u201cWe are talking about an extraordinary, perhaps unprecedented breach of the oath of office by the American president, and if they tried to change the subject, we've got to make sure that that can't happen.\u201d Nevertheless, Biden faces a difficult task in having to fight Trump\u2019s efforts to muddy his record as voters begin to tune into the 2020 election, said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist. \u201cThere\u2019s a contamination effect on the Biden campaign,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEven though he isn\u2019t the bearer of the pathogen, he is forced to wear the surgical mask. It\u2019s not becoming in the course of the campaign \u2014 even if you\u2019re completely in the clear \u2014 to have to explain things that your opponent is saying about you even if they aren\u2019t true.\u201d AMERIND Risk Sponsored by AMERIND Risk",

Trump won Wisconsin by a narrow margin in 2016 \u2013 meaning that early polling could spell trouble for Trump going into the 2020 elections.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday will unveil a broad gun safety agenda that includes a plan to pour $900 million in federal money over eight years into anti-gun violence programs in some of the nation\u2019s cities hardest hit by gun violence, according to two\u00a0senior campaign officials. Biden is among 10 Democratic White House hopefuls set to take part in\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s gun safety forum in Las Vegas hosted by the gun control advocacy groups March for Our Lives and Giffords. Aides say Biden will unveil parts of his gun safety agenda during his appearance at the the forum. Like nearly all of the candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden backs an assault weapons ban, bolstering background checks, and launching a federal buyback program to take military-style firearms off the streets. But in emphasizing the scourge of urban violence in his gun policy, Biden is trying to underscore to voters in inner city communities that he recognizes the impact violence is having on communities that endure\u00a0hundreds of gun-related killings per year without getting the same sort of media or political attention as mass shootings. \u201cI hear the vice president say again and again that the daily acts of gun violence in our (urban) communities may not make national headlines but are just as devastating to survivors' and victims' families as gun violence that does make the front page,\u201d said one Biden campaign official, who briefed reporters on the vice president\u2019s policy rollout\u00a0ahead of Wednesday's forum. Big Trump haul:Trump campaign, RNC to report record $125 million third quarter fundraising haul Guts:Hillary Clinton says \u2018gutsiest' personal thing she ever did was stay in her marriage Biden\u2019s strategy on combating urban violence points to already-tested programs such as Group Violence Intervention, which organizes community leaders to work with individuals likely to commit acts of gun violence, express community demands that gun violence cease, and connect potential perpetrators with social workers and job counselors. Communities that have used such programming have recorded 30% to 60% drop in homicides in districts or neighborhoods that have deployed violence interrupters, according to Giffords. The former vice president is also proposing spending some of the $900 million on funding hospital-based violence intervention programs that help connect young people injured by gun violence with social and economic services while they are still hospitalized. The thinking is that such early intervention could decrease the likelihood they engage in or are victims of gun violence in the future. Biden\u2019s proposal calls for the money to be spent in 40 cities \u2014 the nation\u2019s 20 cities with the highest per capita\u00a0homicide rate and the 20 cities with the highest total number of homicides \u2014 on intervention programming that has proven to have success, Biden aides said. Biden isn\u2019t alone in speaking in favor of intervention programs. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has also called for investing money into urban gun violence intervention programs, and has seen his city make progress in reducing homicides and shootings after launching a program called Stand Against Violence Everyday, or S.A.V.E. Curing gun violence:Can you change how criminals think? Chicago hopes behavioral therapy can cut gun violence Wood solution:Baltimore is mired in violent crime. Could part of the solution be found in reclaimed wood? As part of a plan to improve public safety and reduce mass incarceration, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed the federal government\u2019s backing of\u00a0violence intervention programs \u201cthat divert young people from criminal activity, before the police become involved.\u201d While on the campaign trail, Biden has frequently touted himself as a proven and battle-tested foe of the National Rifle Association, because of his role as a senator in passing the 1994 assault weapons ban. In the aftermath of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, Biden has also sought to frame President Donald Trump as afraid of taking on the NRA and backing tightened background checks, which polling shows is supported by the vast majority of Americans. Trump on multiple occasions during his presidency has voiced support for new gun safety measures before backtracking. \u201cThe president has no intestinal fortitude to deal with this,\u201d Biden said in a speech in Iowa last month. \u201cHe knows better. His instinct was to say yeah, we're going to do something on background checks. What's he doing? Come on. This is disgraceful.\u201d Baltimore:Trump says he's 'the least racist person' in the world, sees Joe Biden as Democratic debate favorite Carnage:Trump, fed up with Chicago 'carnage,' threatens to send Feds By making urban violence a high priority in his gun policy agenda, it could also serve Biden well in the African American community, which polls show have provided him with his most steadfast support as 2020 caucuses and primaries near.\u00a0Black Americans are 10 times more likely than white Americans to die by gun homicide, and 14 times more likely than white Americans to be injured in a gun assault, according to CDC statistics cited by Giffords. It also provides Biden an opportunity to contrast himself to black voters with Trump, who has said that Baltimore residents are \"living in hell\" and spoken disparagingly of the \"horrible carnage\" of gun violence in Chicago.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0The U.S. State Department told a key witness not to appear before Congress, a senator called for Rudy Giuliani to testify\u00a0and the White House told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi there would be no cooperation in what it called a \u201cpartisan\u201d impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump. All of this and more happened on Tuesday. It all stems from the\u00a0July 25 phone call\u00a0in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden and his son. A\u00a0whistleblower complaint alleges\u00a0Trump pressured Zelensky and also raised concerns about U.S. monetary aid that was delayed to Ukraine. We've rounded up the most important developments from today on impeachment: Trump and the State Department blocked\u00a0European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland from appearing before a trio of congressional committees to answer questions about his role in pushing Ukraine's president to investigate Biden. In response, House Democrats issued a subpoena, demanding he hand over key documents by Oct. 14 and appear before the panels on Oct. 16. Sondland's attorney Robert Luskin\u00a0said the State Department directed him not to cooperate with the probe or appear before lawmakers. \"Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,\" Luskin said. He had originally said Sondland\u00a0agreed to \u201cappear voluntarily\u201d. Trump defended the decision to prevent Sondland's testimony, saying the Democrats' inquiry is illegitimate, claiming he would love\u00a0\"to send Ambassador Sondland\" to testify, but he, unfortunately \"would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court.\" Read more: In a letter released Tuesday, Trump and his team told Pelosi and other Democratic leaders that they will not provide documents or witnesses to House impeachment investigators because they consider the investigation to be unfair and illegitimate. \"You have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a blistering eight-page letter to Pelosi and the chairmen of three key House committees. \"President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\" Cipollone added, reiterating the GOP talking point that democrats are just seeking \"to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\" Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's objections\u00a0and indicated they may go to court to try and enforce subpoenas and document requests. House Democratic investigators subpoenaed Sondland minutes after the White House letter. Pelosi released a statement, responding to Trump's letter: \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\" \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law.\u00a0\u00a0You will be held accountable,\u201d she concluded. Read more: Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Giuliani, was invited by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to discuss what he learned during his investigation into\u00a0Ukraine. \"Given the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\" Graham tweeted. \"Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the Committee of his concerns.\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, embraced hearing from Giuliani, saying in a statement\u00a0that she welcomes \u201cthe opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals.\u201d Giuliani told The Washington Post\u00a0he was \"very interested\" in Graham's offer, but \"there are a lot of legal issues to consider.\" Read more: China tells Trump 'no'\u00a0to investigating Biden After Trump publicly said China should also investigate Biden\u00a0and reports swirled that the political prospects of Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0were mentioned in a phone call between Trump and President Xi Jinping, China said no. Last week, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d \u201cWe have no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States. Our position is consistent and clear,\" China foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a report in the South China Morning Post, the main English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. Read more: A\u00a0new report\u00a0released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election has concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Among other controversial issues, Russia attempted to inflame tensions around race and \"targeted African-Americans more than any other group or demographic,\" and according to the committee, the election interference efforts did not end with the 2016 election. The report delivers a call for future action to prevent foreign election interference, saying that \"the Executive Branch should, in the run up to the 2020 election, reinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\" They also recommend the creation of an interagency task force to combat misinformation efforts and a public information campaign against foreign interference. The report comes in the midst of Trump asking Ukraine and China to help him investigate, as well as previous reports that\u00a0Trump asked multiple countries, including Australia, to help\u00a0\u00a0Attorney General William Barr's ongoing inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election investigation.

On Friday, the three committees scheduled a deposition with Igor Fruman, a Ukrainian-born business partner\u00a0who helped introduce Giuliani to the Ukrainian prosecutor and Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\u00a0Trump called Yovanovitch \"bad news\" in his phone call with the Ukrainian president.

The networks that received the letter included\u00a0NBC News, CBS News, Fox News\u00a0and CNN,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Daily Beast, which first reported the letter. Giuliani Sunday morning made the rounds on several Sunday morning shows, including Fox News'\u00a0Sunday Morning Futures,\u00a0ABC\u2019s\u00a0This Week\u00a0and CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\u00a0During several of his appearances, Giuliani repeatedly pushed that Biden should be investigated in the ousting of\u00a0Viktor Shokin, the former General Prosecutor of Ukraine. Last week, a whistleblower's complaint was made public that express concern that Trump\u00a0\"used the power of his office\" to solicit foreign help to discredit\u00a0Biden during a\u00a0call with Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Giuliani is a central figure in the scandal, which has led to the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. More:Whistleblower attorney expresses 'serious concerns' over client safety to acting DNI From 'America's mayor' to Trump's pit bull:Rudy Giuliani emerges as central figure in Ukraine firestorm Dunn and Bedingfield argue in their letter that if Giuliani is booked on a show, then a Biden campaign official should be given the same amount of time on the program. They\u00a0noted that although networks push back in real-time, it is hard to catch up to Giuliani's \"falsehoods and disinformation.\" \"Your obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues,\" they wrote. \"Rudy Giuliani has made very clear that his only obligation is to protect Donald Trump, and that he will willingly lie to do so.\" \"Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\" the letter concluded. \"We ask that you no longer book him on your air.\"",

At the time of the phone call, the White House was holding up a military aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine. During a press conference earlier in the day, Trump slammed the Bidens\u00a0as \u201cstone cold crooked,\u201d and vented on Twitter, saying that Democrats are \"wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy.\" 'Did you hear me?':Furious Donald Trump blasts media over Ukraine, impeachment inquiry \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.

And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name calling. I\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives.\" Trump declined to answer a specific question during Wednesday's press conference about whether he would\u00a0honor subpoenas over the Ukraine call that Democrats promised by week's end. He also did not answer a question about what he wanted Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to do about Biden. Trump continued his defense Wednesday night, accusing Democrats of trying to steal the election, and posted a video about Joe and Hunter Biden, featuring the song \"Photograph\" by Nickelback and a 2014 picture of the duo with\u00a0Devon Archer, who also served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. Biden continued to call Trump \"desperate and defensive,\" pointing out the president's comments\u00a0about the whistleblower being executed, wanting to\u00a0prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for treason,\u00a0and warning of a civil war. \"The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order,\" Biden concluded Wednesday.",

Biden said he knew his family would come under attack, but after a sit-down with his five grandchildren three weeks before announcing he was entering the race, he made the decision. \"They came to me and said, 'Pop, you got to run.'\" When Biden said it would get really mean, his grandchildren responded, \"We know how he is,\" they said about President Donald Trump, \"but, Pop you got to do it.\" Hunter Biden\u00a0has come under scrutiny after Trump asked the Ukrainian president to Biden.

Biden said Trump\u2019s attacks are tough but won\u2019t stop him from winning come November. \"Look, we are a family. We have been through a lot worse,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"We know what real pain is.\" Impeachment poll:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Biden talked about the tragedy of losing his son to cancer.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Already facing the threat of impeachment for his interactions with Ukraine, President Donald Trump embraced the same tactic Thursday by publicly calling for China to launch an investigation into his leading Democratic rival. The remarks stunned legal observers, quieted many of the president's allies and provided ammunition to Democrats who are hoping to convince voters that Trump's controversial call in July with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky wasn't a fluke but rather part of a larger pattern of conduct unbecoming of the Oval Office. \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens,\" Trump said at the White House minutes after discussing\u00a0his administration's longstanding trade war with Beijing. \"What happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\" Experts pointed to similar open-ended requests Trump or his aides have made to Russia, Ukraine, Australia and, reportedly, the United Kingdom \u2013 either to look into the family of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden or to dig up dirt that might discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller's\u00a0investigation into the 2016 election. China:Trump says Beijing should investigate Joe Biden, family Poll:Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Fact check:The story behind Biden pushing\u00a0out a Ukrainian prosecutor Democratic lawmakers didn't take long Thursday to begin stitching the pieces together. \"Russia. Ukraine. China. How far will Trump really go to sell out America\u2019s sovereignty to stay in office?\" tweeted Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. \"The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere and help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and outspoken Trump critic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to suspend the investigation. In rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he read Trump\u2019s statement as using the leverage of trade threats for personal gain. \u201cLinking trade negotiations to Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging effort to fabricate foreign accusations against political rivals is a complete abuse of the powers of the president,\u201d Wyden said. Democrats say they are alarmed by a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which the president repeatedly\u00a0pressed to investigate Biden\u00a0and his son\u00a0Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine. Trump raised the requests after an extended conversation with Zelensky about U.S. aid to Ukraine the White House had delayed. Trump describes\u00a0the call as \"perfect\" and has denied that the foreign aid was used as leverage to pressure\u00a0Zelensky. Like the Ukraine call, Trump's remarks on China came within minutes of him raising U.S. power to punish its foes.\u00a0Trump has often relied on a carrots-and-sticks approach in his trade policy,but his words Thursday took on new meaning for some critics given the ongoing scandal. \"If they don't do what we want,\"\u00a0 Trump said of China, \"we have tremendous, tremendous power.\" Others pointed to Trump's controversial statement in 2016 when he hinted that Russia could \"find the 30,000 emails that are missing\" from Democrat Hillary Clinton's email server. Trump later explained away the comments as a joke, but Mueller's report noted Russian hackers targeted Clinton\u2019s personal office hours later for the first time. \"If this is another instance in which he is incentivizing, encouraging, calling on another country to perform opposition research to further his own personal political goals, then I do think it\u2019s problematic, and not just for political reasons,\" said Kent\u00a0Greenfield, a law professor at Boston College. \"It's part of a pattern and practice of the president breaching his oath of office, which requires him to be faithful to the Constitution.\" Republican lawmakers were slow to react to the president's latest remarks on China. For the most part, those lawmakers have stood by the White House and have lashed out at Democrats for announcing last week that they would launch an impeachment inquiry. Trump's call to China came hours after a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found growing support for impeachment.\u00a0Americans by a 45%-38% plurality support\u00a0a House vote to impeach Trump, the poll found.\u00a0By a similar margin, 44%-35% of\u00a0those surveyed say the Senate, which would then be charged with holding a trial of the president, should convict him and remove him from office. Vice President Mike Pence defended what he described as Trump's \"legitimate questions\" about Biden's former business dealings in Ukraine and China. \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\" Pence told reporters traveling with him Thursday. \"That's about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.\" Trump and his allies have also reportedly leaned on officials in\u00a0Australia and the United Kingdom to dig up damaging information about the Mueller investigation into the 2016 race. David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst and critic of Trump, described the president's overtures to foreign governments as unprecedented. \"Our policy has therefore become exactly what the founders feared: a\u00a0tool to enrich and empower one man, the president,\"\u00a0Rothkopf said.

      "content": "Joe Biden's campaign team on Monday accused President Trump and his allies\u00a0of\u00a0peddling\u00a0\u201croundly debunked conspiracy theory\u201d about the former vice president\u00a0and his son's dealings\u00a0in the Ukraine. The campaign also called on the media to focus on whether Trump abused his authority by allegedly pressuring a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the former vice president and his son. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said\u00a0some in the media \u201chave allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor\" in the aftermath of reports that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden. \u201cQuality reporting on this issue has made it increasingly clear that Trump did indeed attempt to bully a U.S. ally into disingenuously investigating the potential Democratic nominee he fears most,\u201d Bates said in an email to reporters. \u201cThe second narrative that needs to be pointed out is that, unfortunately, not all coverage of this episode has responsibly highlighted the relevant facts that have been widely reported for months.\u201d The Biden campaign raised its concerns\u00a0as Trump insisted on Monday\u00a0that he \u201cput no pressure on them whatsoever\u201d to investigate Hunter Biden. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0has reported that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky eight times in that call to investigate the younger Biden. Trump\u00a0has acknowledged that he brought up Biden in the July phone conversation\u00a0with the newly-elected Zelensky that Trump says served as a mostly congratulatory call. Trump told reporters Monday while at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly\u00a0that \u201cwhat Biden did was wrong\u201d and suggested that he might eventually\u00a0release a transcript of the call \u2014 something that the former vice president and Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding. Trump said a transcript would show that he did nothing wrong, but he also said he is concerned about the precedent of releasing details of a call with a foreign leader. Trump on alleged Ukraine pressure:'I didn't do it.' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden Ukraine scandal explained:What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint? The back-and-forth comes as scrutiny of Trump\u2019s actions during\u00a0the call is mounting amid renewed calls among House Democrats to impeach Trump. The issue came to a head after a multiple news reports about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump\u2019s comments to a foreign leader. The whistleblower complaint remains secret, and Democrats and the Trump administration are in a standoff over demands that the report be turned over to Congress. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani for months have pushed uncorroborated claims that Biden as vice president sought the 2016 ouster of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. Giuliani alleged in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, because\u00a0\u201cBiden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter and he went over there and got [Shokin] fired.\u201d The push by the former vice president, however, came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from both European diplomats and the U.S State Department, because international leaders felt Shokin was doing too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while still serving as vice president , threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma. Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told\u00a0Bloomberg News Service\u00a0in May\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. The Biden campaign says that Trump his allies are trying to muddy the waters about the former vice president's actions in Ukraine because they see Biden as the most potent potential 2020 Democratic rival. \u201cThe president and his lackeys are so terrified of that prospect \u2014 and have abandoned any pretense of having an iota of truth on their side as they flail and try to distract from what may be the greatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate \u2014 that they fell all over themselves lying on the Sunday shows,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Beddingfield said in a memo to interested parties that was titled \u201cCorrecting the Record on Rudy Giuliani's Lies.\u201d Biden told reporters while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday that\u00a0he has never spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, but the younger Biden told the New Yorker magazine in an article published in July that two had one brief exchange about Burisma around December 2015. Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue of Hunter's work with Burisma with the Vice President, according to the article. \u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.

      "content": "WILMINGTON, Del.\u00a0\u2013\u00a0He's been featured in countless newspaper articles, and even got his own New Yorker profile. Some might enjoy that kind of exposure, but it's been a major headache for Hunter Biden \u2013 and for his father Joe's presidential campaign. It's nothing new. The former vice president's middle child has long faced public scrutiny, much of it while his father was still in office. Hunter Biden is the younger son of Joe Biden and Neilia Hunter, who married in 1966. They had three children \u2013 Beau, Hunter and Naomi \u2013 before Neilia and Naomi were killed in a car crash in 1972. Joe went on to marry Jill in 1977, and the couple had their daughter, Ashley, in 1981. Hunter, like his dad and brother, went to Archmere Academy. He graduated from Georgetown University and Yale Law School. Hunter Biden has three children, Naomi, Finnegan and Maisey, with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. In 2016, Hunter Biden began dating Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother, Beau. His parents supported the couple. In 2017, they said, \"We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have (our)\u00a0full and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d When asked to comment on his family life for a January 2019 article in Vanity Fair, Hunter Biden wrote: \"Even though my life has been played out in the media, because I am a Biden, my father never once suggested that the family's public profile should be my priority. The priority has always been clear for my dad, as it is, now, for me: Never run from a struggle. Love people and find a way to love yourself.\" In May, Hunter Biden met Melissa Cohen, a 32-year-old South African filmmaker. Less than a week later, he proposed. The Biden family was not at the wedding. Hunter told The New Yorker of his father's support for the marriage. Read the full\u00a0declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint Complaint released:Whistleblower says Trump used 'the power of his office' to solicit foreign help to discredit Joe Biden, complaint says \u201cI called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, 'Thank you for giving my son the courage to love again.' \u201cAnd he said to me, 'Honey, I knew that when you found love again that I'd get you back ... And my reply was, I said, 'Dad, I always had love. And the only thing that allowed me to see it was the fact that you never gave up on me, you always believed in me.' \" In 2013, Hunter Biden was selected to be a direct commission officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, but was discharged months later after he tested positive for cocaine. That wasn't the first time drugs and alcohol took a toll on his life. In the New Yorker profile, Hunter Biden opened up about his struggle with alcohol and drugs. \u201cLook, everybody faces pain,\u201d he said in the story. \u201cEverybody has trauma. There's addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel \u2013 it's a never-ending tunnel. You don't get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.\u201d Although Joe Biden, who had relatives with alcohol problems, has never had a drink, Hunter Biden started drinking alcohol as a teenager. The story describes how he occasionally used cocaine while a student at Georgetown, even once buying crack. In the early 2000s, he tried to get sober, including rehab in 2003. He relapsed in 2010, after seven years of sobriety, when he had drinks during a business trip. Hunter Biden then told his brother, Beau, and he returned to rehab. But after suffering from shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers, he started drinking again. Baseless accusations?\u00a0Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway? July 25 call:'I would like you to do us a favor.' What Trump and Zelensky said in their phone call After Beau died in 2015, Hunter Biden began doing yoga, but also continued to drink heavily. \"Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was OK. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment,\" The New Yorker reported. \"Hunter said that his father told him, 'I need you. What do we have to do?' \" In the fall of 2016, Hunter Biden arranged to go to rehab in Sedona, Arizona. During an unexpected layover in Los Angeles, he bought crack several times that week, The New Yorker reported. After days of not sleeping, on Oct. 28, Hunter was driving on Interstate 10 near Palm Springs and eventually lost control of the car. He eventually dropped off the rental car and called the rehab center to pick him up. Shortly after the article was published last summer, Joe and Jill Biden commented on it during an interview on CNN. \"Beau was my soul, Hunter is my heart,\" Joe Biden said. \"Hunter has been through some tough times, but he's fighting.\" Hunter Biden is a lawyer and founder of the venture capital firm Eudora Global, which specializes in health care, online gambling and renewable energy. But that's not why he's been in the spotlight recently. In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company. Joe Biden:I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings Put focus on Trump:Biden campaign to media: Focus on 'dishonest' Trump, not Hunter Biden The New York Times reported in May that Joe Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, a former Ukraine prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2013 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d Trump admission:He delayed aid for Ukraine but says he didn't do it to force a Biden investigation Hunter Biden told the Times in May that he had \"no role whatsoever\" in the Ukrainian investigation of the company or any of its officers. The Washington Post has reported there is \"no evidence\" Joe Biden was trying to help his son. As President Donald Trump criticized the Bidens, the former vice president swung back, appearing in Wilmington on Tuesday to state that he supports the impeachment of Trump if the White House does not comply with Congress' requests for details about a call he made to Ukraine's president in which they discussed the former vice president. On Wednesday, the president released notes about the call. Trump campaign officials also fought back prior to Joe Biden's speech, sending out a list of questions that they said Biden should answer. It included \"an explanation for why he believes it was appropriate for Hunter (Biden) to make millions of dollars in Ukraine at the same time Joe Biden was leading diplomatic relations with Ukraine.\" Contributing: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY.

      "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 On a recent\u00a0Sunday, Victor Garcia left his Silicon Valley apartment and traveled an hour north to attend a rally by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Garcia, a 20-year-old political science major, is eager to vote both in the November 2020 election and in California\u2019s moved-up primary\u00a0on March 3.\u00a0But as curious as he is about Yang, a passionate\u00a0proponent of a monthly $1,000 Universal Basic Income payment, Garcia\u00a0is still candidate-shopping. He wants to see which politician is most attuned to issues that concern the state\u2019s growing Latino population. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d Garcia says as a largely youthful\u00a0crowd gathers at Civic Center Plazain San Francisco ahead of Yang's speech. \u201cThat said, most candidates really aren\u2019t reaching out to us yet.\" With California's earlier\u00a0primary date giving\u00a0the state newfound clout in choosing who takes on President Donald Trump, political experts say presidential hopefuls would do well to step up their courtship of the Golden State\u2019s increasingly powerful Latino voters. According to the Pew Research Center, not only are\u00a0Latinos the majority-minority, with\u00a039% (or 15 million) of the state's 40 million residents, but they also represent roughly a third of the state\u2019s eligible voters (at\u00a07.7 million). While Latino voter turnout lags that of other ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 45% of Latino adults are likely to vote, compared with 68% of whites, according to the Public Policy Institute of California \u2013 those numbers have been shifting. In the 2018 midterms, contests\u00a0that\u00a0traditionally draw\u00a0fewer voters than general elections, Latino voter turnout hit 36%, a doubling from 2014 that helped California Democratic candidates\u00a0flip seven perennially Republican House\u00a0seats. California Democrats gather:Here's what you need to know And Latino turnout expectations are heightened for the 2020 presidential election. At play not only are robust voter registration efforts aimed at a heavily Democratic constituency \u2013 58% register as Democrats, compared with 15% who register as Republicans \u2013 but also\u00a0a powerful resentment of Trump, whose disapproval rating hovers at 70% among Latinos, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. According to a Nov.\u00a013 statewide Latino Decisions poll commissioned by the Latino Community Foundation, 74%\u00a0of registered Latino voters say they plan to vote in the March 3 primary. Concerns about racism was cited by 76%\u00a0of respondents. The poll also reveals that 31% planned to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 11% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro came in at 9%, and California\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris was at 8%. \u201cThe message we want all Latinos to hear is that they have the power to determine who is going to run against Trump\u00a0and who will win in November,\u201d says Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO of San Francisco- based Latino Community Foundation, which is working to get out the Latino vote across the state. \u201cThe political climate we are in has awoken a new generation of voters,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate the term sleeping giant, because we\u2019ve been working, not sleeping. Now the candidates have to engage.\u201d Democrats making a run for the White House will have an opportunity\u00a0to lock in Garcia\u2019s vote on Nov.\u00a016 in Long Beach, California, site of a televised Univision forum that will include Harris, Warren, Sanders, Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Yang. The event represents a rare in-state gathering by candidates who by and large have been visiting\u00a0California mostly for lucrative private fundraising trips. Many have so far focused their campaigning on\u00a0Iowa and other early battleground states. In fact, Biden has skipped all events hosted by the state\u2019s Democratic Party \u2013\u00a0 but has attended posh donor events up and down the state. He\u00a0recently announced he would not be at the state\u2019s party convention in Long Beach Nov.\u00a015 through 17. Rounding out the Univision forum's field of eight \u2013 and serving as last-minute replacements for original invitees\u00a0Biden, Warren and former Texas Congressman\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, who ended his once-promising campaign Nov. 1 \u2013 will be billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The cost of not grabbing the attention of Latinos across the state is\u00a0high, says Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cA presidential candidate cannot win California without getting a very significant portion of the Latino population, so ignoring outreach here is a huge strategic mistake,\u201d Romero says. USA TODAY reached out to the campaigns of all those initially invited to the upcoming Univision forum to talk about Latino voters in California. Yang\u2019s team was the only one to arrange an interview. \u201cAs a child of immigrants, I appreciate that communities may have unique issues,\u201d Yang tells USA TODAY in a makeshift greenroom just off Mission Street that by night is a chic cocktail bar. \u201cBut my campaign focuses on topics\u00a0that affect all of us.\u201d Yang says that by highlighting the coming negative effects of automation on retail, transportation and food service jobs, he is in fact directly addressing the concerns of Latino voters. \u201cMany communities will be adversely affected by this coming economic natural disaster,\u201d Yang says. \u201cBut those who will suffer the most will be people of color.\u201d So who has the edge? A recent Telemundo poll of Latino voters nationally showed\u00a0Biden leading with 26%, followed by Sanders at 18% and Warren at 10%. The next closest was\u00a0Harris at 3%. But 36% of Latino voters said they were undecided. Those findings largely were borne out in conversations with a range of California Latino leaders, from the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to a popular radio deejay. \u201cMost Latinos certainly know who Joe Biden is, so he\u2019ll get solid support, especially from the older generation,\u201d says Xavier Becerra, the state's first Latino\u00a0attorney general. His office has\u00a0sued the Trump administration more than 60 times on a range of issues. Becerra says that for many Latino voters, name recognition is key. \u201cFour years ago, I was campaigning for Hillary (Clinton) and Sanders was having a tough time gaining traction with Latinos, and now he\u2019s way up there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that shows is Latinos, like others, want to know who you are before they turn to you.\u201d Interest in Sanders and Warren indicates Latinos are \u201ctrending on the progressive side, which makes sense when you see the growth of younger voters,\u201d\u00a0Becerra says. Currently, 44% of eligible Latino voters are in the millennial age bracket, 18 to 33, according to Pew. Chuy Gomez, a longtime Bay Area radio broadcaster, often has the ear of younger Latino voters. \u201cA lot of people I speak with want Bernie in,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cHe speaks to the common folks, the workers. He\u2019s anti-rich.\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, has endorsed Warren. \u201cShe talks about bread and butter issues in a Midwest way, but it\u2019s all about paying the rent, getting more power as a worker, and our community relates to those issues,\u201d she says. When asked about Julian Castro, the lone Latino in the shrinking cluster of Democratic candidates, many say that while Latinos instantly relate to a man with a familiar last name and life story, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has their vote. \u201cWe want Castro in the race because he lives like us and represents us, so him being president is secondary to him just being on that stage,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe should be an example for the nation. We were scapegoated by this president as a way to win the last election. So we want to help galvanize Latinos everywhere to vote.\u201d Political pundits often like to talk about voters being driven largely by specific issues. But conversations with Latinos make it clear this is not a monolithic group. In fact, they hold a range of views, from progressive to conservative, and care about a rainbow of issues ranging from income inequality to climate change. \u201cThere is no issue that is not a Latino issue,\u201d says Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state who is also the first Latino to hold that position. \u201cWe want what everyone else wants. An opportunity for a good-paying job, access to health care, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing. Our dream is the American dream.\u201d Padilla says many Latinos see that dream as increasingly under threat by the Trump\u00a0administration, which has appealed to its base by attacking illegal immigration\u00a0and calling for tougher security\u00a0at the Mexican border. That, however, has served only to galvanize Latinos in a way that reminds Padilla of California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed by the state\u2019s voters 25 years ago this month. Prop 187 denied undocumented immigrants access to health care and education. Although a day later the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, it created a movement that eventually saw 1 million California Latinos become citizens and arguably launched the ethnic group on a path toward\u00a0increased power at the polls. Latino political activists agree that while the debate over illegal immigration is deeply upsetting to Latinos, candidates would be making a mistake if they focused their messaging on this one topic. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for these candidates to understand that it is not the case that if you know what one Latino wants, you know what we all want,\u201d says Latino Community Foundation CEO Martinez Garcel. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m a Dominican from New York, so when I hear AOC (progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) speak, I don\u2019t hear socialism, I hear policies that care about the poor,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Another mistake for candidates would be displaying a level of sympathy that teeters into pity. \u201cSometimes presidential candidates don\u2019t talk about Latinos in uplifting ways but just as victims, and we need to challenge that image,\u201d says Sarah Souza, president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, the first DACA recipient (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), or \"Dreamer,\" to be appointed to the post. Souza, who originally is from Brazil, says candidates who push for access to home ownership and financial resources for Latinos will find a ready audience. \u201cWe want economic opportunities just like everyone else,\u201d says Souza, adding that she supports Castro, Sanders and Warren. \u201cThey\u2019re the most progressive and have an agenda that is for people of color, a group that has long been a target when it comes to economic equity.\u201d For Alma Beltran, mayor of Parlier, California, just south of the agricultural mecca of Fresno, the upcoming primary and general election are about restoring opportunity and dignity to the lives of her 15,000 constituents \u2013 98.8% of whom are Latino, including her and the entire City Council. Though times are tough in Parlier because of scarce economic opportunities and looming water quality issues, Beltran\u00a0finds encouragement in the younger generation. \u201cI talk to some people who will say \u2018It won\u2019t make a difference if I vote,\u2019 but then I run into young people like my son, who is 17 and told me when he gets older he wants to run for office,\u201d Beltran says. \u201cYou think maybe they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re watching. They\u2019re the people who will make a difference.\u201d The crowd waiting for Yang at Civic Center Plaza is in fact mostly younger. Signs invariably tout the merits of his basic income plan, while most of the baseball caps say, \"MATH,\" a play off Trump's MAGA slogan that stands for Make America Think Harder. Marching with a smile is Eliana Jaramillo. Her large sign features a cartoon drawing of Yang as Uncle Sam, and in Spanish it reads, \u201cUniversal Basic Income: I want you to have $1,000 a month.\u201d Jaramillo says she was drawn to Yang\u2019s campaign specifically because that kind of stipend would have allowed her and her two children to flee an abusive relationship sooner. \u201cI\u2019m marching in the hope that other women don\u2019t have to go through what I did,\u201d she says. Nearby, Milo Alvarez bops up and down on his toes as he tries to get his infant son to sleep in his chest-mounted sling. \u201cI was a Bernie fan, but now I like Yang because I love this idea of a universal basic income,\u201d\u00a0says Alvarez, a scooter repairman from Daly City just south of San Francisco. Alvarez reels off the other issues that are important to him, including health care and climate change. He says he doesn\u2019t particularly mind\u00a0if candidates don't appeal to him specifically as a Latino. \u201cI care about the issues, which cut\u00a0across a lot of ethnicities,\u201d he says. Whether a\u00a0broad political appeal, like that made by Yang, will be enough to woo California's Latino voters come the elections in March and November remains to be seen. California\u00a0Secretary of State Padilla\u00a0suggests it may not be. \u201cYou cannot compete in California without paying deep respect and responding to the Latino community,\u201d he says. \u201cBottom line.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Already under investigation for asking Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, an unrepentant President Donald Trump said Thursday that China should also investigate his political foe \u2013 an all-but-engraved invitation to another foreign country to inject itself into U.S. politics. \"By\u00a0the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters. Democrats and other critics denounced Trump for invoking China, saying he wants yet another country to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election just as Russia did in 2016. \"The defining characteristic of Donald Trump's presidency is the ongoing abuse of power,\"\u00a0 said Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. \"The White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he's afraid to look in the eye next November.\" Speaking with reporters en route to Florida for a Medicare speech, Trump also acknowledged that he did indeed want Kiev to investigate Biden and his son, though he denied using foreign aid as leverage. Asked if he had requested President Xi Jinping of China to help investigate the Biden family, Trump said, \"I haven't but it is certainly something we could start thinking about.\" Some critics noted that Trump's call for\u00a0China to investigate Biden came less than a week before American and Chinese negotiators meet to try and revive a proposed bilateral trade agreement. The Trump administration has been engaged in a longstanding trade war with Beijing. \"It is the president saying to a foreign government that\u00a0it will win his favor by investigating the Bidens,\" said David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst and critic of Trump. \"And he is saying it in the middle of a massively important trade negotiation so the stakes could\u00a0not be higher for China.\" In firing back at Trump, Biden's campaign compared the president's remarks to his open-ended call in 2016 for Russia to \"find\" Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails. Trump \"is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\"\u00a0Bedingfield said. Biden, the vice president under Obama, has said that Trump is targeting him because he fears defeat in the next election. \"He is repeatedly smearing me and my family,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"His party fans out to carry the smear. Millions of dollars in dishonest attack ads are blanketing the airwaves \u2013 paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency.\" Current Vice President\u00a0Mike\u00a0Pence, who has kept a low profile in recent days, expressed support for Trump's actions.\u00a0\u201cThe American people have the right to know whether or not the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position,\u201d Pence told reporters during a stop in Scottsdale, Arizona. Pence later tweeted out a wire story about his comments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal., who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to suspend the investigation. In rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\" At the heart of Congress'\u00a0probe into the president's actions is his\u00a0claim\u00a0that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.\u00a0But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine\u00a0say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted\u00a0for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim. One of Trump's contentions is that Hunter Biden landed business opportunities in Ukraine and China because of his connection to Joe Biden, and that the senior Biden used his position to protect his son. There is no evidence of any improper activity by either Biden. More:Biden pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption Poll:Americans support impeaching Trump over Ukraine allegations, poll finds 'Don't care'\u00a0Trump dismisses GOP concern over protecting whistleblower Before leaving the White House, Trump wrote at least 20 tweets and re-tweets, many of them attacking the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine. Trump also turned to immigration, dismissing a series of\u00a0reports that he has floated ideas of harming migrants to dissuade them from attempting to enter the U.S. Specifically, Trump denied a New York Times report that the president had previously asked about shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down. \"Fake News, just like the snakes and gators in the moat,\" Trump said, referring to another report that he had inquired about using alligators to discourage migrants. \"The Media is deranged, they have lost their minds!\" A USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll released Thursday found that Americans by a 45%-38% plurality support a House vote to impeach Trump.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Allies of President Donald Trump made clear to Ukraine last summer that the release of military aid for the country would be contingent on whether it opened an investigation into an energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter,\u00a0a senior diplomat told lawmakers Tuesday in the House impeachment inquiry. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, said in his opening statement,\u00a0obtained by The Associated Press,\u00a0 that he was \"alarmed\" by the linking of aid to investigations of Trump's Democratic rival\u00a0Joe Biden.\u00a0A source familiar with the statement confirmed its authenticity. Taylor said the demand was relayed to him by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key Trump ally, during a phone call the two had. Sondland discussed Trump's interest in seeing Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky make a public announcement about a probe into Burisma, the energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a member of its board of directors. Sondland also said Trump wanted an investigation of a theory about election interference by Ukraine, according to Taylor. \"During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\" Taylor said. Taylor said it was made clear to him that if Ukraine did not agree to the investigation, there would be a\u00a0\"stalemate\" over the nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine's efforts to fend off Russian military aggression. \"I understood the 'stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\" Taylor said. \"Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\" Democrats on the three\u00a0House committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 called Taylor's opening statement \"explosive\" and \"a direct line\" between Trump's demand for\u00a0an investigation and the withholding of military aid. \"He drew a very direct line in the series of events he described between President Trump\u2019s decision to withhold funds and refuse a meeting with Zelensky unless there was a public pronouncement by him of investigations of Burisma,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. \"I do not know how you would listen to today's testimony by Ambassador Taylor and draw any other conclusion except that the president abused his power.\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and some other members gasped and sighed during Taylor's opening remarks. Lieu said,\u00a0\"In my mind, I kept saying wow, wow, wow.\"\u00a0Rep. Adriano\u00a0Espaillat, D-N.Y., called it \"explosive.\" Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., described it as \"juicy.\" Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., said it was \"a code red.\" \u201cThis is my most disturbing day in Congress so far, very troubling words,\" said Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., who has held the seat for 10 months. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., said the House inquiry may need to \"revisit previous witnesses\" because\u00a0Taylor\u2019s testimony shed new light on them. Taylor also appeared to keep notes on his correspondence. \u201cHe referenced personal notes that he keeps,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cYou know, I don't want to get into this testimony, but he indicated that he kept extensive notes on all of this.\u201d But Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said there was \"nothing new here, I think.\" Rep Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, slammed Democrats as \"going out and leaking everything,\" though he did not comment when asked if the leaks were wrong. Trump has insisted he was justified in urging Ukraine to investigation corruption. His administration has\u00a0denied a \"quid pro quo\" that military aid would be released in exchange for the opening of an investigation. In his statement to the lawmakers, Taylor described two channels of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine, with him in the regular channel and the irregular channel guided by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which sought the investigation. \"But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances,\" Taylor said. The State Department had directed Taylor not to appear as scheduled for the deposition because the White House has declared the inquiry illegitimate. But the Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Taylor and he complied, answering questions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers and staffers. Trump has insisted he was justified in asking Ukraine to investigate corruption. Sondland\u00a0told the House inquiry Thursday that Trump had directed diplomats to consult Giuliani on Ukraine policy. In a July 25 call, Trump\u00a0asked\u00a0Zelensky to open an investigation into Hunter Biden and his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, prompting an unnamed whistleblower to file a complaint alleging Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. Mick Mulvaney:Mick Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up aid to pressure Ukraine, then rows back In text messages released as part of special envoy Kurt Volker's testimony, Taylor questioned whether military aid was being withheld for political reasons. \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH\u00a0meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked in a Sept. 1 text message to Volker and\u00a0Sondland. \"Call me,\"\u00a0Sondland texted back. Taylor raised the issue again in a text Sept. 9. \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said. Sondland said he called Trump before replying and then passed along the president's assurances. Trump had been \"crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind ... I suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\"\u00a0Sondland said. He told Taylor to call \"S,\" presumably referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, if he wanted to discuss the matter further. At an Oct. 17 news briefing, acting White House Chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made statements widely interpreted as saying aid to Ukraine was\u00a0withheld in part because of Trump's\u00a0desire for the country to investigate potential corruption regarding U.S. domestic politics. Impeachment inquiry:Impeachment inquiry: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine policy Mulvaney later issued a statement saying\u00a0his remarks had been misconstrued to \"advance a biased and political witch hunt.\" \"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian\u00a0military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney said in the statement.\u00a0\"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\" Contributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, John Fritze, David Jackson We protect Tribes from financial losses and keep Tribal dollars in Indian Country.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, wrongly implied that his committee had no contact with the whistleblower before receiving the complaint. Schiff claimed, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\u201d when the whistleblower had in fact reached out to a committee aide before filing a complaint. A Democratic committee official told us Schiff \u201ccould have been more clear\u201d but was\u00a0\u201creferring to the Committee officially interviewing the whistleblower, and himself personally.\u201d It was clearly known, however, that the committee hadn\u2019t officially interviewed the whistleblower at that time. Factcheck: Adam Schiff\u2019s \u2018parody\u2019 and President Trump\u2019s response The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0broke the story\u00a0on Oct. 2 that Schiff knew about \u201cthe outlines\u201d of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns before the\u00a0Aug. 12 complaint\u00a0was filed. The whistleblower had contacted an intelligence committee aide after passing along concerns to the CIA\u2019s top lawyer and being \u201c[c]oncerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding,\u201d the\u00a0Times\u00a0reported. New York Times, Oct. 2:\u00a0The House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the [whistleblower] find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said. In an Oct. 2 press conference, President Donald Trump\u00a0speculated\u00a0that \u201cI think [Schiff] probably helped write\u201d the complaint, but there\u2019s no evidence of that.\u00a0Patrick Boland, spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee, said in a statement, \u201cAt no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d New revelation: Sondland said Trump 'cares more' about Biden investigation than Ukraine, Taylor says On Sept. 9, Michael\u00a0Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community,\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to the House intelligence committee saying he had received a whistleblower\u2019s complaint relating to an \u201curgent concern,\u201d and that he had sent \u201cmy determination of a credible urgent concern\u201d along with a copy of the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Contrary to \u201cpast practice,\u201d Atkinson said, Maguire hadn\u2019t forwarded the complaint to Congress within seven days of receiving it. Six days later, Schiff was asked about the complaint in a\u00a0Sept. 17 MSNBC interview\u00a0and stated, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d MSNBC contributor Sam Stein:\u00a0First off, have you heard from the whistleblower? Are you \u2014\u00a0do you want to hear from the whistleblower?\u00a0What protections could you provide to the whistleblower?\u00a0And then, you also said that the DNI is refusing to turn over the stuff, citing a request from a higher authority \u2014 the insinuation left, at least for me and others, was that the President himself had intervened. Is that the insinuation you sought to provide and, if so, what basis do you have for making that insinuation? Schiff:\u00a0We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to, but I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence, just as to how he is to communicate with Congress. And so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation. Will the whistleblower be protected under the statute if the offices that are supposed to come to his assistance and provide the mechanism are unwilling to do so? But yes, we would love to talk directly with the whistleblower. Stein later\u00a0asked, \u201cDo we know what the nature of the issue at hand is? \u2026 What can you tell us about the actual substance of the matter? Are you in the dark as well?\u201d Schiff responded: \u201cWell we don\u2019t have the complaint, so there\u2019s a limit to what I can say about the substance of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do know from the Inspector General that the subject matter relates to an intelligence activity, that it is not just a concern but an urgent concern, that it deals with a serious or flagrant abuse, and that\u2019s really all that is necessary to provide that complaint to Congress.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s complaint charges that Trump \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d by, \u201camong other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d (For more on the complaint, see \u201cThe Whistleblower Complaint Timeline\u201d and \u201cQ&A on Intelligence Community Whistleblower.\u201d) Stein\u00a0addressed\u00a0Schiff\u2019s remarks on Oct. 3, saying on MSNBC that he had spoken to Schiff, who \u201cexpressed regret for not having been more clear in his wording.\u201d Schiff said at the time \u201cthere wasn\u2019t 100% certainty that the whistleblower who had approached his staff was the same one who was behind the actual complaint,\u201d Stein said. As for the committee\u2019s contact with the whistleblower, we don\u2019t know if the complainant had \u201cspoken\u201d to any committee staffers or contacted the committee through email or letter. On Oct. 2, Boland provided us with this statement without answering our follow-up questions: \u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee\u2019s unique oversight role and responsibilities. Consistent with the Committee\u2019s longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.\u201d Impeachment hearing: Diplomat says Trump felt 'wronged' by Ukraine and that they 'owed' him There\u2019s support for the statement that it\u2019s \u201ca regular occurrence\u201d for whistleblowers to contact congressional committees. A May 2019 Government Accountability Office report\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cwhistleblowers who contact the Congress typically reach out to oversight committees, the offices of their own representatives or senators, or authorizing committees.\u201d In a\u00a02016 story\u00a0in The Intercept, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, then the chair of the House intelligence committee, said the committee received whistleblower complaints in the \u201cdozens\u201d each year from both the intelligence community inspector general \u201cand via individuals who approach the committee directly.\u201d But this \u201cregular occurrence\u201d wasn\u2019t disclosed by Schiff when asked about it. Instead, wrongly implied the committee had not been contacted, when he said, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d",

      "content": "MINNEAPOLIS\u00a0\u2013 Breaking out a new stump speech amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered an extended attack\u00a0on rival Joe Biden while largely ignoring the rest of the Democratic field. Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president, hometown Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar and congressional Democrats probing his White House. Trump's retooled remarks in a state he lost narrowly to Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as he is facing a widening impeachment inquiry into whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden by withholding foreign aid. Trump, who has denied doing so,\u00a0has sought to shift attention to Biden and his son, Hunter. \"He was never considered a good senator,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" The former vice president, who spoke Thursday at an LGBTQ town hall sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN,\u00a0later responded on Twitter, saying\u00a0\"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have.\" Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases More:A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair The Trump campaign has tried for days to focus voters' attention\u00a0on Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China.\u00a0Trump, without offering evidence, said that\u00a0Hunter Biden was hired by companies in other countries because of his last name, and his father's position as vice president, rather than his business acumen. \"Whatever happened to\u00a0Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump said, as current Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence watched from just off stage. The line was clearly a point officials close to Trump wanted to emphasize.\u00a0Midway through his remarks, Trump's campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Trump's attacks on Biden came during an unusually long address\u00a0\u2013 running over an hour and a half\u00a0\u2013 in which\u00a0he also blasted the city's mayor for forbidding police officers to wear uniforms to his rally and touted efforts to reduce the number of refugees resettled\u00a0in U.S. cities. Before Trump took the stage, the crowd chanted \"lock him up,\" reprising a taunt his supporters often used against Clinton in 2016 but aiming it at Biden. Joe Biden, who called for\u00a0Trump's impeachment earlier in the week, accused the president of \"shooting holes in the Constitution.\" \"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"His lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence as president.\" Andrew Bates, rapid response director for Biden's campaign, tweeted that Trump's \"presidency\u2019s spiraling after he was caught trying to force a foreign country to lie about the candidate who terrifies him, and apparently this is all he\u2019s got left.\" Biden\u2019s lead in national polling has slipped amid the back-and-forth with Trump as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has steadily increased her support. The president also renewed his attacks on Omar, D-Minn., who represents much of Minneapolis. At one point, the president described\u00a0Omar as a \"American-hating socialist.\u201d Trump has previously claimed that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to Hunter Biden. But an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine and others have countered that the official was ousted\u00a0because he wasn't pursuing corruption aggressively enough. Contributing: Jeanine Santucci",

      "author": "",
      "content": "This story has been updated with details of a Nov. 13, 2019, ruling by a federal court in New York NEW YORK\u00a0\u2014 Could the legal situation possibly get any worse for Lev Parnas, the associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who's under criminal indictment in a campaign finance case? Short answer: Yes. A frustrated creditor is trying to seize bail funds that Parnas \u2014 a potential witness in the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump \u2014 posted to stay out of jail\u00a0while awaiting trial. And a federal judge might authorize the seizure. The development stems from the latest efforts of a\u00a0family trust that since 2015 has tried to collect on a more than $500,000 judgment against Parnas from a movie-loan deal gone bad. The total has since\u00a0risen to more than $678,000. In a rare but not unprecedented action, the trust filed an Oct. 29\u00a0writ to garnish $200,000 that Parnas's family\u00a0posted to secure his $1 million appearance bond in the criminal case. The bond keyed a judge's decision to order Parnas held under home detention, rather than jail, pending trial. A federal attorney in Virginia, where the bond was initially posted, objected and filed a proposed motion to vacate the writ because a judge ordered the bail package to ensure Parnas shows up for court hearings and trial. A federal court in Florida, where Parnas and his family reside, took the proposed motion \"under advisement,\" but did not reject it. Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Middlebrooks ordered attorneys for the family Trust and Parnas to file legal arguments about the unusual collection effort. The collection attempt has taken on heightened public significance because the Ukraine-born Parnas and an associate, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, helped Giuliani seek damaging information in Ukraine about the family of former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2014 a potential Trump challenger in the 2020 presidential election. They also\u00a0reportedly\u00a0assisted Giuliani in seeking the ouster of then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch. Trump recalled her to Washington, D.C., in May.\u00a0As a result, House impeachment investigators have subpoenaed both men. The proceedings \u2014\u00a0with the first live public testimony scheduled for Wednesday \u2014\u00a0focus on allegations that Trump delayed roughly $400 million in congressionally-approved U.S. aid to Ukraine.\u00a0The goal, in theory, was\u00a0to pressure\u00a0Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation of Biden's son's financial involvement in a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma Holdings. Trump also sought an investigation of an unproven theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election that brought him to the White House. He has repeatedly denied there was anything improper about the aid delay or his investigation requests. Parnas and Fruman initially refused to cooperate with the impeachment proceedings. However, defense lawyer Joseph Bondy recently signaled Parnas might provide evidence so long as he did not risk to endanger his defense in the criminal case, The New York Times reported. In that case, federal prosecutors in New York allege that Parnas and Fruman conspired in a scheme to win influence by\u00a0funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign funds to U.S. politicians and election committees. According to the indictment unsealed in October, the scheme\u00a0involved an unnamed Ukrainian government official and an unidentified Russian businessman who bankrolled the effort. The long-running judgment collection effort stems from\u00a0$300,000 that the Michael Pues, the trustee for the Pues Family Trust IRA, loaned\u00a0Parnas in 2010 to invest in a movie that was to be called \"Anatomy of an Assassin.\" However, the film was never produced, and Parnas didn't return the money. The trust won a judgment against Parnas and his company, Parnas holdings, in a 2015\u00a0federal court decision in the Eastern District of New York. After filing the judgment in Florida, the trust embarked on the so-far fruitless effort to collect from a man whom court filings show has been the target of a string of evictions and civil lawsuits, including one in which his attorneys sued him for non-payment. In a court filing on Tuesday evening, defense attorney Chris Draper argued that Parnas's bail funds could not be garnished because the money was posted by his wife, Svetlana Parnas. The funds are \"essentially being held in trust by the court to be delivered back to whom they belong, and thus are not funds or assets\" of Parnas, Draper argued. Tony Andre, an attorney representing the Pues Family Trust IRA, disagreed in a filing that cited court cases involving creditors that garnished bail packages to recover unpaid debts. The collection effort \"is a somewhat extraordinary remedy\" the trust \"has been forced to resort to, because of\" Parnas's \"actions to conceal his assets,\" argued Andre. \"Here, the court has the broad power and responsibility to attach assets . . . to satisfy this long-standing judgment. Judge Middlebrooks is expected to review the legal arguments before issuing a decision. However, even before the Florida court acted, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken, who is presiding over the criminal case against Parnas, ordered the court clerk not to release\u00a0the bail funds. That order, issued on Nov. 13, raised the possibility of a clash between two federal courts over the issue.",

Biden, speaking with reporter Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home, described\u00a0his dealings with the company, Burisma, as \"poor judgment\" on his part that\u00a0\"gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\" former Vice President Joe Biden. But he said he did not do anything \"improper\" in \"any way whatsoever.\" \"I joined a board. I served honorably. I focused on corporate governance,\" he said. Ukrainian officials have previously said they found no evidence of wrongdoing on the Bidens part.\u00a0President Donald Trump's effort, led by his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine into investigating potential corruption tied to Burisma and the Bidens' role with the company has sparked an impeachment inquiry alleging the president was using the power of his office to go after a political rival. Ukraine:Trump's conspiracy theories thrive as young democracy battles corruption and distrust At a rally last week in Minneapolis last week, Trump tore into the former vice president and implied his son had gone into hiding. \"Whatever happened to Hunter?

      "author": "",
      "content": "The fourth round of the Democratic primary debates saw a record 12 candidates battling it out over top issues, while\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is underway. The focus shifted from former Vice President Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility. Here are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate: As expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. When asked about his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected. Foreign business deals:Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter)\u00a0made.\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct. Ukraine explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases This debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support\u00a0with varying levels of enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to\u00a0determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him\u00a0how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election\u00a0makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives\u00a0while pursuing impeachment:\u00a0\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\" Sen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d Warren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was\u00a0Warren's turn to take some hits. Warren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer. Costs will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\" \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan. Polls:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls More data:Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio Klobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump. \"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan. \u201cI\u00a0appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan.\u00a0\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d According to CNN's tracker, Warren\u00a0had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes. At the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate. O'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a\u00a0\u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support. More on\u00a0buyback debate:Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d Calling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said,\u00a0\"I\u00a0don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been\u00a0lost to gun violence. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d In a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election. \"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is\u00a0\u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable. Candidates' ages:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like. Sanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage. Biden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said. Warren, 70, said she'd\u00a0\"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. On the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37.\u00a0She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important. After a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate. \"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said. Later in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department\u00a0review before states passed anti-abortion laws. Klobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.

      "content": "Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment:5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary:Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency:Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00a0\u2014 A judge on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin producing within 30 days documents related to the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine, saying the records were of obvious public interest. The documents were sought under a Freedom of Information Act request by American Oversight, an ethics watchdog that investigates the administration. Any release of government documents could shed new light on President Donald Trump's efforts to prod his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, the matter at the heart of the Democrat-led House impeachment inquiry. \"These records concern a matter of immense public importance,\" Daniel McGrath, a lawyer for American Oversight, said during arguments in Washington's federal court. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said he agreed. More:US diplomat says Donald Trump wanted Ukraine military aid linked to probe of Bidens Cooper encouraged the organization to work with the government to identify which documents can be released because they are not classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure. That could potentially include any correspondence with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer and a key participant in a backchannel diplomacy effort with Ukraine, since he is not an administration official. \"His emails, text messages \u2014 which he showed on TV \u2014 are going to be subject to public disclosure with limited redactions,\" Austin Evers, the organization's executive director, told reporters after the hearing. \"It's possible that this administration will jump through some legal hoops to try to withhold them, but we have the court today urging the parties to focus on those communications as top priority.\" He described the judge's ruling as \"a crack in the administration's stone wall.\" More:Key takeaways from Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement Among the records the group asked for are documents related to interactions between Giuliani and Ukraine, as well as documents about the recall of\u00a0Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. The government has said it does not know how many records could be covered by the ruling. Lawyers said they have identified thousands of potential hits for documents related to Giuliani and Yovanovitch, but that could include duplicates as well as attachments. Meanwhile, three committees leading the impeachment investigation are asking the State Department for documents they say are central to the probe's \"core area of investigation\" after the department defied a subpoena to provide them. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform panels said in a letter Wednesday that they have \"now obtained detailed information identifying specific documents\" in the department's custody. They include written readouts of meetings and conversations that are part of the inquiry, as well as emails, texts and diplomatic cables. The committees are investigating Trump's requests for Ukraine to investigate Biden's family and actions by Democrats in the 2016 election. The panels wrote that they \"may draw the inference that their nonproduction indicates that these documents support the allegations against the president and others.\" Evers said his organization was committed to helping the American public see the same type of documents that the State Department has yet to produce to Congress. If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \"wants to fight so hard\" to keep records out of the hands of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, \"we're happy to be in court,\" Evers said.

It may be a federal holiday, but the countdown to public impeachment inquiry hearings on Wednesday marches on \u2013 and with it, so does the partisan bickering. Here's the latest. Saturday was the deadline for House Republicans to submit their proposed list of\u00a0witnesses\u00a0to Democrats.

      "content": "Elizabeth Lawrence, a school teacher in Alabama, was lynched in 1933 for reprimanding white schoolchildren for throwing rocks at her. In 1893, 17-year-old Henry Smith, suspected of killing a white girl, was burned alive before a mob of 10,000 in Texas.\u00a0His ashes and bones were sold as souvenirs. Emmett Till, 14, was abducted, tortured and murdered in 1955. They are\u00a0just three of the\u00a0at least 4,000 lynchings that took place in the United States from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. And Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that an impeachment inquiry against him is a lynching, a\u00a0metaphor that quickly drew widespread criticism from lawmakers and social justice groups as \"grotesque\" and \"offensive.\" \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\" Trump tweeted. Trump's tweet:Trump slammed by lawmakers after he called impeachment inquiry a 'lynching' Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democratic presidential candidate, responded: \"Lynching is an act of terror used to uphold white supremacy. Try again.\" \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\" Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director of the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union, told USA TODAY that Trump's comment was \"grounded either in ignorance or deliberate stupidity.\" \"Him making this statement and Senator Graham backing it up, I\u00a0think they are slaps in the face to the African American community and to the families who are descendants\u00a0of people who were lynched\u00a0in this country,\"\u00a0Robinson said. \"At the end of this process, (Trump) is going to have his life. At the end of this process, he is not going to be physically tortured,\" he added. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, defended the president's word choice as \"pretty well accurate.\" He told reporters that the impeachment investigation is a \"sham\" and a \"joke.\" \"So yeah,\" Graham said, \"this is a lynching in every sense.\" Trump's impeachment inquiry, a legal process occurring within the confines of the U.S. Constitution, is completely different from the lynchings of black Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries. According to the\u00a0Equal Justice Initiative, lynchings were \"violent and public acts of torture that traumatized black people throughout the country and were largely tolerated by state and federal officials.\" Between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,384 racial terror lynchings\u00a0occurred in the United States, according to the Equal Justice Initiative's count. Racial terror lynchings are\u00a0distinguished from mob killings that followed some form of trial or were committed against white people without the threat of terror, the group says. The NAACP puts the number at\u00a03,446 black people\u00a0lynched from 1882 to 1968. An additional\u00a01,297 white people were lynched, the group says, for helping blacks or being anti-lynching. Bryan Stevenson, the Equal Justice Initiative's executive director, told the Montgomery Advertiser in a 2018 interview\u00a0that lynching was used as \"a tactic of control, of reinforcing white supremacy, of racial hierarchy.\" Lynchings occurred outside of a formal criminal justice system because black Americans were seen as not deserving a trial, Stevenson said. The violence also occurred with the expectation that those who committed the lynching would not be punished for the act, he added. \"The threat, the menace, to African Americans is very different,\" Stevenson said. \"This is terrorism. It is not a crime. It's not murder. It's terrorism. The difference is the act of violence isn't directed\u00a0just at that one person who's hanging from that tree. It's the entire black community.\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denied that Trump considers himself a lynching victim, saying \"he's not comparing himself to those dark times.\" Instead, Gidley said, the president was criticizing his treatment by Democrats and journalists whom he said have called for his impeachment ever since he was elected. \"He is not receiving due process,\" Gidley said. Trump, however, is not alone in calling an impeachment inquiry a lynching. Graham defends Trump:'This is a lynching, in every sense': Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate' Former\u00a0vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night after a 1998 clip surfaced of him saying the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton could be seen as a \"partisan lynching.\" Biden's apology came the same day he said it was \"abhorrent\" and \"despicable\" that Trump used the term to refer to the impeachment inquiry. \"Impeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution,\" he admonished Trump. \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\" Biden's apology:After slamming Trump for 'lynching' tweet, Biden apologizes for using the term about Clinton impeachment But 20 years ago, Biden used that exact word to refer to the impeachment process against fellow Democrat Clinton. \"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Other Democrats also used \"lynching\" when referring to Clinton's impeachment. A Washington Post report found at least five House Democrats, three of whom are black,\u00a0used that word or \"lynch mob\" to refer to the process against Clinton, including\u00a0Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who now chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment.

Period. Period. End of story,\" Biden told reporters in Iowa after giving remarks at a labor conference. Biden's remarks to reporters at the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday came hours after his son, Hunter, announced he would step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm and committed to not do any foreign work if his father is elected president. Biden said his son's lawyers had told him they would be issuing a statement but he did not consult with his son about the statement and only saw it when it was released publicly Sunday morning. Biden said no one has asserted he or his son have done anything wrong, except President Donald Trump. Hunter Biden:Will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president The younger Biden has become a target of Trump\u2019s criticism for his work on the boards of companies in Ukraine and China, although there is no evidence that he engaged in unlawful behavior. Trump\u2019s request of the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in that country has become the basis for an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House. Democrats allege the request amounted to using the power of the presidency to improperly ask a foreign power to investigate the family of one of his domestic political rivals. Trump has said he did not do anything wrong. Biden said no news organizations that have investigated his son's business dealings have found that there was any wrongdoing by the Bidens. \"No one, no one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong.

Biden is one of the last Democratic presidential contenders to signal his support for the U.S. House's impeachment inquiry against Trump. Failing to pursue the impeachment inquiry against the president could give future presidents license to engage in unethical behavior, Biden said at the forum. \"If, in fact, the House doesn\u2019t move and let the facts fall where they may, what does the next unethical president, if we elect another one, what does that say they can do?\" Biden said. \"What\u2019s that say? What\u2019s going to happen? They have to know there\u2019s consequences.\" Biden suggested growing public opinion on impeachment will sway more Republicans in Congress to support it. Several public polls in recent days have found that public support for an impeachment inquiry tops 50%. \"What\u2019s going to change Republican minds in the United States Congress is when their constituents start changing their minds,\" Biden told the labor forum. \"And you\u2019re seeing it start to happen: More Republican voters, independent voters are saying, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0As 12 of the remaining 19 Democratic presidential candidates head\u00a0into Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday for the fourth primary debate,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden and\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More:Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September. Warren is the choice of 50% of Democratic voters\u00a0and independents who lean Democratic\u00a0who identify as \"very liberal\"\u00a0in the poll from Quinnipiac. Sanders and Biden are tied at 14% within that group. Among those who call themselves \"somewhat liberal,\" Warren finishes\u00a0first at 34%, Sanders comes in at 17% and Biden at 15%. Biden is\u00a0the clear favorite among those who identify\u00a0as conservative Democrats at 36%;\u00a0Warren comes in second at 19%, and Sanders is third at 6%. Democratic debate:Why the 2020 election will be decided in suburbs such as\u00a0Westerville, Ohio More:Why Democrats have a tough road in 2020 in Ohio Warren \u2013 whose declaration\u00a0\"I have a plan for that\" has become synonymous with her campaign\u00a0\u2013\u00a0holds a decisive lead as the candidate with the best policy ideas at 40%, ahead of Biden at 16% and Sanders at 12%, according to Quinnipiac. But Democratic voters indicate\u00a0defeating President Donald Trump in the general election is their top priority, and about half of Democratic voters see Biden as the candidate best equipped to pull that off. Forty-eight percent say Biden has\u00a0the best chance of defeating Trump, and 21% see\u00a0Warren as the candidate with the best shot. While Biden has hovered at 42% to\u00a056% in Quinnipiac polls on this question, Warren had never finished higher than 9% in previous surveys from the pollster. More:Elizabeth Warren leads\u00a0Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primary polls When asked which Democratic candidate they think would be the best leader, 32% say\u00a0Biden and 28% say\u00a0Warren. On the question of impeachment, 46% say\u00a0Trump should be removed from office, and\u00a048% oppose\u00a0such a move. A\u00a0narrow majority of 51% approve\u00a0of the Democrat-controlled House's move to open an impeachment inquiry, and 59% say\u00a0they disapprove\u00a0of the way Trump has responded to the inquiry. Fifty-one percent say the impeachment is a \"legitimate\" investigation, and\u00a043% say\u00a0it is a \"political witch hunt.\" Though 66% say it is \"not acceptable\" for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump encouraged\u00a0Ukraine to look at\u00a0Biden, only 44% say\u00a0that is a good enough reason to remove a president from office. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Oct. 11-13 among 1,195 registered voters. It has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden, for the first time, called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Speaking in Manchester, N.H., Biden said, \"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed the nation, and committed impeachable acts.\" \"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\" Biden added. \"The United States cannot afford to have a president who will abuse whatever power available to them to get re-elected,\" Biden said, slamming Trump's request to the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump asked the Ukrainian government in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Biden and probe allegations about Ukraine's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Democrats have cited evidence showing that the U.S. government withheld military aid from Ukraine as part of the effort to pressure Ukraine into opening the investigation. Trump has accused Biden's son of \"corruption\" relating to his board seat on a Ukrainian gas company, though Ukrainian prosecutors have said Hunter Biden did not do violate any laws. And on Oct. 3, Trump urged China to investigate Biden,\u00a0though the Chinese government has publicly declined to do so. In his speech today, Biden said there was \"no truth in [Trump's] charges against me and my son. Zero.\" Previously, Biden had hedged his comments about Trump despite the launching of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \"If the president does not comply with such a request of\u00a0the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flaunt the law,\" Biden had said on Sept. 24,\u00a0\"Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.\" Shortly after Biden made his remarks, Trump tweeted in response and posted a campaign ad about Bide. \"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong,\" Trump wrote. Biden later responded on Twitter. \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution,\" Biden wrote, also calling on Trump to release his tax returns.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead a turbulent field for the Democratic presidential nomination, a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but his margin over Massachusetts Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren has been slashed in half. And most Democratic voters\u00a0say they could still change their minds. Almost exactly one year before Election Day\u00a0\u2013 and 96 days before the opening Iowa caucuses\u00a0\u2013 Biden was backed by 26% of likely Democratic primary and caucus voters in the survey. Warren was\u00a0second at 17%, followed by\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Biden's lead over Warren, now 9 percentage points, was 18 points in the last\u00a0USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, taken in late August. His standing has fallen by 6 points since then; hers has risen by 3. \"My front-runner would be Biden,\" Nathaniel Dortch, 77, an Air Force retiree from\u00a0Moreno Valley, California, who was among those surveyed, said in a follow-up interview. Then he added, \"I want to wait and see.\" Iowa caucuses:\u00a0Poll shows they are 'up for grabs' as\u00a0Buttigieg surges into top tier In a sign of the prospect for changes ahead, 18% of likely Democratic voters were undecided. Among those with a preferred candidate, a 57% majority said their minds weren't firmly made up. \"I am undecided in supporting a specific candidate right now because I am not looking for the issue differential, I want someone best equipped to take on Donald Trump,\" said Freyr Thor, 56, a tech CEO from South Pasadena, California. He's worried about\u00a0what he's seen, and hasn't seen, in the Democrats' televised debates so far.\u00a0\"No one has shown me they can take on Trump, including Biden.\" In a match-up between President Trump and an unnamed Democratic nominee, Trump narrowly led, 41%-39%, with 10% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate. Another 10% were undecided. That was a shift, albeit one within the margin of error, from the August survey, when the unnamed Democrat held a narrow lead over Trump,\u00a041%-39%. In the new poll,\u00a0Republicans expressed overwhelming confidence about the outcome of the election, with 86% predicting the president would win. Seventy-five percent of Democrats said their nominee would win. But independents by a double-digit margin expected Trump to prevail. Despite the cloud of impeachment, overall those surveyed predicted by 50%-40% that the president in the end would claim a second term. \"Trump has done a lot of the things he has set out to do,\" said John Siefkas, 52, a farmer and political independent from Osceola, Iowa, who was called in the poll. \"He needs to keep his hands off Twitter, (but) he is doing some stuff that is needing done that people haven't had the guts to do.\" William Collins, 56, an independent who is a retired police investigator from Fort Valley, Virginia, also plans to vote for the president. \"I believe Trump has directed America in the right direction, and I think he really has the American people in his own heart.\" Trump's job-approval rating was 46% approve-52% disapprove, with 27% saying they \"strongly\" approved and 37% saying they \"strongly\" disapproved. More from the poll:Who's sticking with Trump? His seemingly unshakable base. USA TODAY interview with David Rubenstein: 'The country will survive whatever happens now' The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The sample of 399 likely Democratic voters has an error margin of 4.9 points; the sample of 323 likely Republican voters has an error margin of 5.5 points. Those surveyed were split down the middle when it comes to Congress: 43% said they supported the Democratic candidate in their district; 42% the Republican. Asked whether they would prefer Democrats or Republicans to win control of Congress next November, they divided 46%-46%. The Democratic field now has a top tier of four candidates \u2013 Biden, Warren, Sanders and now Buttigieg, whose standing rose 4 points from the August poll. They were followed by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 4% \u2013 up from less than 1% last time \u2013 and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%. California Sen. Kamala Harris was also at 3%, a drop of 3 points from August. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, credited with a strong performance in the last debate, was at 2% \u2013 not a big number, but better than in August, when she registered no support. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also was at 2%. None of the other 11 candidates had support higher than 1%, a troubling sign as they try to raise money and break through. Seven of them had either no\u00a0or only a single backer in the survey. \"I like Warren, Harris and Booker,\"\u00a0said Doleen Reynolds, 51, an independent from Slidell, Louisiana, who is concerned that Biden \"would compromise too much\" with progressive principles. \"But if he gets the nomination, I will vote for him, because we cannot have the alternative.\" The big field is helping Biden, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"Biden's strength has been, at best, fixed, and he benefits from so many other candidates splitting the non-Biden voters,\" Paleologos said.\u00a0\"Overall, Biden has led in the national polls for some time but you can't flatline to the Iowa caucuses.\" The Democratic field has set records for size, but almost one in five Democrats, 18%, said they wished someone else would jump into the race. In response to an open-ended question about who, 10% identified former first lady Michelle Obama,\u00a07% said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg\u00a0and\u00a04% said Hillary Clinton, the party's 2016 nominee. Among Republicans, a similar number, 17%, said they wished someone else would enter the GOP contest. Asked who, 8% said former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and 6% said Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee. Mitt Romney:\u00a0A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party None of the three Republicans who are already running are cutting into Trump's support. In the poll, 85% of likely GOP voters backed Trump. Two percent supported former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld; and 1% each supported former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Vice President Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night after a 1998 clip surfaced of him saying the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton could be seen as a \"partisan lynching.\" Biden's apology came the same day he said it was \"abhorrent\" and \"despicable\" that\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0used the term to refer to the impeachment inquiry being conducted against him. \"Impeachment is not 'lynching,'\u00a0it is part of our Constitution,\" he admonished Trump. \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\" But 20 years ago, Biden used that exact word to refer to the impeachment process against fellow Democrat Clinton. \"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. 'This is a lynching, in every sense':Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate' Trump said he was the victim of a lynching in tweet that\u00a0argued the inquiry\u00a0was being done \"without due process or fairness or any legal rights.\" \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here\u00a0\u2013 a lynching,\" he tweeted. Nine hours after condemning Trump's tweet, Biden went on Twitter to say he was sorry for doing the same two decades ago. \"This wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that,\" Biden said in a tweet linking to a CNN story about the 21-year-old interview. But he quickly made a distinction between himself and the president, tweeting\u00a0\"Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\" Biden's assertion that Trump \"deliberately\" used the word was echoed by other Democrats who painted it as a strategy to distract from the negative headlines surrounding the impeachment inquiry in the House. Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said in a statement Tuesday that \"every time his back is up against the wall, he throws out the red meat of racial rhetoric and attacks communities of color.\" Biden was not the only Democrat to refer to Clinton's impeachment as a \"lynching.\" A\u00a0 Washington Post report found at least five House Democrats used that word or \"lynch mob\" to refer to the process against Clinton. One of them,\u00a0Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment.

Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, used a speech in Iowa to criticize several aspects of Trump's foreign policy, including the trade war with China and\u00a0his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump is \"a complete failure\" and \"the most reckless and incompetent commander-in-chief we've ever had,\" Biden said. 2020 Election:5 things we learned from the Democratic debate in Ohio But he saved his harshest words for Trump's decision earlier this month to remove U.S. armed forces from northern Syria. Turkey subsequently invaded the country, including territory held by the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS. \"The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform,\" Biden said, according to prepared remarks. The decision to withdraw troops from Syria, Biden said, created a humanitarian crisis and gave ISIS \"a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants.\" \"These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice,\" Biden said, according to the prepared remarks. \"And then, Trump sold them out.\" Trump has stood by his decision. \"It's not our problem,\" the president\u00a0told reporters Wednesday\u00a0as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared to travel to\u00a0Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire\u00a0and avoid a humanitarian crisis on the Syrian border. \"Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside,\" Biden said. Biden also used the speech to highlight the Obama administration's efforts against ISIS. \"The Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground,\" Biden said. \"Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump\u2019s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing \u2014 until last week.\" Trump has faced bipartisan criticism for the withdrawal of troops, with the U.S. House voting overwhelmingly\u00a0Wednesday afternoon to condemn the move. \"Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible,\" Biden said. \"It's about the only time they've mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump.\"",

Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here.

Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

      "content": "YORK, Pa.\u00a0\u2014 Democrats and President\u00a0Trump agree on at least one thing: Pennsylvania is one of the most important states on the electoral map in 2020. Analysts place it in the top three states to watch, along with Wisconsin and Michigan. Together, these states gave Trump a Rust Belt victory in 2016, thanks to a high turnout of blue collar workers. Pennsylvania hadn't backed a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988, but a wave of first-time, rural voters helped Trump change the reliably blue state to red for a victory over the favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. More:Here's where Pennsylvania, a swing state in the 2020 election, stands on Trump \"Trump won in 2016 because he flipped Michigan, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Wisconsin, all of which Barack Obama carried in the previous election. If 2020 is a repeat of 2016 in the 47 states besides Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, these three would determine the winner,\" said Seth Moskowitz, a political analyst and columnist for the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Other competitive states include Iowa, Main, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Ohio, he said. Moskowitz\u00a0is founder of EverySecondYear.com, a blog that focuses on U.S. House races. He pointed out a potential drawback of having so much attention on the commonwealth. \"A presidential campaign focused on Pennsylvania and a handful of other states might work in the electoral college, but it could hurt a candidate's party in down-ballot Senate and House races,\" he said. One of the top House battlegrounds in the country is in south-central Pennsylvania, where state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, a Democrat, is running to unseat Republican Scott Perry, an early Trump supporter who narrowly defeated Democratic challenger George Scott in 2018. There are no U.S. Senate races in Pennsylvania in 2020, but competitive House races and the presidential election will make the state a frequent stop for candidates. \"Pennsylvania is going to be critical in the next presidential election,\" said Kyle Kopko, a political scientist and professor at Elizabethtown College. \"It's one of the key states.\" Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states considered to be a tossup in 2020, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Along with Arizona and Wisconsin, it's voting patterns can't easily be categorized as \"likely Democrat\" or \"likely Republican.\" New York and California, on the other hand, are almost certain to vote overwhelmingly for a Democrat, while Oklahoma and Alabama are fully expected to vote overwhelmingly for a Republican. Analysts focus less on the red and blue states and more on the so-called purple states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Ohio and Florida, which could elect a Democrat or Republican. Can Trump win Pennsylvania again? \"That depends,\" said Terry Madonna, a veteran pollster and political analyst at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. \"We have to see how the impeachment will go, and we won't really know until we know who the Democratic nominee is.\" Trump would much rather run against a progressive, such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, who are viewed as too far left by the president's supporters, Madonna said. He doesn't want to run against Joe Biden, who has an everyman appeal. \"You can disagree with Joe Biden, but you can't dislike him,\" Madonna said. Before he\u00a0served as\u00a0vice president to President Barack Obama, Biden spent decades as a U.S. senator. Though he represented Delaware, he was constantly covered by Philadelphia media and broadcast throughout the highest population center in Pennsylvania. The story of a widower taking the train home from Washington, D.C., every night to be with his children, who had recently lost their mother, pulled at heart strings. One of Biden's biggest fans often sat\u00a0across the aisle from him in the U.S. Senate and\u00a0 next to him on the train. Sen. Arlen Specter, who represented Pennsylvania for 30 years and died in 2012, became friends with Biden during their Amtrak rides back and forth to the beltway. \"Arlen Specter used to drive Pennsylvania Republicans crazy because he called Biden Pennsylvania's third senator,\" Madonna said. As Biden campaigned with Obama, he reminded the electorate that he was born and raised in Scranton until he was about 10 years old. \"Biden is a popular Democrat and the most known Democratic nominee, and he served as vice president with the most popular Democrat,\" Madonna said. But Biden has struggled to maintain a lead among the crowded field of 17 Democratic candidates who are still in the race. Eight other Democrats have dropped out. \"The Democratic nomination process is a mess,\" Madonna said. \"I have no clue who the nominee will be. Right now, the Democratic race is a two-person contest between Biden and (Sen. Elizabeth) Warren.\" Biden being a Pennsylvania native might not help him much, especially among Trump supporters who have not wavered. The impeachment inquiry has already been more detrimental to Biden's campaign than Trump's presidency. Trump's approval rating dropped one percentage point in the Real Clear Politics average, while Warren took a lead over Biden. As of Thursday\u00a0morning, Biden had regained a five-point lead over Warren. If Biden is the nominee, Democrats hope his \"average Joe\" charm could defeat Trump in the Rust Belt areas. In the last days of Clinton's campaign, she tapped Biden to campaign for her in the heart of his home state. During a stop at a Harrisburg school administration building, Biden said the 2016 presidency would be decided in \"areas like this.\" He was right. Though Trump lost Pennsylvania cities, he won the state because of rural voters and\u00a0small towns, such as the ones that dot south-central Pennsylvania. When he dropped out of the 2008 primary, Biden joined a list of Pennsylvanians who failed in their bids for the White House, such as Specter (R), Milton Shapp (D), William Scranton (R) and Rick Santorum (R). Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, a Union general who led the Battle of Gettysburg, came close in 1880, but ultimately lost to Republican James Garfield. Hancock ultimately went on to become president of the National Rifle Association. More:U.S. presidents like to visit York County More:Who were York County's most influential citizens? The only Pennsylvanian elected president was James Buchanan, who is often regarded by historians as the worst president in U.S. history and presided over the country's spiral into the Civil War. When Trump was elected, some pundits compared the tone of the country to that during the Civil War\u00a0\u2014 the division, not the bloodshed. The battle was an intellectual one between rural and urban voters. \"People ask why politicians in D.C. are so deeply divided. It's because the voters who send them there are deeply divided,\" Madonna said. Moderates are losing elections in this environment, which bodes well for progressives such as Warren and Sanders, but not for Biden. Trump defeated moderate Republicans in the 2016 primary. Liberal Democrats defeated moderate Republicans in\u00a0House races in the 2018 midterms. To win Pennsylvania in 2020, a candidate will need to win the cities and their suburbs, and have a high turnout of their voting base. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 because he had a high turnout, won Erie, almost won Scranton, captured southwestern counties around Pittsburgh, and won 57 of 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Madonna predicts Trump will get impeached in the House, but not convicted in the Senate, which means he would serve out his term. He could potentially be impeached and re-elected. Also, no president has been re-elected with a job approval rating less than 48 percent. Trump's job approval rating was 42 percent as of Tuesday morning, according to Real Clear Politics.\u00a0Trump's job performance on the economy is 49.5 percent. \"No president has been re-elected like that,\" Madonna said. Kopko agrees the economy is key in the election. \"If there's a recession, it's a likely sign Trump will lose,\" he said But the analysts are also watching another important number. Trump's approval rating among Republicans. Some 68 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans gave him a favorable rating in the latest Franklin & Marshall College Poll released Thursday. \"His supporters are still with him,\" Madonna said. \"The question is, will they have the enthusiasm and turnout like they did in 2016.\"",

      "content": "In a statement released through his attorney Sunday morning, Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, said he would resign from the board of a Chinese company and pledged not to serve on boards of foreign companies if Joe Biden were elected president. Hunter Biden had received criticism from President Donald Trump and Republicans for his work on foreign boards as House Democrats escalated an impeachment inquiry into Trump for pressuring the Ukrainian government into opening an investigation into Hunter Biden. Trump has also said China should investigate Hunter Biden, though the Chinese government has said publicly that it would not. USA TODAY has spoken to two dozen leaders and investigators in Ukraine who say\u00a0 Trump's accusations against Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine are baseless. George Mesires, Hunter Biden's attorney, wrote in a statement posted on\u00a0Medium that Hunter Biden had decided to\u00a0resign his seat on the board of the Chinese investment firm BHR. Mesires said Biden had not received any compensation for being on the board, nor did he receive any equity in it while Joe Biden was vice president. \"To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors,\" Mesires wrote. \"He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR\u2019s investments.\" Mesires said Hunter Biden was going to resign from the BHR board by Oct. 31. More:Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust According to Mesires, \"Hunter undertook these business activities independently,\" never discussed them with Joe Biden, and \"When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith.\" Hunter Biden \"never anticipated the barrage of false charges\" from Trump, Mesires wrote. If Joe Biden were elected president in 2020, Hunter Biden pledged \"not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies\" and comply with all ethics and guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\u00a0Mesires concluded. Joe Biden has defended his son on the campaign trail and has said Hunter Biden would serve a visible role on his 2020 campaign. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an Oct. 3 interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.",

      "content": "From\u00a0Delaware \u2014 home state of former Vice President and Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden \u2014 north to New Jersey\u00a0and\u00a0the suburbs of New York\u00a0and on to Vermont and New England, Democrats can count on heavy support in the 2020 election.\u00a0And yet, as veteran USA TODAY NETWORK columnist Mike Kelly and visual journalist Chris\u00a0Pedota\u00a0found, resilient\u00a0pockets of Trump supporters persist\u00a0amid this Democratic landscape. This is the\u00a0first installment in a five-part\u00a0series,\"Red\u00a0Islands in the Blue Sea.\u201d MAGNOLIA, Delaware \u2014 If President Donald Trump is looking for allies to help him beat an impeachment effort, he should come to the flatlands of America's second-smallest state and the home of the candidate who may be challenging him in next fall's election, Joe Biden. Beyond the highway that runs by\u00a0\u201cGod\u2019s Thrift Shop,\u201d beyond\u00a0the steel bleachers of a NASCAR\u00a0raceway, beyond a bar that advertises \u201ccold beer and hot women\u201d and beyond a strip mall that is home to a nail salon, a martial arts studio and a liquor store, Trump can find Dietmar Panzig. Panzig, 75, a retired mortgage banker and son of a World War II German army captain, rarely leaves\u00a0his house in a retirement community on a former peach farm\u00a0without a T-shirt and baseball cap that proclaim\u00a0his unabashed\u00a0loyalty to Trump. At home, he routinely raises a flag promoting Trump\u2019s reelection even when neighbors, he says, call him a \"disgrace.\" Not surprisingly, Panzig, who moved to Delaware\u00a0in 2008 from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, to save on property taxes, thinks little of efforts to impeach Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about impeachment since 2016,\u201d said Panzig, who also lived in Manville, New Jersey, about 30 miles west of Staten Island,\u00a0where he served on the Borough Council. \u201cThey don\u2019t want him in there for any reason at all.\u201d \u201cThey,\u201d said Panzig, not trying to hold back his disdain, are Democrats.\u00a0And\u00a0Delaware, with its\u00a0967,000 residents, is often viewed, for good reason, as a Democratic bastion. It is, after all, the longtime political power base of Biden, who has been a dominant figure in Delaware politics for nearly half a century. Indeed, many Democrats and Republicans here agree that Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for four decades before serving as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years, is beloved in even the most conservative hamlets of the state. What's more, every statewide\u00a0officeholder \u2014 from the governor to the attorney general, the insurance commissioner, Delaware's two U.S. senators and its single member of the House of Representatives \u2014 is a Democrat. In presidential voting, Delaware has\u00a0sided with Democratic candidates for nearly 30 years \u2014 and especially in 2016, when Hillary Clinton scored an 11-point victory over Trump. But often overlooked are Delaware\u2019s hardy Republicans. Like\u00a0Panzig, a former Marine\u00a0with thick forearms and a barrel chest who served in Vietnam and now sports a bushy white beard, they are a minority.\u00a0But they are far from\u00a0quiet. Two of Delaware\u2019s three counties supported Trump in 2016. Clinton won Delaware\u2019s three electoral votes by scoring a 30-point victory in New Castle County, where nearly 60 percent of the state\u2019s residents reside. In Kent County, with its growing population of retirees and military veterans who live near Dover Air Force Base,\u00a0Trump secured a five-point victory.\u00a0In rural\u00a0Sussex County, home to sprawling\u00a0farms, poultry slaughterhouses and Delaware's conservative base, Trump won by nearly 22 points. Now, with the 2020 election approaching and with Trump facing impeachment \u2014\u00a0in part,\u00a0over allegations he held up military aid\u00a0to pressure\u00a0Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky to investigate a Ukrainian gas firm that employed Biden's son, Hunter \u2014\u00a0Delaware Republicans like Panzig are making a fresh\u00a0effort to rally behind the president. Panzig feels that he has little in common with many of the Democratic voters \u2014 and strident Trump critics \u2014 only a short drive away in the nexus\u00a0of Biden's power base in New Castle County. \"I want the Norman Rockwell America\u00a0back,\" said Panzig, who was born in the final months of World War II in a section of Poland that was German East Prussia. He immigrated with his parents to America in 1951. \"I think Donald Trump can do that, financially, socially and religiously.\" MAP BELOW: 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE Click on a district to see the voting breakdown. On a recent evening, when bulbous, gray-black storm clouds blew across Delaware's farms from the Atlantic and let loose a 15-minute torrent of pelting rain, Panzig, wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d Trump baseball cap, joined nearly 90 Republicans in a back room at Grotto\u00a0Pizza on a highway named after the state's onetime chemical giant: DuPont. The group\u2019s goals that night were simple \u2014 raise enough money to pay the rent on the Kent County Republican headquarters, a one-story bungalow just a few miles away on\u00a0South DuPont Highway, and encourage more Republicans to run against Democrats in upcoming state legislative races. Paying the rent was easy.\u00a0Hank McCann, a former two-star general in the Delaware National Guard and now chairman of the Kent County Republicans, already had half the $800 monthly rent from an anonymous donor.\u00a0After he passed a basket around the room, he had $570\u00a0more. Convincing Republicans to run for office was another story. \u201cCandidates.\u00a0I need candidates,\u201d McCann exhorted the group. Standing against the back wall, Terry Dunn, a nurse, smiled and clapped. Dunn said she grew up in a family of Democrats. But she soon tired of their refusal to support a crackdown on illegal immigration and their promises of free health care \u2014\u00a0what many Delaware Republicans disdainfully refer to as \"socialism.\" \u201cI\u2019m a super Trump fan,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing in business. He\u2019s fighting for our country.\u00a0He\u2019s not apologizing for our country like Obama did.\u201d But as McCann\u00a0gave a pep talk in one end of the room, Dunn\u00a0stood in the back, speaking in hushed tones of being afraid of reprisals for being a Trump supporter in a Democratic state. \u201cI would fear putting a Trump flag outside my house,\u201d she said. Pointing to a man sitting at a table who wore a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d Trump hat and a red \u201cTrump in 2020\u201d football jersey, Dunn added: \u201cYou have to fear walking around with that.\" The man in the football jersey, John Gregg, 67, a retired postal clerk, has no such fears \u2014 certainly not the kind that would cause him to leave his Trump hat and jersey\u00a0in the\u00a0closet. \u201cWe need a strong leader like Donald Trump,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cHe stands up for what he believes in.\u201d From his early childhood in the Bergen County, New Jersey, suburb of Ridgewood, Gregg discovered that politics was hardly a genteel sport. Gregg\u2019s father, Charles, a liberal Democrat and vocal critic of America\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War, was trounced by 25 percentage points in the 1968 congressional elections when he challenged then-incumbent Republican Rep. William Widnall for a House seat. In John Gregg\u2019s home, just outside of Dover, he still keeps a framed\u00a0pamphlet with his father\u2019s progressive platform\u00a0on a wall of his den. In an adjoining room, framed photos of President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, flank a crucifix above Gregg\u2019s bed. Gregg, who voted for George McGovern in 1972\u00a0and later worked as a volunteer for Bill Clinton's campaigns in the 1990s, left his Democratic roots for Trump in 2016. Now, as Trump battles an\u00a0impeachment inquiry, Gregg feels enduring loyalty\u00a0to the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything there to have him impeached,\u201d Gregg said from his den a few weeks after the Republican meeting. \u201cI believed in Trump. Every time he spoke about the issues, he was strong.\u00a0He wanted to make America great again.\u201d Such firm support for the embattled Trump seems almost strange when compared with the daily criticism of the president on cable news and from Democrats. But it\u2019s not odd among Trump supporters \u2014 even in decidedly Democratic Delaware. As Congress moves forward with a formal impeachment inquiry, a variety of polls show Americans are still deeply divided on whether Trump should be removed from office. A Washington Post/ABC poll released Nov. 1\u00a0found that 49 percent of Americans favored Trump's impeachment and removal from office while 47 percent opposed such a drastic move.\u00a0The same poll found that 82 percent of Democrats wanted Trump ousted, but 82 percent of Republicans wanted him to stay put. \u201cI think impeachment is atrocious,\u201d said David Anderson, 50, a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force reserve and a Dover councilman. \u201cThe Democrats are so desperate to get President Trump that they are undermining not only the presidency, but basic rules of evidence.\u201d Anderson, who is black, considers himself at the forefront of what he believes to be a surge in support for Trump among African Americans. The reason for what Anderson says will be an increase in black voters for Trump\u00a0is simple: He insists that African Americans are doing better economically, even though statistics offer a mixed portrait. African American\u00a0unemployment has dropped to around 6 percent, down from nearly 17 percent in 2010 at the peak of the economic recession. The poverty rate has also fallen. But the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau reports that median income for African Americans, after gains in 2015 and 2016, experienced a slight drop in 2017, the last year figures were available. Nonetheless, Anderson feels that more black voters will side with Trump in 2020.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he got 20 percent of the African American vote nationwide,\u201d Anderson said. A recently released Hill-HarrisX poll\u00a0found that 85 percent of African Americans would support any Democrat over Trump\u00a0\u2014 with a large number siding with Biden. Anderson, who served in the Delaware National Guard with Biden\u2019s son, Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, says it\u2019s not difficult to understand why the former vice president is still popular among African Americans and other traditional Democrats. The key to Biden\u2019s political success, Anderson says, can be found in Delaware\u2019s unique brand of politics that forces Democrats to gently support some progressive issues while also tilting to more moderate view on others. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful guy,\u201d Anderson said of Biden. \u201cPersonally I like him. Ideologically I disagree with him.\u201d Lee Murphy, a retired Amtrak engineer and conductor, considers Joe Biden to be a friend. Murphy came to know Biden when the former senator rode Amtrak trains regularly from his home in Wilmington to Washington. But Murphy, 68, a Republican, is now running for Congress himself. \"I\u2019ve known Joe for 35 years,\" Murphy said of Biden. \"I call him a friend, but, politically, I could never vote for him.\" That mix of personal and political is what some experts say is part of the \u201cDelaware Way,\"\u00a0especially in trying to appeal to progressive voters in northern\u00a0Delaware communities around Wilmington while also drawing in moderates and conservatives in the southern portions of the state. \u201cThings are handled in an almost Southern gentlemanly way,\u201d said Nancy Karibjanian, a former TV and radio journalist who now runs the University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a state where party lines get really blurred when they like the politician,\u201d Karibjanian said. \u201cThat would be how Joe Biden was elected so many times.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a small world in Delaware politically,\u201d said M. Jane Brady, a former judge and attorney general who now serves as state Republican chairwoman. Brady challenged Biden in the 1990 Senate race \u2014 and lost \u2014 in a hard-fought campaign.\u00a0But four years later, when Brady was elected state attorney general, Biden invited her to lunch, in part to smooth over their differences. And in 2002, she said, Biden made a point of supporting Brady to become a state judge. Biden seemed to have other reasons for encouraging the increasingly popular Brady to leave her attorney general position to become a judge.\u00a0Biden\u2019s son, Beau, wanted to run for attorney general. \u201cThat\u2019s Delaware,\u201d said Brady. \u201cThat\u2019s how politics used to be.\u201d Whether that style will change in the age of Trump \u2014 and among Trump supporters in Delaware \u2014 remains to be seen. Robin Hayes, 53, a nutrition counselor who is running for a House seat in the state Legislature, finds that Delaware mirrors the rest of the nation in how voters feel about Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s city folk versus country folk,\u201d Hayes said. The urbane, progressive \u201ccity folk,\u201d she explains, find Trump uncouth, embarrassing and corrupt. But \u201ccountry folk,\u201d whom Hayes considers more grounded in conservative values, find Trump to be a breath of political fresh air. \u201cWhat I find fascinating about Trump is you kind of know where he stands,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not always comfortable\u00a0with how he goes about communicating. He\u2019s kind of like a mean dog with a bone. When you have the problems this country has, that\u2019s what you need.\u201d Rob Arlett, a former U.S. Navy officer who ran Trump\u2019s campaign in Delaware in 2016, said he is \u201cnot overly concerned with Trump\u2019s personality\u201d and the controversies from the president\u2019s Twitter messages and other off-the-cuff statements. \u201cYou may not like his personality, but let\u2019s focus on his policy,\u201d Arlett said, citing Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigration and the improving economy.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s where we make headway.\u201d The question now, as Arlett and other Republicans concede, is how he will weather the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. On a recent morning at his office at the Kent County Republican headquarters, Hank McCann settled into his desk, on which a small bust of Abraham Lincoln sat next to a photograph of Trump. The news of that morning predicted that Trump would likely be impeached by the Democratically controlled House of Representatives but probably acquitted and kept in office by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. McCann chuckled as he thought about the prospect of impeaching Trump. He handed a treat to Lucy,\u00a0a yellow Labrador retriever who sat by his feet, then reached for the photo of Trump. \u201cIf they do impeach him,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019ll be the shortest trial in history.\u201d Mike Kelly is a columnist for the USA TODAY NETWORK.

Each of those Democratic candidates\u00a0performed\u00a0well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and\u00a0all of them expanded\u00a0those leads in this week's survey. Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is\u00a0not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances. Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that \"the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020\" won't start coming out until after the holiday season. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment \"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states,\" Johnson said. \"But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points.\" MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there\u00a0\"literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national\u00a0more than a year out from the election.\" \"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident,\" he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College. A recent poll\u00a0from\u00a0The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading\u00a0Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona. More:Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds According to the Post-ABC poll,\u00a0most Americans share\u00a0negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say\u00a0they don't think the president is\u00a0\"honest and trustworthy,\" 62% say\u00a0he lacks\u00a0presidential\u00a0temperament, 60% say\u00a0he does\u00a0not understand their problems, 55% say\u00a0he is not good at making political deals and 54% say\u00a0he is\u00a0not a strong leader. Fifty-four percent say the United States is\u00a0less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses\u00a0the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable. Forty-nine percent favor\u00a0impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill\u00a0Clinton's impeachment at 27% to\u00a041% in 1998. Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U.S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did\u00a0something wrong\u00a0\u2013 though 8% say they don't\u00a0think it was a serious matter. Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want\u00a0to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and\u00a030% say\u00a0they would prefer someone else. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and\u00a0Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When asked who has\u00a0the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say\u00a0Biden, 17% say\u00a0Warren and 16% say\u00a0Sanders.

      "content": "DAVENPORT, Ia. \u2014 Achinteya Jayaram is doing everything he can to elect Joe Biden president\u00a0\u2014 everything short of\u00a0caucusing. The 13-year-old from Bettendorf knocks on doors and makes phone calls to potential caucusgoers urging them to support the former vice president in February. But he's too young to participate in the process himself. \"I feel like that Mr. Biden has the most experience being the vice president for Mr. (Barack) Obama,\" he said. But few young Iowans share his enthusiasm for Biden. In September, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found Biden's support at 9%\u00a0among likely caucusgoers ages 35 and under. That's worse than rivals like U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has 27% support among the age group, and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has 22%. Biden's support from that age group is tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 37-year-old who is running a campaign based on generational change. When taking into account all those under 35 who are considering supporting Biden in some way, his support falls to sixth among the candidates. Other polls have found similar results. A polling average published by The Economist shows Biden takes an average of 12% support from voters under 30,\u00a0third behind Sanders and Warren.\u00a0Sanders is 78, Biden is 76 and Warren is 70. While Iowa caucus crowds skew older in general, the audiences Biden attracts are noticeably more gray-haired. He\u00a0often points out old friends in the crowd\u00a0at events, including supporters of his 2008 and 1988 runs for president. Biden campaign officials say\u00a0they'd like to improve Biden's\u00a0standing among younger voters. \"We want to increase our vote share there, with full acknowledgment that there are a lot of candidates that are attracting a lot of attention. And so no one\u2019s going to win that vote,\"\u00a0Greg Schultz, Biden's national campaign manager, told the Register earlier this month. \"We would love to be gaining some points from where we are, and we think we can.\" Campaign officials see climate change and gun control as areas where Biden has a long history of action on issues that are motivating for young people. \"When you look at the younger voters, one of the top issues \u2014 climate\u2019s big, but almost even with more passion\u00a0is guns,\" Schultz said. Part of the campaign's strategy with younger voters\u00a0will be to lean into Biden's leadership on those issues, like emphasizing his record of championing the passage of an assault weapons ban in the 1990s. \"He\u2019s taken on the NRA and won,\" said Jesse Harris, a senior adviser with Biden's Iowa campaign. On climate,\u00a0Biden's campaign has emphasized his long record going back to when he introduced the Global Climate Protection Act in the Senate in 1986. He has introduced a climate plan that sets a goal of net-zero U.S. emissions by 2050 at the latest, but some activist groups say his climate plan does not go far enough to address the issue. Kit Iyer, a senior at Linn Mar High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and an activist with the Sunrise Movement, asked Biden at\u00a0a climate-focused town hall in Cedar Rapids in September\u00a0how young climate activists like herself have affected his campaign. \"Well I hope I\u2019ve affected young climate activists over the years. And they\u2019ve affected my campaign because so many have joined it,\" Biden said. He continued with a winding answer that included the story of his own political awakening in the 1960s and ended by saying that Trump's election has mobilized young people to get involved in politics. Iyer, who is undecided in the presidential race,\u00a0said afterward that she appreciated Biden's answer to her question. \"Sunrise Movement is very encouraging,\" she said. \"I\u2019m glad that he is also that way and that he wants the youth to be active.\" Iowa campaign officials for Biden said the campaign is organizing on every college campus in the state\u00a0\u2014 regent\u00a0universities, community colleges and private schools\u00a0\u2014 with a structure akin to a precinct operation with a student volunteer acting as a sort of organizer on and around campus. But they're talking to young people in other places, as well. \"There\u2019s a lot of young people in rural parts of this state, in the blue-collar parts of this state and so on and so forth that have nothing to do with colleges and we\u2019re talking to all those people,\" said Jake Braun, Biden's Iowa state director. Campaign officials like Harris also expect Biden to perform strongly with other groups, like\u00a0veterans, Catholics, organized labor, African Americans, Hispanics and older Iowans. The September Iowa Poll found 29% of Iowans 55 and older support Biden, a 12-point lead over Warren. He also leads among rural voters, with 29%, and with those who describe themselves as \"moderate,\" with 31%, more than 20 percentage points ahead of Warren, who has 10% support from that group. Biden also leads voters ages 45-64 in The Economist polling average with 28% and has a stronger advantage with voters 65 and over, taking 39%. On Iowa campuses, Biden's campaign is powered by people like Addie Cosgrove, a 19-year-old freshman at Drake University in Des Moines who joined the campaign as a fellow in June and recently started a \"Bulldogs for Biden\" student group. She said she's known since the 2016 election that she wanted to work for Biden's campaign. \"I was waiting for Joe,\" she said. \"I wanted to work for him.\" She was inspired after reading\u00a0his\u00a0book, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" about his son Beau's death from brain cancer in 2015. Cosgrove said her father died of cancer when she was 4. Braun said the Biden campaign also benefits from their candidate's\u00a0high name identification\u00a0\u2014 and not just from his time as vice president. Braun said the years of parody articles about Biden published in The Onion, a satirical news site, and memes depicting Biden and Obama as a dynamic duo have also raised his profile with young people who otherwise wouldn't know him. \"So, oddly enough, who knew that we\u2019d be able to thank The Onion,\" he said.

The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan. Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the\u00a0Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election. The Times said the results of the poll \"suggest that the president\u2019s\u00a0advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole\u00a0remains intact or has even grown\u00a0since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could \u2013 for the third time in the past six elections \u2013 win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\" And The Times\u00a0said the results showed \"little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward\u00a0winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016.\" Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42%\u00a0\u2013 his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018\u00a0\u2013 and his disapproval at 57%. And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%.

      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vaulted to a 7-point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary race, according to a poll from Quinnipiac University released\u00a0Thursday. When asked whom they would vote for if the primary election were today, 28% of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democrat named the senator from Massachusetts, compared with 21% who selected Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was third at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg finished fourth at 10%. It was the fourth consecutive Quinnipiac poll in which Warren came out ahead of Biden. Before September, Biden consistently led Warren in Quinnipiac's surveys, usually by more than 10 percentage points. But the poll appears to be an outlier compared with other recent surveys on the race. Warren surged in late September and early October to drop Biden from the lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average for the first time since the race began. Since then, however, Biden has roared back, coming out\u00a0ahead in every major national poll released after\u00a0Oct. 15 except for Thursday's\u00a0from Quinnipiac. One poll from CNN on Wednesday\u00a0had the former vice president leading Warren by 15 percentage points. Warren:Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan When asked who had the best policy ideas, Warren was the pick of 30% of likely Democratic voters, compared with Sanders at 20% and Biden at 15%, according to the Quinnipiac poll. But 28% felt Biden would make the best leader\u00a0\u2013 24% said Warren and 13% said Sanders\u00a0\u2013 and he continued to lead in the all-important question of who is most likely to beat President Donald Trump. Democratic voters have made it clear that the ability to defeat Trump is one of the most important factors in their 2020 primary decision. Biden has consistently been seen as the best positioned to unseat the president, but the percentage of Democratic voters saying that has slipped from a high of 56% in April to 42% now. The share of voters saying Warren is the one to beat Trump has\u00a0gone from 3% in April to 20%. There's a new front-runner in town:Elizabeth Warren. Just ask her Democratic rivals Warren came under fire from her rivals this month at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, getting hit particularly hard on the question of how she would pay for her health care plan. But 26% said she did the best job at the debate, compared with 17% who said Buttigieg was the winner, 12% who said it was Biden and 11% who said Sanders. When asked who performed worst at the debate, Biden was the top pick at 15%. Eleven percent said\u00a0Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, performed the worst. \"Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden, who saw his numbers slip to where they were in early July following the first Democratic debate. Then, like now, he ranked among candidates doing the worst job in the debate. Later in July, his numbers rebounded. The question remains whether this is a blip or a trend,\" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow.",

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was denied Holy Communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina on Sunday morning because of his views on abortion, a priest said in a statement. The Rev. Robert Morey said Monday that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0attended Mass at Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Florence and was refused the sacrament because any \"public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\" \"Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to Former Vice President Joe Biden,\" Morey said. \"Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\" Morey added that as \"a priest, it is my responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to my care, and I must do so even in the most difficult situations. I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers.\" When asked about the incident Tuesday during an interview on MSNBC, Biden declined to comment, saying it was his \"personal life.\" \"I'm a practising Catholic, I practice my faith,\" Biden said, adding that he does not \"impose\" his belief on others. At Catholic Masses, Communion is when congregants eat bread and drink wine, which Catholics believe become the\u00a0body and blood of Jesus Christ. Poll:Who's sticking with President Trump, through trouble and tweets? His base The Catholic Church has debated giving Communion to politicians who support abortion rights for decades, and some church leaders have argued that such lawmakers should be excommunicated entirely. In 2004, some bishops threatened to deny Communion to then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee, because of\u00a0his stance on abortion rights. When former President Barack Obama named Biden his running mate in 2008, several bishops, including Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput,\u00a0said they would\u00a0refuse Biden if he sought Communion in their diocese, according to the Catholic News Agency. Biden's stance on abortion has shifted over time. In 1974, during his first term in the Senate, Biden said the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision \"went too far\" and he didn't \"think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.\" \"I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy,\"\u00a0Biden said in a 2006 interview. He added that abortions should be \"rare and safe\" and that the focus should be on limiting the number of abortions performed. In his 2007 book, \"Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics,\" Biden said he had \"stuck to my middle-of-the-road position on abortion for more than thirty years.\" He wrote that he personally opposes abortion, \"but I don't think I have the right to impose my view\u00a0\u2013 on something I accept as a matter of faith\u00a0\u2013 on the rest of society.\" Hero dog:Hero military dog injured in al-Baghdadi raid returns to duty after treatment. Trump praises 'talented dog' This year, Biden has said that Roe v.

      "content": "MAQUOKETA, Ia.\u00a0\u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday referred to his health care plan as \"Medicare for All Who Want It,\" employing the phrase used by Pete Buttigieg, one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden used the phrase while answering a question from\u00a0voter Susan Reighard about high health care costs at a town hall in eastern Iowa. \"My proposal is straightforward. It is Medicare for all who want it and it significantly increases the subsidies to be able to get class A coverage,\" Biden said. He went on to say the plan would limit people's annual co-pays to $1,000 per year, reduce drug prices and allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has been describing his own health care plan as \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" for months. Previously, Biden has often described his health care plan as building on the Affordable Care Act, which he helped pass as vice president. On Wednesday, he also said he wants to \"finish the job\" that the ACA began. There are differences between the Buttigieg and Biden proposals, but both plans essentially would allow Americans a choice of buying into a government-run health care program or keeping private insurance plans. Later in his answer, Biden referred to his plan as \"Medicare, if you want it,\" emphasizing that people would be able to keep private health care if they choose to. Biden also took a swipe at rivals like U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who support \"Medicare for All.\" Warren has faced questions about how she would pay for the program, which would place all Americans on a government-run health care plan, and Biden campaign officials recently criticized Sanders for not saying which taxes he would raise to fund the plan. \"By the way, unlike a lot of people, I tell you how much my plans cost. OK?\" Biden told the crowd. He said his health care plan would cost about $720 billion. Some estimates predict Medicare for All could cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years, although proponents argue Americans would save on costs overall. Reighard, 58, of DeWitt, said she liked Biden's answer to her question and she plans to caucus for him. \"I like the idea of doing the Medicare buy-in for people like me that fall through the gaps, rather than Medicare for All,\" she said. \"I think Medicare for All is going to be a hard sell. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to pass through the Legislature. I just don\u2019t see that happening.\"",

U.S. intelligence has found no evidence of Ukrainian meddling in 2016. Taylor testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that his staffer asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine after the phone call, which came a day after Trump's conversation with Zelensky, which\u00a0is the focus of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0Sondland said,\u00a0\"President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden,\" than U.S. policies on Ukraine, according to Taylor. In a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump denied that he had a phone conversation with Sondland in which he asked the ambassador about whether Ukraine would proceed with investigations. \"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said. \"First time I've\u00a0heard it. ... I don\u2019t recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.\" White House:Trump is not watching impeachment inquiry hearing Taylor delivered an opening statement that largely echoed his closed-door testimony at hearings Oct. 22.

Public impeachment testimony is set to begin.

Taylor said\u00a0CIA Director Gina Haspel was among senior administration officials who tried to persuade Trump to lift the hold on Ukraine's military aid. \"My understanding was that the secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director, and the national security adviser sought a joint meeting with the president to convince him to release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to schedule, and the hold lasted well into September,\" Taylor said. Also Wednesday, House Democrats scheduled two closed-door depositions\u00a0in the impeachment inquiry for Friday and Saturday,including from the Taylor aide who overheard Sondland's call with Trump. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., confirmed after the hearing that the aide is\u00a0David Holmes, counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, who is\u00a0scheduled to appear Nov. 15. \u00a0Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget who failed to show up for a closed-door deposition last week, is scheduled for Nov. 16.

      "content": "WASHINGTON-- Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to President Donald Trump, claimed that many of his efforts since he started his role at the White House have been focused on \"cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.\" Speaking during an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 13 News published by Axios, Kushner was responding to comments Biden made on \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0where he said it was improper for Kushner, and Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, to have senior-level positions in the White House. \u201cLook, he\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but a lot of the work that the president's\u00a0had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind,\u201d Kushner said. \"I think President Trump\u2019s entitled to pick his team, and we\u2019ve worked with him for a long time, and I think we\u2019ve done a good job of trying to help him be successful.\" Kushner continued to slam the Trans-Pacific Partnership that\u00a0Trump withdrew from, and claimed that other reforms enacted by the current administration, \"rolled back a lot of the very harsh laws that were created and partially written by Vice President Biden over 20 years ago, which put a lot of African Americans in prison and really destroyed a generation and did a lot of harm to our country.\" Ivanka and Jared have worked within the Trump administration for some time now and have\u00a0accompanied\u00a0the President on foreign trips where they've\u00a0acted\u00a0as unofficial diplomats. \u201cIf I get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings,\u201d Biden said on \"60 Minutes.\" \u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them. And the idea that you\u2019re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.\u201d Host Norah O\u2019Donnell pressed, \u201cYou don\u2019t think that Jared Kushner should be negotiating a Middle East peace solution?\u201d \"No, I don't,\" Biden answered, laughing.\u00a0\"I don't. What-- what credentials does he bring to that?\" In a response to the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, the White House said, \u201cJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are serving the American people every day, with no salary, helping deliver on the promises President Trump made to the American people.\u201d During the same interview,\u00a0Kusher said Trump's \"record of accomplishments is unimpeachable.\" The President is currently facing an impeachment inquiry\u00a0over whether he withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure them to investigate Biden.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Republican lawmakers stepped up pressure Sunday on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to allow them to call Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, to testify in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. The GOP lawmakers said if the Intelligence Committee's Democrats block the\u00a0committee's minority\u00a0choices of witnesses, it\u00a0would cast further doubt on the fairness of the inquiry's process. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on CBS'\u00a0\"Face the Nation\" that if Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \"prevent the Republicans from calling their own witnesses,\" they would be \"doubling down on stupid.\" Kennedy cautioned\u00a0that if those witnesses are not allowed to testify, \"The American people are going look at this and go, 'I get it.\u00a0They're going to give the president a fair and impartial firing squad.'\" \"If you can't call Hunter Biden and you can't call the whistleblower, that's sort of a sham. That's not really even a trial,\" said\u00a0Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I would love to hear from Hunter Biden,\" said\u00a0Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Hurd, a moderate who has been critical of Trump, said the impeachment inquiry \"has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning\" and that in past impeachment proceedings the minority had been allowed to call its own witnesses. Trump also weighed in, claiming\u00a0that Schiff had declined to call any of the witnesses Republicans had proposed even though Schiff has yet to officially make a decision. \"Corrupt politician Adam Schiff wants people from the White House to testify in his and Pelosi\u2019s disgraceful Witch Hunt, yet he will not allow a White House lawyer, nor will he allow ANY of our requested witnesses,\" the president tweeted. \"This is a first in due process and Congressional history!\" On Saturday, the Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.,\u00a0had submitted a list of witnesses he wished to see called in the inquiry's open hearings, which are scheduled to begin this week. The list included Hunter Biden, two people related to an\u00a0unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine was behind 2016 election interference, and the whistleblower. Nunes told Schiff\u00a0that \"failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.\" In a letter to Nunes later the same day, Schiff told Nunes that the committee was \"carefully evaluating the witness list you provided\" but added that the hearings would not be used to unmask the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the investigation, nor to investigate the Bidens. Schiff said the inquiry \"is a solemn undertaking, enshrined by the Founders in the Constitution\" and that the hearings \"will not serve as vehicles for any Member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.\" And Schiff said the committee \"will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.\" Trump is accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine amid that country's effort to fend off Russian aggression in order to pressure President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating allegations that Biden used his office to block an anti-corruption probe from looking at Burisma Holdings \u2013 which included Hunter Biden on its board. He also wanted Zelensky to look into the idea that Ukraine, not Russia, was the foreign power that tried to interfere in the 2016 election. Impeachment:Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said? More:Trump says he 'probably' will release summary of second call with Zelensky on Tuesday Both investigations could have helped\u00a0the president politically. Biden is a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary and Trump has often resisted the U.S. intelligence community's firm conclusion that Russia tried to sway the election in his favor. An unsubstantiated theory has circulated on right-wing websites that Russia was framed by the Democratic National Committee and that Ukraine was the true culprit. But Trump's own former\u00a0homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert has said the latter idea is\u00a0\"a conspiracy theory\" that has been \"completely debunked.\" And officials in the U.S. and Ukraine said they have found no indication of wrongdoing by the Bidens, though some have questioned the propriety of Hunter Biden's position with Burisma given his father's role in pushing Ukraine to take on corruption. On Sunday, Hurd said he would like Hunter Biden and other Burisma officials to testify about \"how someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine, nor experience in a natural gas company\" comes to \"sit on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.\" Democrats said Hunter Biden's testimony would not be pertinent to the inquiry. Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y.,\u00a0said he did not see what information Hunter Biden, \"a private citizen who has broken no laws by sitting on a board of directors, would have about the president's withholding\u00a0of military aid to Ukraine.\" \"There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearing,\" he said. \"We want to stay focused on the Ukraine call. And having Hunter Biden come in is unrelated to the Ukraine call,\" Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., said on ABC's \"This Week.\" Trump encouraged Zelensky to conduct the investigations during\u00a0a July 25 phone conversation. Though the president has claimed the call\u00a0was \"perfect,\" it raised alarm among some officials who overheard it. They shared their concerns with the whistleblower who filed the complaint that sparked the inquiry. The president and his congressional supporters have insisted that the whistleblower's identity be made public, arguing Trump has a right to confront his accuser. Nunes also said the whistleblower should be identified because of reported \"bias against President Trump\" and that the person should say who \"fed the information\" that \"led to a false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats.\" But whistleblower advocates argue that would discourage other people from coming forward in the future and Democrats say there is no need for the person to testify because the allegations in the complaint have largely been corroborated by other witnesses. While Paul and other Republicans have argued the whistleblower should testify, Hurd said the person's identity should be protected \"because how we treat this whistleblower will impact how we treat whistleblowers in the future.\" But Hurd called on Schiff to testify about his contacts with the whistleblower. Speier said the whistleblower had taken a great risk by coming forward and could not add anything more than the other witness. Schiff made the same arguments in his letter to Nunes. \"It remains the duty of the Intelligence Committee to protect whistleblowers, and until recently, this was a bipartisan priority,\" Schiff said. \"The whistleblower has a right under laws championed by this Committee to remain anonymous and to be protected from harm.\" Schiff said the whistleblower's testimony would be \"redundant and unnecessary\" because the committee has \"gathered an ever-growing body of evidence\u00a0\u2013 from witnesses and documents, including President Trump's own words in his July 25 call record \u2013 that not only confirms but far exceeds, the initial information in the whistleblower's complaint.\"",

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders are the top picks for Latino voters as the Democratic candidate\u00a0to combat President Donald Trump in next year\u2019s presidential elections, according to a new Telemundo poll. Biden, who served as vice president under former President Barack Obama,\u00a0garnered 26% of Democratic Latino voters in the survey, compared to 18% for Sanders, 10% for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 3% for Sen. Kamala Harris and 2% each for Julian Castro, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, according to the poll. O'Rourke dropped out of the race last week. \u201cThis is a phenomenon of name recognition,\u201d said Jeronimo Cortina, associate director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Houston. Biden has been \u201cattached to Obama and he has been in the political limelight for more than two decades.\u201d The survey \u2013 Noticias Telemundo\u2019s \u201cState of the Latino Vote Poll \u2013 One Year Out\u201d \u2013 interviewed 1,000 registered Hispanic voters nationwide over four days in late October. It offered some of the most detailed questions put to Latino voters in the run-up to the 2020 elections. Latino voters are likely to play a key role in that race. Next year's elections will mark the first time that Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13% of eligible voters, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. An estimated 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, higher than the 30 million eligible black voters, according to the Pew analysis. Democratic candidates vying for the presidential\u00a0nomination\u00a0have been courting Hispanic support, from answering questions in Spanish during televised debates to organizing forums with Latino leaders. Latinos represent\u00a0only 3.4% of eligible voters in Iowa, site of the first Democratic caucuses in February, but could play pivotal roles in other states with larger pools of Latino voters, such as Nevada (19%), New Mexico (43%) and Texas (30%). The Trump campaign has also set its sights on Latino voters. In June, Vice President Mike Pence,\u00a0speaking to a Latino crowd in Miami,\u00a0launched the \"Latinos for Trump\" coalition, an effort to woo Hispanic voters. In the Telemundo poll, 64% of respondents said they would like to see Trump replaced as president versus 25% who would prefer he get reelected. That means Trump, despite controversial immigration policies and congressional impeachment hearings, still holds roughly the same Latino support \u2013 28% \u2013 that helped elect him in 2016, according to exit polls. Other findings from the Telemundo poll include: Hispanic voters also showed they were strongly split along party lines for their support for Trump and on different issues, mirroring the political partisan divide evident across the U.S. Among Latino Democrats, 86% said they wanted Trump replaced next year, while 73% of Latino Republicans wanted him reelected. And 87% of Latino Democrats said they disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance as president, compared to 89% of Latino Republicans who approve of his performance. Overall, 57% of those polled supported impeaching the president, though that question also broke sharply down\u00a0political lines, with 79% of Latino Democrats supporting impeachment and 92% of Latino Republicans opposing the measure. \u201cIt points to the diversity of this electorate,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew Research Center. \u201cWhen you think about the Latino vote, it\u2019s not always the same.\u201d Most Latino voters \u2013 70% \u2013 felt that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has encouraged anti-immigrant sentiment, racism or discrimination in the U.S., according to the poll. But only 35% of those polled said they were \u201cvery\u201d worried of becoming the victim of a hate crime, such as the shooting at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart in August, while 25% said they were \u201csomewhat\u201d worried and 27% said they were \u201cnot at all\u201d worried.
