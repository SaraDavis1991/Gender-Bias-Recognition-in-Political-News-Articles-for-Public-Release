      "content": "Jon Voight danced for President Donald Trump at the White House Thursday, before being honored with the National Medal of Arts. As musicians in the East Room played strains of \"Midnight Cowboy,\" Voight, who starred in the Academy award-winning 1969 film, rose from his seat, dancing and sliding across the makeshift stage.\u00a0Trump grinned and clapped, giving a positive shake of the fist as Voight reclaimed his seat. \"Midnight Cowboy,\" a tale of the friendship between a\u00a0Texas dishwasher turned-NYC prostitute\u00a0(Voight) and a hustler (Dustin Hoffman), remains the only X-rated film to win an Academy Award for best picture. Once reviled by conservative critics for its graphic depictions of sex and brutality,\u00a0the movie\u00a0became a critical and box office success, and was\u00a0later reclassified with a\u00a0R rating.\u00a0Voight won best actor for his role. \u201cI love having you here, especially since you are someone I really like,\u201d Trump said, cheering the actor's performances in films from \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d to \u201cThe Champ\u201d \u2013 the latter of which he called one of the best boxing movies in history. The largely lighthearted ceremony, which Melania Trump also attended,\u00a0was held as the impeachment hearings churned on across town. Deadline spotted Voight\u2019s son, James Haven, in attendance, though daughter Angelina Jolie,\u00a0a U.N. special envoy who has passionately advocated for women's equality and refugees worldwide,\u00a0was absent. The \"Ray Donovan\" star\u00a0has been a vocal supporter of President Trump, in August calling him\u00a0\"the greatest president of this century.\" Voight currently\u00a0sits on the\u00a0John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts'\u00a0board of trustees after being\u00a0appointed by Trump\u00a0in March. Voight\u00a0later accompanied Trump to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to pay tribute to the remains of two U.S. service members who were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan this week. Honorees Thursday included musician Alison Krauss,\u00a0novelist James Patterson and musicians of the United States military. Trump described Patterson as \u201canother friend\u201d and joked about his book sales being among the highest of all time. \u201cYou\u2019ve sold a lot more books than me,\u201d Trump said, according to The Hill. \u201cThe\u00a0Bible has you by a little bit.\u201d Thursday's ceremony marked the first time during his nearly three-year-old presidency that Trump has awarded the National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities Medal. Trump has had an uneasy if not hostile relationship with many in the arts and the humanities who have denounced his presidency and his administration's policies. He has been largely shunned by Hollywood and has skipped events like the annual Kennedy Center gala, one of Washington\u2019s premier social gatherings, after some honorees said they would not attend if Trump were part of the ceremony.

      "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 While most people might look a few weeks into the future when scheduling appointments for work,\u00a0Amy Bittner\u00a0has put court dates on her calendar for 2022. The Columbus-based immigration lawyer already knows she\u2019ll have to make the 280-mile round trip to Cleveland to represent a client at a hearing in three years. \u201cThe backlog is a victim of this administration\u2019s priorities. There did not used to be this backlog,\u201d Bittner said. Nationwide, the backlog has almost doubled, from 542,411 pending cases when President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 to just over 1 million as of Sept. 30, according to an\u00a0October report\u00a0by\u00a0TRAC, a\u00a0Syracuse University\u00a0clearinghouse that gathers and analyzes immigration data from government agencies. In Ohio, 12,851 cases are pending in\u00a0Cleveland Immigration Court, the state\u2019s only such court. That is up significantly from 3,295 in 2009. It\u2019s also double the 6,184 in 2016. Hearings are scheduled in the Cleveland court through Dec. 30, 2022. 'Medicare for all is really missing the point':Experts say existing program still needs work Trump administration policies have not helped temper the rise in the country\u2019s immigration court backlog, the TRAC report says. Austin Kocher, a faculty fellow at TRAC,\u00a0said such backlogs result when \u201cthe government focuses concern on immigrants and puts enforcement ahead of due process and civil rights.\u201d \u201cVery little resources actually go to the immigration court system and judges\u201d compared with enforcement efforts, Kocher said. Although the judges in northeastern Ohio stay busy, the backlog at Cleveland\u2019s immigration court isn\u2019t the worst in the country. In areas such as New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, immigrants are waiting an average of 1,450 days, or just under four years, to see a judge. Part of the reason for the backlog, TRAC says, is that then-U.S. Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions\u00a0in\u00a0May 2018 ordered\u00a0the nation\u2019s immigration judges to end their practice of removing cases from their dockets without issuing decisions. That resulted in formerly closed cases being reopened, according to TRAC. \u201cThe decision to reopen previously closed cases has single-handedly exacerbated the immigration court crisis, yet it has not received sufficient attention,\u201d the TRAC report states. \u201cThis single policy decision has caused a much greater increase in the court\u2019s backlog than have all currently pending cases from families and individuals arrested along the southwest border seeking asylum.\u201d Others blamed the delays in part on one of Trump\u2019s earliest\u00a0executive orders, from January 2017, when he made every immigrant who was in the country illegally a priority for deportation. The norm had been to prioritize those who had committed crimes. \u201cIt is a senseless waste of taxpayer money to attempt to remove people who are not criminals and who are well-integrated into our community,\u201d Bittner, the Columbus immigration lawyer, told The Dispatch in an email. She said\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0should close deportation cases involving long-term U.S. residents who are not dangerous. The\u00a0Executive Office for Immigration Review, the\u00a0Department of Justice\u00a0branch that supervises the federal immigration court system, did not respond to requests by The Dispatch for comment. The backlog has grown despite the Trump administration having given the immigration courts \u201cthe greatest amount of resources,\u201d said Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the\u00a0National Association of Immigration Judges, a union. The nation has 442 immigration judges, according to TRAC. Although about 220 judges have been hired in the past three years, about 100 others have left, Tabaddor said. She said that many of those who have left have expressed feeling like the Trump administration doesn\u2019t allow them to do their jobs properly while adding quotas and micromanaging their work. Each judge has about 2,000 cases, according to TRAC. In 2016, when Cleveland\u2019s immigration court had three judges, Bittner went to the court only twice. Now it has six judges, and she goes more than once a month. Hiring more judges hasn\u2019t fixed the backlog, Bittner said. \u201cIt is very frustrating because justice delayed is justice denied, and while foreign nationals wait years for the adjudication of their cases, they are putting down roots here and having families, which makes removal from the United States even crueler if their case is ultimately denied,\u201d Bittner wrote in the email. She said some of her clients are grateful for the wait because they have more time to build a life here. Others, however, are frustrated, Bittner said, because they feel that they are constantly in limbo, and once they\u2019ve built a life, it could all come crashing down when their day in court finally arrives. A few of her clients who had waited years to make their asylum case in the U.S. court left for Canada instead, hoping things would go more smoothly up north. \u201cIt just seems to be getting worse,\u201d Bittner said.

      "content": "San Diego \u2013 It\u2019s like chickens for Colonel Sanders.\u00a0Why would any self-respecting Latino vote to re-elect President Donald Trump, arguably the most anti-Latino chief executive in U.S. history? That\u2019s what my non-Latino friends want to know. I get that question all the time, often accompanied by a tilted head and a confused look. In the 2020 election, Trump seems likely to get between 25%-30% of the Latino vote. A recent poll by Telemundo found that 1 in 4 American Latinos would vote to re-elect him. In 2016, according to exit polls, Trump got 28% of the Latino vote.\u00a0He did better than Sen. Bob Dole, who got 21% of the Latino vote in 1996, and Sen. Mitt Romney, who got 27% in 2012. But he couldn\u2019t match Sen. John McCain, who got 31% of the Latino vote in 2008, or President George W. Bush, who got 40% in 2004. Anything north of 30% is a decent showing for a Republican, and anything beyond 40% will make a GOP candidate virtually unbeatable. Latino voters count for a lot. Three reasons: they\u2019re a young population\u00a0that is adding new voters at a staggering rate; They\u2019re well-represented in so-called battleground states such as Colorado, Nevada\u00a0and Florida; And close to two-thirds of Latinos\u00a0are Mexicans\u00a0or Mexican-Americans, who\u00a0tend to be swing voters. Latinos are now poised to be the largest racial or\u00a0ethnic minority group to be eligible to vote in a presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.\u00a0By 2020, an estimated 32 million Latinos will be eligible to vote, which is just slightly more than the 30 million voters who are African-Americans. According to Pew, Latinos are expected to be about 13.3% of the electorate in 2020. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Latino vote: there is no such thing. That is, Latinos aren\u2019t monolithic and we don\u2019t vote as a bloc. Yet, Trump is likely to do better than expected with Latino voters. It\u2019s not just because of a strong economy, low unemployment rates among Latinos, etc. It\u2019s also because many Latinos are willing to look past Trump\u2019s anti-Latino bigotry. After all, they tell themselves, the president is not talking about people like them. The problem is that, when it comes to Latinos, Trump can\u2019t stop talking trash. Here\u2019s a look at his rant sheet. As a candidate, Trump\u00a0declared that Mexico is\u00a0\u201cnot sending their best\u201d\u00a0but ridding itself of those who are\u00a0\u201cbringing drugs\u2026bringing crime,\u201d\u00a0labeled Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, promised to deport \u201cbad hombres,\u201d praised the 1954\u00a0mass deportation program called \"Operation Wetback,\" promised a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d\u00a0and attacked the integrity of U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel \u2014\u00a0a U.S.-born citizen of Mexican descent \u2014\u00a0by questioning whether Curiel could fairly adjudicate a lawsuit against Trump University because, \u201cHe\u2019s a Mexican.\u201d Dear progressives:Hispanics are not 'Latinx.' Stop trying to Anglicize our Spanish language. As president, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the former lawman was found guilty of racially profiling Latinos and defying court orders, ended Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), \"leaving\"\u00a0more than 700,000 young people\u00a0potentially subject to deportation, targeted birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, embraced policies that would cut\u00a0legal\u00a0immigration in half\u00a0and separated thousands of refugee families to the point where nearly 70,000 immigrant children were held in U.S. custody at some point in the last year. Even as he campaigns for re-election, Trump still can\u2019t seem to refrain from sticking his foot in this mouth when it comes to Latino voters. He talks often about how the United States is facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d from the south.\u00a0That\u2019s the same word that 21-year-old Patrick Crusius used in a racist manifesto\u00a0he penned before walking into a Walmart in El Paso, Texas\u00a0on Aug 3 to, as he allegedly told police,\u00a0\u201ckill as many Mexicans as possible.\u201d\u00a0Crucius killed 22 people, many of them Mexican\u00a0and wounded 25\u00a0others. Several weeks ago, when Trump traveled to New Mexico to court conservative Latinos, he doted on CNN commentator Steve Cortes, a pro-Trump immigrant from Colombia who the president declared \u201clooks more like a WASP than I do.\u201d\u00a0Trump put Cortes on the spot, asking him,\u00a0\u201cWho do you like more,\u00a0the country or the Hispanics?\u201d\u00a0Cortes answered \u201cThe country.\u201d Most of the Latinos who back Trump are not so buffoonish about their support. But they\u2019re no less devoted to their guy. As a Mexican-American Never Trumper, I wanted to understand these people. Besides, as a journalist who is trained to talk to strangers, the idea of Latinos who support Trump sounded plenty strange to me. So, I went out and interviewed a couple dozen Latinos for Trump. What I found is that, in many cases, these folks are not really Latino at all. They\u2019re \u201cpost-Latino.\u201d They see themselves as Americans. They\u2019re ambivalent about their heritage, relatives, ancestors. They don\u2019t take offense when Trump insults Mexican immigrants because \u2014\u00a0even for Mexican-Americans \u2014\u00a0they see the people he\u2019s talking about as another species. It's time to take a stand:After El Paso shooting, Mexican Americans can no longer be ambivalent minority Consider the views of Chris Salcedo, a conservative Mexican-American radio host in Texas who bills himself as a \u201cliberty loving Latino.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always resented the hell out of liberals, in the press and out of the press, who have said that I, because of my Latino surname, have anything in common with someone who is breaking into my country without our permission,\u201d Salcedo told me. \u201cWhen the president cracks down on illegal border crossings and human trafficking, I do not believe he\u2019s attacking me \u2014\u00a0because I also want to stop those same things.\u201d I get it. But I also recognize a familiar song when I hear one. Other ethnic groups know this one by heart. The Irish, Italians and\u00a0Jews\u00a0all have people in their community who don\u2019t identify with their heritage or who think they\u2019re better than others in their tribe, when they\u2019re really just better off. These are the folks who were born on third base\u00a0but tell themselves they hit a triple. Now some Latinos have found their way to Trump. Good for them. But make no mistake. In a larger sense, they\u2019re lost.

The call is a key aspect in the whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine for political benefit.

But Democrats say it demonstrates\u00a0that Trump wanted a \"favor\" in the form of investigations in exchange for military assistance.

      "author": "David Jackson",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo might leave the State Department to run for a Senate seat in Kansas. In an interview on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said Pompeo \u2013 a former House member\u00a0\u2013 might resume his political career if he feels a Republican cannot win a Kansas Senate seat that is open in 2020. \"If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that,\"\u00a0Trump said. While Pompeo \"has done an incredible job\" at the State Department, Trump added that \"Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it's a Trump state. He'd win easily.\" It might be an awkward time for Pompeo to launch an election campaign. Just this week, Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, testified that Pompeo was \"in the loop\" on the campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 president election. More:Trump visits Dover to honor remains of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan Sondland described that as a clear \u201cquid pro quo\u201d and said Pompeo was kept apprised of the effort. \"We kept the leadership of the State Department and the NSC (National Security Council) informed of our activities,\" Sondland said. \"They knew what we were doing and why,\" the EU ambassador said. Pompeo denied wrongdoing. Pompeo listened in on the now-infamous July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has publicly\u00a0defended the conversation as \"wholly appropriate,\" arguing that Trump was pushing to root out corruption in Ukraine. Pompeo sought to block\u00a0some State Department witnesses from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, with little success. He\u00a0has also refused to comply with the House Democrats' subpoena for documents related to the State Department's actions on Ukraine and its dealings with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and a key player in pressuring Ukraine's new government. It\u2019s unclear if the impeachment scandal would hurt Pompeo\u2019s prospects in Kansas, which has been a GOP stronghold but now has a Democratic governor. If Pompeo leaves the administration, it would be a major blow to Trump \u2013 particularly as his presidency is engulfed in an impeachment investigation that prominently features foreign policy. Pompeo is Trump's second secretary of state and succeeded Rex Tillerson in the post. Pompeo has staunchly defended Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine, even as his State Department employees provided damaging testimony. While Pompeo has publicly denied interest in the Kansas Senate race, he has repeatedly returned to the state and nurtured his political connections there. Pompeo,\u00a0who represented Kansas in the House for three terms before joining the Trump administration, is one of the president's longest-serving and most trusted advisers. He joined the Trump administration early, becoming the president's CIA director three days after his inauguration. Pompeo then took the helm at\u00a0the State Department in April of 2018, and he has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders amid a series of foreign policy crises \u2013 from Afghanistan to North Korea to Syria. The\u00a0filing deadline\u00a0for the Senate race is not until June, giving Pompeo time to contemplate a bid. He still has a congressional fundraising account, with nearly $1 million in the bank, according to the most recent\u00a0federal campaign finance\u00a0report.",

      "author": "Bart Jansen",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The House impeachment inquiry begins public hearings Wednesday after weeks of closed-door depositions investigating President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Much of the evidence gathering occurred behind closed doors, as three key committees gathered depositions from State Department and National Security Council officials. But now the entire House \u2013 and the country \u2013 will be able to watch as testimony unfolds. Democrats suggest that Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his rival while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid could warrant impeachment. During a July 25 call, Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of\u00a0Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. But Trump has dismissed the investigation as a partisan \"witch hunt\" and said he was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine. The hearings will educate the American public about what happened in anticipation of a possible House vote on whether to impeach Trump. If the House adopts articles of impeachment, the Senate would hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office. \u201cIn my view, the public hearings have the potential for significant impact,\u201d said John Marston, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Foley Hoag LLP. \u201cIf the case is made clearly and with compelling evidence in the hearings, that can move the needle in the public, and that is what will drive the views of congress. So public hearings have the potential for significant, even determinative, impact as this moves forward.\u201d Movie nights, phone calls:How Trump is uniting the GOP to fight impeachment Two witnesses are scheduled Wednesday.\u00a0Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who told lawmakers about gradually learning about demands for investigations, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition to receive military aid. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of State, raised concerns about Giuliani steering policy privately. The witness Friday is\u00a0Marie Yovanovich, the former ambassador to Ukraine, who explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April. A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair Here are five things to look for in the public hearings: House Republicans have remained unified in defending\u00a0Trump against the Democratic rules for the impeachment inquiry. To this point, Republicans have focused their opposition to how the inquiry was conducted. Three key panels took depositions behind closed doors that other\u00a0lawmakers couldn't attend. Then the House authorized public hearings with the support of just Democrats. Trump said Saturday that there shouldn't be any hearings because there shouldn't be any investigation. He encouraged people to read the summary of his July 25 call with Zelensky rather than listen to witnesses with third-hand knowledge. \"There shouldn\u2019t be anything. There shouldn\u2019t be impeachment hearings, is what I said,\" Trump said. \"This is a witch hunt at the highest level, and it's so bad for our country.\" The approach of hearings focused attention on the president's actions, but some Republicans have said even if Trump's request for investigations was inappropriate, it doesn't merit impeachment. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said it was inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. But Thornberry said the July 25 call sounded like how Trump talks regularly and shouldn't be grounds for impeachment. \"I believe it was inappropriate,\" Thornberry told ABC's\u00a0\"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" on Sunday. \"I do not believe it was impeachable.\" Impeachment inquiry:Read all the transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, also said a president shouldn't urge the investigation of a political rival, but that calls for impeachment were premature. \"I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign \u2013 is not something a president or any official should be doing,\" Hurd, a former CIA officer who serves on the Intelligence Committee,\u00a0said on\u00a0\"Fox News Sunday.\"\u00a0\"I think everybody has \u2013 most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he would look for evidence of the president's motivations if the House sends articles of impeachment for trial in the Senate. \"Here are the two possible scenarios,\" Kennedy said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"No. 1,\u00a0the president asked for an investigation of a political rival. No. 2, the president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The latter would be in the national interest. The former would be in the president's parochial interests and would be over the line.\" The initial witnesses will describe how two channels of diplomacy emerged. Taylor learned gradually from May through September about demands for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and Burisma, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition for Ukraine to receive military aid. Taylor called the trade-off \"crazy.\" Kent raised concerns about Giuliani's private back-channel efforts, testifying that Trump \"wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden,\u00a0and Clinton.\" And Yovanovich explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April. Congressional Republicans asked to hear from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, on the same panel as Taylor and Kent because Volker dealt first-hand with Giuliani and others. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., argued that witnesses such as Taylor and Kent had only indirect knowledge of the arrangements because neither spoke\u00a0directly to Trump or Giuliani. Closed-door testimony:Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said? Volker in his closed-door testimony described Trump's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine. \"And like a lot of business people, I think he just recoiled at the corrupt environment,\" Volker said. The special envoy also said \"no,\" when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election. \"Even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something,\" Volker said. Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Notre Dame, said the hearings will put arguments about serious allegations into a public forum for the American people to decide whether the president's conduct was appropriate. Republicans and Democrats may have made up their minds already, he said. \"But there are independents, many of whom are on the fence and many of whom haven\u2019t made up their minds about the nature of this scheme and whether it was an abuse of power or not,\" Gurule said. \"I think that in the end is the intended audience.\" Much of the closed-door testimony credited Giuliani\u00a0with guiding Ukraine policy to push for investigations. But how much was Trump involved? Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said Trump told him at a May 23 briefing on Ukraine to deal with Giuliani, who \u201cemphasized that the president wanted a public statement from President (Volodymyr) Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues.\u201d Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, asked Sondland in late June who assigned him to oversee Ukraine. \u201cAnd he said, the president,\u201d Hill said. Giuliani also said repeatedly he was working for Trump. Giuliani tweeted Nov. 6 that his investigation was done solely as a defense attorney to protect Trump from false charges. Taylor said during a July 18 conference call that an unidentified Office of Management and Budget staffer said the directive to withhold military aid \u201chad come from the president to the chief of staff to OMB.\u201d Trump and his Republican defenders have insisted that while he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens during the July 25 call, he didn't explicitly mention the trade-off for military aid. \"The fundamental facts have never changed and will never change,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee who joined the Intelligence Committee to participate in the hearings. \"There was no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo.\" . Yovanovitch was a career foreign service officer serving as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine when she was removed abruptly in late April, after months of criticism by Giuliani. Hill called the removal \"a real turning point\" among diplomats recognizing Giuliani's influence because \"there was no basis for her removal\" based on a\u00a0\u00a0\"a mishmash of conspiracy theories\" that had \"no merit whatsoever.\" Republicans have questioned whether Yovanovitch\u00a0collaborated with Democrats, as they have alleged with the whistleblower.\u00a0Zeldin asked during her closed-door deposition about her contacts with the House Foreign Affairs Committee after her recall from Ukraine. Yovanovitch testified that she received two emails from a staffer and referred the person to the State Department. But Zeldin said department emails suggested she had more contacts, saying she apparently \u201cdid not accurately answer this question\u201d under oath. Republicans earlier drew attention to the whistleblower\u2019s intermediary contacting the House Intelligence Committee before filing a complaint about Trump's July 25 call. Trump retweeted Zeldin\u2019s exchange with Yovanovitch, calling it \u201ca terrible lie. How can she do such a thing?\u201d But the committee headed by Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., tweeted in reply to Trump that the panel had \u201calready debunked this ugly smear.\u201d Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee asked Saturday for nine categories of witnesses at the public hearings scheduled to begin Wednesday. Under rules the House adopted for the hearings, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., could reject any of the requests. Republicans could ask for a vote on any rejections, but Democrats control the committee and it\u2019s not clear how many will be allowed or rejected. Republicans requested testimony from the whistleblower, the only witness Schiff rejected outright, and any individuals who helped the person prepare the complaint about the July 25 call. Schiff said the panel wouldn\u2019t help Trump threaten, intimidate or retaliate against the person who filed the complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence about the call. Andrew Bakaj, one of the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, said his client was willing to answer written questions, but not in person out of concern about being identified. Government officials who testified in closed-door depositions are also on the Republican witness list: David Hale, the undersecretary of State for political affairs; Tim Morrison, the National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and Volker. Republicans also requested subpoenas for Hunter Biden\u00a0and Devon Archer, a Biden business partner who was a fellow board member for Burisma, to ask about possible corruption at the\u00a0company. Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party And Republicans sought testimony from two witnesses associated with the 2016 election: Nellie Ohr, a contractor for the research firm Fusion GPS\u00a0that produced the dossier of alleged ties between Trump and the Kremlin, and Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee staffer with alleged connections to Ukrainian efforts to interfere with the election. Schiff replied to Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, that he was reviewing the requests. But Schiff sounded pessimistic in his Saturday reply to Republicans about accepting the Bidens or political operatives as witnesses. \u201cAs we move to open hearings, it is important to underscore that the impeachment inquiry, and the committee, will not serve as vehicles for any member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about the 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit,\u201d Schiff said.",

Trump is facing the prospect of impeachment for allegedly using military aid to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations that stood to benefit him politically. Trump has denied making the aid contingent upon the investigations and has insisted he was only concerned about corruption. When asked which statement best reflected their view of the president's conduct after the first round of open testimony, 70% said \"Trump's actions were wrong.\"\u00a0Fifty-one percent said his acts were wrong and deserved impeachment in the House and conviction\u00a0in the Senate. Thirteen percent said what he did was wrong but not impeachable. And 6% thought his actions were wrong, and that he should be impeached but not removed from office by the Senate. A quarter of the respondents did not think the president had done anything wrong. According to ABC News, 85% of Democrats said Trump should be removed from office, and 65% of Republicans did not think the president had done anything to warrant impeachment. Impeachment Week 9:Alexander Vindman and Gordon Sondland headline three days of public hearings More:Gordon Sondland, who flaunted Trump access, may offer first-hand account of Trump's Ukraine aims Twenty-one percent of those surveyed said they\u00a0formed their opinion on Trump's behavior after last week's hearings, and 27% said they decided how they felt between the time news of the Ukraine allegations broke and the hearings began. Another 19% said they decided when news of the story was first reported. Nearly a third said they had made up their mind about Trump and impeachment even before the first news reports about Ukraine in September. The poll found that 21% of Americans have been following the impeachment inquiry hearings \"very closely,\" and 37% have been following \"somewhat closely.\" But 42% said they were not closely following the testimony. Of those who are watching closely, 60% believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, ABC News said.

      "content": "If the impeachment process gets too hot for President Donald Trump down the line, he could always seek political asylum in Israel. No one would be a more sympathetic host than Israel\u2019s longest-serving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sees in Trump not only a staunch ally, but also a kindred soul. Having just added to his impressive resume the dubious distinction of being the first incumbent PM in Israeli history to be indicted for abusing his power for political and personal gain, Netanyahu would be doubly empathetic to Trump\u2019s legal predicament. Trump has a standing invitation from none other than Yair Netanyahu, the PM's brash son and a favorite on the evangelical lecture circuit. Netanyahu junior, who at 28 can no longer be considered an enfant terrible, lets his fingers do a lot of talking. Much of it is racist, nasty invective directed at, well at anyone who disagrees with his father, which provides him with endless Twitter targets. One of his latest tweets was a photo of Trump with the caption \u201cThat's my president\u201d \u2014 a response to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, who took Yair's\u00a0father to task for calling Israel\u2019s 21% Arab minority an existential threat to the state.\u00a0\u201cThe vast majority of Israelis adore America and adore President Trump. He is a rock star in Israel,\u201d young Netanyahu said earlier this year in an interview on conservative Glenn Beck\u2019s BlazeTV. Indeed, Trump is probably more popular in Israel than Yair\u2019s father, who was recently indicted on charges of bribery. The president has been lavished with\u00a0even more praise\u00a0since last week when his secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, reversed decades of U.S. policy and essentially announced that the United States no longer considers the Jewish settlements in the West Bank as occupied Palestinian territory. No coherent plan:Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo shift on Israeli settlements is U.S. foreign policy at its worst A week before the settlements announcement, Trump told Orthodox Jewish donors in New York that his approval rating was around 98%\u00a0in Israel and joked that \"if anything happens here,\" he could become prime minister there. He wasn't far off. He's certainly more popular in Israel than almost anywhere else\u00a0in the world \u2014 83% approval last year, according to a Pew Center Research survey. Israelis have never seen anything like this president who keeps on giving. First there was his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital (just about the only country in the world to do so despite Israel\u2019s unilateral annexation of the predominantly Palestinian eastern half of the city), then he moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, cut U.S. funding to the Palestinians, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and then ignored international law and the positions of all U.S. allies with this month\u2019s recognition of Israeli settlements. And Israelis were grateful. The suburban Tel Aviv town of Petah Tikva named a city square (with a bizarre looking fountain) after Trump, and Netanyahu named a whole settlement after the 45th President. Well, perhaps not a settlement. Right now it\u2019s only a sign that reads \u201cTrump Heights,\u201d\u00a0located on the disputed Golan Heights that Israel captured from Syria \u2014 but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts. And there are plans afoot to build 110 houses there. If he seeks asylum in Israel, Trump would have plenty of company. Evangelicals, many of whom declare a faith-based affinity for the Jewish state and wield significant political clout in shaping U.S. policy on Israel, flock in droves to the Promised Land to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and dunk themselves in the Jordan River. The U.S.-based Christians United for Israel boasts of 7 million members \u2014 roughly the size of Israel\u2019s Jewish population. Trump would be a major asset to such Holy Land tours, meeting and greeting the faithful and charging hundreds of thousands for each appearance before them. He and the Netanyahu family have much in common. They both love Tucker Carlson (Yair proudly posted a photo of himself with the Fox News anchor earlier this year), they both use the exact same rhetoric to complain repeatedly about \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and \u201cattempted coups\u201d perpetrated against them by nefarious liberal cabals. The Hebrew-accented words \u201cfake news\u201d have entered the Hebrew lexicon and are much beloved by Netanyahu fans, who share a visceral hatred of most media with Trump followers. Buckling under pressure:Does Trump really want to get us out of Syria? Apparently, not so much. No one here would hold Trump\u2019s meanness in granting asylum to citizens of other countries against him, although by its very definition, Israel is the haven of the Jewish people and it has hosted more than one suspected criminal sought by law enforcement authorities in other countries. True, Israel\u2019s Law of Return only grants automatic citizenship to Jews or those of maternal Jewish ancestry\u00a0\u2014 but maybe the law could be amended to provide automatic citizenship for grandparents of Jewish grandchildren.

      "content": "Most Americans understand that, under military law, soldiers must\u00a0disobey an illegal command. It's\u00a0a\u00a0doctrine that demolished Nazi war criminals' claims during the Nuremberg trials that they were just following orders. But what if\u00a0the order is legal, but unethical or even immoral? What is a member of the military\u00a0to do then? For some top Pentagon officials, the question might be more than hypothetical. They apparently resisted President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to protect a Navy SEAL accused of misconduct, and by late Sunday afternoon one of them \u2014 Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer \u2014 was out of a job. This issue came to a head last week, when Trump threatened to issue an order many senior military leaders see as bordering on unethical. The order would have effectively undermined efforts by a Navy leader\u00a0to restore good order and discipline among the vaunted Navy SEALs. A key focus was the conduct of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who had earned a reputation as a rule-breaking \"pirate,\" accused of committing war crimes in Iraq, including the indiscriminate\u00a0firing into a neighborhood with a machine gun and killing a teenage captive with a custom-made knife. OPPOSING VIEW:The president must have the final say When the criminal case against Gallagher fell apart at trial in July, he was convicted only of posing in\u00a0a photograph with the dead teenager and demoted. Right-wing commentators flocked to Gallagher's\u00a0defense, and Trump\u00a0ordered\u00a0Gallagher's rank restored Nov. 15. The same day, Trump\u00a0dismissed a murder charge against a Green Beret accused of killing an Afghan prisoner and pardoned an Army officer serving time in prison for ordering troops to fire on unarmed Afghan men. Pentagon leaders were appropriately\u00a0appalled.\u00a0\"The president's decision ... diminishes American moral authority on the battlefield to our detriment internationally,\" said retired four-star Adm.\u00a0James Stavridis, former NATO supreme commander. In Gallagher's case, Rear Adm. Collin Green, the commander of the SEALs, pressed on. Worried about a \"Gallagher effect\" on troop culture, Green initiated steps to strip the sailor of his SEAL status by revoking the revered Trident pin earned when becoming a member of the unit.\u00a0Equally undeterred, Trump tweeted Thursday that \"the Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident Pin.\" Trump, who seems to equate war crimes with battlefield toughness,\u00a0certainly has the authority to order such a thing as commander in chief of the military. But is it worthy of being obeyed?\u00a0Military ethicists have debated this for years. Marine Corps officer Andrew Milburn wrote in a controversial\u00a02010\u00a0essay that \"faced with a moral dilemma, the military officer not only has grounds for dissent, but also, if his code of ethics and oath of office so guide, has a duty to disobey.\"\u00a0The only real option under such circumstances, Milburn wrote, would be\u00a0to resign rather than carry out the order. On Sunday, after Gallagher criticized Navy leadership in a morning interview on Fox News, Defense Secretary Mark Esper forced Spencer to resign over his handling of the case. The circumstances were murky, but it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s unwelcome intervention precipitated another mess. Military leaders shouldn\u2019t have to choose between their conscience and an order from the commander in chief.

      "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 As the Trump administration looks to replace a recently fired Obama appointee tasked with battling homelessness, California officials and advocates are\u00a0in the dark and bracing for battle. The abrupt nature of the dismissal Nov. 15 of Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, has suggested to many who work on homelessness that the White House is poised to deliver a new agenda as early as next week. \u201cIf joining and funding real solutions to homelessness, instead of political theater and points-scoring, are the Trump administration\u2019s objective, California continues to be ready to engage,\u201d says Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, adding that \u201cthe state has not been contacted by federal officials.\u201d Although Trump has sparred with California leaders\u00a0all year on issues ranging from fire safety to tailpipe emissions, he has been particularly scathing about the Golden State\u2019s inability to beat back a surging tide of homeless residents. Around 140,000 people are homeless in California, or about a quarter of the nation\u2019s homeless population. Trump has\u00a0suggested\u00a0federal intervention is needed. \u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up and the people of Los Angeles are fed up, and we\u2019re looking at it, and we will be doing something about it at the appropriate time,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to California in September. While the details of a new White House strategy remain unknown, suggestions of its direction can be found in a Council of Economic Advisers report released in September. Taking aim at homelessness:Blaming shelters and street sleeping, President Trump blasts California In it, administration officials argue that housing needs to be deregulated to get costs down, shelters are partly to blame because they delay re-housing, and policing should be ramped up in the interest of public safety. Those working to alleviate homelessness note that the federal government has always had the power to help relieve the problem, as evidenced by public works projects enacted during the Great Depression. But some homelessness experts are skeptical about the motivations of the Trump White House when it comes to the less fortunate. \u00a0The administration has moved to cut food stamps three times in the past year, including a proposal last month to cut $4.5 billion from the program. \u201cIt is my hope that if the administration issues an executive order, it will be one that supports and expedites proven solutions to homelessness,\u201d says Nan Roman, president and CEO of the nonpartisan National Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington, D.C. Roman says\u00a0helpful measures could include access to surplus federal properties for shelter and linking health and behavioral care to housing. Instead, the administration has suggested providing more shelter, but nothing about getting people from those shelters into the housing that would end their homelessness,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has promoted more aggressive policing, which has proven not to end homelessness, and proposed policies that create barriers for people trying to access shelter and housing.\u201d Newsom spokesman Melgar says \u201cthere are a number of federal actions\u201d Trump administration officials could reverse to help alleviate homelessness, including ending \u201ctheir misguided quest to slash social safety net programs like food stamps that many of these folks rely upon.\u201d Jennifer Friedenbach is on the front lines of the crisis as executive director of San Francisco\u2019s Coalition on Homelessness. She says that while \u201cthere\u2019s a lot (Trump) can do that would be positive,\u201d her mind often runs to more dire edicts. \u201cI suppose he could try and get participation from cities to go hardcore and set up camps, but you can\u2019t really force people to go to them,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t criminalize not having a home, or having a substance abuse problem, but that seems to be an easy out for politicians. It\u2019s an approach that sets us back in the struggle.\u201d The camps Friedenbach mentions are a reference to a mobile facility that was recently on display when Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development, visited\u00a0Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row in September. He spent time with homelessness experts such as Union Rescue Mission CEO Andy Bates\u00a0and toured a tentlike structure that could be used to shelter people temporarily. Just before that visit, Trump administration officials visited Los Angeles and spent time with Herb Smith, CEO of Los Angeles Mission, a faith-based organization serving the city\u2019s homeless. Smith welcomed the meeting but was disappointed when the emissaries did not appear well-informed about the problem. \u201cThey had no handle on the causes of homelessness and its challenges,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey were struggling to understand the problem, which is largely about getting people to accept shelter in the first place.\u201d Smith encouraged the administration officials to look at the crisis as a natural disaster. \u201cI asked them, what if Skid Row were wiped out by a surging river, what would you do?\u00a0And they said, \u2018We\u2019d send in FEMA,\u2019\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo\u00a0I asked them, 'Why not provide that same response here?' They didn\u2019t have an answer for that.\u201d For Smith, any executive action that relies on disrupting an already fragile ecosystem would be unwelcome on the part of those helping the homeless. \u201cLook, the Feds don\u2019t have the authority to come in and arrest people for being homeless,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my real concern about whatever might be presented is that it will include moving people around, traumatizing people and generally just exacerbating the level of human misery we already have.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava",

Speaking at the campaign launch of the \"Black Voices for Trump\" coalition at Atlanta's World Congress Center, the president used his signature issue of immigration in his latest attempt to gin up support among African American one year out from the 2020 election. \"Democrats want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens, courtesy of you, the American taxpayer and the African American community,\"\u00a0he told a crowd of about 300 people as they cheered and chanted, \"four more years!\" \"Republicans believe that public benefits should be protected for American citizens.\" Throughout his speech, Trump argued that his Democratic opponents were more focused on helping countries and people outside the U.S. rather than the black community at home. \"The money that we spend on illegal aliens we could be rebuilding our inner cities, repairing our crumbling infrastructure and fixing our terrible public schools...but instead Democrats want to redistribute your wealth all over the entire world,\" Trump\u00a0said. He railed against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats, accusing them of holding up passage of a trade agreement with Canada and New Mexico because they \"would rather hurt their political opponents than help their black constituents.\u201d Trump blamed Democrats for eroding urban areas and driving up crime, suggesting \"Nancy Pelosi should go back home to San Francisco and clean up its problems.\" He also touted his move to formally pull out of the 2015 landmark Paris agreement\u00a0on Monday, a move that has drawn worldwide condemnation, contending he was focusing on domestic issues while Democrats were looking abroad. \"Democrats want to invest in green global projects. I want to invest in black American communities,\" he declared as the crowd cheered. Ivanka Trump:Whistleblower's identity 'not particularly relevant' in impeachment inquiry But Trump faces\u00a0an uphill battle over the next year as he looks to expand his\u00a0appeal among black voters.\u00a0Only 8% of African Americans\u00a0cast their ballot for Trump in 2016, compared to Hillary Clinton's 89% among the voting bloc,\u00a0while his approval rating among black voters sits at just 10%, according to\u00a0a recent survey by\u00a0Quinnipiac University. The president often highlights his economic record when arguing for why African Americans should support his re-election bid.\u00a0When he took office in January 2017, the black jobless rate\u00a0was 7.7% and has since fallen to 5.4% \u2013 the lowest on record dating to 1972 - while the overall unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.6%. That message has resonated with some supporters from\u00a0\"Blacks for Trump\", a Miami-based group that traveled to Atlanta Friday to support the launch of the coalition. Lateresa Jones, a member of the group, said African Americans should not feel afraid to voice support for Trump. Michael Bloomberg:Former NYC mayor opens door to 2020 presidential campaign Jones, 55, said the black community expected more from former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration but it did not deliver. Under Trump\u2019s administration, Jones said she sees more young, black professionals getting jobs and small businesses opening. \u201cWe have been allowing ourselves to be ignored politically,\u201d said Jones, who was wearing a \u2018Blacks for Trump\u2019 T-shirt and a red jacket. \u201cOur president has an urban agenda that will grow every urban community across the country.\u201d The Atlanta event drew a few hundred African American supporters, many wearing red and\u00a0Make America Great Again hats, with the line stretching through the lobby\u00a0of the World Congress Center. Outside the Atlanta event, hundreds of protesters gathered at nearby Centennial Park before marching toward the World Congress Center. The president has drawn criticism\u00a0over what some see as\u00a0racially divisive language, most recently in clashes with the late\u00a0House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump referred\u00a0to his black-majority district in Baltimore as a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested mess.\" He also criticized four freshman congresswomen of color known as \"The Squad.\" He initially attacked Reps. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), before zeroing in on Omar, who was born in Somalia but is a U.S. citizen. The spat intensified after supporters chanted \"send her back\" at one of his campaign rallies in North Carolina in July. Trump has made other overtures to the black community in recent months.\u00a0Last month he spoke at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, in what was billed as a keynote speech at a three-day presidential forum on criminal justice reform that featured some of his Democratic\u00a0challengers. Instead, Trump's speech came a day before the other\u00a0candidates appeared and\u00a0was delivered to a handpicked\u00a0crowd of supporters and just seven students. He was honored for the bipartisan passage of the First Step Act, which gives elderly inmates opportunities for release,\u00a0increases the amount of good-time credit inmates can receive and assists with their transition back into society. His award prompted Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris to pull out of the event Saturday. Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Trump also hosted the Young Black Leadership Summit, an event organized by the conservative group Turning Point USA, at the White House\u00a0Oct. 4 In September, he spoke to leaders from\u00a0historically black colleges and universities at an annual conference in Washington, where he announced faith-based HBCUs would no longer be restricted from federal funding for capital projects. He often points out that he outperformed former Republican presidential nominee\u00a0Mitt Romney, who received just\u00a06% among\u00a0African American voters in 2012. But\u00a0Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who focuses on race and politics, emphasizes\u00a0he was running against the first black president,\u00a0Barack Obama, who received 93% of the black vote. Prison guards:Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts \"He actually fared worse than every other Republican presidential candidate that didn't run against a black man since [Barry] Goldwater in 1964,\" Johnson said. Goldwater took 4% of the African American vote. George W. Bush received the highest number of African American voters of any modern Republican candidate with 11% in 2004, a jump from 8% in 2000. While convincing black voters he's delivered on his promises at the end of his first term, it'll be a stretch for Trump\u00a0to deliver on one he made in August 2016, when he told a crowd\u00a0he would get 95% of the African American vote at the end of his first four years. Johnson isn't convinced that the coalition or any of the president's efforts among the African American community are aimed at expanding his appeal, but keeping the slice of black voters he does have in place. \"When he talks about unemployment numbers, when he talks about criminal justice reform and visits HBCUs, this is just to hold on to that 8% of those folks that he does have, in particular black men,\" Johnson said. Karen Pence:Second lady embraces bigger role on 2020 campaign trail \"He gives just enough to show that they care, to some extent,\u00a0about the black American experience by pointing to these policy wins, but the bigger thing is to cast doubt on whoever the Democrats put forth,\" he said. Johnson noted that black voter turnout dropped by seven points\u00a0from 2012 to 2016. If turnout among black voters falls short in 2020, Trump would benefit. Every\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate has received no less than 82% of the African-American vote\u00a0since 1972. Yahanesh \u201cYG Nyghtstorm\u201d George, vice chairman of the Forsyth County GOP, said he supports Trump\u2019s outreach to black voters in Atlanta because too often Democrats take the black vote for granted. Many presidential candidates, he said, skip campaigning in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of him showing that he is trying to appeal to American citizens period, he\u2019s trying to talk to everybody,\u201d said George, adding that he was pleased with the country\u2019s low unemployment rate. \u201cSo if you act like you\u2019re entitled and say \u2018I know I\u2019ve got this group\u2019 then you\u2019re not working for that group. We are a voting bloc and we deserve to be talked to as well.\u201d Contributing:\u00a0Eric Connor and Carol Motsinger, The Greenville News",

I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well,\" Trump said of Sondland.\u00a0\"Seems like a nice guy, though.\" Before the leaving the White House for Texas,\u00a0Trump read\u00a0from handwritten notes disputing Sonland's testimony, and repeatedly saying he demanded \"nothing\" from Ukraine's president. Sondland, testifying on Capitol Hill in the House impeachment inquiry,\u00a0confirmed the existence of a \"quid pro quo\" in which military aid to Ukraine was tied to Trump's call for an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Sondland\u00a0said\u00a0Trump's personal attorney,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, pressed the demand\u00a0that Ukraine publicly announce an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter, who once worked for Burisma Holdings. \"Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president,\" Sondland told lawmakers. Later, during a tour of an\u00a0Apple manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said he believed\u00a0Sondland's testimony vindicated him. \u201cI think it was fantastic,\" Trump told reporters. \"They have to end it now. There was no quid pro quo. The president did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who Sondland testified was \u201cin the loop\u201d on the Ukraine pressure campaign, also departed for visits to Wisconsin and his home state of Indiana on Wednesday. Trump\u00a0focused on the portion of the testimony in which Sondland\u00a0said the president\u00a0himself did not tell him directly that Ukraine aid was tied to investigations of the Bidens. However, Sondland said Trump's desires were communicated through Giuliani and it was clear there was a link. Follow along:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Impeachment hearing:Sondland confirms Ukraine 'quid pro quo' \"I never heard anyone advocate for holding the aid,\" Sondland said, a line that was rapidly echoed on social media by the president's allies. \"President Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on an announcement of investigations,\" Sondland added. Despite Trump's insistence that he didn't know Sondland well, the ambassador testified they were friendly enough to have candid phone conversations with expletives. In the hearing on Capitol Hill,\u00a0Sondland was asked about a comment attributed to him in which he told Trump that the president of Ukraine \"loves your a--.\" The conversation was recounted to lawmakers by another U.S. official. \"Yeah, it sounds like something I would say,\" Sondland testified. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate. Lots of four-letter words ... In this case: three letters.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sondland's testimony was\u00a0\u201camong the most significant evidence to date.\u201d \"Republicans seem to be under the impression that, unless the president spoke the words 'I am bribing Ukraine'\u00a0there's no evidence of bribery or misconduct,\" Schiff wrote on Twitter.

That ain\u2019t happening. I did get arrested. I got charged. That\u2019s all right. I\u2019d do it again given the opportunity.\" President Donald Trump attended the game Saturday and was met with mostly cheers and chants of \"USA!\" The Baby Trump balloon, an\u00a0orange-faced president in a diaper, first made a protesting appearance at the United Kingdom last year and a website, \"Baby Trump Tour,\" will loan out the balloons while tracking appearances at Trump visits around the country. \u201cI got so fired up when I rolled by the balloon,\" Hutchinson recalled on the radio program. \"I figured only way I was going to get close enough to that balloon was to blend in. I went and bought me an Alabama shirt and walked up like I was just walking to the game and like I was going to take a picture with (the balloon). I was so fired up, man. I was shaking, I was so mad.\" Hutchinson created a GoFundMe page tabbed, \"Restitutions for Baby Trump Stabber\" with a goal of $6,000 to pay his legal fees. By Tuesday, the page had raised over $43,000. He\u00a0added that he felt a religious obligation, and compared his balloon slashing to a \"turning over the temple tables\" moment\u00a0\u2014 when Jesus threw tables of tax collectors. \"The (democratic) left wants to kind of use religion against you like you shouldn\u2019t act like this and stuff, but I\u2019ll tell you this \u2014 the Devil knows the Bible as good as we do,\" he said.",

      "author": "John Fritze",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0President Donald Trump signed\u00a0bipartisan legislation Wednesday aimed at supporting protesters in Hong Kong, ignoring warnings from Beijing that the measure would be met with \"strong countermeasures\" during a standoff over trade. The bill, which won near unanimous approval in Congress, would require officials\u00a0to annually reconsider special treatment Hong Kong receives from the U.S., including trade rules that have helped elevate the city to a global financial power. China retaliated\u00a0Thursday by\u00a0summoning\u00a0Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador, and warned\u00a0the move would undermine cooperation with Washington. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng told Branstad the move constituted \u201cserious interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and a serious violation of international law,\u201d a Foreign Ministry statement said. Calling\u00a0it a \u201cnakedly hegemonic act,\" Le\u00a0urged the U.S. not to implement the bills and to prevent greater damage to U.S.-China relations, the ministry said. Lawmakers in both parties have sought to signal support for the protesters, who for months have taken to the streets to demonstrate against what they view as China's encroachment on the city's autonomy.\u00a0Pro-democracy candidates won major gains in Hong Kong elections over the weekend, a rebuke to Beijing's response to the protests. \"I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,\" Trump said in a statement.\u00a0\"They are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.\" But Trump also appeared to balk at portions of the bill, adding a signing statement cautioning that \"certain provisions\" of the act \"would interfere with the exercise of the president's constitutional authority to state the foreign policy of the United\u00a0States.\" The White House did not respond to questions about which provisions were at issue. Trump has been ambiguous when asked about the Hong Kong protesters, a topic that complicates his effort to reach an agreement to end a trade war with Beijing. Trump told reporters Oct. 7 that if \"anything happened bad\" that would be \"very bad for the negotiation.\" He said he hoped \"they can work out something that\u2019s amicable.\" Election:Pro-democracy candidates surge in Hong Kong elections China had threatened to retaliate if Trump signed the measure. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said recently that the legislation undermines U.S.-China relations. \"We urge the U.S. to grasp the situation, stop its wrongdoing before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said. \"If the U.S. continues to make the wrong moves, China will be taking strong countermeasures for sure.\" Lawmakers from both parties applauded Trump's decision to sign the bill, which had not been a sure bet. Trump initially demurred when asked if he would sign it. \"Know this,\u00a0Chairman Xi: Americans despise tyrants and stand in solidarity with Hong Kong,\"\u00a0said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. \"The whole world has seen both the courage of Hong Kongers and the brutality of your Chinese Communist Party.\" Sen.\u00a0Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said the law \"ensures the United States finally sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of Hong Kong: We are with you.\u201d Britain controlled Hong Kong until 1997, when it ceded authority to China to oversee the city as a special administrative region. At the time, communist\u00a0Beijing promised Hong Kong would enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years. Washington afforded the city special treatment, setting up different rules than for mainland China. For instance, the trade barriers Trump has imposed on China have not applied to Hong Kong.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump signed a short-term spending bill on Thursday that will avoid another government shutdown, at least for now. The measure will fund the government at current levels through Dec. 20, buying lawmakers a few more weeks to agree on long-term spending but backing difficult decisions up against the Christmas holiday and, potentially, an impeachment vote. Budget talks have hit an impasse over Trump\u2019s demand for billions in funding to build a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border. Last year, a fight over border wall funding triggered a partial government shutdown that lasted a record 35 days. The push to keep the government open comes amid ongoing impeachment inquiry hearings.\u00a0House Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his office to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats also are looking to wrap up the investigation and hold a possible impeachment vote before Christmas. Federal agencies have shuttered three times\u00a0under Trump. The first, in early 2018, lasted three days. The second, which lasted\u00a0only a few hours, took place in February of that same year. A third, caused by an impasse over funding for the president\u2019s proposed wall, lasted 35 days \u2013 the longest closure of federal agencies in U.S. history.

The White House announced four recipients of the National Medal of Arts and four of the National Humanities Medal in a statement Sunday night.

Trump will award the medals during a ceremony at the White House on Thursday.

The White House, which sometimes adds its own nominees, traditionally approves and announces them ahead of a presidential ceremony. Trump has had an uneasy if not hostile relationship with many in the arts and the humanities who oppose his policies and have denounced his presidency. He has been largely shunned by Hollywood and has skipped events like the annual Kennedy Center gala that is one of Washington\u2019s premier social gatherings after some honorees said they would not attend if Trump was part of the ceremony.

But Trump stopped short of repeating his claim that Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman is a \"Never Trumper.\" \"I don't know Vindman at all,\" Trump said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. \"I never heard of him.\" Trump's remarks came as a House committee was conducting another impeachment hearing in which Vindman was one of the witnesses. Vindman, who listened to Trump's call with Zelensky, told lawmakers Tuesday he knew without hesitation that he had to report his concerns about the conversation to White House lawyers. \u201cIt was inappropriate,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cIt was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this could be an impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge.\u201d Vindman said that given the \"power disparity\" between the United States and Ukraine, it was clear that Trump's request for investigations was more of a demand. At the White House, Trump said he briefly watched Vindman's testimony.\u00a0\"I'm going to let people make their own determination\" about Vindman's remarks, he said. Trump faced a backlash from Democrats and Republicans\u00a0last week after he tweeted negative remarks about Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, while she was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Yovanovitch was testifying in the second public hearing of the impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump used military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that stood to benefit him politically.

She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\" Yovanovitch told Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that she found the\u00a0tweet \"intimidating.\" Schiff called the tweet \"witness intimidation.\" More:The Trump impeachment inquiry in pictures More:Impeachment hearings: the latest on the Trump impeachment proceedings and what it means",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "Gordon Sondland is not a note taker, but it appears that he can do math. Appearing Wednesday before\u00a0House impeachment investigators, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union said\u00a0he communicated to the president of Ukraine that before Ukraine would receive military aid and a White House meeting,\u00a0he needed to announce certain investigations. Sondland testified that \u201cit was abundantly clear that there was a link\u201d between the actions Ukraine desired and an announcement about the two investigations. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d Sondland asked rhetorically. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d In addition to confirming the quid pro quo, Sondland \u2014 a major donor to Donald Trump's inauguration\u00a0\u2014 unequivocally tied it to Trump: \u201cWe all understood that these prerequisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected President Trump\u2019s desires and requirements.\u201d Sondland should have taken notes After his election last\u00a0spring on a reform agenda, Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky sought a meeting with Trump at the White House to signal U.S. support for Ukraine as it resists Russian aggression. Congress had approved nearly $400 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2014 and continues to occupy its eastern region. In exchange, the United States was seeking an announcement about two investigations. One investigation would explore possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election, a debunked conspiracy theory that contradicts findings by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election. The other investigation was into Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine that\u00a0counted\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s son as a board member from 2014 to earlier this year. Unlike other witnesses who have testified that they took meticulous notes about their work, Sondland said that he is \u201cnot a note taker\u201d nor \u201ca memo writer,\" and that he never has been.\u00a0If Sondland had been a note taker, perhaps he would have remembered before this third try that there was a quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky. During his October deposition, Sondland testified that there was never any precondition to the release of the military aid. But after other witnesses contradicted this testimony, Sondland submitted supplemental written testimony to explain that his recollection had been refreshed by their testimony, and that he now remembered the meeting and aid were conditioned on anti-corruption investigations. If only he had taken notes. Go-to impeachment tools:Trump abuses power by harassing, intimidating witnesses like Yovanovitch And even the written correction wasn\u2019t complete. On Friday, State Department official David Holmes testified about a phone call between Sondland and Trump regarding the investigations, after which Sondland told Holmes that Trump does not care about Ukraine, only about \u201cbig stuff\u201d like investigating the Bidens. On Wednesday, Sondland admitted to the phone call with Trump, though he persisted in his claim that he did not know until recently that Burisma was code for \u201cBiden.\u201d Quid pro quo is an element of bribery Sondland blamed his lapses of memory on the State Department\u2019s refusal to permit him to access any documents that might refresh his recollection, as well as his own habit of not taking notes. When it comes to math, however, Sondland is apparently an excellent student. The ambassador to the\u00a0EU testified that Trump\u2019s attorney, Rudy\u00a0Giuliani, told him the investigations were conditions for the White House meeting, and Sondland\u00a0assumed that the military aid was a condition as well. Sondland said that though\u00a0Trump never specifically told him the delay in releasing the military aid was directly tied to the announcement of investigations, he assumed the link because \u201ctwo plus two equals four.\u201d A deeper hole:Taylor impeachment testimony on Sondland call brings Trump deeper into Ukraine scandal Quid pro quo is an element of bribery, which is specified in the Constitution as an impeachable act. While it is not necessary in the impeachment context to prove the elements of a crime as defined by statute, such proof certainly makes for a compelling case.\u00a0Bribery is defined by statute as demanding a thing of value in exchange for the performance of an official act. An announcement of investigations against Trump\u2019s political rivals was a thing of value for Trump. He could have used the announcement to attack former Vice President Biden, a top rival in the 2020 presidential election. On the other side of the equation, an official White House visit and the release of military aid could each constitute the performance of an official act. In other words, a quid pro quo. It all adds up.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Before heading to his new home base in Florida for the Thanksgiving weekend,\u00a0President Donald Trump engaged Tuesday in the quasi-political\u00a0tradition of turkey pardoning\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0cracked jokes about efforts to impeach him. The turkeys Bread and Butter were raised \"to remain calm under any condition, which will be very important because they have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff's basement,\" Trump said. \"It seems the Democrats are accusing me of being too soft on turkeys,\" Trump added. For good measure, Trump joked that Bread and Butter will provide unique testimony because \"unlike previous witnesses, you and I have actually met. It's very unusual.\" Following the tradition of earlier presidents, Trump spared the lives of both of the\u00a0turkeys presented to him,\u00a0but he announced an official presidential pardon only for Butter, who was officially designated this year's National Thanksgiving Turkey. The guests at the ceremony included two House Republicans who are among Trump's most ardent defenders, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. \"They have all been great warriors,\" Trump said of his congressional guests. Trump also extolled his presidency during the ceremony, praising the stock market and the military, and telling the crowd that \"our\u00a0country is doing very well\" It's not the first time Trump has used the traditional turkey pardoning to make jokes about his political opponents. At\u00a0last year's event, held less than a month after Democrats won control of the U.S. House in the congressional\u00a0elections,\u00a0Trump wisecracked\u00a0\u00a0about the opposition's desire to investigate him. \u201cEven though Peas and Carrots have received a presidential pardon, I have warned them that House Democrats are likely to issue them both subpoenas,\u201d he said. Bread and Butter:Trump to pick between Bread and Butter at annual turkey pardoning ceremony Trump also joked about his\u00a0defeats in lawsuits, telling last year's turkeys: \"Unfortunately, I can\u2019t guarantee that your pardons won\u2019t be enjoined by the Ninth Circuit ... Always happens.\" In 2017, his first turkey pardoning as president, Trump joked that,\u00a0while seeking to reverse many of the actions taken by predecessor Barack Obama, \"I have been informed by the White House Counsel\u2019s Office that Tater and Tot\u2019s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked ... So, Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.\" Earlier in the day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a task force on missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. \u201cThat\u2019s something that should have been done a long time ago,\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office signing ceremony. After the turkey pardoning, Trump is scheduled to leave the White House for a Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida\u00a0\u2013 his first holiday since he switched his residency from New York City to Florida. The president kicks off the weekend with a campaign rally Tuesday night in Sunrise which is about 50 miles southwest of Palm Beach. Trump also warmed up for his turkey pardoning by tweeting. In a series of posts, Trump criticized a judge's decision that White House Counsel Donald McGahn must testify to Congress about claims the president tried to short-circuit the Russia investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The administration is appealing the ruling. 'The ultimate fighter':Conan, the military dog wounded in Islamic State raid, gets hero's welcome at White House House Democrats are also seeking testimony from Trump aides in the impeachment investigation involving Ukraine. Trump is accused\u00a0of using foreign aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating U.S. Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden. In his tweets, Trump said he is \"fighting for future Presidents\" in appealing the ruling that the White House lawyer must testify. Denouncing the \"D.C. Wolves and Fake News Media\" over the impeachment saga, Trump said he would not mind testimony from\u00a0McGahn, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, retiring Energy Secretary Rick Perry, or Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney because, he said, he has done nothing wrong. \"It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but, future Presidents should in no way be compromised,\" he said. \"What has happened to me should never happen to another President!\"",

      "author": "Christal Hayes",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 More than a dozen witnesses have been called before a trio of House committees and questioned for hours about President Donald Trump and\u00a0Ukraine. The witnesses include diplomats and White House officials with knowledge of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\u00a0Each has provided new details\u00a0as\u00a0part of the quickly moving impeachment inquiry examining whether Trump abused his power as president in asking Ukraine to investigate political foes while dangling military aid for the country and a White House meeting. Their testimonies combined span about 100 hours. Almost a dozen of these witnesses have also appeared publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Here are the 17\u00a0witnesses who have been interviewed\u00a0behind closed doors by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees or later testified publicly, why they matter in the impeachment saga and what we know about their testimony. Why he matters: A\u00a0career State Department official, Volker worked with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and various White House officials to set up Trump's phone call July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a potential White House visit. This happened\u00a0as military aid for the country was on\u00a0pause. What he told lawmakers:Volker said he never saw anything that made him believe there was a quid pro quo\u00a0with Ukraine and said he felt coordinating with Giuliani could change Trump from his negative feelings about Ukraine. His testimony made clear the influence Giuliani had over policy, including Giuliani dictating\u00a0a statement to Volker that he wanted the Ukrainians to issue on corruption. In his public testimony Nov. 19, Volker told lawmakers he was not aware of or knowingly took part in any efforts to pressure Kyiv to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0At the time, he told lawmakers,\u00a0he did not realize investigations into the Bidens and into Burisma had been conflated. Why she matters: A career diplomat, Yovanovitch was forced out of her role. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Yovanovitch was confused by her ouster and the comments made by conservatives and\u00a0Trump, who called her \"bad news.\"\u00a0She said she\u00a0raised concerns about the shadow campaign pushed by Giuliani and how it ran counter to U.S. policy. In her Nov. 15\u00a0public hearing, Yovanovitchhow she felt after being ousted as ambassador amid the \"smear\" campaign against her. When asked how it felt to be told to leave Ukraine as quickly as possible, she said it felt \u201cterrible, honestly. After 33 years of service to our country it was terrible. It's not the way I wanted my career to end.\u201d Why she matters: Hill worked for years on the National Intelligence Council and as Trump's senior adviser on the Kremlin and Europe. She held a key role in U.S. policy in Ukraine and was part of several meetings where she expressed concerns over the shadow policy led by Giuliani and White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Hill told lawmakers\u00a0national security adviser John Bolton likened\u00a0the policy in Ukraine to a \"drug deal\" and called Giuliani a \"hand grenade\" who was going to blow everyone up, according to The New York Times and NBC News. In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Hill slammed the \"fictional narrative\" of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans\u00a0have argued Ukraine colluded with Democrats to hurt Trump in the election. Why he matters:\u00a0Kent serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. What he told lawmakers: Kent told\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0he raised red flags about Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden more than six months ago. In his public testimony, Kent said\u00a0the Ukrainian oligarch owner of gas company Burisma should be investigated over allegations of paying a bribe to kill a probe into the company. Why he matters: McKinley boasted a career that spanned decades at the State Department and resigned just before his testimony\u00a0because of low morale at the department and because he said\u00a0Pompeo did not stick up for career employees, such as\u00a0Yovanovitch. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0McKinley didn't oversee issues related to Ukraine, so his testimony did not deal with the core allegations against Trump. He outlined his concerns about the ouster of\u00a0Yovanovitch\u00a0and said he was troubled that the State Department did not have her back and that she\u00a0and the department\u00a0were\u00a0being politicized. Why he matters: A\u00a0businessman and major Trump donor, Sondland\u00a0was in communication with the president and Giuliani and attempted\u00a0to get Ukrainians to investigate several\u00a0political matters, according to witnesses. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Sondland amended his original testimony and told lawmakers he communicated a quid pro quo to a Ukrainian\u00a0official, linking military aid for Ukraine\u00a0to a public statement committing to investigations Trump and Giuliani wanted. In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Sondland gave more details not previously included in his closed-door interview, telling lawmakers that \"everyone was in the loop\" on the pressure campaign \u2013 including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence. Why he matters: Taylor\u00a0voiced concerns about conditioning military aid and a\u00a0White House meeting on political investigations. What he told lawmakers: Taylor directly tied Trump and his allies with a quid pro quo. He said Trump made the order to pause military aid for Ukraine, and it was his \"clear understanding\" that \"security assistance money would not come until the (Ukrainian)\u00a0president committed to pursue the investigation,\" according to a transcript of his testimony. In his public hearing, Taylor gave new testimony saying one of his aides overheard a call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations,\" which caused Trump to deny the conversation. Oct. 23: Defense official Laura Cooper Why she matters:\u00a0Cooper serves as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine\u00a0and Eurasia. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Behind closed doors, Cooper gave lawmakers further details about the\u00a0withholding of aid. In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Cooper provided new details about emails from the Ukrainians showing they had concerns about security assistance on July 25\u00a0\u2013 the day of Trump's infamous call with Zelensky. Why he matters:\u00a0Reeker serves as the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0According to The Wall Street Journal, he discussed with lawmakers failed efforts to help\u00a0Yovanovitch. Why he matters: Vindman is one of several officials who listened to Trump's phone call with\u00a0Zelensky on July 25. He served as the White House's top Ukraine expert. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Vindman said in prepared remarks\u00a0he twice reported concerns to superiors that the president and those\u00a0working for him linked\u00a0foreign aid to Ukraine with political\u00a0investigations. He said he worried the efforts undermined\u00a0U.S. national security. In his public testimony on Nov. 20, Vindman said he reported his concerns about a July 10 meeting between Sondland and Ukrainian officials, as well as Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, out of a sense of duty. \"I was concerned by the call,\"\u00a0Vindman said. \"What I heard was inappropriate.\" Why she matters: Croft worked for Volker at the State Department and has expertise on Ukrainian issues. She focused on arms sales and security assistance for the country as it fended off Russia. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0According to a copy of her opening statement, Croft told lawmakers\u00a0she received calls from a lobbyist trying to oust Yovanovitch. She said she learned that aid was put on hold stemming from an order from the president. Why he matters:\u00a0Anderson worked for Volker at the State Department and was present for at least one\u00a0meeting\u00a0where political investigations were discussed. What he told lawmakers: In his opening statement, Anderson said\u00a0 Giuliani's efforts were discussed at a Ukraine strategy meeting over the summer. At that meeting, Bolton said Giuliani's efforts \"could be an obstacle.\" Anderson said he believed it was important to not request specific investigations from the Ukrainians. Why he matters: Morrison is the top Russia and European adviser to Trump's National Security Council and was cited by multiple witnesses in conversations about a quid pro quo. He is a political appointee and not a career official. What he told lawmakers: Morrison confirmed testimony given by Taylor that outlined a quid pro quo, basically halting aid until Ukraine committed to investigations. Morrison testified that he didn't believe Trump's call July 25 was illegal. In his Nov. 19 public testimony, Morrison said\u00a0fellow NSC staffer Fiona Hill warned him of the \u201cGordon problem\u201d regarding\u00a0Sondland\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. Why he matters: Hale is the third highest-ranking official at the State Department. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Hale told lawmakers about the political considerations in dismissing Yovanovitch\u00a0and how those decisions affected military aid for Ukraine. In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Hale said the State Department's decision not to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch\u00a0could only be made by someone\u00a0\"more senior to me. The Secretary most likely would have been the person.\" Why she matters: A\u00a0foreign policy aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Williams was one of a handful of officials who listened to Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. What she told lawmakers: In her closed-door interview, Williams told lawmakers and staff\u00a0it was \u201cfolly\u201d to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was \u201cunusual.\u201d In her Nov. 19 public testimony, Williams said she found Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call \u201cunusual\u201d because of the discussion of \u201ca domestic political matter.\u201d Why he matters: In his public testimony, Taylor told lawmakers about a call one of his aides, later identified to be Holmes, overheard between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations.\" What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Holmes confirmed he overheard the call and that he \"heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\" In his Nov. 21 public testimony, Holmes said U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine\u00a0\"became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted\" by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and a \"cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\" Why he matters:\u00a0Sandy a White House official in the Office of Management and Budget, is the first OMB official to testify in the inquiry. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Documents presented during the deposition of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper showed\u00a0that Sandy signed one of the \"apportionment\" letters in July 2019 halting security assistance to Ukraine. Democrats allege Trump tied the aid and a White House meeting to requests for investigations that benefited him politically.",

      "content": "President Donald Trump signed a bill making animal cruelty a felony, expanding on\u00a0legislation from 2010 that made creation or distribution of \u201canimal crushing\u201d videos illegal. The previous bill outlawed the videos but didn't ban the actual acts of cruelty. \"This common sense legislation restricts the creation and distribution of videos or images of animal torture,\" Trump said Monday at the bill signing. \"It is important that we combat these heinous and sadistic acts of cruelty, which are totally unacceptable in a civilized society.\" Trump noted the role animals play \"in the development, settlement, security\u00a0and happiness of our country.\" He specifically called out Conan,\u00a0a military dog injured during the mission that killed\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Conan was honored in a White House ceremony\u00a0Monday. \"Conan was something and created quite a stir,\" Trump said. The National Sheriffs\u2019 Association and Fraternal Order of Police endorsed the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture act, citing a \"documented connection\" between animal cruelty and other violent crimes. The bill drew bipartisan support, championed in the House by Florida Reps.Ted Deutch, a Democrat, and\u00a0Vern Buchanan, a Republican. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.;\u00a0and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.,\u00a0introduced the legislation in the Senate. \"Special thank you to all the animal lovers everywhere who know this is simply the right thing to do,\" Deutch said. \"This is a major step to end animal abuse.\" \"Animal crushing\" is a term used to describe torturing animals\u00a0\u2013 often small ones such as kittens, puppies, bunnies\u00a0or mice.\u00a0The PACT act defines animal crushing\u00a0as when \u201cone or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles\u00a0or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled\u00a0or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury.\u201d Every state has laws banning animal cruelty. This year, a Maryland man was sentenced to 90 days in jail for posting a video of himself\u00a0jumping on a pelican in Florida. Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said the law fills a gap between state laws, allowing federal prosecutors to pursue cases that cross state lines. The bill provides for federal fines and imprisonment of up to seven years for a PACT conviction. \"PACT makes a statement about American values,\u201d Block said. \u201cFor decades, a national anti-cruelty law was a dream for animal protectionists. Today, it is a reality.\u201d Dead dog found in NJ town has drawn outrage:\u00a0But will anything be done? 'The ultimate fighter':Conan, the military dog wounded in Islamic State raid, gets hero's welcome at White House Marty Irby, executive director at Animal Wellness Action, said the group was \"thrilled to see the first anti-cruelty statute in American history\" signed into law, lauding Trump and Congress for their efforts. \u201cThe PACT Act will allow federal authorities to crack down on the most egregious of animal abusers and help keep American pets safe from harm,\" Irby said.",

      "author": "Jon Campbell",
      "content": "ALBANY \u2013 A state judge has ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million to charity to settle a lawsuit accusing him and his family of illegally mismanaging his charitable foundation. State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla of Manhattan issued her decision Thursday, faulting Trump for allowing his 2016 presidential campaign to orchestrate a televised fundraiser in Des Moines for the Trump Foundation, which then distributed $2.8 million to veterans charities that were also chosen by the campaign. Trump and then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood reached a deal last year that saw the Trump family agree to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its remaining $1.8 million in assets to a variety of charities, including the Army Relief Fund and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. But the two sides couldn't reach consensus on penalties for the Iowa fundraiser, leaving it up to Scarpulla to order Trump to pay an additional $2 million to the same charities. \"Mr. Trump\u2019s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign,\" Scarpulla wrote in her decision Thursday. Trump blasted the decision in a lengthy statement posted Thursday on Twitter, calling the litigation \"politically motivated harassment.\" \"All they found was incredibly effective philanthropy and some small technical violations,\" Trump said. In a statement, Trump attorney Alan Futerfas said the Trump Foundation was pleased with the decision. Underwood, a Democrat, first filed a lawsuit\u00a0against Trump, his three eldest children and the Trump Foundation \u2014 which was registered in New York \u2014 in June 2018. The lawsuit accused the Trump family of a wide variety of mismanagement, including using the charity to advance his self interests and boost his successful 2016 presidential campaign. A large part of the suit focused on the Iowa fundraiser, which Trump held as counter-programming to a Republican presidential debate he chose to skip. Trump's campaign staff organized the event\u00a0and\u00a0directed where the funds went. When Trump issued enlarged checks to the veterans organizations, they had his \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan on the bottom. New York law prohibits charities from participating in political events. The lawsuit also accused the Trump Foundation board of being largely nonexistent, failing to hold a meeting since 1999 and allowing Trump himself to determine when and where contributions were made. Several times, the foundation paid six-figure sums to other foundations to settle legal issues at Mar-a-Lago and Trump's other clubs in violation of state and federal law. The two sides reached an agreement in December to settle many of the lawsuits claims, in large part by agreeing to dissolve the Trump Foundation, despite Trump previously vowing he wouldn't settle the case. After further negotiation, the state and Trump\u00a0agreed to allow Scarpulla to decide the remaining issues surrounding the Iowa fundraiser. The Attorney General's Office, now led by Attorney General Letitia James, had been pushing for Trump to pay an additional $2.8 million to settle the Iowa claims and more for punitive damages. But Scarpulla declined to award the full amount, instead ordering Trump to pay $2 million because the money raised from the Iowa fundraiser did ultimately go to veterans charities. The money will go to eight different charities:\u00a0Army Emergency Relief, Children\u2019s Aid Society,\u00a0City Meals-on-Wheels,\u00a0Give an Hour,\u00a0Martha\u2019s Table,\u00a0United Negro College Fund,\u00a0United Way of Capital Area\u00a0and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, according to the settlement. In his statement, Trump's attorney criticized the lawsuit as being \"politically motivated\" and praised Scarpulla for rejecting the Attorney General's push for additional damages. \"We are pleased that the Court, in rejecting the Attorney General\u2019s frivolous request for statutory penalties, interest and other damages, recognized that every penny ever raised by the Trump Foundation has gone to help those most in need,\" Futerfas said. \"Now that this matter is concluded, the Trump Foundation is proud to make this additional contribution.\" James said the judge's decision and her office's lawsuit show \"no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.\u201d \u201cThe court\u2019s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain,\" James wrote.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's decision to wade into the controversial case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher is the latest example of the president intervening\u00a0to help a conservative cause celebre, a pattern that has alarmed some legal experts. Trump ordered Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday to let Gallagher retire from the military as a SEAL, upending plans to review his status. Gallagher was acquitted of killing an Iraqi civilian\u00a0but was convicted of posing for a photo with the corpse. The president did not pardon Gallagher but reversed his demotion last week\u00a0and then lobbied for him to retire this month as a SEAL, a move that exposed rifts within the Pentagon and led to the firing of Navy Secretary\u00a0Richard Spencer on Sunday.\u00a0Spencer had reportedly threatened to quit if the president tried to subvert\u00a0the process. Gallagher, who had repeatedly appeared on Fox News to make his case, became something of a cause for conservatives who, like the president, felt he had been mistreated by the military justice system. In that sense, his case has been similar to some of the highest-profile pardons the president has granted so far, experts said. More:Trump defends decision to order SEAL Edward Gallagher to keep Trident pin \"He's doing it to reward political supporters and to benefit those who would benefit him politically,\" said\u00a0clemency expert\u00a0Daniel Kobil,\u00a0a professor at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio. \"What he\u2019s doing is serving up\u00a0red meat to the base.\" Trump defended the decision Monday, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he has to \"protect my war fighters\" and claiming that \"people in the military have thanked us very much.\"\u00a0In the past, Trump has argued the case was poorly handled by prosecutors. The president has taken an unusual approach to clemency, one of the most sweeping powers he has under the Constitution. Trump has granted 18 pardons and commutations, often to well-known conservative figures. His\u00a0first pardon went to former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u00a0a politically polarizing anti-immigration figure who was convicted in 2017 of defying a judge's order to release immigrants from jail. Other Trump pardons include\u00a0Scooter Libby, a former aide to President George W. Bush who was convicted of lying to the FBI in an investigation into the leak of the identity of a CIA agent;\u00a0Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative commentator who pleaded guilty to making an illegal campaign contribution; and\u00a0Conrad Black, an outspoken Trump supporter\u00a0who spent\u00a0three and a half\u00a0years in jail on a 2007 fraud conviction. Trump\u00a0intervened in two other military cases this month, granting pardons to\u00a0Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was serving a 19-year sentence for ordering soldiers to fire on unarmed Afghans, and\u00a0Maj.\u00a0Mathew Golsteyn, charged with killing a suspected bombmaker. Both were frequently featured\u00a0on Fox, the president's favored network. In many instances, those cases did not go through the normal Department of Justice process. \u201cIt's disconcerting because there are literally thousands of people who have filed petitions for clemency who are not getting any serious consideration by the Department of Justice even though they have strong cases that they should have sentence reductions,\u201d said Rachel Barkow, a New York University law professor. Trump's decision to intervene for Gallagher sharply divided lawmakers along partisan lines.\u00a0Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the\u00a0Armed Services Committee, described Trump's move as\u00a0an \"outrageous, irresponsible interference\" into the military justice system. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise defended the effort by Trump, telling Fox News recently that Trump was boosting troop morale. More:Trump pardons servicemembers in high profile war crimes cases It also appeared destined to divide members of the military. \"The larger issue for me is this 'cable Cabinet' at Fox News that seems to be able to almost unilaterally convince the president to act on issues they care about,\" said\u00a0a retired senior Navy officer, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Gallagher's case candidly. \"He should be held accountable. But what do you do about Fox News? Who holds them to account for advising defense and foreign policy?\" The internal conflict over the fate of Gallagher's status\u00a0spilled into public view over the weekend when Esper demanded the resignation of Spencer, saying he had lost \"trust and confidence\" in Spencer over the handling of the case. Spencer publicly disputed earlier reports that he had threatened to resign over the president's actions. In an interview with CBS News on Monday, Spencer said the decision to halt the Pentagon's review of the case\u00a0sends a message \u201cthat you can get away with things.\u201d Trump has rarely discussed pardon cases\u00a0\u2013 military or civilian\u00a0\u2013 at his political rallies, but he did lay out an argument earlier this year for leniency for Gallagher,\u00a0Lorance and\u00a0Golsteyn. \"We teach them how to be great fighters,\" Trump told reporters in May outside the White House. \"And then when they fight, sometimes they get, really, treated very unfairly.\" Fritze covers the White House for USA TODAY.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to order the Navy to allow\u00a0SEAL Edward Gallagher to retain his status in the elite force, despite criticism from Democrats about the intervention. \"I have to protect my war fighters,\" Trump said in the Oval Office a day after the top Navy official was ousted after expressing concern about the case. \"I think what I'm doing is sticking up for our armed forces.\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday that Trump ordered that Gallagher be allowed to retire without losing his status as a SEAL. Gallagher was acquitted of stabbing a wounded Islamic State prisoner and firing on Iraqi civilians. But he was convicted of posing with the captive\u2019s corpse and was demoted. Trump reversed Gallagher\u2019s demotion this month, and the Navy announced it would review the case, which could have led to Gallagher\u2019s expulsion from the SEALs. Democratic lawmakers\u00a0blasted Trump for wading\u00a0into the Gallagher case.\u00a0Some expressed concern about the firing of U.S. Navy Secretary\u00a0Richard Spencer. Esper demanded Spencer's resignation over his handling of the case. \"This was an outrageous, irresponsible interference by President Trump in the military justice system,\" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the\u00a0Armed Services Committee. \"The White House\u2019s handling of this matter erodes the basic command structure of the military.\" Navy SEAL:Advocacy for Gallagher is Trump's latest intervention for conservative cause celebre Esper said Trump\u2019s verbalorder, which he said\u00a0followed a tweet from the president last week, was the reason he announced over the weekend that Gallagher would be allowed to keep his Trident Pin, a symbol of his status as a Navy SEAL. Trump has repeatedly argued that the case \"was handled very badly from the beginning.\" The internal conflict over the fate of Gallagher's status\u00a0spilled into public view over the weekend when Esper demanded Spencer's resignation. Esper said he had lost \"trust and confidence\" in Spencer over the handling of the case. More:Navy plans to strip SEAL's Trident, banish him from elite commando community In a letter to Trump on Sunday, Spencer gave a different perspective on how the events unfolded. Spencer said he could not in good conscience follow an order that he believed would undermine the principle of good order and discipline in the military \u2013 suggesting that he had been, or expected to be, ordered to stop a regular review process for Gallagher. In announcing Sunday that he had dismissed Spencer, Esper said he acted after learning of Spencer\u2019s secret plan to guarantee the outcome of the Navy SEAL peer-review board that was scheduled to convene Dec. 2 \u00a0to recommend whether Gallagher should be allowed to retain his Trident. Read the letter:Richard Spencer's scathing final letter as Navy secretary Spencer \"proposed a deal whereby if the president allowed the Navy to handle the case, he would guarantee that Eddie Gallagher would be restored to rank, allowed to retain his Trident and permitted to retire,\" Esper said. This was \"completely contrary\" to what Esper and the rest of the Pentagon leadership had agreed to, he said, and contrary to Spencer\u2019s public position that the Navy disciplinary process should be allowed to play out with no interference. Esper said he had advocated for allowing the Navy peer-review board to go forward Dec. 2,\u00a0but when Trump gave him a \"verbal instruction\" Sunday to stop the process, he did so. \"We also recognized that the commander in chief has certain constitutional rights and powers which he is free to exercise,\u00a0as many presidents have done in the past,\"\u00a0Esper said, according to a transcript of his remarks. \"Again, these are constitutional powers.\" Esper did not say whether he agreed or disagreed with Trump\u2019s order. Once Trump gave the order, Esper said he responded, \"Roger. I got it.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saturday, Esper called Trump to tell him he intended to fire Spencer, and Trump supported the decision. Sunday afternoon, Esper called Spencer and told him he was being fired. Spencer \"took it in stride\" and said he would have a resignation letter to him within 30 minutes \u2013 \"and he did.\" In that letter, Spencer made no mention of what Esper called Spencer\u2019s secret deal with the White House. Esper said it was best, under the extraordinary circumstances set in motion last week, that the Gallagher review board not proceed as planned. He said he believes in the military justice system, but in this case, it had become untenable. \"As professional as they are,\" he said of the board members, \"no matter what they would decide, they would be criticized from many sides, which would further drag this issue on, dividing the institution. I want the SEALs and the Navy to move beyond this now, fully focused on their war fighting mission.\" Contributing: The Associated Press",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The House Judiciary Committee has\u00a0scheduled its first hearing in the formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump for\u00a0Dec. 4, to explore how the Constitution applies to allegations of misconduct. No witnesses were announced. But Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., explained in a letter to Trump that the hearing will discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment, as well as the intent of terms such as \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" for which a president can be removed. Nadler said Trump's lawyers will be allowed to attend\u00a0and to question witnesses, so the president has a choice to make about whether to participate in\u00a0 the process. \"Our first task is to explore the framework put in place to respond to serious allegations of impeachable misconduct like those against President Trump,\" Nadler said in a statement. The hearing will be held where the House Intelligence Committee just concluded\u00a0two weeks of hearings, in a room larger than the customary Judiciary hearing room, to accommodate a larger audience for the public and reporters. Five panels are drafting reports to Judiciary, which will determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said his panel\u2019s report will be completed \u201csoon after\u201d the Thanksgiving holiday. The other Trump investigations:While focus is on Ukraine, here's the evidence committees have compiled to bolster Trump impeachment case Testimony from 12 witnesses during five days of hearings described Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. State Department and national security officials said Trump demanded investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, as a condition for meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and then before releasing nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress had approved. But Trump has said he was justified in urging the investigation of possible corruption. Congressional Republicans said the president sets foreign policy, rather than witnesses who criticized Trump\u2019s efforts during their testimony. The announcement came a day after the Judiciary Committee won a U.S. District Court ruling to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. But the Justice Department appealed the decision. The panel had previously held hearings about former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. One was with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday the House will continue its oversight to uphold the separation of powers. What do American's think?:Number of Americans supporting Trump's impeachment and removal unchanged \u201cAs the Court ruled, \u2018It is hard to imagine a more significant wound than such alleged interference with Congress\u2019 ability to detect and deter abuses of power within the Executive branch for the protection of the People of the United States,\u2019\" Pelosi said. \"The judge concluded that, \u2018Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.\u2019\" The panel earlier\u00a0won a U.S. District Court order for\u00a0access to grand jury evidence that supported the Mueller report. Attorney General William Barr had redacted grand jury material from the report and defied a request to testify about the report,\u00a0as he had at the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the latest hearing will be the first for the panel since Pelosi\u00a0declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24\u00a0and the House adopted rules for the inquiry Oct. 31. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a partisan \"witch hunt.\"",

Trump, who earlier expressed support\u00a0for a\u00a0ban on non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes,\u00a0appeared to reverse course\u00a0saying\u00a0he believes prohibition often leads to less safe black market products. \"If you don't give it to them, it is going to come here illegally,\" he said, warning \"they could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible.\" Regarding an age limit, Trump said, \"21 we are going to be doing.\" The session was called amid reports\u00a0of soaring vaping-related lung illnesses. And with some 5 million U.S. teens now vaping, the e-cigarette issue has taken on more urgency . At one point, Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican from Utah, who was seated next to Trump, said \"most adults are not using flavors,\" prompting vaping industry\u00a0leaders to shout back, \"yes they do,\" offering adult sales statistics. Romney responded by pointing\u00a0to Juul voluntarily ending flavors, but other companies said many or most of sales are of flavored products. Romney clashed multiple times with vaping advocates. \"Utah is a Mormon state, and half the kids in high school are vaping,' he said at one point.\u00a0He claimed vaping companies sold a flavor called \"unicorn poop\" to appeal to children. Ryan Nivakoff, CEO of Njoy, an e-cigarette company, said teen vaping is \"not necessarily a flavor problem.\" At another point, Reynolds American chief commercial officer Joe Fragnito, told Trump, \"we believe we can market flavors responsibly.\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said the gathering\u00a0was aimed at giving Trump and administration officials an opportunity to hear from all sides of the issue \"as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people.\u201d Greg Conley, president and founder of the American Vaping Association, said afterwards that the president\u00a0\"seemed to understand that prohibition is not the only option.\" \"He cares a lot about youth and keeping them away from these products, but there is the jobs issues and the adult cessation issue that is clearly weighing on his mind,\" Conley\u00a0said. Conley added, however, that there was no indication of the timing of any broad plan. \"He wants ideas.\" Dr. Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said Trump \"listened intently\"\u00a0 to what developed into a\u00a0\"very spirited discussion.\"\u00a0He said the \"jury is still out\" regarding any Administration decisions or legislative proposals. LeRoy noted that the sides were far apart on such issues as the value of vaping to wean adults off of cigarettes,\u00a0but said all sides seemed to agree that vaping \"has no place for young adults below the age of 21.\" Among those on the guest list were Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, and two executives of the largest U.S. tobacco companies, Altria CEO Howard Willard and Fragnito of\u00a0Reynolds'. Other invitees included\u00a0Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, and Tony Abboud, executive director of the\u00a0Vapor Technology Association. Health leaders who attended included\u00a0Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids president Matt Myers, American Academy of Pediatrics president-elect Sally Goza and American Lung Association President Harold Wimmer. The administration\u00a0has sent mixed signals on how it plans to tackle the problem of young people vaping and the outbreak of lung injuries. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced plans by the administration to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves in a widening crackdown. Last week, however, Mitch Zeller, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's\u00a0Center for Tobacco Products, declined to confirm such a ban in testimony before a Senate committee, referring inquiries instead to the White House. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0reported Thursday\u00a02,290 cases of vaping-related lung injuries in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, 47 vaping-related deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and D.C. The median age of deceased patients was 53 years and ranged from 17 to 75 years. Among those cases where data was available, 68% of patients\u00a0were men and 38% were between the ages of 18 and 24. The CDC recently reported vitamin E acetate was associated with the outbreak. The substance is used as a \"thickening agent\" in e-cigarette products containing THC, the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. The CDC said vitamin E acetate usually does not cause\u00a0harm when ingested as a vitamin or is used as skin treatment, but that research suggests if\u00a0inhaled \"it may interfere with normal lung functioning.\" Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner until April, told CNBC on Friday\u00a0White House hesitation on the banning issue was likely due to fears of political blow back. \u201cI think they were spooked by the politics of this and the push back,\u201d said Gottlieb, a physician and\u00a0health advocate. He added that he thinks the White House is \"legitimately concerned about shutting down these small mom and pop shops and these adult vape stores.\u201d The Vapor Technology Association, a trade group, says a report prepared for it by economist John Dunham & Associates\u00a0found a ban on flavor products would eliminate more than 150,000 jobs, force most of the country's 13,480 independent retail stores to close and cost\u00a0$8.4 billion in lost sales. Meanwhile, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee passed a measure this month that would raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21, prohibit all flavored tobacco products and, in a bid to stop mail purchases,\u00a0direct the FDA\u00a0to issue a ban on all cigarettes and e-cigarettes sales not sold in person.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The way Ambassador Gordon Sondland tells it \u2013 under oath, no less \u2013 he and President Donald Trump are on such friendly terms that they communicate using colorful language and lots of naughty, four-letter words. But Sondland hadn\u2019t even finished his bombshell testimony during Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearing when Trump issued what has become his standard rebuttal. \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d Trump said of the Oregon hotel owner who donated $1 million to his inauguration and was rewarded with the U.S. ambassadorship to the European Union. Trump often argues he's not familiar with certain people who run afoul of the law or whose\u00a0words or actions cast him in a negative light. Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted barely more than a week as White House communications director? \u201cI barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence,\u201d Trump said. Stormy Daniels? \u00a0\u201cI had nothing to do with her,\u201d Trump said of the adult film star whom he paid $130,000 in hush money after she claimed the two had a sexual encounter. Here are 11 people Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know or never met \u2013 despite, at times, evidence to the contrary. The E.U. ambassador, Trump\u2019s go-to guy on Ukraine and a star witness in the House impeachment inquiry, testified that Trump directed him and others to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to publicly announce supposed anti-corruption investigations that Trump was seeking. Under oath, Sondland confirmed the existence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in which Ukraine was urged to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s political rivals. In exchange, Ukraine would get the U.S. military aid it\u00a0desperately wanted,\u00a0and\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would get a White House meeting. Asked if he used a vulgarity when telling Trump about Zelensky's desire to cooperate with the United States, Sondland said that sounded like something he would say. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate \u2013\u00a0a lot of four-letter words,\" he said. Trump's retort:\u00a0\u201cI have not spoken to him much,\u201d he\u00a0told reporters on the White House South Lawn. \u201cThis is not a man I know well.\u201d Million-dollar question:How well does Trump know $1 million donors like Gordon Sondland? Some now work for him Scaramucci \u2013 aka, \u201cthe Mooch\u201d \u2013 was a financier and one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters when Trump named him White House communications director on July 21, 2017. It didn\u2019t last. Trump fired Scaramucci less than two weeks later when the New Yorker called a reporter and trash-talked what he perceived to be the president\u2019s enemies, including some members of Trump\u2019s administration. Trump\u2019s take: \u201cAnthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable \u2018nut job\u2019\u2026,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cI barely knew him.\u201d Scaramucci on Trump:\u00a0'Very clear that it\u2019s impossible for him to win' Papadopoulos, a young aide, was tapped by Trump to serve on\u00a0his foreign policy team during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump lauded Papadopoulos as \u201can excellent guy\u201d during a meeting with The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board on March 21, 2016. Later that month, Trump tweeted a photo of him seated at a table with Papadopoulos during a national security meeting. But Trump\u2019s lofty praise cooled quickly when Papadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian contacts. \u201cFew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. And that photo of him seated next to Papadopoulos? \u201cI never even talked to the guy,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was.\u201d Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for five months, quickly fell out of his favor after he was convicted and sentenced to nearly four years in prison over financial fraud crimes related to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \"I didn't know Manafort well,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cHe wasn't with the campaign long.\u201d Trump denied knowing the two Ukrainian-born business partners, who were\u00a0associates of Giuliani, after they were indicted in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns. The problem? Several photos show the men with Trump or members of his family. Parnas posted one photo on Facebook showing himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, describing an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d Trump\u2019s explanation: \u201cIt's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody,\u201d he told reporters on the White House South Lawn. But, \"I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know about them. I don\u2019t know what they do.\u201d Testimony:Giuliani associate Lev Parnas must testify about GOP contributions at center of criminal case Trump loyalist Whitaker served a year as chief of staff to Trump\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions. But Trump had a frosty relationship with Sessions and fired him last November. He then named\u00a0Whitaker as acting attorney general. \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\u201d Trump said just two days after handing Whitaker the promotion. He did, however, know Whitaker\u2019s reputation, he said. Whitaker lasted in the job just three months and was replaced in February by William Barr, who remains attorney general. Conway, a conservative attorney who reportedly made Trump\u2019s short list to become U.S. solicitor general, is one of the president\u2019s most persistent critics, frequently Twitter-slamming him with insults like \u201cnarcissistic sociopath\u201d and \u201cdelusional demagogue.\u201d Conway also happens to be married to Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and currently serves as one of his senior advisers. In one Twitter take-down, Trump claimed Conway was jealous of his wife\u2019s success and angry that he didn\u2019t get the job he wanted. \u201cI barely know him,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cbut just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!\u201d Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d in a New York Magazine interview in 2002 and said he\u2019d known the multi-millionaire for 15 years. \u201cHe's a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d But Trump distanced himself from the \u201cterrific guy\u201d in July after Epstein was arrested on\u00a0charges of sex-trafficking girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes\" in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida. The \"terrific guy\" was suddenly not so terrific anymore. \u201cI knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"...He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don\u2019t think I have spoken with him for 15 years. I was not a fan.\" Epstein died in his New York jail cell in August. The New York medical examiner ruled his death as suicide by hanging. Suicide?:Private pathologist questions whether Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide; medical examiner stands by conclusion Stephanie Clifford, an adult film star who performs under the name Stormy Daniels, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Not true, Trump said. \u201cI had nothing to do with her,\u201d he\u00a0told The Associated Press on Oct. 16, 2018. \u201cSo she can lie and she can do whatever she wants to do.\u201d Trump initially denied knowing about the hush-money paid to Daniels but later acknowledged repaying his former lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to her that was made as part of a hush agreement. After a federal judge in California threw out Daniels\u2019 defamation lawsuit against Trump last year, he celebrated on Twitter. \u201cHorseface,\u201d Trump mocked\u00a0Daniels, adding: \u201cShe knows nothing about me.\" Regrets:Stormy Daniels says she regrets body shaming President Trump with graphic description The longtime advice columnist accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City in the mid-1990s. Carroll went public with the allegation against Trump in June before the release of her book, \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,\" which contains a description of the alleged assault. \u201cShe\u2019s not my type,\u201d Trump shot back, denying they\u2019d ever met. But a photo shows them speaking at a party in the 1980s. Accuser\u00a0hits back:Columnist E.

      "content": "Monday\u2019s\u00a0surprise\u00a0announcement by Secretary\u00a0of State Mike Pompeo that the United States\u00a0views Israeli\u00a0settlements as not \u201cinconsistent with international law\u201d\u00a0should have come as no surprise to anyone who has\u00a0followed\u00a0the Trump administration\u2019s pro-Netanyahu and anti-Palestinian\u00a0policies since coming into office. The move combined all of the worst elements of Trumpian foreign policy \u2014 an obsession with his predecessor; the centrality of domestic\u00a0politics in his foreign policy; and the untethering of the recent announcement\u00a0from any coherent strategy, including the furtherance of the administration\u2019s own peace plan. Indeed, Monday\u2019s upending of decades of U.S. policy\u00a0was yet another example of\u00a0the Trump administration coming up with a solution to a problem America didn\u2019t have and creating new problems in the process. Every administration defines itself to a certain extent in terms of the policies of its predecessor, usually in an effort to break out anew and to put its own unique cast on what it does and doesn\u2019t do. But rarely has there been an administration three years in that is still so obsessed with and focused on the\u00a0actions of its predecessor. This administration uses\u00a0the Obama administration\u00a0as a kind of North Star to instruct what not to do, regardless of the merits of the policy. Nowhere was this clearer than in Pompeo\u2019s remarks Monday, which opened by stating flatly that the Trump administration was reversing the Obama administration\u2019s position on settlements. Pompeo\u00a0went on to single out former Secretary of State John Kerry, whom he described as changing decades of a bipartisan approach by publicly reaffirming the illegality of settlements. Pompeo neglected to mention that despite its tough rhetoric,\u00a0the Obama administration\u00a0failed to block, or impede significantly, Israeli settlement activity on the ground, let alone confront Israel with consequences for continuing it. And in a\u00a0moment of partisan cherry-picking, Pompeo failed to mention the one example of a Republican administration \u2014 President George H.W.\u00a0Bush \u2014\u00a0that denied Israel $10 billion in housing loan\u00a0guarantees because of its settlement construction. Instead, Pompeo tethered Trump\u2019s policy to President Ronald Reagan, who did refer to the settlements in 1981 as \u201cnot illegal,\u201d\u00a0but who also clashed with Israel over settlements by calling for a freeze. Every administration injects domestic politics into its foreign policy. But rarely has there been an administration where domestic considerations\u00a0dominate\u00a0nearly every foreign policy move \u2014 from climate to the Iranian nuclear accord to Ukraine. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Trump\u2019s policy toward Israel and the Palestinians. Appealing to his political base of evangelical Christians and conservative Republicans, Trump has made\u00a0the Republican Party \u2014 and his presidency \u2014 the go-to source for demonstrating America\u2019s pro-Israeli pedigree. Trump was the first president to visit\u00a0Israel so early in his term; the first to pray at the Western Wall; the first to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; and the first\u00a0to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. In all of this, Trump has been driven not by national interests but by the goals\u00a0of securing his base and casting Democrats\u00a0as less than supportive of, if not hostile to, Israel. This week's\u00a0announcement\u00a0on settlements\u00a0feathered\u00a0Trump's\u00a0own political nest; tossed\u00a0support to Prime Minister Benjamin\u00a0Netanyahu, who\u2019s fighting for political survival; and perhaps set\u00a0the groundwork for additional settlement growth and annexation of land. For an administration that has worked\u00a0on a 60- to 80-page peace plan \u2014 the so-called ultimate deal \u2014\u00a0 it\u2019s hard to imagine behavior more destructive to its own initiative than in validating settlements. Palestinians have committed their own share of transgressions that have made peace elusive. Even so,\u00a0no Israeli action has been more humiliating to Palestinians and more destructive to a possible\u00a0two-state solution than settlements. The Trump administration has now legitimized that enterprise and undermined its own role in any mediation or negotiation. If the administration had wanted to ensure that it would alienate Palestinians and doom its already half-dead peace plan, it could not have concocted a better solution in a laboratory than Pompeo's pro-settlement announcement. Indeed, when I first met Jared Kushner,\u00a0the administration's senior adviser on the\u00a0Israeli-Palestinian\u00a0peace plan, I said half-jokingly that I wish my father-in-law had as much confidence in me as\u00a0his had in him\u00a0\u2014\u00a0because President Trump has\u00a0given his son-in-law mission impossible. The last thing the peace process needed was another insurmountable challenge. Yet, courtesy of the Trump administration, that\u2019s exactly what it got.

      "content": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper forced out Richard Spencer, the secretary of the Navy,\u00a0over his handling of a Navy SEAL whose demotion for a war crimes charge had sparked objection from President Donald Trump. Esper asked for Spencer's resignation \"after losing trust and confidence in him regarding his lack of candor\" because he failed to tell Esper of a \"private proposal\" he made to the White House that would have allowed\u00a0Navy Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher to keep his rank and SEAL status, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement. \"I am deeply troubled by this conduct shown by a senior DOD official,\" Esper said.\u00a0\"Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position. I wish Richard well.\" Opinion:Do Navy leaders have a 'duty to disobey' Trump in Gallagher case? In a letter submitted Sunday, Spencer did not say he resigned and\u00a0instead wrote, \"I hereby acknowledge my termination.\" Spencer\u00a0did not address Esper's charge of going over his head but\u00a0said it had been\u00a0\"the extreme honor of a lifetime to stand alongside the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps.\" He said his departure was due to the fact that he and\u00a0Trump \"no longer share\u00a0the same understanding\" of the importance of military justice. On Nov. 15, Trump reversed the demotion of Gallagher, who had been acquitted of\u00a0stabbing an Islamic State prisoner and killing Iraqi civilians, but was convicted of posing with for a photo with a corpse. The following week, the Navy announced it would review Gallagher's status as a SEAL, which could have led to him losing his \"Trident,\" the symbol of membership in the elite group of special operations troops. In a tweet at the time, Trump indicated\u00a0he did not want the review to take place and stated, \"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident Pin.\" Going to prison?\u00a0Chinese woman convicted of trespassing at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort faces up to 6 years in prison \"This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!\" he said. On Saturday, Spencer denied reports that he had threatened to resign over Trump's intervention in the Gallagher case. While Esper said Spencer was pushed out because of his alleged undisclosed talks with the administration, Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he had Spencer fired because he\u00a0\"was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s trial was handled by the Navy\" and because of \"large cost overruns from past administration's\" that \"were not addressed to my satisfaction.\" \"I thank Richard for his service & commitment,\" Trump said. \"Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin.\" Spencer, however, indicated his departure was rooted in the disagreement over the Gallagher case. \"The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,\" Spencer said in his letter. \"The Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are the shields that set us\u00a0apart, and the beacons that protect\u00a0us all.\" \"Unfortunately, it has become apparent in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and\u00a0defend the Constitution of the United States,\" he wrote. Spencer said Trump \"deserves and should expect a Secretary of the Navy who is aligned with his vision for the future of our force generation and sustainment\" and acknowledged his termination. According to the Pentagon, \"Spencer had previously and privately proposed to the White House \u2013\u00a0contrary to Spencer's public position \u2013 to restore Gallagher's rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin.\" The statement said Esper always thought \"the process should be allowed to play itself out objectively and deliberately, in fairness to all parties. However, at this point, given the events of the last few days, Secretary Esper has directed that Gallagher retain his Trident pin.\" Navy Under Secretary Thomas Modley will become the acting secretary of the Navy. Trump said he plans to nominate U.S. Ambassador to Norway Ken Braithwaite to become Spencer's permanent replacement.\u00a0Braithwaite is a business executive and retired rear admiral. He served as a Navy aviator, whose missions included\u00a0tracking Soviet submarines, before serving as an information officer.

More:Trump goes to Walter Reed National Medical Center for 'portions' of annual physical exam Morrison told congressional members and staff he asked National Security Council lawyers to review Trump\u2019s July 25 call because he thought it \u201cwould be damaging\u201d if it \u201cleaked.\u201d \u201cI was concerned about whether or not they would agree that it would be damaging for the reasons I outlined in my statement if the call package...leaked,\u201d Morrison said. Trump is accused of withholding nearly $400 million of military assistance to Ukraine as well as a White House meeting with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0unless the Ukrainian government opened investigations into Trump's political adversaries, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\u00a0A whistleblower complaint filed about the\u00a0July 25 call, during which Trump\u00a0raised the issue of investigations into his political adversaries while also discussing security assistance to Ukraine, kicked off the impeachment inquiry. In his opening statement, he said he was concerned about the implications of a leak of the call with regards to how it would be viewed in \"Washington's polarized environment,\" its potential effects on the \"bipartisan support\" for Ukraine, and impacts on Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Read Morrison's transcript:Timothy Morrison's testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry Read Williams transcript:Read the full impeachment inquiry testimony of Pence aide Jennifer Williams Morrison: Aid withheld at 'the President\u2019s direction' Morrison said he first learned of the hold on aid during a July conversation with Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser who had failed to appear for his scheduled testimony. Kupperman told Morrison \u201cthe chief of staff\u2019s office had informed (the Office of Management and Budget) that it was the President\u2019s direction to hold the assistance.\u201d Democrats have sought evidence to directly link Trump to the withholding of aid.\u00a0Saturday's testimony with OMB official Mark Sandy, who signed one of the documents halting aid, is expected to shed more light on how aid was withheld. Morrison's testimony gave further context to the relationship between U.S. Ambassador to the\u00a0European Union Gordon Sondland and Trump. Trump attempted to distance himself from Sondland, telling\u00a0reporters \"I hardly know the gentleman,\" on Nov. 8 as he appeared to distance himself from the ambassador. Morrison's account of Sondland's contacts with Trump, however, suggests\u00a0close contact between Trump and Sondland on Ukraine. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the President was giving him instruction,\u201d Morrison said of a conversation with Sondland about the \"parallel\" pressure campaign on Ukraine. And before the July 25 call, Sondland emailed Morrison and other White House staff to say \u201che had spoken to the President that morning to brief him on the call.\u201d Recounting a later conversation between Morrison and Sondland, Morrison said Trump told Sondland \u201cthere was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to do it and he should want to do it.\u201d Trump physical:Trump receives 'portions' of annual physical exam, White House said he's 'healthy and energetic' Morrison recounted a conversation with fellow National Security Council official Fiona Hill, who is also scheduled to testify publicly next week, in which she told him he \"would be wise\" to stay away from engagement with Giuliani and the \"parallel\" pressure campaign on Ukraine. \"She\u00a0mentioned that Gordon talked with Rudy, and she mentioned that she stayed away from any conversation with Rudy and that I would be wise to do the same,\" Morrison said. Morrison added that he \"tried to stay away from\" any discussion of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board. \"I would say that it struck me as unusual and inappropriate,\" Williams said when asked what her own personal reaction to the call was. \"I guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,\" she added. Earlier in her interview, she said she found the \"specific references\" in the July 25 call to investigations to be part of Trump's \"personal political agenda\" as opposed to a \"broader...foreign policy objective.\"",

      "content": "Support for President Donald Trump's impeachment remains at about 50% despite\u00a0two weeks of testimony in public hearings that Democrats felt strongly bolstered their case, according to a CNN poll released Tuesday. Half of Americans said Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 43% said he should not, exactly the result CNN got in a poll conducted from Oct. 17-20, before the hearings began. Of those who support impeachment, 91% said they \"strongly\" felt that way, a one percentage point increase from the month before. Among those who oppose impeachment, the number who strongly felt that way climbed from 86% to 89%. As has been the case with virtually every poll on impeachment, the numbers were clearly divided by party affiliation, race and gender. Among Democrats, 90% favored impeachment while 87% of Republicans were opposed. Independents were split, 46% to 47%. Sixty-one percent of women and 40% of men said Trump should be removed from office, while 34% of women and 53% of men were opposed. Among non-whites, 65% support impeachment while 51% of whites are opposed. \u2018Presidents are not kings\u2019:Judge says ex-White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify before Congress Trump impeachment:Rudy Giuliani says prosecutors 'know how to contact' him The demographic group most opposed to removing Trump was non-college educated whites at 56%. More than three-quarters of Americans said they have been following the impeachment proceedings at least \"somewhat closely\" while 23% said they were not following too closely or not closely at all. Trump is accused of using the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that stood to benefit him politically: one to look into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, was behind the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign in 2016, the other into an energy company whose board includes the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump has defended his calls for the investigations as efforts to combat corruption in a country receiving large amounts of U.S. assistance and has denied any political motivation. But 56% of Americans told CNN's pollsters that they believed Trump acted \"more to\u00a0benefit himself politically\" while 36% said they thought he was more interested in fighting corruption in Ukraine. And 53% said he had used the power of the presidency for political gain, while 42% said he \"did not use the presidency improperly.\" The poll found Trump's job approval rating at 42% and his job disapproval at 54%, within the range its polls have found for most of his presidency. Fifty-five percent approved of his handling of the economy, his highest mark in a CNN poll since April. The poll was conducted from Nov. 21-24 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump was welcomed by supporters Tuesday to his new home state of Florida, where he held his first campaign rally since changing his address from New York to\u00a0his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. \"Less than one year from now, I will join voters across the Sunshine State -\u00a0my home -\u00a0 as we head to the polls and together we will win back the House, we will hold the Senate and we will keep that beautiful, beautiful White House,\"\u00a0he told the crowd in Sunrise,\u00a0about 50 miles southwest of Palm Beach. Trump spoke for nearly 90 minutes before traveling\u00a0to his Mar-a-Lago club for Thanksgiving as House Democrats moved forward with\u00a0the next phase of the formal impeachment inquiry into whether he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to open investigations into his political rivals. The House Intelligence Committee announced it was drafting a report on its inquiry while the House Judiciary Committee said it would begin\u00a0hearings on Dec. 4. Southern White House:Why is Trump moving his residence from New York to Florida? Trump\u00a0boasted about intervening in three war crimes cases,\u00a0in which\u00a0he pardoned a former soldier\u00a0convicted of second-degree murder and an Army major charged with executing a man suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker. He also\u00a0reversed the demotion of\u00a0Edward Gallagher, a Navy Seal\u00a0accused of using a knife to kill a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq, and of other killings of civilians. The move sparked criticism and resulted in the ouster of\u00a0Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who acknowledged he could not in \"good conscience obey\" the order from the president. \u201cJust this week I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state. You know what I'm talking about,\" Trump told the crowd Tuesday night, without mentioning any names. \"We're going to take care of our warriors,\" he said. The president also claimed some politically correct people want to change the name Thanksgiving. \"They don't want to use the name Thanksgiving. And that was true also with Christmas but now everyone is using Christmas again,\" he said before the crowd erupted in cheers. Trump was joined by\u00a0Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Fla. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who recently joined Trump's impeachment legal team, as well as Vice President Mike Pence. Trump appeared before thousands of supporters at\u00a0the BB&T Center\u00a0in Broward County, the most Democratic part of the Sunshine State, where Hillary Clinton won 66.5% of the vote compared with Trump's 31.4%\u00a0in\u00a02016.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's administration will pay less to NATO under an agreement reached\u00a0days before the president is set to travel to London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the 29-member trans-Atlantic alliance. Even before he was elected in 2016, Trump frequently railed against the\u00a0military alliance that largely defined the global order after World War II. Specifically, the president has argued for years that European nations should pay more for their own security. A NATO official speaking on the condition of anonymity told USA TODAY that member states agreed to a new formula this week for the organization's common funding, which covers the cost of a headquarters and some military operations. The move is largely symbolic because it is separate from the defense spending Trump focuses\u00a0on. The U.S. has contributed about 22% of NATO's roughly\u00a0$2.5 billion in annual common fund costs. Defense officials told CNN the Trump administration sought to reduce its contribution to roughly 16%, a roughly $150 million difference. \"Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European Allies and Canada will go up\u00a0while the U.S. share will come down,\" the NATO official said. \"This is an important demonstration of Allies\u2019 commitment to the Alliance and to fairer burden-sharing.\" The move comes after French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist in an interview\u00a0this month that NATO was experiencing \"brain death,\" warning that the European members could no longer rely on U.S. leadership. German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the remarks as \"drastic words\" that did not reflect her view. More:What is NATO and why is President Trump slamming it? Trump has long complained about cost-sharing with the alliance. Most of those complaints have focused on countries that are not meeting\u00a0the goal of spending 2% of economic output on\u00a0defense budgets, a goal\u00a0NATO members agreed to\u00a0in 2014 during the Obama administration. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 with Europe still reeling from the devastation of World War II. Concerned about communist expansion in Europe and the increased capability of enemies to reach across the Atlantic,\u00a0the U.S., Canada and other nations embraced a system of collective defense. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump will meet with allies on the outskirts of London on\u00a0Dec. 3-4 for the annual NATO meeting. They will discuss a wide variety of strategic economic and security issues: threats from cyberspace, terrorism, Syria's 8-year-old civil war, China's growing military might, an assertive Russia, space warfare and more.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump made a previously unannounced visit Thursday to Dover Air Force Base to honor the remains of two returning Army officers  killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Chief Warrant Officer 2s David C. Knadle, 33, of Texas, and Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr., 25, of Hawaii, died Wednesday when their helicopter crashed as they provided cover to\u00a0ground troops in Eastern Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. The visit is\u00a0Trump\u2019s third to witness a dignified transfer ceremony at the Delaware base and it comes as he has been increasingly vocal in describing the emotional scenes\u00a0associated with meeting the parents of fallen soldiers. Trump has described those meetings in detail to explain his desire to withdraw troops from the Middle East. The president\u00a0stood silently and saluted as he watched service members carry the two transfer cases to a waiting vehicle.\u00a0The soldiers wore Army fatigues, white gloves and black berets. The ceremony, perhaps the most somber duty for any president,\u00a0was not on Trump's public schedule. The president did not take questions from reporters. As he boarded Marine One,\u00a0Trump was accompanied by actor\u00a0Jon Voight, who received a\u00a0National Medal of Arts earlier in the day at the White House. Voight was also seen by reporters at Dover who were traveling with the president. The visit comes as the president faces the threat of impeachment in the House, where Democrats are holding a series of hearings to assess whether he held up nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv into opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump last visited Dover in January to meet with relatives of four U.S. service members killed in an attack in Syria. In 2017, just days after taking office, Trump traveled to Dover to receive the remains of a U.S. Navy seal killed in Yemen. The president faced bipartisan backlash this fall for ordering the withdrawal of virtually all 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. At the same time, however, the president is sending tanks, armored vehicles and the soldiers attached to those weapons to Syrian oil fields. Trump described his impression\u00a0of the solemn service in a series of remarks last month in an effort to\u00a0underscore his call to reduce U.S. military engagement overseas. \u201cAnd that door came down, and there\u2019s five soldiers on each side \u2013 beautiful soldiers, beautiful \u2013 and a coffin with a flag on it,\u201d Trump said during a speech Oct. 14. \"And that door opened, and you would hear screams and cries like you've never heard before, actually.\u00a0Like we\u2019ve never heard \u2013 like I\u2019ve never heard before.\" Contributing: Tom Vanden Brook",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump sought to escape the deluge of negative headlines pouring out of impeachment hearings in Washington on Wednesday by heading to Texas to turn the spotlight on one of his favorite topics: the economy. Trump traveled to Austin, where he joined Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook on a tour of the plant where Apple produces its Mac Pro desktop computer. Trump\u2019s trip coincided with Apple\u2019s announcement that it is beginning construction on a new $1 billion campus in Austin and the company\u2019s decision last month to assemble the high-end Mac Pro in Austin. The company had reportedly been considering moving production to Asia but said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to waive tariffs on certain parts made in China as one of the reasons for its decision to keep producing the computer in Texas. Trump cast the trip as part of his effort to get people to build in the United States, not in other countries, particularly China. \u201cWhen you build in the United States, you don\u2019t have to worry about tariffs,\u201d he said, standing next to Cook. During the plant tour, Trump looked over an unfinished Mac Pro computer while Cook pointed out the device\u2019s different parts. A worker explained part of the assembly process then held up the bottom of a computer to show the inscription: \u201cAssembled in the USA.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we want,\u201d Trump said. More:Highlights from Sondland's testimony: 'Rudy was the guy' driving Trump's Ukraine aims Repeating one of his frequent talking points, Trump said the country is doing well, \u201cespecially from the standpoint of the economy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the strongest economy in the world right now,\u201d replied Cook, who has maintained a warm relationship with Trump while others in the tech industry have been quick to criticize the president. But the rapport between Trump and Cook has not always been smooth. Cook has publicly criticized Trump\u2019s stance on climate change and other issues. In October, Trump went on a Twitter rant against Cook over Apple\u2019s decision two years ago to scrap the home button on new models of the iPhone. Trump also was ridiculed when, at a White House roundtable in March, he referred to Cook as \u201cTim Apple.\u201d Trump later claimed on Twitter that he used the moniker \u201cas an easy way to save time & words.\u201d Before Trump\u2019s arrival in Texas on Wednesday, Apple announced the start of construction on its new campus in Austin. The campus will be 3 million square feet and will initially house 5,000 employees but will have the capacity to grow to 15,000. The facility is expected to open in 2020. Apple said in September it would assemble the Mac Pro at the Austin campus by using parts from American companies. The company had considered moving production to Asia because of difficulty getting parts. But the Trump administration granted the company tariff exclusions on some parts, which allowed the company to get the parts it needs to produce the computer without paying tariffs. Even so, Apple said the new Mac Pro will be made with more than twice as many American-made parts previous models of the computer. Apple has been making Mac Pro computers in Texas since 2013. The product, which starts at a hefty $5,999, isn't one of its best sellers. The new model is scheduled for release this fall. Michael Collins and David Jackson cover\u00a0the White House.

On Monday, Trump tweeted that he would \"strongly consider\" testifying \"even\u00a0though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax.\" Trump was responding to suggestions by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats that he come before the committee conducting the impeachment inquiry. House Democrats are investigating evidence Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, and threatened to withhold aid if the Ukraine government did not follow through. In her CBS interview, Bondi said she understands why Trump would want to testify \u2013 \"he did nothing wrong\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0but attorneys would advise against it. \"The president should not testify,\" she said.

The advice\u00a0not to testify did not surprise legal analysts who said the president could not control the narrative within a House hearing room the way he can when speaking in public. \"In a hearing, on the other hand, skilled and experienced committee counsel will ask probing questions and pin him down on inconsistencies,\" said Barb McQuade, a former federal prosecutor and now a law professor at the University of Michigan. \"In that\u00a0setting, lies are crimes or impeachable offenses.\"",

Beginning Thursday, a Colorado school district dealing with an \"unprecedented spread of illness\" will close the doors to every one of its more than 40 schools. Mesa County Valley School District 51 announced\u00a0Wednesday all of its schools will be closed until after Thanksgiving break is over on Dec. 2. A statement quotes district nursing coordinator Tanya Marvin as saying a virus that is \"extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools.\" Later in the statement, Marvin spoke of \"a second, related virus that is affecting students.\" and\u00a0that \"the combination of the two has created an unprecedented spread of illness.\" The district, according to its website, serves more than 22,000 students and has 2,785 teachers and staff.",

      "content": "President Donald Trump will hold a meeting\u00a0Friday about the\u00a0use of e-cigarettes by young people and possible regulation, the White House said Wednesday night. Participants will include advocacy, industry, non-profits, medical associations\u00a0and state officials. \"As the President has said, there is a serious problem among our youth and their growing addiction to e-cigarettes,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \"The policy making process is not stalled \u2013 it continues to move forward. This meeting will allow the President and other Administration officials an opportunity to hear from a large group, representing all sides as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people.\u201d The planned meeting marks a restart of talks once scheduled then abruptly canceled earlier this\u00a0month. Vaping opponents, including the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, hadn't given up hope on administration action as they\u00a0pressed\u00a0Congress and states to enact bans. Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Sept. 7 announced a planned ban of all flavored e-cigarettes\u00a0other than tobacco and menthol. Such flavored products are attractive\u00a0to an increasing number of teen users. Last week, however, when advocates and industry were awaiting the\u00a0expected ban, Trump appeared to back off saying he would meet with interested parties. The statement came after\u00a0the Office of Management and Budget cancelled meetings with interest groups. As of Nov. 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,172 people so far injured and 42 dead. The CDC has linked to the injuries to vitamin E acetate, used as a thickening agent or to dilute THC oil in vape cartridges to make it go further. Tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, is the ingredient in cannabis that creates the \"high.\"",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will block possible\u00a0military\u00a0efforts to remove the Navy SEAL whose demotion over a war crimes charge he reversed last week. \"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident Pin,\" Trump tweeted. \"This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!\" The Navy late Thursday issued a statement acknowledging the tweet in which Trump called for them to halt the review that could banish Gallagher from the SEALs, but indicating they are waiting on a formal order. \"The Navy follows the lawful orders of the president,\u201d said the Navy\u2019s top spokesman, Rear Adm. Charlie Brown. \u201cWe will do so in case\u00a0of an order to stop the administrative review of (Special Operations Chief) Gallagher's professional qualification. We are aware of the President's tweet and we are awaiting further guidance.\" Gallagher is one of the three defendants in war crimes cases in which\u00a0Trump intervened last week, issuing pardons\u00a0to two soldiers and restoring Gallagher's rank and pay. Gallagher was accused of using a knife to murder\u00a0a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq\u00a0and of killing\u00a0other civilians.\u00a0A military court found Gallagher not guilty of the most serious charges\u00a0in July\u00a0but convicted him\u00a0of posing for a photo with the ISIS victim. The Navy has since said it plans to review\u00a0Gallagher's status as Navy SEAL, a decision that would likely result in Gallagher being removed from the elite commando community \u2013 the development Trump has vowed to block. The Navy's statement echoes the military\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s July 2017 tweet in which he called for a ban on the service of transgender troops. The tweet was acknowledged but the Pentagon waited for written orders before taking action. Since his acquittal, Gallagher has been a frequent critic\u00a0of the Navy, particularly fellow SEALs who testified against him. He has described top SEAL commanders as \"morons.\" While intervening in the Gallagher case, Trump has not pardoned him or vacated his court-martial conviction. He has acted to prevent punishment of Gallagher. Gallagher's\u00a0is one of several military justice cases\u00a0that have become major causes for\u00a0conservative commentators who say the men were treated unfairly. On Friday,\u00a0Trump also\u00a0pardoned Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who had been serving a 19-year sentence for ordering soldiers to fire on unarmed Afghan civilians, two of whom died. The president also granted a pardon to Maj. Matthew Golsteyn, who was charged with killing a suspected\u00a0bombmaker. In July,\u00a0Trump ordered the withdrawal of military awards for the Navy attorneys who prosecuted\u00a0Gallagher, saying they did an unfair\u00a0job. Critics have hit Trump for intervening in the cases, saying he is undermining the\u00a0military justice system. \"Trump's misuse of pardoning power does a real disservice to our troops,' tweeted Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., an Army veteran and top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He added, \"To quote\u00a0@SenJohnMcCain: 'What I do mourn is what we lose when by official policy or official neglect we confuse or encourage those who fight this war for us to forget that best sense of ourselves.'\"",

      "content": "The impeachment inquiry into the behavior of President Donald\u00a0Trump has reached a public phase, giving the American people their\u00a0first chance to reach their\u00a0own judgments. Two witnesses testified Wednesday before a House panel, including one who told of a cellphone call during which the president allegedly pushed to use America\u2019s national security apparatus to do his own political dirty work. Eight other witnesses have been scheduled. These include the U.S. diplomat on that call with Trump, at least one other person at the table listening in, and a decorated Army officer working for the National Security Council.\u00a0But many others aren\u2019t coming\u00a0because the Trump administration is engaged in what could only be categorized as stonewalling. The White House's refusal to provide witnesses, as well as much needed documentation, for a legitimate and serious congressional inquiry accomplishes little but undercut efforts by Republicans to come to Trump's\u00a0aid. One of the few coherent arguments that GOP lawmakers\u00a0could make Wednesday was that the witnesses were sometimes providing secondhand or thirdhand information. All the more reason, then,\u00a0to go to the source. But several of the key witnesses, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, are balking. OTHER VIEWS:Why would we try to be complicit in impeachment inquiry when we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about The rationale for the stonewalling is supposedly laid out in a letter White House counsel Pat Cipollone\u00a0sent to Congress last month. The\u00a0\"due process\" argument in that letter, however, has been superseded by events. A vote to authorize the inquiry has been taken, and once-private proceedings\u00a0are now public. Much of the rest of the rationale is baffling, unsupported\u00a0or circular in logic. It declares the inquiry to be invalid because testimony provided by credible witnesses under oath consists of \u201cfalsehoods and misinformation.\u201d It declares that Democrats fear they will lose the next election. And it throws in references to the Framers and the Constitution much like a high school student might do in hopes of getting a passing grade on an otherwise incomprehensible term paper. Surely, if Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president was as \"perfect\" as the president says,\u00a0the administration would want to tell its side of the story. Topping the list of people who should want to come forward is Mulvaney, who last month publicly affirmed\u00a0that Trump had conditioned security aid to Ukraine on the announcement of a\u00a0public investigation into the family\u00a0of former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cI have news for everybody,\u201d Mulvaney haughtily declared in the White House briefing room. \u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d The fact that Mulvaney later tried to walk back his jaw-dropping admission\u00a0only adds to the urgency of his testimony. Bolton, meanwhile, has found time to arrange a book contract and deliver paid speeches. The stonewalling\u00a0can only contribute to the perception that the administration knows it did wrong and is trying to hide that fact as much as it can. Ultimately, refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas might itself be impeachable conduct. If you can't see this reader\u00a0poll, please refresh your page.",

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., but added that \"what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process. The President has done nothing wrong and the Democrats know it.\" Nadler, in a statement announcing that the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Dec. 4, said Trump's lawyers would be allowed to attend and question witnesses. The hearing topic: How the Constitution applies to allegations of misconduct, including the definition of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that are the standard for impeachment of federal officials. \"Our first task is to explore the framework put in place to respond to serious allegations of impeachable misconduct like those against President Trump,\" Nadler said in a statement. Other evidence:While focus is on Ukraine, here's the evidence committees have compiled to bolster Trump impeachment case He gave\u00a0the White House until Sunday evening to respond to his offer. The White House refused to cooperate with the impeachment investigation conducted by the House Intelligence Committee, which held hearings on allegations that Trump improperly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate domestic political opponents. Democrats say Trump abused power by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate congressional Democrats,\u00a0including presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in the country. They also said Trump sought to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless it followed through with the investigations. Trump has denied wrongdoing, and accused congressional Democrats of conducting a political witch hunt. \"Radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart,\" Trump said during a political rally in Sunrise, Florida, on Tuesday",

      "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 A 33-year-old Chinese woman is likely to be on her way back to China after a federal judge on Monday sentenced her to eight months in prison for lying to get into Mar-a-Lago while President Donald Trump was visiting in March. In handing Yujing Zhang an eight-month sentence, U.S. District Judge Roy Altman noted that she has already spent nearly eight months in jail and should be released over the weekend. But\u00a0she won\u2019t immediately be on a plane to Shanghai. Altman said she must report to immigration officials for deportation. It is likely she will be picked up from the Florida\u00a0 jail where she has been held, and taken to Krome Detention Center south of Miami. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago:An oasis of support, fundraising as 2020 election, impeachment looms Zhang\u2019s sentencing hearing was delayed when confusion erupted over whether she had received documents Altman used to determine sentencing. Prosecutors and the probation office said they sent the documents to Zhang via certified mail. But\u00a0since she had recently been moved from a federal detention center in Miami to a county\u00a0 jail, Altman gave Zhang time to meet with a defense attorney she fired months ago when she decided to represent herself. But Altman made it clear that he was in charge. When Zhang said she had some questions for him, he shot back: \u201cYou don\u2019t have questions for me. You have answers for me.\u201d As Zhang did during her three-day trial in September when she was convicted of lying to a federal agent and gaining access to a restricted building, the self-described investment adviser represented herself. However, she allowed Assistant U.S. public defender Kristy Militello to sit by her side and speak on her behalf. Asked why she went to Mar-a-Lago, she said: \u201cI came there to meet president and maybe his family ... and make some other friends, too.\u201d Sneaking into Mar-a-Lago:Florida man sentenced for sneaking into Mar-a-Lago while Trump was there Assistant U.S. attorney Rolando Garcia urged Altman to impose an 18-month sentence, arguing that Zhang lied to everyone she encountered, including a U.S. magistrate. At a hearing before Magistrate William Matthewman shortly after her March 30 arrest, Zhang claimed she had only $5,000 in her U.S. bank account. However, an investigation showed she had $40,000 in a brokerage account along with $8,000 in cash in her hotel room, Garcia said. By handing her a lesser sentence recommended under federal guidelines, \u201cZhang\u2019s obstructive conduct in lying to the magistrate judge essentially goes unpunished,\u201d he wrote. More importantly, he said, the crime was a serious one. \u201cShe clearly knew she did not have permission to go on that property, yet she spent thousands of dollars and traveled halfway around the world\u201d to get into the club while Trump and his family were visiting. \u201cShe had an agenda.\u201d Trump lives in the White House:So, why is he moving to Florida? Zhang was arrested after convincing federal agents that she was a member of Trump\u2019s private club in Florida. Although she was wearing an evening dress and didn\u2019t have a bathing suit with her, U.S. Secret Service agents waved her in when she said she wanted to use the club pool. Once inside, she changed her story, agents said. Zhang told club managers she had come to Mar-a-Lago to attend a United Nations Friendship event. Knowing no such function was planned, club managers summoned agents. When they arrested her, Zhang was carrying a laptop, four cellphones, an external hard drive and a thumb drive in her purse, agents said. Later, when agents searched her room at The Colony hotel, they discovered cash along with credit cards, another cellphone, nine USB drives, five SIM cards and a device that can be used to detect hidden cameras. More:Trump at Mar-a-Lago as thousands march in D.C. White House applauds 'courageous young Americans' A search of her cellphone revealed that Zhang had been told that the so-called friendship event had been canceled before she left Shanghai. Charles Lee, a Chinese businessman who arranged the trip for Zhang, texted her that the event had been nixed. While he tried to interest her in rerouting her trip to attend an event with former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Zhang said she wasn\u2019t interested. Instead, she asked Lee for a $20,000 refund of the travel package. \u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d she texted back. \u201cNeed the money urgently. Go ahead and credit the money back to my account by this weekend.\u201d Yet\u00a0the next day,\u00a0she paid $2,000 for a flight and showed up at Mar-a-Lago anyway, Garcia said. \u201cShe was bound and determined to get on that property,\u201d Garcia told jurors during the trial. \u201cShe lied to everybody to get on that property.\u201d Supreme Court:Temporarily blocks access to Trump's tax, financial records while more legal papers filed Zhang isn\u2019t the first person to face charges this year for skirting security at Mar-a-Lago while Trump was visiting. A freshman at the University of Wisconsin\u00a0who was visiting his grandparents during last year\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday\u00a0wandered the grounds for 20 minutes before being stopped by federal agents. When 18-year-old Mark Lindblom pleaded guilty in May to a charge of gaining access to restricted grounds, he said he got into Mar-a-Lago by walking through a beach access point reserved for club members. He apologized profusely and was placed on probation by Matthewman. The ability of Zhang and Lindblom to bypass security at Mar-a-Lago raised questions about federal agents\u2019 ability to protect Trump while he is at the club he has dubbed the \"Winter White House.\" The Secret Service acknowledged that it doesn\u2019t determine who gets into the club, but screens visitors carefully to assure the president and his family are protected.

      "content": "Anyone who posts as many tweets as President Donald Trump is bound to have some typos here and there, but the president's typing errors tend to get more attention than those committed by the average user. That was the case on Sunday, when \"womem\" became a trending term on the social media site after the president sent out that misspelling in a retweet praising former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Trump later deleted the tweet and posted a new one with the correct spelling. \"I agree Katrina, Pam Bondi is a great womem!\" Trump wrote in his tweet, which shared a post from Katrina Campins, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice.\" Campins said she had the \"utmost respect\" for Bondi. \"Not only did she serve as the first woman Attorney General for Florida but she is a class act who is kind to other women regardless of her undeniable success. True strength,\" she wrote. Earlier this month, the White House announced Bondi was joining the administration in a temporary role to handle\u00a0\"proactive impeachment messaging and other special projects as they arise.\" As attorney general, Bondi was criticized by Democrats\u00a0for not conducting a fraud investigation into Trump University after a review of consumer complaints against the for-profit real estate program. Critics pointed out the decision not to investigate the school came around the time Bondi received a $25,000 campaign contribution\u00a0from Trump, though both denied wrongdoing. Although the \"womem\" typo was not on the level of some Trump's other spelling gaffes \u2013such as the mysterious covfefe tweet\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and it's easy to see how one could mistakenly hit the \"m\" instead of the adjacent \"n\" key, Twitter users were quick to mock the president's mistake.

      "content": "On Saturday, March 14, 2020, hundreds of well-coiffed women and homeless dogs will descend on Mar-a-Lago for a rescue-pup fundraiser. The charity event will be chaired by an unlikely pair of animal lovers: Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and arguably his biggest fan, and Georgina Bloomberg, daughter of billionaire Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, long-loathed and publicly mocked by President Donald Trump. The peculiar pairing of Lara Trump and Georgina Bloomberg is just one of the oddities that can be expected during what has come to be known in Palm Beach as \u201cTrump Season.\u201d The 2019-2020 season \u2014 the fourth since Trump was elected in 2016 \u2014 begins Tuesday, when Trump is expected to arrive in Palm Beach for the family\u2019s annual Thanksgiving dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The roster of events for this season at the president\u2019s private club punctuates a trend that began more than a year ago: Mar-a-Lago\u2019s transition from a mecca for philanthropic event to a hub for political gatherings by groups that support the president. And although each season has generated plenty of headlines, from addressing a major national security problem with a world leader on the terrace at Mar-a-Lago to a Chinese national sneaking into the club, this season Trump comes to Palm Beach in the midst of an historic attack on his presidency. He likely will bring the angst and furor he has vented on Twitter about the impeachment hearings, legal efforts to acquire his tax returns, and criticism from Fox News. Sneaking in:Man sentenced for sneaking into Mar-a-Lago while Trump was there Trump has already made 25 visits to Mar-a-Lago but this season could see more frequent trips. As impeachment hearings intensify, Trump could use his walled, weekend retreat to escape Washington. Already he has scheduled back-to-back weekend visits, returning the weekend after Thanksgiving for the state GOP\u2019s annual Statesman's Dinner.As fundraising ramps up for the 2020 election, Trump will likely use Mar-a-Lago as a venue to lure big-dollar donors to exclusive fundraising events. More political spending and revenue for Mar-a-Lago can be expected as 2020 campaigns ramp up. \u201cI would hope so and expect so,\u201d longtime Republican fundraiser and Trump confidant Brian Ballard, managing partner of the lobbying powerhouse Ballard Partners, told The Post earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s where folks want to be and as far as hospitality, it\u2019s a first class venue.\u201d Why Florida?:It's the road to the White House Michael Barnett, chairman of the Republican Party of Palm Beach County, said he, too, expects \u2014 and hopes \u2014 to see more of the president. \u201cAs important as Florida is, the largest swing state in the country, I expect him down in Florida a lot - not just Palm Beach County,\u201d Barnett said, adding that the local party plans to hold its annual Lincoln Day Dinner at Mar-a-Lago again this year. \u201cWe have had great fundraisers there.\u201d Of the $1.2 million political groups have spent at Mar-a-Lago, Trump is his own best customer. Trump\u2019s campaign has paid Mar-a-Lago $650,000 to use his club since he celebrated his Super Tuesday win at Mar-a-Lago. Most of the charities that canceled their high-society, big dollar fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago the past two seasons after Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d at a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 are still are shunning the president\u2019s private club. Again this year, those events will be replaced by pro-Trump groups that had never been seen at Mar-a-Lago before Trump was elected. That trend recently grabbed national headlines when ACT for America, a grassroots national security group with a long history of anti-Muslim rhetoric, booked an event and Mar-a-Lago. News of the group\u2019s fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago drew swift criticism from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization also known as CAIR, which considers ACT for America a hate group that spreads fear and misinformation. In the outrage that followed, the Trump Organization canceled the event. \u201cThis group absolutely will not be hosting their event at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, wrote in an email to The Post. But that did not stop the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C., think-tank with a history of anti-Muslim rhetoric, from booking its annual Flame Dinner at Mar-a-Lago on November 23. The Mar-a-Lago member who agreed to sponsor the event is Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, a West Palm Beach resident who is a friend of the president. The event has not been canceled, despite complaints from CAIR. Another pro-Trump group that partied at Mar-a-Lago last year and is likely to return is Turning Point USA. The group, headed by Trump super-fan Charlie Kirk, held a dinner at Mar-a-Lago during its annual Student Action Summit in West Palm Beach in December. The event is considered the nation\u2019s largest gathering of young conservatives and this year featured speakers include Donald Trump, Jr., and Fox News personalities Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. Orphan\u2019s Promise, a charity of the Christian Broadcasting Network, may also make a return appearance. The group founded by televangelist Pat Robertson, held its inaugural Dream Gala in February. The Trumpettes USA Inc., the self-proclaimed \u201cnumber one support group\u201d for President Donald Trump, has scheduled its fourth annual bash at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 1 \u2014 Super Bowl eve. The choice date all but guarantees that next year\u2019s event will be on a weekend when Trump will be at his private club to host his third Super Bowl party as president. What is certain is that taxpayers will foot the bill for the president\u2019s travel and security. The Government Accountability Office released a report in February that assessed Trump\u2019s first four trips to Mar-a-Lago as president. Those travels took place in early 2017: February 3-6, February 10-12, February 17-20 and March 3-5. The total? Just under $14 million, for an average cost of $3.4 million per trip. That includes about $8.5 million spent by the Department of Defense and $5 million by the Department of Homeland Security. It also includes about $60,000 paid directly to Mar-a-Lago itself, $24,000 of which was for lodging for Pentagon personnel and $36,000 for operational space used by DHS, according to a report in the Washington Post. That figure does not include the costs to local taxpayers for law enforcement overtime and special equipment needed to protect the president. Providing security for Trump when he visited the West Palm Beach area during the 2018-19 fiscal year cost the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office more than $3.86 million in overtime \u2014 the second-highest accrual the sheriff\u2019s office has racked up in the three years Trump has been president. The town of Palm Beach police department reported it racked up $13,769.50 in overtime pay during presidential visits in the most recent fiscal year, whereas West Palm Beach police had nearly $60,000 in overtime pay during the same time. The federal government reimburses most of those costs to local governments. Mar-a-Lago secure?:FBI examines whether President Trump's resort is vulnerable to foreign spies Town of Palm Beach Mayor Gail Coniglio said the town is prepared for Trump\u2019s return. Coniglio said she has not heard whether Trump will spend more time at Mar-a-Lago this season, but she does expect there will be more activity by Trump supporters and opponents. Locals can expect more of the same during the president\u2019s winter visits: Pontoon gunships patrolling the Intracoastal waterway near Mar-a-Lago; national and international news networks establishing base camps in a parking lot at a West Palm Beach park; and local police and deputies racking up thousands of dollars in overtime. There will be the usual evening road closures and traffic jams near Palm Beach International Airport when Air Force One lands and A1A, the oceanfront road runs in front of Mar-a-Lago, will be closed, forcing detours through downtown West Palm Beach. Also facing an inconvenience will be members of the Bridge Family, ardent Trump supporters who wave signs, flags and chant slogans on a corner they have staked out along the president\u2019s motorcade route from PBIA to Mar-a-Lago. Their corner is under construction, leaving them with two choices: Move across the street, where Trump protesters gather, or find another spot along the motorcade route. \u201cCome December we\u2019re going to figure out what to do, where to go,\u201d said Willy Guardiola, chairman for the county\u2019s Trump rallies and sign waving events. One thing is certain, Guardiola said. They will find a new location. Also returning to Palm Beach is Mad Dog PAC, the political pranksters responsible for the anti-Trump billboard along the motorcade route. The group\u2019s 2018 message was \u201cIMPEACHMENT NOW\u201d blazoned on a billboard along Southern Boulevard. This year, the group posted bright red sign with three letters \u2014 GOP \u2014 the acronym for the Republican Party. But the O is replaced by a hammer and sickle, the Russian symbol of proletarian solidarity. You're hired:How well does Trump know $1 million donors like Gordon Sondland? Some now work for him",

      "content": "FORT WORTH, Texas\u00a0\u2014 An English teacher who was fired after tweeting to President Donald Trump that her Texas high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark\u2019s tweet was protected by the First Amendment, the\u00a0Fort Worth Star-Telegram\u00a0reported. Morath also determined that Clark is entitled to back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year\u2019s salary. \u201cIt appears the commissioner ruled the way he did based on a technicality and we are exploring all of our options,\u201d said Barbara Griffith, a spokeswoman for the school district. \u201cThis is all we are going to say right now, as we have not yet had a chance to review and analyze the entire decision.\u201d Clark\u2019s attorney, Brandon Brim, didn\u2019t respond to the newspaper\u2019s request for comment. Under state law, the district has 20 days to ask for a hearing, based on a specific problem it feels was ignored. If that request is filed, the Texas agency would have 45 days to rule on the request. Beyond that, any additional appeal would come in the form of a lawsuit in district court. Earlier this year, several tweets from a Twitter account that used Clark\u2019s name asked the president to crack down on student immigration at the school. One tweet asked him to help remove \u201cillegals from Fort Worth.\u201d Her tweets sparked an outcry, and the district placed Clark on administrative leave in May. In June, the district board\u00a0unanimously voted\u00a0to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump\u2019s eyes and that she didn\u2019t realize her tweets could be seen by the public. The Twitter account has since been deleted. In August, an independent hearing examiner suggested that the board reinstate Clark after finding her job termination unjustifiable. But the board rejected the recommendation and upheld the decision to fire her. \u201cWe stand by our decision because we firmly believe this is in the best interest of all students,\u201d Superintendent Kent P. Scribner said. It wasn\u2019t the first time Clark\u2019s job was in jeopardy. In 2013, the board voted to fire her over her language and behavior toward students, but a teachers group intervened and helped resolve the situation.",

Yujing Zhang could face up to six years for unlawfully entering the Palm Beach, Florida, club in March and lying to Secret Service agents who confronted her. Authorities did not charge Zhang\u00a0with espionage, but her arrest prompted an investigation into\u00a0potential intelligence vulnerabilities at the resort Trump has called his \"Winter White House.\" Although Trump was visiting Mar-a-Lago on the weekend she passed a security checkpoint, he\u00a0was playing golf at a nearby course at the time of her arrival. Zhang has been jailed since federal agents arrested her after finding\u00a0two passports, four cellphones and a laptop on her person in addition to the infected thumb drive. Authorities found more cash and electronics in her hotel, according to a federal criminal complaint. Mar-a-Lago managers let her into the club because they thought she might be the daughter of a member with the same last name, according to the complaint. During her trial, Agent Krystle Kerr testified that Zhang said she was there to visit the pool, despite not carrying a swimsuit. She later told a receptionist she was there for a United Nations event, but the woman knew no such event was scheduled and alerted the Secret Service. Then, Zhang told\u00a0Agent Sam Ivanovich she was there for a\u00a0Chinese-American event,\u00a0Ivanovich testified.\u00a0After a search, Ivanovich said Zhang lied again, saying she never told Kerr she was there to visit the pool. 'Serious national security implications':FBI is examining whether President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort is vulnerable to foreign spies Prosecutors requested that\u00a0U.S. District Judge Roy Altman hand down an 18-month prison sentence to Zhang, a\u00a033-year-old Shanghai consultant. She acted as her own attorney during a\u00a0trial two months ago and has not filed anything regarding sentencing. Text messages outlined at her trial and posted to her court file after her conviction suggest she is obsessed with wealth and had hoped to meet the president or his family to discuss possible business deals, along with other U.S. executives. Zhang's\u00a0arrest came\u00a0at a time when Chinese entrepreneurs in South Florida had launched consulting businesses offering to sell Chinese clients access to Trump and his family members. GY US Investments LLC's website, for example, claimed clients could\u00a0\u201chave the opportunity to interact with the president\u201d and other \u201cpolitical figures.\" It's 'Trump Season':Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago is an oasis of support, fundraising as 2020 election, impeachment loom House and Senate Democrats asked the\u00a0Governmental Accountability Office\u00a0to study Mar-a-Lago security after Trump discussed\u00a0national security matters \u2013 in front of club guests \u2013 with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February 2017.\u00a0A club member posted pictures of Trump and Abe discussing a North Korean missile launch and looking at documents at a table on the dining terrace. The Secret Service has said there is no system for keeping track of Mar-a-Lago guests, including those who speak to Trump.

      "content": "The former Navy secretary who was forced out over his handling of convicted SEAL Eddie Gallagher's case\u00a0is speaking out about President Donald Trump's \"shocking and unprecedented\" involvement\u00a0and being pressured to leave. Richard Spencer was asked to resign\u00a0by Defense Secretary Mark Esper after expressing his concerns about the war crimes case. Spencer objected to Trump becoming involved and publicly ordering the Navy to allow Gallagher to keep his rank. \"This was a shocking and unprecedented intervention in a low-level review,\" Spencer wrote in The Washington Post on Wednesday.\u00a0\"It was also a reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices.\" Gallagher was acquitted of stabbing an ISIS prisoner and other charges\u00a0but was found guilty of posing for photos with the corpse of the prisoner. His demotion in rank was reversed by Trump, and he was allowed to retire. Spencer said he pushed back against Trump's interest in the case. Timeline:How Trump intervened in the Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's war crimes case Spencer also said on CBS on Monday in his first interview after leaving his post\u00a0that the reversal of Gallagher's sentence sends the message to troops\u00a0\"that you can get away with things. We have to have good order and discipline. It's the backbone of what we do.\" Esper accused Spencer of going over his head when Spencer talked directly with the White House about a negotiation to settle Gallagher's case. \"I also began to work without personally consulting Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on every step. That was, I see in retrospect, a mistake for which I am solely responsible,\" Spencer wrote Wednesday. In the letter Spencer wrote as his final word as Navy secretary, he did not say he was resigning. \"I hereby acknowledge my termination,\" he wrote. Spencer has maintained that he was fired. Trump's irregular involvement, Spencer said, came early on in the Gallagher case, and Trump contacted him repeatedly to advocate for the SEAL.\u00a0\"I came to believe that\u00a0Trump\u2019s interest in the case\u00a0stemmed partly from the way the defendant\u2019s lawyers and others had worked to keep it\u00a0front and center in the media,\" Spencer said. More:Trump ramps up attacks on 'deep state,' focuses on Pentagon amid Eddie Gallagher controversy Spencer said\u00a0it is important for the American public to understand Navy procedures: \"Our system of military justice has helped build the world\u2019s most powerful navy; good leaders get promoted, bad ones get moved out and criminals are punished.\" \"More importantly, Americans need to know that 99.9 percent of our uniformed members always have, always are and always will make the right decision,\" he wrote. \"Our allies need to know that we remain a force for good, and to please bear with us as we move through this moment in time.\" Trump has defended his actions, declaring that\u00a0\"I have to protect my\u00a0war fighters.\" His comments came the day after Spencer's ouster. \"I think what I'm doing is sticking up for our armed forces,\" Trump said.

      "content": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect recent White House policy actions on Israel, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement Nov. 18\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. would be shifting\u00a0its position\u00a0on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights \u2013\u00a0It's been branded a hollow public relations exercise. It may not actually get built. It's surrounded by hostile military land. And as for the well-known preference for luxury real estate and trademark bling of the family whose name it would ultimately bear, it almost certainly won't be a shining example anytime soon. But a planned Israeli community named \"Ramat Trump\"\u00a0in Hebrew, or \"Trump Heights,\" around\u00a012 miles from the Syrian border \u2013\u00a0right in the heart of territory the United States alone recognizes as legal Israeli territory \u2013\u00a0nevertheless encapsulates a defining tenet of U.S. foreign policy: Every American president in modern times, citing shared history and values and an unshakeable security commitment, has been staunchly pro-Israel. President Donald Trump perhaps more than most. \"Trump's a true friend of Israel,\"\u00a0said Haim Rokach, the head of the Golan Heights Regional Council that is overseeing the fledgling \"Trump Heights\" initiative in Bruchim, a shabby village, population\u00a0approximately\u00a07-10, that is part of Kela Alon, a larger adjoining community of 80-90 families who are predominantly secular Israeli Jews. \"There's no question Trump's voice on Israeli\u00a0affairs has been a good thing for us,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Dulan abu-Saleh, the mayor of the largest Druze town in the Golan Heights. Druze are an esoteric religious sect of Islamic origin, but characterized by an eclectic system of doctrines. About 25,000 live in the Golan Heights. Many more reside\u00a0in Lebanon and Syria. \"Trump's been a stabilizing force,\" said abu-Saleh. For the second time in less than six months, Israelis failed in September\u00a0to convincingly\u00a0back\u00a0a prime minister\u00a0in an election that highlighted the Jewish state's\u00a0complex secular-religious divide and pitted its longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,\u00a0against Benny Gantz, the hawkish former head of\u00a0Israel's military. Results showed that neither politician's party secured a majority, meaning that in order for either\u00a0to form a government each would need to\u00a0enter into a coalition deal with\u00a0opposition parties. Forming a coalition has proved difficult. Netanyahu failed to form a government in a vote in April, which set up September's\u00a0election do-over. He has been unable to\u00a0form a coalition with his political rivals after the September vote. Gantz is making a final bid to\u00a0assemble a governing coalition before a Wednesday deadline. If he, too, fails, a third vote may be called. Netanyahu is\u00a0a former commando whose tenure has been defined by repeated promises to keep Israel secure and prosperous, while sidelining Palestinians. He could see his decade-long dominance of the country's\u00a0polarized politics abruptly end. Among major industrialized\u00a0powers, only Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and German leader Angela Merkel have led for longer. Moshe Maoz, a Middle East\u00a0expert\u00a0at Hebrew University, in Jerusalem, said\u00a0a central issue in the election is competing views over how Jewish a state Israel should be\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and what it means anyway to be Jewish in a modern country that is more democratic, more advanced technologically and more powerful militarily than any of its Middle Eastern rivals who surround it, some of whom are bent on its destruction. The issue has come to the fore in the past two elections amid growing resentment over whether ultra-Orthodox Jews should continue to be exempt from military service and benefit from religiously-tinged state subsidies and other perceived advantages. \"This is\u00a0a vote about who Israelis want to be, and Israel's trajectory,\" said Maoz. Jacob Berger, 49, a property developer who lives in Jerusalem and leads an\u00a0ultra-Orthodox lifestyle, said that Israel's secular Jews were trying to assert control over how people like him educate their children, when they work and how they mix with society. \"If those types of Jews want to spend all their time at the beach in Tel Aviv, that's fine with me,\" he said. \"What they shouldn't\u00a0do is tell me and my family how to live.\" According to data published by the Pew Research Center, \"a nonpartisan fact tank,\"\u00a0in 2016, 81%\u00a0of Israel's 8.7 million citizens identify as Jewish, with the remaining 19% split among Arab Muslims (14%), Druze (2%), Christians (2%) and no religion (1%). Among those who identify as Jewish, approximately 40%\u00a0are secular; 18%\u00a0are Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox; and the remainder observe a medium level of religious strictness on issues such as marriage, military conscription and gender segregation. Berger, originally from Belgium, is part of the 18%. He opposes many modern values and practices. Israel's do-over vote took place because while Netanyahu's\u00a0Likud Party won the most seats in April, he didn't win a majority and\u00a0wasn't able to form a government. Poles apart:Jared Kushner meets with Israeli leader amid political chaos But the situation is fluid. Netanyahu's strongest rival for prime minister is Gantz, the leader of the self-described centrist Blue and White Party. Gantz, 59, is a former head of the Israel Defense Forces. He has bragged about flattening entire residential neighborhoods during two wars Israel fought in the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian enclave on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea that is ruled by Hamas, which the U.S. and other countries, partly or as a whole, have designated a terrorist organization. Coalition governments are commonplace in Israel politics. Netanyahu would need\u00a0the support of religious and nationalist parties to stay in power. Gantz would likely need to enter\u00a0a coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, Israel\u2019s hawkish ex-defense minister. Lieberman, 61, is an immigrant from the former Soviet Union and\u00a0heads the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu Party. His is also an ultra-nationalist settler. And settlements, communities of Jews who move to Palestinian areas in the West Bank, a separate self-governing area that is administered by the Fatah-run Palestinian National Authority but effectively subject to Israeli military control, are illegal under international law. They are also considered to be a major impediment to peace in the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has been running for more than 70 years. Never-ending conflict:Palestinians step up rocket attacks as Israel strikes Gaza Netanyahu has tried to capitalize on his close relationship with Trump. Indeed, it was his idea to \"honor\" the U.S. president with \"Trump Heights.\" It marks the first time that Israel has named a new community after a U.S. leader since President Harry Truman. According to documents featured in his presidential library, Truman weighed \"personal, political and strategic concerns\" in 1948 when he went against the advice of the State Department and recognized the new Jewish state. Then-U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall feared, correctly as it turned out, that any new Jewish state would be immediately attacked by its Arab enemies. It could also jeopardize American access to oil. Truman believed it was a risk worth taking. Today, \"Kfar Truman\" is a moshav or village in central Israel. (In 2008, \"George W. Bush Plaza,\" a modest square in central Jerusalem, was dedicated to the former U.S. president by a private foundation for his support for the Israeli people.) \"Trump has probably been the most pro-Israel president since Harry Truman recognized Israel,\" political analyst Bill Schneider told news outlet\u00a0The Hill in July. Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), a Washington, D.C.-based pro-Israel think tank, said that he views Trump's pro-Israel stance as more of a historical \"reversion to the norm\" after eight years of President Barack Obama. Obama and Netanyahu had a difficult political chemistry. Israel's leader felt abandoned by Obama's stewardship of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which Israel strongly opposed. Makovsky conceded that Trump has \"gone beyond\" other presidents on Israel. In fact, Trump has dismantled many of the widely held assumptions\u00a0of the U.S. and international foreign policy establishment when it comes to Israel. He relocated the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the holy city that Palestinians claim as part of their future capital. He withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement.While most western powers view Iran's nuclear activities as a considerable threat, for Israel, its proximity to the Islamic Republic and Tehran's periodic vows to \"annihilate\" the Jewish state mean that Iran is a daily existential worry. \"Netanyahu has basically been telling Israelis that the nuclear agreement will lead to another Holocaust, although he never uses that word,\" said Amos Yadlin, a former senior military intelligence officer with the Israel Defense Forces, and now executive director of Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies. Yadlin said\u00a0while the deal was not perfect because many of its restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities were temporary, and it did not address Iran's ballistic missiles program or support for militant groups in Lebanon and Syria, he believes\u00a0it would have been better for Trump stay\u00a0in the deal for longer, coming out at a later date if needed. Ticking clock:Iran reduces nuke\u00a0deal compliance, warns over accord Trump has also overlooked Jewish settlement expansion on land claimed by Palestinians and on Monday his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, abruptly announced that the\u00a0U.S. would be shifting\u00a0its position, in place since 1978, on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. Trump has also closed the Palestinian Liberation Organization's mission\u00a0in Washington, D.C. \u2013 its de facto embassy\u00a0\u2013 and cut off U.S. funding to organizations that work on Palestinian issues. A long-promised Israeli-Palestinian peace plan from the White House has been drafted by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Israel advisers, Jason Greenblatt and Avi Berkowitz; and David Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. All four men have deep religious and educational ties\u00a0to Israel \u2013 factors that have undermined their legitimacy as honest brokers in the eyes of many Palestinians. In fact,\u00a0prior to taking up his ambassador role,\u00a0Friedman was president of the American Friends of Bet El Yeshiva Center, an organization that sponsors academic study\u00a0in\u00a0Bet El, an Israeli settlement that was established on Palestinian land in 1977. \"We see the Trump team as the Israeli team,\" said Khaldoun Barghouti, a Palestinian journalist and analyst of Israeli affairs from Ramallah in the West Bank, a landlocked area sandwiched between Israel's eastern frontier and the Jordan River Valley.\u00a0Israel places onerous security restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank that prevent many from traveling or\u00a0visiting friends and family in Jerusalem or Gaza. Israel says these restrictions, along with a West Bank security barrier and complex patchwork of fences and checkpoints, are necessary to stop suicide bombers. \"Security is always\u00a0our number one concern,\"\u00a0said Inna Rozman, 36, who works in Israel's high-tech sector and lives near\u00a0the border with the Gaza Strip, where Hamas-made rockets fired over the border into Israel are a regular\u00a0occurrence. \"The U.S. team consults extensively with Palestinian representatives and experts, including members of the Palestinian business, academic and philanthropic community, as well as those with close relationships with Palestinian leadership,\" an embassy spokesman told USA TODAY in emailed comments, replying to a question about\u00a0why there are\u00a0no Americans with links to Palestinians\u00a0involved in\u00a0the plan. \"The Jerusalem Embassy has deep and broad contacts within Palestinian society.\" Ambassador Friedman said that the\u00a0\"the\u00a0embassy move fulfilled the will of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives.\" He said that while the move\u00a0\"perhaps rais(es)\u00a0some friction in the short term, (it)\u00a0has created a foundation upon which real peace discussions may proceed.\" Still, Palestinians\u00a0insist there has been minimal outreach. \"Trump's so-called peace plan should be called the 'No Deal of the Century,'\" said Mustafa Barghouti, a former Palestinian lawmaker and onetime presidential candidate. \"Everything that has leaked about this plan, and every statement that has come from Trump's envoys have shown only that they are biased toward Israel, and that they are intending to fulfill and implement the exact ideas and wishes of Netanyahu,\" he said, noting\u00a0the Palestinian leadership has rejected the peace plan unseen\u00a0because it is not expected to address Palestinian demands for a political solution, for full statehood, and instead revolve around an \"economic vision\" for boosting the\u00a0economy. The White House has said the plan will\u00a0be released sometime after Tuesday's election. Greenblatt, the U.S. official in charge of Trump's peace plan, has announced he is stepping down. Trump fired his National Security Adviser John Bolton, an aggressively pro-Israel and anti-Iran advocate. What this means for Trump's overarching attitude toward Israel, the Palestinians and his\u00a0Middle East policy more generally is not clear. Trump-Bolton breakup was inevitable:They clashed over Iran, North Korea, more Meanwhile, the Trump administration has stayed relatively quiet over Netanyahu's election pledge to apply its sovereignty \u2013 annex \u2013 the northern Dead Sea and entire Jordan Valley, which runs through part of the West Bank and is home to around 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Israeli settlers, according to B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli humanitarian rights group. To do so, would amount to a serious escalation of the intractable Israeli-Palestinian struggle, said Maoz, the Middle East expert at Hebrew University. Trump has boosted Israel in other ways. In mid-September,\u00a0Trump\u00a0tweeted he spoke with Netanyahu to discuss moving forward with a possible mutual defense treaty between Israel and the U.S. that Makovsky, of JINSA, who is also a former Pentagon official and has been making recommendations to the U.S. and Israeli governments on the potential pact, said could operate in a similar way to NATO's Article 5: An attack on one member is an attack on all. \"Thank you my dear friend President @realDonaldTrump,\" Netanyahu tweeted in reply. \u00a0\"The Jewish State has never had a greater friend in the White House.\" Since the end of World War II, Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid, most of it for its military, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service, a government agency that provides research and analytical support to\u00a0Congress. For 2020, Trump has requested $3.3\u00a0billion in military aid for Israel, per the service. He has contemporaneously halted all aid to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. \"A lot of the infrastructure projects \u2013 schools, roads\u00a0\u2013 have just stopped,\" said Naser Qadous, a Palestinian who manages agricultural projects in the West Bank for Anera, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that works on development and refugee issues. Trump has also stood by denials from Israeli officials over claims that emerged last week that the country placed cellphone-surveillance devices near the White House. Allegations of spying on a close ally are\u00a0not unheard of, but\u00a0Trump's\u00a0muted response raised a few eyebrows:\u00a0\"I would find it really hard to believe,\" he said. Trump has also appeared to openly play\u00a0party politics when it comes to Israel. When he\u00a0discovered that Democratic lawmakers Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were planning to visit Israel and the West Bank last month, Trump urged Israel to prohibit access to the two elected members of Congress. Then, he applauded from the sidelines after Israel\u00a0initially banned the congresswomen from visiting the nation because of their support for a movement\u00a0that promotes various forms of\u00a0boycott\u00a0and sanctions against Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians. \"Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!\" Trump tweeted, after the decision. He has also said Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats are \"disloyal to Israel.\" When\u00a0Wayne Allyn Root, a\u00a0right-wing conspiracy theorist, likened Trump to a \"King of Israel,\" Trump thanked him in a tweet. Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, was later granted permission by Israel,\u00a0on humanitarian grounds, to visit her elderly\u00a0grandmother, who lives in the West Bank. She turned the opportunity down. 'Complete setup':Trump slams Tlaib over Israel\u00a0approval to see grandmother A Pew Research Center study in May found 42% t of U.S. Jews believe Trump favors Israelis too much. Although the same study found that 47%\u00a0of American Jews believe that Trump is \"striking the right balance between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Six percent said Trump was too biased toward the Palestinians. The remaining 4% weren't sure. The Golan Heights is a fertile region of cattle ranches, orchards and vineyards. The area is also filled with bunkers, tanks and impromptu war memorials. On its southwestern edge sits the Sea of Galilee, where Christians believe that Jesus performed miracles such as walking on water and feeding the multitude. While the Golan Heights\u00a0has been administered as part of Israel since 1981, the United Nations, European Union and all nations except the U.S.\u00a0consider it Israel-occupied Syrian territory. That's due to Trump, too. He drew international criticism when he signed a presidential proclamation acknowledging the validity of Israel's claim over the strategic plateau, which supplies Israel with a third of its water, on March 25. \"This should have been done, I would say, numerous presidents ago. But for some reason they didn't do it. I am very honored to have done it,\" Trump said in the Oval Office at the time, as he stood alongside a beaming Netanyahu. Netanyahu thanked Trump for his \"incredible support\" for Israel. Still, in Bruchim-Kela Alon, where it remains far from clear whether \"Trump Heights\" will get off the ground, Chicago-born David Katz was deeply bothered by what he sees as many Israelis' uncritical embrace of Trump because of his perceived pro-Israel stance. \"Did you hear that Trump wanted to buy Greenland and the Danes said 'thanks, but no thanks?' Well, he could get Israel for free. We'd love to be part of his kingdom,\" said Katz, 50, sarcastically, as he sat on the porch of his home in an area captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, a brief but bloody conflict between Israel and the Arab nations of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel emerged victorious. \"We don't need Trump or anyone else to recognize Golan for us. It's ours,\" said Katz, adding: \"If this village deserves to be named after anyone it should be (Menachem) Begin.\" He was referring to the founder of Netanyahu's Likud Party and Israel's sixth prime minister and leader when it asserted civil administration over the Golan Heights. Katz moved to Israel with his parents when he was three-years-old. He works as a horse trainer and cattle hand and lives with his wife and four daughters here. \"Bibi, our king, wants to give Trump, the Americans' king, something with his name on it,\" said Katz, joking. \"Bibi\" is Netanyahu's widely used nickname in Israel. Yet the idea of the Trump name presiding over an area ringed with dry, high yellow grass, weather-worn farming equipment, and where smoke and loud booms from Israel's frequent engagement with Iran-backed militants\u00a0in nearby Lebanon and Syria can be regularly seen and heard, is not without its ardent supporters. \"Trump's name will bring investment to our area for sure,\" insisted Hilik Dahan, 49, another Bruchim-Kela Alon resident who rents out vacation cabins next to his home. \"The Israel-U.S. alliance is the best in history,\" he said, repeating a variation on a phrase that can be heard over and over again in Israel: \"Trump is our true friend.\" Dahan added that he thinks most of Bruchim-Kela Alon's residents are broadly in favor of \"Trump Heights,\" although he does not think the question has been systematically posed outright to all the families who live in the community. Many don't want to say. But others with a stake in what happens here also claim a \"silent majority\" on the \"Trump Heights\" issue. And they are taking a page\u00a0out of the Trump-as-real-estate-magnate playbook. They have started legal action to prevent the development from moving ahead. They allege \"Trump Heights\" is little more than a brazen attempt by Israel's government to flatter a U.S. president who has shown himself to be especially susceptible to honeyed words of admiration from North Korea to Saudi Arabia. \"The whole idea is complete political bull****,\" said Uri Sitnik, 59, a carpenter and pottery maker who lives in the community and is helping to spearhead resistance to\u00a0\"Trump Heights,\" which Israel's opposition lawmakers\u00a0say has no\u00a0budget or plan. Sitnik shared official zoning documents with USA TODAY\u00a0that appeared to substantiate the claim, disputed by Rokach, the Golan Heights Regional Council chief, that \"Trump Heights\" will trample on the property rights of residents by claiming that Bruchim and Kela Alon are technically two separate places for development purposes. Rokach insists these residents are mistaken; that Bruchim was never part of Kela Alon. Still, for Katz, Sitnik and other secular Israeli Jews who live in the area, there is also another reason to push back against the proposal. It is one that mirrors some of the conversations about Israel's\u00a0election that have been taking place on the national stage \u2013about the separation of synagogue and state, and how to strike the right balance. \"This community is not a religious place,\" said Sitnik, referring to indications that \"Trump Heights\" has been earmarked as a community for modern Orthodox Jews. Ultra-religious Israeli Jews are a rare sight in the Golan Heights, an area according to Israeli statistics that's home to 50,000 people, including roughly 22,000 Jewish Israelis. \"When my parents emigrated to Israel, in those days it was still real Zionism compared to what's happening today,\" said Katz, the Israeli cowboy, who feels Israel's government has strayed from its path of being a homeland for Jews to one increasingly subject to special interests, whether commercial, religious or to\u00a0leaders like Trump. For now, \"Trump Heights\" amounts to a large gilded sign with the U.S. and Israeli flags intertwined and the name of the community written in English and Hebrew. This sign was unveiled with much fanfare during a ceremony in June attended by Netanyahu and Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel who is a former\u00a0lawyer for the Trump Organization, the president's private business. On the day of the ceremony, which took place in a carefully choreographed setting in Bruchim in front of Israel's press corps, Friedman described \"Trump Heights\" as a birthday president to Trump. The president had turned 73 a few days prior. Still, when USA TODAY\u00a0visited the area in early September not much was happening. The \"Trump Heights\" sign had been moved to the village's\u00a0dusty access road. It's now located across from a building that the area's\u00a0long-term dwellers had been hoping to turn into a small business park.\u00a0The land around it was recently cleared of mines. Israel's vote, Palestinian concerns, Iran \u2013 they weren't, but seemed a universe away. As did Trump. On the back of his sign, local graffiti artists had scrawled a few intriguing messages. \"Shlomo and Jacob were here,\" read one. \"Yankale: the traveling guitar player,\" said another. The last one, without exclamation, said: \"Oh my God.\"",

      "author": "Susan Page",
      "content": "OK, but who can win? In a marathon day, congressional Democrats\u00a0led explosive hearings to consider\u00a0whether the House should impeach President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 with almost no expectation that the Republican-controlled Senate would then vote to remove him from office. During a slow-starting Democratic debate in the evening, 10 presidential hopefuls finally got animated when they argued about how they would defeat Trump\u00a0\u2014 amid nervousness among many in the party that they could hand the president a second term by making the wrong choice. \"The issue isn't what is the fight; the issue is, how are we going to win?\" Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, suggesting that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, wouldn't be able to generate strong turnout among\u00a0African Americans, the party's most loyal voters. \"We have to rebuild the Obama coalition.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg's tenure as mayor of a small, Democratic-leaning city meant he could win in red and purple districts, as she has in Minnesota. \"He said the right words, but I have the experience,\" she said.\u00a0\"I think experience should matter.\" Buttigieg was ready for that charge. \"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small,\" he said. \"But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.\"\u00a0The focus on Buttigieg reflected his remarkable rise to the front\u00a0of the field in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire since the last debate,\u00a0in October. That made him a target. 'I thought you might have been high':Quips from candidates and other top moments from the November Democratic debate But the tone of the debate, sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post,\u00a0was largely civil, and the candidates'\u00a0efforts to draw sharp distinctions with one another more subdued than in previous forums. That may have reflected the sobering effect of the impeachment hearings, which have convinced many Democrats of two things: that Trump committed impeachable offenses, and impeachment is not likely to remove him from office. That is more likely to depend on the 2020 election. The evening was an object lesson in the way Trump and the impeachment debate are defining the moment, a reality likely to continue through the end of this year and into the\u00a0next. The House investigation of the president, and the Senate trial that would follow passage of Articles of Impeachment, are\u00a0taking the spotlight from and heightening the stakes for the Democrats who want to succeed him. All that has overshadowed the ideological divides in the sprawling field. Perhaps most notably,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorse Medicare for All, a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system that former Vice President Joe Biden called too radical to sell to swing voters or pass in Congress. But Democratic voters say their top concern isn't policy; it's\u00a0politics. In poll after poll, most say they care more about nominating a candidate who can win than they do about nominating one who agrees with them on issues. Scorecard:Here are the winners and losers from the Democratic debate On that front, there were some disquieting signs for Democrats in surveys released Wednesday before the debate.\u00a0A Marquette University Law School Poll\u00a0showed Trump for the first time surging ahead of the top four\u00a0Democrats in hypothetical head-to-head matchups in the crucial state of Wisconsin. And the Gallup Poll\u00a0showed Trump's national approval rating actually ticked up a bit as the impeachment hearings began, albeit to an anemic 43%. At the debate, Biden\u00a0argued he could not only win back the White House, but also help win back a Democratic majority in the Senate to make it possible to get things done. He noted his strong support among African Americans, though he stumbled in saying he has\u00a0been endorsed by \"the only black woman elected to the United States Senate.\" That was news to Harris, who is black. \"I'm right here!\" she interjected to laughter. Biden corrected himself, saying he had been endorsed by the first black woman elected to the Senate:\u00a0former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois. It was an unwelcome reminder of his tendency to stumble verbally. November debate:Donald Trump and allies attack Democratic candidates over impeachment drive The forum in Atlanta\u00a0opened about an hour\u00a0after the House Intelligence Committee concluded an impeachment hearing at which\u00a0Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor-turned-diplomat, testified\u00a0there had been a quid pro quo \u2014\u00a0a demand by the Trump team that nearly $400 million in military aid wouldn't be released until Ukraine announced investigations into unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden, the frontrunner, tried to spin even that\u00a0as a sign of his strength.\u00a0\"I learned that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee, that's pretty clear,\" he said. The presidential hopefuls fielded questions on addressing climate change, providing paid child care, protecting abortion rights, dealing with North Korea. But in a sign of how difficult it may be to command attention on the campaign trail while the impeachment proceedings continue on Capitol Hill,\u00a0the discussions seemed a little flat compared to the bombshells that had exploded during the day's hearings. Because the real question for Democrats is: Who can win?",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "By now, we\u2019ve all seen the video of Cleveland Browns player Myles Garrett beaning Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with his own helmet on Thursday night. On Friday, the NFL indefinitely suspended Garrett, and he\u2019ll be out for the rest of the season at least. This is, of course, grossly unfair. The play was beautiful, just watch the video for yourself. Garrett has been working hard to make Cleveland great again. He was the first pick in the 2017 overall draft and, obviously, a lot of teams have been working to overturn the results of that draft ever since. Everybody knew when Garrett was drafted that he was a counter-puncher and that if you hit him, he hits you back three times\u00a0as hard. That\u2019s what people love about him, that he\u2019s a fighter. Yes, he tore off Rudolph\u2019s helmet and hit him over the head with it when Rudolph wasn\u2019t looking, but Rudolph tried to remove Garrett\u2019s helmet first and Garrett has a right to defend himself! Sure, this wasn\u2019t in keeping with the rules, but the old rules don\u2019t apply anymore. All that matters is winning. Anything is fair game, as long as it benefits your team, or even just you. Everybody \u2014 certainly every Browns fan \u2014 should be defending Myles Garrett to the hilt. Because nothing is ever more important than your team. Look at President Donald Trump. He did pretty much the same thing to former\u00a0 Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Friday when he attacked her right in the middle of her congressional testimony at the impeachment hearing by tweeting, \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t a cheap shot when she wasn\u2019t looking, I don\u2019t know what is. This all does seem sort of amusing \u2014 you can imagine my reaction when I saw that \"Saturday Night Live\" had \u201cstolen\u201d this analogy and used it in a\u00a0cold open that ended with \"Garrett\u201d bopping \u201cRudy Giuliani\u201d in the head with his helmet \u2014\u00a0but it\u2019s not. Trump\u2019s scorched earth defense is damaging real people, good people, who deserve better. Yovanovitch had a distinguished career serving American interests under both Republicans and Democrats in some of the most stressful, unpleasant and occasionally dangerous places on earth. You would think this\u00a0would provide her with pretty solid protection. But President Trump, Garrett-style, tore that helmet off and beat her with it, claiming that she was responsible for the difficult conditions in the countries where she served rather than honoring her for her\u00a0service. It\u2019s pretty much the equivalent of blaming the military team that took out the leader of the Islamic State terrorist organization,\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for the civil war in Syria. Impeachment:Government deep state isn't what you think, and America really needs it Trump\u2019s attack on Yovanovitch wasn\u2019t all that surprising considering that he had already trashed her on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and had apparently countenanced an utterly despicable campaign to get her recalled from her position as ambassador. It\u2019s true that ambassadors serve at the president\u2019s pleasure and that he should have confidence in their abilities. But when an ambassador is removed because she\u2019s not going along with half-baked conspiracy theories and because she\u2019s trying to keep U.S.-Ukraine relations on an even keel despite Giuliani\u2019s ham-handed efforts to freelance his own apparently illegal foreign policy, well, we\u2019ve got a problem. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council Ukraine expert who was on the call with Zelensky, is one of eight witnesses scheduled to appear at impeachment hearings this week. Trump and his sycophants have already sneered at Vindman's honesty and questioned his patriotism\u00a0and service. We can expect more of the same when he testifies publicly on Tuesday. Impeachment drama: Trump abuses power by intimidating witnesses like Yovanovitch What Trump is doing to these dedicated public servants might not be impeachable, but it is certainly vile. What\u2019s even more vile is the Republican response, which, with very few exceptions, has been nothing but\u00a0crickets.\u00a0This isn\u2019t about politics;\u00a0it\u2019s about basic human decency. If you\u2019re willing to stand by and look the other way when a powerful bully\u00a0torments a decent person just for trying to do their\u00a0duty,\u00a0there\u2019s really no other way to put this: You\u00a0suck. A fish rots from the head. Dirty, baseless attacks seem to be the order of the day in Trump\u2019s America. While the stakes may be different, Myles Garrett\u2019s vicious attack on Mason Rudolph is far too similar to Trump\u2019s attack on Ambassador Yovanovitch for moral comfort. If you are OK\u00a0with one and not the other, maybe you should ask yourself why.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump left many people scratching their heads\u00a0after he decried a movement, which no one appeared to be aware of,\u00a0to rename Thanksgiving, during\u00a0a rally in Florida Tuesday night. \"You know, some people want to change the name Thanksgiving. They don't want to use the term Thanksgiving,\" the president told the crowd of supporters, without explaining what he was referring to. \"That was true also with Christmas,\u00a0but now everybody's using Christmas again. Remember, I said that?\" he said, comparing\u00a0the shadowy threat to the gluttonous day's\u00a0moniker to his dubious claim that people had stopped telling each other \"Merry Christmas\" until he was elected. \"Now, we're going to have to do a little\u00a0work on Thanksgiving. People have different ideas why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving,\" he said, again without elaborating on the identity of the feast's alleged detractors. \"But everybody in this room I know loves the name Thanksgiving and we're not changing it,\" he defiantly declared. Trump's claim confounded many observers. Even the\u00a0hosts of \"Fox & Friends,\" who are generally credulous when it comes to the president, appeared skeptical on Wednesday morning's show. \"I don't think there's a huge push to change the name of Thanksgiving. Is there?\" asked co-host Brian Kilmeade. Co-host Steve Doocy suggested Trump may have been referring to a debunked 2015 hoax that claimed then-President Barack Obama was changing the holiday's name to \"Celebrate Immigrants Day.\" But Fox News has promoted the idea of a \"War on Thanksgiving\" and that college liberals want to \"cancel Thanksgiving\" for weeks, according to the left-wing watchdog Media Matters. \"Liberals are coming for your Thanksgiving turkey,\" Greg Gutfeld warned viewers on the Nov. 6 episode of \"The Five.\" \"They want to fight a war on Thanksgiving? They lost the war on Christmas. They want to fight again?\" asked a flabbergasted Jesse Watters. Their fears of a new front in the holiday wars were sparked by a HuffPo article published Nov. 5 that looked at the environmental impact of people traveling the nation to gorge on turkey with relatives. On Wednesday, Doocy suggested Trump may have been influenced by the article that his network had so thoroughly attacked. \"Perhaps what he is talking about is just all these stories about your carbon footprint and the amount of energy you use to travel over the river and through the woods to grandmother\u2019s house,\" Doocy suggested. While many on Twitter were equally unclear what the president was referring to, other users gobbled it up and offered their thoughts on the issue, using\u00a0#WhatLiberalsCallThanksgiving and #WarOnThanksgiving hashtags.

Al Green, D-Texas, underscores the entire House impeachment sham; this is a hyperpartisan process intended to nullify a presidential election. Even a casual viewer can tell Democrats have weaponized the process of impeachment. The investigation has been scripted and leaked to the news media in an attempt to maximize political damage without granting the president any right to defend himself. Democrats have been on a crusade to unseat Trump since before his inauguration. When all previous attempts to achieve this \u2014 including the Mueller probe \u2014 failed, Democrats decided to turn bureaucrats against their commander in chief and investigate the president themselves. It speaks volumes that Democrats have changed their charge from \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to \u201cbribery\u201d in light of party polling that showed voters losing interest. Just Tuesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, highlighted this by pointing out that not a single witness testimony includes the word \u201cbribery.\u201d OUR VIEW:Trump-Ukraine scandal isn\u2019t just another partisan dispute Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s iron grip on the proceedings shows how Democrats have dispensed with a fair and open process for the sake of political expediency. Democrats\u2019 muzzling of Republicans all but ensures the country will only hear one side of the story. The American people deserve to hear all the facts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that the House would proceed with the impeachment inquiry in a fair and open manner.

Gallagher had been accused of using a knife to kill an Islamic State prisoner and of killing civilians, but in July, he was found not guilty of the most serious charges. Gallagher was found guilty of posing for a photo with a human casualty.

      "content": "Ratings show Americans are tuning in to the House\u2019s public impeachment hearings, and\u00a0polls\u00a0show a clear majority of them find President Donald Trump\u2019s actions wrong. Even so, Democrats face obstacles that could\u00a0keep public support from reaching a tipping point toward\u00a0impeachment and removal of the president. What\u2019s more, these obstacles are completely independent from the increasingly corroborated\u00a0substance of their charges against the president. Ukraine is a U.S. political and military ally. In fact, according to the State Department, \u201cThe United States attaches\u00a0great importance\u00a0to the success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state.\u201d Both parties agree that Ukraine is a key actor in stymieing Russian aggression in the region. But the American public isn\u2019t generally familiar with Ukraine. This might\u00a0prevent Democrats from persuading\u00a0many average Americans to care enough about this scandal that they invest time in learning about the details. We care about what we know and what is familiar. We are more likely to pay attention when what we easily relate to is involved, such as in the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton impeachment proceedings about episodes on our home turf. Right or wrong, Ukraine could be\u00a0too foreign, simply too far away, to break through the public consciousness and move enough voters undecided on the facts of the case toward\u00a0the Democratic position. As part of his America First platform, candidate Trump capitalized on the public\u2019s long standing animosity on spending abroad in the name of foreign aid. For decades, Americans have severely\u00a0overestimated\u00a0both the amount and the percentage of the federal budget committed to foreign assistance. And\u00a0recent polling\u00a0finds that over half of Americans believe that foreign aid spending nets a bad return on the investment of taxpayer funds. This matters to\u00a0this inquiry because Democrats, on some level, are asking Americans to get upset about foreign aid to a country many of them would have trouble finding on a map. It might\u00a0be a tough sell to gin up uncommitted members of the public\u00a0against a president who is reluctant to send taxpayer funds to a foreign country with a reputation for corruption. Trump ran on that message, and it paid off. Now\u00a0Republicans can claim he\u2019s following through. Democrats have trying to make their\u00a0impeachment case\u00a0as simple as possible: President Trump abused his office for personal political gain. But even with that straightforward narrative, Americans may struggle with the roster of unknown actors in the drama, making it harder for them to keep track of who said and did what when. Bombshell witness:\u00a0Gordon Sondland\u2019s impeachment testimony on Trump and Ukraine adds up to bribery The witnesses are mostly career state department officers with no public standing or name recognition, allowing Republicans to hammer them as unelected bureaucrats out to get the president. Even talking heads on TV who follow this inquiry minute by minute have mixed up which witness held which job. If average voters feel like there is too much to grasp, both in names and in events, they might\u00a0be less likely to even try. A final key obstacle is that most folks who are following the impeachment inquiry think they already know how this movie ends: The Democratic House impeaches Trump, and the Republican Senate tries and acquits him. Of course, we could all be surprised by new information, a\u00a0court ruling\u00a0that certain high-level subpoenaed witnesses must appear before the Intelligence Committee, or an unexpected \u201cJohn Dean\u201d moment that plays out in front of the cameras\u00a0\u2014 which Democrats may have gotten with the\u00a0explosive public testimony\u00a0of\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\u00a0But many pundits and Americans,\u00a0even those who think the president\u2019s actions warrant impeachment,\u00a0are convinced that no matter what facts come to light, Trump will be spared by the Republican senators who represent states where he remains popular. Impeachment tool box: Trump abuses power by harassing, intimidating witnesses like Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Ukraine That matters. A lot. Democrats need to shake up the inevitability narrative in order to build momentum for impeachment and removal. Otherwise, the undecided public could\u00a0move toward the Republican claim that the whole undertaking is a waste of time and money \u2014 especially when voters know they will have a chance to remove the president at the ballot box in less than a year.

      "author": "John Fritze",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 After years of questioning the loyalty of intelligence agencies, President Donald Trump and his allies are increasingly turning their focus to the military, suggesting without evidence a \u201cdeep state\u201d in the\u00a0Pentagon has joined the resistance. Trump's rhetorical attack\u00a0burst into view this week amid a controversy over the president\u2019s intervention\u00a0in the case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, a conservative cause celebre acquitted on charges he used a knife to kill an Islamic State prisoner. Trump drew fire from critics for reversing\u00a0Gallagher\u2019s demotion and ordering that he retain his status as a SEAL, as well as issuing pardons for two Army officers in war crimes cases this month. The Gallagher episode led to the ouster of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who questioned Trump\u2019s decision to overrule the military justice system. \u201cI stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state,\u201d Trump told a Florida rally on Tuesday, tying\u00a0the military to his notions of a deep state for the first time.\u00a0\u201cAnd you know what I'm talking about. I had so many people say, \u2018Sir, don't think you should do that.\u2019\u201d Timeline:How Trump intervened in the Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's war crimes case Though the president had not personally used the phrase \"deep state\" before in relation to the Defense Department, the idea has been bubbling\u00a0up on social and conservative media for weeks. Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, one of the officers Trump pardoned this month, told Newsmax that \"a big majority\" of the \u201cpeople with stars on their collar that work in the Pentagon\u201d are \"part of what President Trump calls the deep state.\" Lorance, who also called those military officials \"corrupt,\" did not offer evidence to back up the claim.\u00a0Lorance was convicted in 2013 of second-degree murder after he ordered his soldiers to open fire on three unarmed Afghan men, two of whom died. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a close Trump ally, raised the term in a tweet applauding\u00a0the president\u2019s advocacy for Gallagher\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0Hunter wrote to Trump that he would\u00a0\"continue to stand with you\" in a fight \"against the Deep State Military.\" Hunter also did not define the term or explain whom, specifically, he meant. Hours after Trump's remarks, Fox News published a column with a headline claiming Spencer's actions \"prove a \u2018deep state\u2019 anti-Trump \u2018resistance\u2019 exists at Pentagon.\" Left unsaid in accusations of political gamesmanship at the Pentagon is that some of Gallagher\u2019s colleagues testified against him. His teammates told prosecutors Gallagher took \"random shots, sometimes into buildings, where he claimed to have killed someone,\" according to documents reviewed by Navy Times. Another SEAL said he saw Gallagher \"fire into a crowd of what appeared to be noncombatants multiple times.\" Also not mentioned: Trump nominated the same people at the Pentagon at the center of the conspiracy theories, including Spencer, a retired Marine and donor to Republican candidates. Spencer told CBS News Monday that Trump\u2019s intervention in the Gallagher case sends a signal that members of the military can \u201cget away with things.\u201d Gallagher was acquitted of the most serious charges against him but was convicted in July of posing for a photo with a corpse. Trump appears to have first used the phrase \"deep state\" on Twitter in June 2017, retweeting a since-deleted message from Fox News host Sean Hannity about \u201cthe Deep State\u2019s allies in the media,\u201d according to a database of the president\u2019s social media posts compiled by the website Factba.se. As whistleblowers and members of his own administration have come forward as part of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, the president has significantly increased his reliance on the phrase, both on social media and on stage.\u00a0\"Deep state\" has appeared in Trump\u2019s Twitter feed 17 times this year, a threefold increase since 2018. Trump is also using the phrase far more at political rallies this year. He told an audience in Kentucky this month that \"the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past.\" To an audience in Mississippi days earlier, Trump said\u00a0that \"the deep state are desperate to stop us.\" Months earlier, speaking at the White House, Trump said he doesn\u2019t like to use the phrase at all. \"You know, a lot of people say \u2018deep state.'\u00a0I don\u2019t say 'deep state,'\" Trump said. \"We have a lot of bad people and I think they\u2019re being found out.\" But two months later, as he addressed a group of conservative students, the term was back on his lips as he railed against Democrats in Congress. More:Navy says review board will not look at case of SEAL Eddie Gallagher \"We have a deep state. We have bad people,\" Trump told the students. \"We have sick people.\" The phrase \"deep state\" is loosely defined as a group of unelected officials within a bureaucracy, something of a shadow government. Experts say the term originated in Turkey as a reference to military officials and their civilian partners. Tom Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said that Trump\u2019s use of the term is in line with his broader efforts to paint Washington as out of touch with the rest of the nation\u00a0\u2013 a \"swamp.\"\u00a0Nichols was speaking in a personal capacity. \"I think the president uses the term 'deep state' as a kind of trigger for his rally crowds to mean 'that hostile government in Washington that is far away from you,' or 'everyone in the government but me,'\" Nichols said. \"It's very much an \u2018us versus them\u2019 distinction.\" Nichols added that Trump seems to believe\u00a0that \"it's popular to side with 'tough guys' and that this, by extension, makes him look tough.\" Trump has described Gallagher and the other soldiers as heroes who were operating in difficult, wartime circumstances. He defended his intervention this week by telling reporters in the Oval Office he has to \"protect my war fighters\" and claiming that \"people in the military have thanked us very much.\"\u00a0In the past, the president has also argued that the cases were poorly handled by prosecutors. Barb McQuade, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at the University of Michigan, argued that Trump's emphasis on the \"deep state\" undermines\u00a0a federal bureaucracy that is simply trying to do its job. \"There is no such thing as a deep state,\" McQuade said. \"Professional career public servants who care about following the law are not members of a deep state, they are patriots.\" Fritze covers the White House for USA TODAY.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied sending his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to dig up dirt on his opponents,\u00a0or for any other reason. \"No, I didn't direct him,\" Trump told former Fox News host\u00a0Bill O\u2019Reilly in an online interview.\u00a0\"No, but you have to understand, Rudy is a great corruption fighter.\" Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine have come under scrutiny in the House Democratic impeachment inquiry.\u00a0Federal investigators, meanwhile,\u00a0are conducting an investigation into Giuliani's associates, two of whom were charged with campaign finance violations. Trump repeatedly said he never directed his personal attorney to go to Ukraine. Giuliani agreed. \"He never did and I never did,\" Giuliani told USA TODAY in response to Trump's remarks. \"I never went to Ukraine and I was always seeking evidence to defend him against false charges in my role as his lawyer.\" Giuliani said his effort started long before Biden was a candidate and while the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was still underway. Whether Trump sent Giuliani to the country is not the center of the investigation, however. The summary of the president's July 25 phone call with Ukraine president\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky shows the president urged Kyiv officials to reach out to Giuliani about the investigations. State Department officials have told lawmakers under oath as part of the impeachment inquiry that Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, appeared to be running a diplomatic effort in Ukraine outside of the official channels. Giuliani was also among the critics who appeared determined to undermine former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Giuliani has acknowledged he was conducting an investigation into Ukraine to defend Trump. \"The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproven,\" Giuliani posted on Twitter last month. Despite speculation about whether Trump will continue to stick by his personal attorney, the president has so far generally defended him. Giuliani raised eyebrows recently by saying he did not think Trump would turn on him during the investigation\u00a0\u2013 and that, even if Trump\u00a0did, he has an \"insurance policy.\"\u00a0 Giuliani later said he was joking and that his insurance was his case against Biden. On Monday, Trump called Giuliani \"a great guy\" and the \"best mayor\" New York City ever had. Giuliani has refused to provide information to House investigators about his dealings in Ukraine on Trump's behalf. Giuliani has\u00a0done business in Ukraine\u00a0since at least 2008.\u00a0In June 2017, he delivered a speech called \u201cGlobal Challenge, the Role of the U.S. and the Place of Ukraine,\u201d according to a post on the website of the Pinchuk Foundation.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 After a day of playing defense on impeachment,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his allies spent Wednesday night attacking the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0and their views\u00a0\u2013 including support for impeachment. \"Democrats Have Been Obsessed With Impeachment from Day 1,\" said a statement from the \"rapid response\" arm of Trump's re-election campaign, one of a string of\u00a0emails, tweets, and texts sent by the president's supporters during the Democratic debate. At the end,\u00a0Trump campaign spokeswoman\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany said the \"2020 Democrats were short on solutions and heavy on their unhealthy obsession with taking down President Trump via an illegitimate coup.\" In the middle of the proceedings, Trump himself tweeted out his version of the highlights from a critical impeachment hearing earlier in the day, testimony that he said exonerates him. \"That means it's all over,\" Trump said in the video. Prior to the debate, Trump tweeted out a news story about poll numbers in Wisconsin. During the debate in Atlanta, the Democratic candidates for Trump's job cited evidence that he abused power by asking another country, Ukraine, to investigate one of their colleagues, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"We have to establish the principle no one is above the law,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0\"We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.\" Biden said he has learned one thing from the impeachment hearings: \"Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear.\" Throughout the day and the evening,\u00a0Trump and his supporters pushed back on testimony from a blockbuster impeachment witness. Ambassador Gordon Sondland said Trump appeared to support the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the country. Trump said he did not know Sondland \"very well,\" and cited the ambassador's\u00a0testimony that the president told him he did not want a \"quid quo pro\" from Ukraine over investigating the Bidens. Trump's campaign stayed busy throughout the debate, emailing and tweeting responses to the various candidates while arguing that the Democratic Party as a whole is backing impeachment for political reasons. \"The Democrat candidates continue to push the Ukraine scam in a desperate attempt to impeach President Donald Trump before he wins reelection in 2020,\" said a statement from the Republican National Committee. As for other issues,\u00a0Trump and the Republicans said Democrats want to raise taxes, increase government regulations, open the nation's borders, promote unlimited abortion rights, and impose climate change controls that will cost U.S. jobs. At one point, the campaign unit known as the\u00a0\"Trump War Room\" tweeted out video of Democratic candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticizing some party colleagues. \"Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,\" Gabbard said. The Trump-ites paid particular\u00a0attention to long-standing Democratic frontrunners Biden, Sen.Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. They also played up attacks on a new contender: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose poll numbers have shot up in the early contest states of Iowa and New Hampshire. \"Crime is rising, schools are suffering, and police are demoralized in the city Pete Buttigieg has managed for nearly eight years,\" said an email from the Trump campaign. For their part, the 2020 Democrats largely defined themselves in opposition to Trump. \"We can deal with Trump's\u00a0corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country,\" said Sanders, the Vermont senator. Trump's presidency, particularly the impeachment drive, hovered over the debate. \"It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate,\" tweeted David Axelrod, a political adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Kind of low energy.\" Hours before the event, during a tour of an\u00a0Apple manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said he\u00a0believes impeachment is an effort to defeat him in the 2020 election by Democrats who are angry over his 2016 victory. \"They are trying to take it away because they can't do it fairly,\" Trump said.",

      "content": "Could it get any hotter in the kitchen? And I\u2019m not talking turkey. No, I\u2019m pointing to the forecast for record-breaking highs for the political temperature around holiday tables this year. With the Democratic-led impeachment process under way and President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, streaming constantly,\u00a0with insults,\u00a0it\u2019s time to go back to the fundamentals of how we talk and eat without developing indigestion. For starters, put down those knives and remember \u2014 as I say in my family \u2014 it\u2019s the pies that bind us. Oh, and if we really need to start a fight, how about arguing whether it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cpuh-KAHN\u201d or\u00a0\u201cPEE-can\u201d pie.\u201d As a civility expert, here are my recommendations to create a safe zone at your family gathering. 1. Hosts set the rules ahead of time. It's your gathering, and in the same way you tell people what time to arrive and whether to bring sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows or grandma\u2019s green bean casserole, send an email with your house rules. Here are some suggestions: \u201cWe\u2019ll only talk politics (which includes gun control, abortion rights, racism, and LGBTQ issues) before we sit down for dinner.\u201d Other families are more draconian, declaring\u00a0\u201ca politics-free zone the entire day.\u201d Or this approach, with a side of humor: \u201cThe only thing we can talk about are our kids, pets\u00a0and our ailments.\u201d Remember: Your house, your rules. Your family is relying on you to keep the peace. 2. Don\u2019t make politics personal. If you\u2019re going to talk about issues, talk about them but don\u2019t attack the character of those you disagree with. Almost everyone in politics loved the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,\u00a0because he made it a point to focus on policy and not personality. In fact, I\u2019d go a step further: Let\u2019s not invite Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi to our homes this holiday season. We see them plenty anyway. 3. Hide the knives. Whether you\u2019re a Red or a Blue \u2014 or a purple \u2014 it\u2019s easy to toss verbal Molotov cocktails at each other. Sarcasm isn't our friend and that means no, \u201cCan you pass the imPEACHment pie please?\u201d Or, if asked about the weather, hold your tongue about it being \u201csnowflake season.\u201d While you\u2019re at it, hide the sharp knives. 4. Listen up. We know the drill on social media. Don\u2019t agree with someone\u2019s perspective, flame them. Unfriend them. Problem solved, right? Not so fast. Thanks in large part to our online echo chambers, we\u2019ve forgotten how to listen. Even if our politicians can\u2019t figure out how to listen respectfully, we can. We must. Let those you disagree with speak. Listen to what they say. Be prepared to have your own beliefs challenged as you challenge theirs. One friend offers this\u00a0humorous and effective suggestion: Take off your hearing aids for the day and say, \"So sorry, the batteries are dead.\" Problem solved, at least for her. 5. If necessary, call a timeout. Pay attention, hosts. If the vituperation gets out of hand, tell your guests to cool it. Or change the subject, which can mean abruptly starting a new, benign conversation. If there\u2019s a particular troublemaker, ask them to help you in the kitchen and then remind them that the holidays are not about winning political arguments. A friend of mine advises that if a discussion or rant gets out of control, excuse yourself and go the bathroom for five minutes. If it\u2019s still going on, help out in the kitchen. 6. Don\u2019t invite trouble into your home. Some families know they can\u2019t all sit down together now because, as a neighbor of mine reminded me, talking politics or impeachment at the holiday table can only lead to one thing\u00a0\u2014 indigestion. On a similar note, a colleague explained that three years ago his grandmother \"disinvited\" everyone who had politics different than hers. Since then the remaining guests have been playing Scrabble, drinking cocktails and watching movies all weekend., and had the best Thanksgivings of their\u00a0lives.\u00a0Sometimes less is more. 7. No baseball caps at the table. Ever. Especially those that\u00a0say\u00a0\u201cMake America\u00a0Great Again\u201d or \u201cMake Racism Wrong Again.\u201d 8. Be grateful. Some of the most meaningful holiday dinners have started with a ritual I love: Everyone at the table declares what they have to be grateful for this year. Perhaps it\u2019s your spouse, your kids, your job, good health, a place to call home, or the friends and family you\u2019re breaking bread with. Focus on the ties that bind us, not divide us. 9. Family first.\u00a0Family lasts forever, whether it\u2019s your biological or chosen family. And that's what the holidays are ultimately about. Let's try not to forget that this holiday season.

President Donald Trump has publicly called for changing the libel laws, a repeated demand that ignores that the defamation standard rests on constitutional not statutory authority.

Nunes is aggrieved by the coverage of a breaking story that he used a congressional trip to meet with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt against the Bidens in 2018.\u00a0CNN and the Daily Beast cite Lev Parnas' lawyer\u00a0as the source. Parnas,\u00a0a former Rudy Guliani associate, was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations. Nunes vehemently denied the stories and declared that \u201cwe actually caught them\u201d in advancing a false story and a defamation lawsuit will soon follow. At the outset, it is worth noting that I agree with the White House that there is a great deal of distorted and biased coverage of this president. However, that does not justify the president\u2019s reckless attacks on the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d\u00a0or his desire to roll back\u00a0protections for the free press. More importantly, in this matter, Nunes proceeded to make statements that could easily be viewed as attacking the defenses raised not only by the White House but Nunes himself. \u201cThis is criminal in nature.\u201d Nunes states, \u201cThe problem with this week\u2019s fake news story is \u2014 we actually caught them. And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity...We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate.\u201d One possible meaning is that Nunes is referencing one of the \u201cper se\u201d categories for defamation\u00a0in asserting that someone is committing a criminal offense. That would be a reference to a member of Congress using a public funds for political purposes. Yet, that is very similar to what Democrats are accusing President Trump of doing in pushing a quid pro quo by withholding aid or other official acts. One defense (raised by acting Chief of Staff Mick\u00a0Mulvaney)\u00a0is that such quid pro quos have always been part of foreign policy so, \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it.\u201d\u00a0If the criminal matter is the intermixing of politics with public-funded work, Nunes could find himself in the unenviable position of rivaling Mulvaney as one of the most quoted Republicans in this scandal. Nunes stated \"It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress.\u201d Why is he suing me:Free speech means I don't have to be nice to Devin Nunes on Twitter. One can certainly understand the desire to avoid association with Parnas or his equally dubious associate Igor Fruman.\u00a0Parnas and Fruman bear striking resemblance to Flotsam and Jetsam \u2014\u00a0the craven and ingratiating henchmen for the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid. Both men were arrested trying to leave the country at the airport shortly after meeting with Giuliani (who makes Ursula look like a public minded citizen). The problem is that these two alleged felons, to use Ursula\u2019s description,\u00a0were Giuliani\u2019s \u201cpoor little poopsies\u201d\u00a0in Ukraine. They worked with Giuliani who was (according to Giuliani and various witnesses) working for President Trump in pursuing matters in Ukraine. If it was untoward to be working with them, Nunes could have a problem in explaining why Giuliani maintained his own association with them in Ukraine. Moreover, it is bizarre to suggest that the media should not work with accused felons. Many major stories are based on accounts from not just indicted but convicted felons. That is particularly the case when you are covering possible unethical or criminal acts. The association with such individuals is a problem for people like Giuliani, not the media. This is why the premise of this defamation lawsuit is so potentially damaging to the narrative supporting the president. You cannot allege that it is per se defamatory to associate you with two individuals who have only two degrees of separation from the president himself. Indeed, the president has associated directly with a number of proven felons including his former personal counsel Michael Cohen and his former campaign chair Paul Manafort. They both displayed the same ravenous corrupt appetites in mixing government and private interests. He's been a liability:Rudy Giuliani's flubs may let Stormy Daniels take down President Trump Nunes has insisted that he will file the lawsuits against CNN and the Daily Beast after Thanksgiving and added \u201cwe hope they cooperate.\" They may be more cooperative than he expects. With such a lawsuit will come depositions and discovery into Nunes\u2019 travel, associations\u00a0and efforts. That could prove a treasure trove for two organizations with diminishing access to Republican sources. Moreover, Nunes will have to satisfy the standard that Trump has repeatedly denounced: the\u00a0New York Times Company v. Sullivan standard of \u201cactual malice.\u201d That decision imposed a higher standard of proof for lawsuits by public officials based on the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech and the free press. During the civil rights movement, various southern states were using their defamation laws to hit media companies with huge damage awards to coerce them into silence. The court mandated that officials like Nunes must show that the media was\u00a0acting with either knowledge of the falsity of their reporting\u00a0or reckless disregard for\u00a0the truth. That standard is designed to be difficult to prove and meant to give protection to the media in publishing allegations against high-ranking officials. What may be easier to prove is that these two individuals are not the types with whom any responsible and reputable official would associate. The problem is that a couple of notable figures did precisely that.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's physician dismissed speculation late Monday about his unexpected trip to Walter Reed\u00a0National\u00a0Military\u00a0Medical Center over the weekend, calling the visit \"routine\" and \"preventative.\" Dr. Sean Conley, the president\u2019s physician, dismissed speculation that the president had been brought to the hospital for chest pain and specifically said Trump was not evaluated for \"any urgent or acute issues.\" White House officials have been working to downplay the unexpected visit on Saturday to the suburban Washington medical center. The president's annual physical usually is announced in advance to avoid speculation about his health, but was not in this case. Though the White House usually discloses the president's weight, blood pressure and other details of an annual exam, Conley provided only the president's cholesterol numbers. Conley said he would provide a more comprehensive exam early next year. The president last had his annual physical in February. Results in February:Trump's weight up, cholesterol down, president's doctor discloses Trump had a total cholesterol level of 165, down from the 196 number reported in February, Conley said. \"Primary preventative care is something that occurs continuously throughout the year, it is not just a single annual event,\" Conley wrote in a memo release late Monday by the White House. Trump\u2019s health has long been a subject of interest, despite a doctor\u2019s assessment last year that he has \u201cincredibly good genes\u201d and was in \"excellent health.\"\u00a0The 73-year-old president doesn\u2019t exercise regularly, beyond golf, and acknowledged last year he takes a\u00a0statin drug designed to lower\u00a0his cholesterol. Trump's exam from earlier this year showed he had a blood pressure reading of 118 over 80, which is within the normal range, and weighed\u00a0243 pounds. The president had a resting heart rate at that time of 70 beats per minute, considered normal. Conley said the president visited with medical staff and the family of a soldier undergoing surgery. He said the visit was initially kept off the record due to \"scheduling uncertaintanties.\" Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": "According to a new filing with the Federal Election\u00a0Commission, the Republican National Committee spent almost $100,000 on bulk purchases of Donald Trump, Jr.'s book \"Triggered\" as part of an incentive\u00a0scheme for Republican donors. The filing shows the Republican National Committee spending $94,800 at the bookstore \"Books-A-Million\" for \"donor mementos,\" on Oct. 29 a few days before Trump's book was released on Nov. 5. At the Books-A-Million retail price for \"Triggered\"\u00a0of $30.00, that would be about 3,160 copies of the book. Mike Reed, an RNC spokesman, explained to\u00a0The New York Times that the expenditure at Books-A-Million had gone toward copies of Trump's book. \"The book has been hugely popular,\" he said, noting that the RNC had made additional purchases of the book in November. Last week, another RNC spokesman, Steve Guest,\u00a0said in a statement to the Associated Press the book had been purchased as a fundraising incentive for donors, but that\u00a0the book was bought \"to keep up with demand\" instead of a\u00a0\"large bulk purchase.\" When asked about the single large expenditure on books, Reed told the Times that the RNC stood by its previous statement.

The book's position on the bestseller list had been caveated with a dagger symbol, which meant that some of the book's sales were bulk purchases, according to the Associated Press. Bulk purchases sometimes indicate that the author himself or someone associated with him bought a large number of copies. Trump retweeted posts from conservative reporter Ryan Saavedra and Trump campaign adviser and partner Kimberly Guilfoyle about the book that argued the book could have been a bestseller even without the RNC's purchases. \"This book and its author are something special,\" Guilfoyle wrote.",

Well, now the position is closed and I found out that my manager never requested my pay bump.\u00a0How do I continue to work\u00a0with\u00a0this guy? \u2014\u00a0 Melanie Answer: Does it seem to you\u00a0that\u00a0lying has gone mainstream? Because it does to me. One reason, of course, is\u00a0our\u00a0president. Lying is corrosive to democracy, and, yes, the truth. It confuses people (as it is intended to) and it\u00a0sows\u00a0dissention. Yes, sure, all presidents lie (\u201cI did not have sexual relations with that\u00a0woman,\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Lewinsky,\u201d; \u201cYour president is not a crook\u201d) but these days, the lies are on a different, toxic\u00a0scale.

When I came back two days later with only a portion completed, she said, \u201cI was just testing you.\u201d \"Toxic\" is the word. When a boss \u2013 or really, for that matter, a co-worker \u2013 lies to you, little good can come of it.\u00a0One of the essential things that make work (and life) go 'round is trust.\u00a0When trust erodes, the culture of the company suffers. I have to be able to trust that when you say you handled that issue, you handled it. You have to be able to trust that when I say I will put you up for a\u00a0raise\u00a0that\u00a0I\u00a0put you up for\u00a0a raise. And when you don\u2019t handle it and I don\u2019t put you up, we will no longer trust each other.

Gaps:\u00a0(Note: I am talking lies that make a difference, not the white lies that get\u00a0us\u00a0through the day.)\u00a0 When people lie to each other on the job, they\u00a0won\u2019t be able to trust each\u00a0other. What\u00a0suffers\u00a0is the work. Things may not get done, or done on time, or at all. Processes will fail.\u00a0Dissention\u00a0looms.\u00a0Customers will notice. Morale:\u00a0When\u00a0people don\u2019t trust each other because they have learned that they can\u2019t trust each other, morale suffers. The culture suffers. The works suffers. And when\u00a0it is the\u00a0the\u00a0boss\u00a0who\u00a0is the liar, things\u00a0will\u00a0go downhill\u00a0really\u00a0fast. No one wants to work for someone who can\u2019t be trusted, whose word is not their bond. In a roaring economy like this one, people will simply leave. So, what do you do when the boss lies? Simple:\u00a0Be a grownup.\u00a0Clear the air.\u00a0Talk it out. You and your boss should make amends and try to move\u00a0on. Because if you don\u2019t, the air is\u00a0going\u00a0to get awfully polluted. And if your boss\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0change,\u00a0jump on the bus, Gus, and set yourself free.

      "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 President Donald Trump's intention to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations\u00a0\u2014 a move which might portend deeper U.S. incursions into Mexican security\u00a0\u2014 is drawing support from some of the relatives of families killed in an ambush early this month. The victims, members of Mormon offshoot communities with dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship, were gunned down in an attack in Sonora, about three hours south of the Arizona-Mexico border. The apparent ambush\u00a0has widely been blamed on cartel violence. Trump's remark Tuesday night suggested the administration has been working on a terrorist designation. \"I will be designating the cartels \u2014 absolutely,\" he said.\u00a0\"You know designation is not that easy. You have to go through a process and we're well into that process.\" Those plans\u00a0appeared to catch the Mexican government off-guard. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted,\"Mexico will not accept any action that signifies a violation of its national sovereignty.\" But\u00a0the controversy over cartels highlights a lack of public progress in the ambush investigation. More than three weeks after three women and six children were killed, there have been no arrests, and little new information released about who might be held responsible. The case is\u00a0being investigated by both Mexican judicial officials and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. MORE: Children wounded in ambush released from Arizona hospital Victims\u2019 relatives on both sides of the border have waged vocal campaigns for bringing the perpetrators to justice \u2014\u00a0something rare in Mexico, where the relatives of victims of violence are often stigmatized by society and the authorities, and those slain in the rising drug violence are often seen as somehow complicit in the crimes committed against them. Relatives'\u00a0efforts include calling for the same sort of terror designation Trump described. A White House petition, filed online Nov. 24,\u00a0asked Trump to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Julian LeBaron, a spokesman for the victims\u2019 families, told USA TODAY the petition was probably filed by relatives who reside in the United States. LeBaron was unable to say what progress had been made on the case, but suggested that more evidence exists.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a video that the FBI has of 12 guys dressed in black with helmets, like special forces, coming down the hill, opening fire on my cousin\u2019s vehicle,\"\u00a0he said. Some in the family expressed hopes the terrorism designation would bring about more cross-border cooperation on going after drug cartels. \u201cRegardless of the State Department\u2019s definition of terrorism, we can\u2019t help but believe it,\u201d Alex LeBaron told USA TODAY. \u201cThey\u2019re playing to their supporters,\u201d LeBaron said of the presidents of Mexico and the United States \u2014 while acknowledging Trump is seeking re-election. \u201cThey can say what they want, they can wrap themselves in any one of the two flags. All we want is results. \u2026 All we\u2019re asking for is better cooperation.\u201d QUESTIONS BUILD: After deadly ambush, family's question: To stay or leave? Mexican drug cartels have carried out shocking acts of violence over the past 13 years \u2014 a period that\u00a0coincides with then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declaring war on the cartels and organized crime and deploying the army to stamp them out. Calder\u00f3n's decision in December 2006, starting with sending soldiers into his home state of Michoac\u00e1n, was preceded by a cartel known as La Familia Michoacana bowling human heads onto the dancefloor of a bar. The atrocities have only escalated and included hanging bodies from bridges, shooting up bars and burning buses to thwart attempts at capturing cartel capos. \u201cIt\u2019s not being stopped,\u201d LeBaron said of the violence. \u201cThis is completely out of control and we can\u2019t sit by and watch this.\u201d Experts, however, question if Trump\u2019s plan to designate cartels as terrorists has been thought through. Mexican drug cartels arm themselves with U.S. weapons, so selling guns to the cartels could be providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to a foreign terrorist organization, said Brian Phillips, a terrorism expert at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. \u201cThese are criminal groups. At the end of the day their primary goal is to make money,\u201d Phillips said of the drug cartels. \u201cThere are many political implications: they scare people from voting, the have preferred political candidates, but their primary goal regarding the government is to be left alone by the government to make money, so I don\u2019t see them as the same as Al-Qaeda or the FARC in Colombia.\u201d Migrants fleeing violence in Mexico and wishing to seek asylum in the United States could have their cases strengthened as they \u201cmay soon be victims of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, on the same list as ISIS, Boko Haram, and (Colombia\u2019s)\u00a0ELN,\u201d\u00a0tweeted Adam Isacson, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights think tank. The crackdown on drug cartels has fragmented the Mexican underworld. As cartel kingpins are killed, criminal organizations splinter,\u00a0causing local conflicts. Analysts say there\u2019s also the issue of corrupted public officials to contend with. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow the formula good state versus\u00a0evil cartels. ... The lines between crime and state are highly porous,\u201d said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst for the International Crisis Group. \u201cThis helps to explain why the past 13 years of hard-handed, militarized approach to fighting organized crime in Mexico has not only failed to achieve results, but backfired and increased violence. Further escalating this logic by applying the terror jargon and potentially some of the measures associated with it thus carries a big risk of making things worse.\u201d The Nov. 4 attack captured worldwide attention and marked yet another grim milestone in Mexico\u2019s drug war, which has claimed more than 250,000 lives and left more than 35,000 missing. The attack also thrust isolated communities\u00a0\u2014 which date\u00a0to the 1870s and have roots in Mormon efforts to avoid polygamy laws in the United States \u2014 into the spotlight again. Two community members, including an anticrime activist,\u00a0were murdered in 2009 after locals refused to pay a ransom for a kidnapped boy. FAMILY HISTORY: A history of family traditions, and violence, in offshoot colonies Their most recent activism hasn\u2019t always been well-received.\u00a0The hashtags \"LeBaron Out of Mexico\" and \"LeBaron Traitors to the Fatherland\" trended Wednesday on Twitter. Mexican policy on cartel violence, though, has been shifting \u00a0\u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014\u00a0as\u00a0President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador speaks of \u201chugs not bullets\u201d and solving what he considers to be the root causes of crime: corruption and violence. In a Tuesday statement, the Foreign Ministry said it would seek dialogue on plans for the terror designation \u2013 along with the issue of U.S. weapons being smuggled into Mexico. L\u00f3pez Obrador sought a soft\u00a0posture, telling the nation Wednesday, \u201cI want to send a hug to the American people. It\u2019s not a good time for confrontational politics. \u2026 Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.\u201d For his part, Juli\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n, known as an activist for victims in Mexico, found common ground with the president\u2019s criticisms of Mexico\u2019s cartel crackdown as ill-conceived. \u201cIt\u2019s been a catastrophic failure. The numbers tell that story,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stopped drug-trafficking in any way. The only thing it does is make it a much more profitable business for the terrorists.\u201d",

      "content": "President Trump claims he intervened in the war crimes case involving a Navy SEAL as a way to protect \"warriors.\" \"Warrior\", as a descriptor, does not always call to mind scenes of Homeric bravery or Iwo Jima-like camaraderie. In some circles, it's a toxic word, a put down even, as it assume they are part of a class or caste onto themselves, to be worshiped. It also speaks to a certain level of gung-ho machismo shared by everyone who puts on the uniform. In other circles, it assumes a preference for brawn over brainpower, a Spartan jock culture versus Athenian intellectual worldview \u2014 why else would James Mattis have to be qualified as a \"warrior monk\"? For most who wear the uniform it gives them a sense of purpose. The warrior nomenclature tends to diminish their value to ensuring peace and security, or defending the homeland. Or it conflates their role as being a purveyor of lethal violence. Let's not sugarcoat what soldiers do \u2014 their job, in part, is to kill, if called upon to do so. Yet lumping all of them together as \"warriors\" cheapens the uniform. A mercenary or a Viking raider is also a \"warrior\" in the strict sense of the word. So is a Taliban fighter or ISIS recruit. What makes our men and women, not just in the U.S. but in militaries across the globe, unique and \"special\" is their strict adherence to a virtuous moral code in the management of violence. This is what President Trump misunderstands. He believes that warriors enjoy protected status. By interfering in the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, he is suggesting that soldiers, given they are\u00a0part of the warrior elite, are somehow above the law. I have spent the past four years\u00a0on the military training side of West Point, surrounded primarily by special operators or Rangers who have fought multiple tours. What makes them extraordinary is not their bravery or toughness but their commitment to a set of values. They are soldiers first, warriors second. Banish 'warrior' label In some ways the \"warrior\" label should be banished from our vocabulary or downplayed when referring to the military. After all, changing norms and technologies may start to erode our contemporary notions of warrior. Are drone pilots as heroic as their Top Gun brethren wearing Aviator shades? Is somebody who branches cyber and codes for a living as brave and fearless as his infantry brethren? Do they get to cut the lines at airports, too? More on Donald Trump:Asylum? Top job? What a friend Trump has in Israel, should impeachment get real Democrats just might reelect Trump, and they'll have no one to blame but themselves. This past month has shown us the best and the worst of America's \"warrior\" class. On one hand, we saw Lt Col Alexander Vindman, an immigrant from Ukraine who has a Purple Heart, a Combat Badge and Ranger Tab, who defended his notion of what was right by reporting an abuse of the system. On the other we have Chief Petty Officer Gallagher, who deserves praise for serving our nation but whose alleged war crimes, as well as rank insubordination in an interview\u00a0he gave to Fox News, demonstrates the seedier side of our \"warrior\" class. America's relationship with the military has always been a bit cartoonish and Trump's meddling is the latest embodiment of this. We have a public largely checked out and uninformed about the wars fought in its name, one that supports its troops and likes flyovers at its ball games yet also does not want to be burdened with bad news from the front lines. We rightfully venerate those who serve, yet we also seem to elevate them onto this vaulted status that they neither seek nor deserve.\u00a0 We should praise their sacrifice, yet not excuse them when they fall short or commit crimes. Otherwise they will be seen as warriors in the worst sense of the word.

      "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2013 Shortly after sunset on Wednesday, President Donald Trump secretly boarded an undisclosed aircraft at an undisclosed airport in Florida and flew to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, according to pool reports from media who traveled with the president. Air Force One, the plane Trump took from Andrews to Florida Tuesday evening, remained parked on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport as part of the subterfuge. Meanwhile, at Andrews AFB, located just outside Washington, D.C., a dozen reporters in the White House travel pool were told to meet on the top floor of a parking garage at 7:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday. They were not told where they were going. For about 16 hours, the pool reporters, who chronicle nearly everything the president says or does, went silent. When the news blackout was finally lifted at 2 p.m. on Thursday, pool reporters in Afghanistan told a fascinating tale of the clandestine operations that enabled Trump to sneak out of Mar-a-Lago and onto a military base in a country occupied by Islamic State and Taliban fighters. According to the pool reports, vans drove the reporters from the top of the parking garage to a security checkpoint. They were required to surrender their cellphones and other devices that emit signals. From there, they went to a cavernous hangar where they boarded another Air Force One and awaited the president\u2019s arrival. The president boarded Air Force One at 9:49 p.m. and the plane took off 20 minutes later with its interior lights off and shades drawn. About 11 hours into the 13-hour flight, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham divulged their destination: Bagram air base \u2013 the primary hub for U.S. air operations, located outside the Afghan capital of Kabul. Trump in Afghanistan:Trump announces resuming peace talks with Taliban Air Force One landed in the dark, with interior lights off and shades drawn. Trump ate turkey with the troops and met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. After about three and a half hours, Air Force One was wheels up for its return flight to the U.S. As for the Air Force One that landed Tuesday at Palm Beach International, it was nowhere to be seen Thursday afternoon. There was no word from the White House about whether the president will return to Palm Beach or stay in Washington for the remainder of the weekend. First lady Melania Trump and the couple\u2019s son, Barron, have been staying with the president at Mar-a-Lago since Tuesday. Follow Christine Stapleton on Twitter: @StapletonPBPost",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump announced he restarted\u00a0peace talks with the Taliban during a surprise\u00a0visit to soldiers Thursday at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, his first visit to the country since becoming president. Trump spent about 2 1/2 hours at the military base, where he served turkey to soldiers in a dining hall, posed for photos, delivered brief remarks\u00a0and met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, according to press pool reports. The president arrived at Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. base in Afghanistan,\u00a0around 8:30 p.m. local time. The trip, Trump's second visit to a combat zone, comes as he\u00a0faces\u00a0threats to his presidency back home. A fast-moving impeachment inquiry\u00a0yielded testimony about the Trump administration's efforts to push Ukraine to announce investigations that could have been politically beneficial to Trump in 2020. Trump announced the restart of peace negotiations with the Taliban during a bilateral meeting with Ghani. The two presidents sat at one end of the room at the military headquarters, where four alternating U.S. and Afghan\u00a0flags were erected behind the two leaders, according to pool reports. \"The Taliban wants to make a deal \u2013 we\u2019ll see if they make a deal. If they do, they do, and if they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t. That's fine,\" Trump told reporters. The president reiterated his desire to reduce the number of American troops in Afghanistan to 8,600, a figure he cited in announcing a major withdrawal in August. The United States\u00a0has less than 14,000 troops in Afghanistan; military officials would not confirm the exact number. The move would reduce troop levels to one of the lowest points in the history of the war. U.S. troops swelled to nearly 100,000 at the highest mark in 2011 and dipped to 8,300 in 2017. Peace talks were upended in September, when Trump canceled a secret summit with the Taliban, Ghani and other Afghan officials after the militant group killed a U.S. soldier. The meeting was to finalize an agreement that had been in the works for months to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan and would have taken place at Camp David\u00a0two days before the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump said \"it was not a good thing\" that the group killed the\u00a0soldier, who was from Puerto Rico. During a speech greeted with cheers and chants of \"USA! USA!\" Trump told soldiers\u00a0that his administration had eradicated the Islamic State's territorial caliphate despite warnings of the terrorist group's resurgence. A report released by the Pentagon on October found that the Islamic State is rebuilding itself in Syria, where Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops in October. The decision allowed Turkey's incursion into the region and left vulnerable Kurdish forces that had worked with the United States to roll back gains made by terrorists. Before the meeting with Ghani, Trump served turkey to about two dozen troops\u00a0in a dining hall decorated with red, orange and yellow banners, according to pool reports. \"I\u2019ll be talking to you later, but right now I want to have some turkey,\" Trump told soldiers as he joined a table of service members at the\u00a0 hall, where 500 troops ate their Thanksgiving meal. Trump sat down to eat a plate of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread, according to pool reports. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, who accompanied Trump on the trip, said the visit had been planned for months. Reporters traveling with the president were not told of the destination until two hours before landing. They were barred from reporting on the trip until the visit was nearly over. \"It\u2019s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops,\" Grisham told reporters. \"He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there\u2019s a lot of people far away from their families during the holidays and we thought it\u2019d be a nice surprise.\" Trump had initially flown to his Mar-a-Lago resort, but he flew out of an undisclosed airport in Florida on Wednesday evening and landed at Joint Andrews Base, where he boarded Air Force One, according to pool reports.\u00a0First lady Melania Trump stayed behind in Florida. Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq last week to serve a Thanksgiving dinner to troops. Last year, Trump\u00a0made a surprise visit to troops in Iraq, where he defended his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. The trip last December was Trump's first encounter with soldiers serving under his command in a combat zone. Contributing:\u00a0John Fritze,\u00a0Tom Vanden Brook and David Jackson",
