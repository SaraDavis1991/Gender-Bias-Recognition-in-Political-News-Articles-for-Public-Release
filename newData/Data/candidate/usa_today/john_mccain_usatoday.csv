So far this year, there have been roughly 74,000 fires — up 84 percent from the same period last year.Why is this happening? People are illegally clearing land in the Amazon for business prospects, such as growing agriculture or raising cattle. What's feeding the fire? The trees, plants and animals in the Amazon are not adaptive to fire and are easily killed, which makes putting out a wildfire in the Amazon ""basically impossible."" So, what can be done about this? For starters, stop sharing outdated photos. While well-intentioned celebrities have been drawing attention to the wildfires, the photos they are posting range anywhere from one to 30 years old. Some don't even show the Amazon rainforest at all. Here are the real photos you need to see."
