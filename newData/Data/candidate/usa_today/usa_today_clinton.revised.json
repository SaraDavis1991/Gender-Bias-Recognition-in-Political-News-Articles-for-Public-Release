      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump defended a re-tweet that appeared to link Jeffrey Epstein's death to former President Bill Clinton, and said Tuesday he wants a full investigation of Epstein's apparent suicide. \"The retweet was from somebody that is a very respected conservative pundit so I think that was fine,\" Trump told reporters as he departed his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for an energy speech in western Pennsylvania. \"I want a full investigation,\" Trump said. Supporters of Clinton have questioned Trump's mental stability for trafficking in conspiracy theories normally confined to the fringes of the political spectrum. \"Ridiculous, and of course not true \u2014 and Donald Trump knows it,\" said a weekend tweet from Angel Ure\u00f1a, a spokesman for former President Clinton. \"Has he triggered the 25th Amendment yet?\" After Trump defended the re-tweet on Tuesday,\u00a0Ure\u00f1a added: \"Might be hard to hear over Air Force One, but that\u2019s the sound of the President of the United States\u2019 credibility blowing in the wind.\" Keep up with this story:Get USA TODAY's Evening Briefing in your inbox Trump has frequently feuded with the Clinton family, particularly during the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 and others have blasted Trump for re-tweeting a no-evidence conspiracy theory somehow tying Epstein's death\u00a0to Clinton. \u201cThis is another example of\u00a0our President using this\u00a0position of public trust to\u00a0attack his political enemies\u00a0with unfounded conspiracy\u00a0theories,\" Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN. Another presidential candidate, Cory Booker, told CNN that Trump is \"whipping people up into anger and worse\" and added that \u201cthis is a very dangerous president that we have right\u00a0now.\" Asked Tuesday if he believes Clinton had anything to do with Epstein's death, Trump said he didn't know. Trump did mention that Epstein, the accused sex trafficker,\u00a0owned\u00a0a private island where \"bad things\" happened. \u201cDid Bill Clinton go to the island?\u201d Trump asked. There is no evidence at all linking Clinton to\u00a0Epstein's death Saturday by suicide, yet Trump on Saturday night re-tweeted the comments of a Twitter user named Terrence K. Williams: \"Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH? Yeah right! How does that happen #JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this! RT if you\u2019re not Surprised.\" Epstein, the financier who had been facing federal sex trafficking charges,\u00a0was not on suicide watch\u00a0when he was found dead\u00a0in his jail cell early Saturday, officials said. Other conspiracy theorists on the Internet are trying to link Epstein's death to Trump, but there is no evidence of that either. Like Clinton, Trump was once friends with Epstein. After his remarks on Epstein, Trump departed for\u00a0Monaca, Pa., about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, where he will tour\u00a0the soon-to-be completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Trump plans to discuss his support for \"expanding domestic manufacturing and energy production,\" the White House said.",

Trump had said on Twitter that because of Google's misdeeds, \"Google must be sued\" and added that his electoral victory should have been larger. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, rated Trump's claim \"false.\" The site noted that Trump appeared to be referring to a 2017 research paper by psychologists Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson. The paper had claimed that users' search results were biased in favor of Clinton, which could have possibly shifted votes to her. The paper's methodology and findings have been\u00a0questioned by other academics. who said the paper had failed to adequately explain its methodology or even define what \"bias\" was.

More:FEC chair Ellen Weintraub on Trump claims: 'No evidence of rampant voter fraud in 2016' When reached by the outlet, Epstein said Trump mischaracterized his work. \"I have never said that Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election,\" he told PolitiFact. Epstein and Robertson had hedged their findings in their paper, too. \"We don\u2019t know what caused these patterns of bias,\" wrote Epstein and his co-author in the paper. Trump has frequently vented about his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. Trump won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to Clinton by several million votes, and Trump has claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally for Clinton.

      "author": "Savannah Behrmann",
      "content": "WASHINGTON-- Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, spent time Tuesday leafing through her emails that were on display at an art exhibit in Italy. Clinton, whose 2016 campaign was shadowed\u00a0by lingering questions after an\u00a0FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while leading the State Department, sat at a replica of the Oval Office Resolute Desk and thumbed\u00a0through thousands of emails during a\u00a0visit to an\u00a0art exhibit in Venice\u00a0titled \"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails.\" According to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects, the exhibit makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some\u00a060,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails which, according to WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013.\u201d \"Hillary Clinton spent an hour yesterday reading her emails at my exhibition of all 62,000 pages of them in Venice,\" Artist Kenneth Goldsmith tweeted. The former Democratic presidential candidate and first lady was \u201cguided on a closed-door visit\u201d of the exhibition, the curators say in a statement. \"I think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first,\" the show's curator, Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, told the Huffington Post. Clinton posted a picture of herself at the exhibit\u00a0Instagram, saying that she \"found\" the emails, so someone needed to \"alert the House GOP.\" Answering reporters questions outside the exhibit, Clinton told Italian news outlet TGR Veneto, \"It was and is still one of the strangest, most absurd events in American political history.\" \"And anyone can go in and look at them -- there's nothing there,\" Clinton says. \"It's an artistic way of making the same point that I made in the book I wrote, 'What Happened,' and that is, there was nothing wrong, there was nothing that should have been so controversial.\" On Twitter on Thursday morning, she said: \"Found my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP.\" During the 2016 White House race, then-candidate Donald Trump highlighted the long-simmering controversy surrounding\u00a0Clinton\u2019s usage of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State,\u00a0and chants of \u201clock her up\u201d would often break out at his campaign rallies. Then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0penned a letter to lawmakers after the\u00a0investigation that stated the FBI stood\u00a0by its original findings, made in July of 2016, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email while\u00a0secretary of State. The often-derided refrain of \"but her emails\"\u00a0was\u00a0heard on the trail and on social media during the 2016 campaign to justify support for Donald Trump over Clinton. The remark was often attributed to Clinton opposers who were searching for a way to offset\u00a0the latest negative news about Trump. Clinton was reportedly already in Italy to attend an economic forum. In a statement provided to the Hill, the curatorial\u00a0team said\u00a0\u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary Clinton has been part of this image full of possibilities. \"The exhibition is indeed the portrait of a powerful woman, but also the portrait of a historical change in our understanding of notions such as transparency, propaganda, public and private space,\u201d they also said.

      "content": "Chelsea Clinton ended speculation that she might\u00a0run for Congress next year during an appearance on the talk show \"The View\" on Wednesday. Clinton, 39, emerged as a\u00a0possible candidate\u00a0immediately following 30-year Rep. Nita Lowey's announcement on Thursday she\u00a0wouldn't seek reelection in 2020. She was considered a frontrunner in what is expected to be a crowded field, even though Clinton herself never said she was considering entering the race. On Wednesday, she directly addressed the rumors. \"I'm not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey's seat,\" Clinton said in response to a question from co-host Whoopi Goldberg. Chelsea Clinton:Could Chelsea Clinton run for a New York House seat? Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\u00a0said she understood why people asked her about running. \"Someone has asked me some version of this question literally as long as I can remember,\" she said before recounting that she remembers being asked if she'd run for governor of Arkansas at age 3 or 4. \"I share that because I think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\" she said, referring to co-host Abby Huntsman, the daughter of former Utah governor and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Hunstman. \"It\u2019s a question we should be asking kids, like, 'Do you think about running for office one day?'\" she said. \"I hope that if the answer to\u00a0that question is, 'Yes, I'm considering it,' that you'll really think about doing it and go to run for something.\" She said she wasn't sure if she'd run for office one day, but \"right now, the answer's no.\" October debate:Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate Lowey, 82, is a longtime fixture in New York's 17th Congressional District, which includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County. Clinton's parents have lived in the ritzy hamlet of Chappaqua in the Westchester part of the district since leaving the White House at the turn of the century. Chelsea Clinton lives outside of the district in New York City, but the U.S. Constitution doesn't require a House member to live within the district he or she represents. Lowey, chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, is the first woman to head the committee. Since the district is reliably blue and overwhelmingly Democratic, her retirement has sparked interest from a number of local Democrats. 'To me it will always be Columbus Day.':Trump dismisses criticism of Christopher Columbus But the Clinton name\u00a0propelled her to the front of the pack\u00a0without so much as a public statement from the would-be candidate, and drew comparisons to Lowey's own abandoned\u00a0U.S. Senate race in 2000. The congresswoman, a Harrison resident, had eyed a run for the Senate seat that year but stepped aside to allow Hillary Clinton a clear path to the nomination. Hillary Clinton went on to win election against Republican Rick Lazio. In 2006, she won reelection to the Senate against former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News host and friend of President Donald Trump. Clinton left the Senate in 2009 after running unsuccessfully for president to become President Barack Obama's Secretary of State. With Chelsea Clinton out of the running for the seat, there are two Democrats who are officially seeking the party nomination:\u00a0David Buchwald, a state Assemblyman from White Plains\u00a0who once interned for Lowey, and\u00a0Mondaire Jones,\u00a0who launched a primary challenge from the left in July well before Lowey's announcement she wouldn't seek reelection. Debate:CNN slammed for asking about Ellen, but not climate change, at Democratic debate Jones, 38, grew up in Spring Valley and attended Harvard Law School, raised $218,000 since launching his candidacy with the goal of becoming the first gay black man elected to Congress. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in the 17th district, according to state Board of Elections figures. Registered voters without party affiliation also outnumber Republicans in the district, 110,000-103,000, according to state active voter numbers.

After all, rumors of Clinton, 39, being groomed for New York's 17th Congressional District, have long been circulating. The district represents Rockland County and part\u00a0of Westchester County, including Chappaqua, where her parents, former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, live. In an interview with The Journal News/lohud.com last year, Chelsea Clinton said she would consider a political run under certain circumstances. \u201cI think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it\u00a0matched my talents, I\u2019d have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me,\u201d she said. While she didn\u2019t have any immediate plans to run for office, she told the paper,\u00a0it was something she thought about. \u201cIf you care about what\u2019s happening in the world, you have to care about running for and holding elected office,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI hope it\u2019s a question that we ask ourselves.\u201d Chelsea Clinton's spokeswoman did not respond to an email this week about her plans, but whether she'll run is a question many are asking.

Chelsea Clinton has been speculated to run for this seat. America, it's not too late. Come 2020 we could have them BOTH in office at the same time.\u201d Chelsea Clinton does not live in the district, but unlike her mother, who had to establish residency in New York when she ran for a Senate seat in 2000, she would\u00a0not have to engage the services of a real estate agent any time soon. Members of the House of Representatives are not required to live in the district they represent; they are required\u00a0to be at least 25 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and live in the state they represent. Chelsea Clinton\u00a0lives in Manhattan with her husband and three children, but could easily relocate\u00a0to the 17th District by moving\u00a0next door to her parents in Chappaqua. The Clintonsbought the\u00a0neighboring 3,600-square-foot home at 33 Old\u00a0House\u00a0Lane for $1.16 million in August 2016. Referring to reports it would be used as a getaway home for the couple's daughter and her family, Roni Jacobson, who has lived on Old House Lane since 1984, said when the Clintons bought the house:\u00a0\"It's a perfect house for (their daughter) Chelsea. Perfect mother-daughter situation. The neighbors are delighted for them.\" What does Lowey, the first woman to lead the powerful House Appropriations Committee, think about a possible Clinton run? \"She can do whatever she wants. She\u2019s an adult,\" said Lowey in an interview with The Journal News/lohud last November. \"When I decide to retire, I am sure the list will be very long (of people interested in the seat).\u201d More:Here are the lawmakers who aren't running again in 2020 On Sunday, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will be in Hyde Park\u00a0where Chelsea is set to receive the\u00a0Eleanor Roosevelt\u00a0Val-Kill\u00a0Medal \u2014\u00a0which honors\u00a0the legacy of the late first lady \u2014\u00a0at the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park.

Trump tweeted after Pelosi\u2019s announcement that the inquiry was \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d\u00a0and a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed claims for months that Biden as vice president sought the\u00a0ouster in 2016 of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0served on the board of directors. The push by the vice president came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from European diplomats and the U.S. State Department\u00a0because international leaders said Shokin did too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. The Ukrainian Parliament voted Shokin out. Ukrainian officials have found no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Contributing:\u00a0Bart Jansen and\u00a0Christal Hayes",

And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\u201d The former First Lady, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, has been married to former President Bill Clinton for more than 40 years. While Bill Clinton was president, he engaged in a\u00a0sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was eventually\u00a0impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of the extramarital affair. However, the Senate acquitted him of both charges, and Clinton went on to serve the remainder of his second term in office. Chelsea Clinton, when asked the same question after her mother, said\u00a0she was \u201coverwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words.\u201d Clinton also told ABC that she had not been questioned in relation to recent reports\u00a0that the Trump administration is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former State Department officials who sent emails\u00a0to her private email address. \u201cI think it's an unfortunate diversion,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou go and you talk to people who've been experienced diplomats for many years, and then you retroactively classify what they said 10 years ago? I think it's really a shame that they're doing that, and hopefully people will not be distracted.\u201d On Tuesday, Clinton also sarcastically responded to\u00a0Rudy Guiliani,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer,\u00a0who invoked the Clinton Foundation while defending his involvement in the Ukraine controversy\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \u201cWP [Washington Post], NBC, and CNN are going after me because I\u2019m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption,\u201d Giuliani tweeted. \u201cMeanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!\u201d Clinton quote-tweeted his statement and quipped, \u201cYes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u201d",

You can't let that stand.'\" Clinton said. \"But we don't know what he did.\" Colbert asked how she would have reacted \u2013 when she was America's top diplomat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to the president sending out his personal attorney to \"handle foreign policy,\" a nod to Rudy Giuliani's admission\u00a0that he contacted\u00a0Ukrainian officials at the direction of the State Department.

Clinton actually suggested it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard. Gabbard has continued to run with the statement and has used it as a way to rally supporters. She is now one poll away from qualifying for the November debate after polling at 4% in a recent national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a petty \u2018spat\u2019 between Mrs. Clinton and me,\u201d Gabbard said in the Wall Street Journal op-ed. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious contrast in views about the choice voters face as they decide which Democratic candidate is best equipped to defeat President Trump. Mrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different?\u201d Gabbard writes that she is not an \u201cisolationist\u201d by wanting to withdraw America from global conflict, writing she would\u00a0stop \"trying to police the world,\" \"overthrowing governments,\" and ending \"the new Cold War and nuclear arms race.\" She reiterated\u00a0that, \u201cThose who follow the Bush-Clinton doctrine believe the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions.\u201d Some of Gabbard's foreign policy views have raised eyebrows during her run for president. After the August debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, who is also vying for the Democratic nomination, called Gabbard a\u00a0Bashar al-Assad \"apologist\" and that she \"can only take what (Gabbard)\u00a0says in her opinion so seriously.\" During a January 2017 trip to Syria, Gabbard met with Assad, the President of Syria. She said in February that\u00a0\"Assad is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" She also opposed President Barack Obama's request\u00a0to use military force in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons against his people in 2013. Gabbard recently wrote of Clinton, \"From Iraq to Libya to Syria, her record is replete with foreign-policy catastrophes.\" \"Only when we recognize the failings of the past \u2014 embodied by Mrs. Clinton and her minions in the media \u2014 can we move forward to a future of peace, dignity, transparency and aloha,\" she concluded.

Chelsea Clinton, who was also interviewed, noted that the media's treatment of the former Meghan Markle\u00a0is probably due to her advocacy work and willingness to break the mold of what a royal is expected to be like. \"She proudly had a career first and has a voice that she thankfully continues to use,\" Clinton said. \"\u00a0Anyone who has the temerity to break the mold of what has previously been established and expected often, unfortunately, receives criticism and bile that I don't understand.

The royal, 35, continued: \"I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\" Harry compared the media treatment of Meghan to that of his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while evading\u00a0paparazzi. \"My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.

Some Iowans showed their support for Gabbard after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that Russians are \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0to run as a third-party candidate Friday. While Clinton did not name Gabbard, the comment appeared to be directed at the Democrat from\u00a0Hawaii. On Saturday, Gabbard said the past 24 hours had \"a lot of news,\" but it brought to the forefront the reasons why she believes her campaign is important: it threatens the party's establishment. More:Tulsi Gabbard fires back at Hillary Clinton suggestion that she's Russia's pawn Gabbard has said multiple times she is not considering a third-party run, both before and after Clinton's statement. \"She knows she can't control me,\" Gabbard told the Des Moines Register on Saturday.\u00a0\"She knows that if I'm the nominee, if I become president, she can't have any influence or any control over the kind of foreign policy I would lead our country in. Both her and her proxies and the foreign policy establishment.\" Gabbard said Clinton was the \"queen of warmongers\" on Twitter Friday in response to her comments. Despite the back-and-forth between Gabbard and Clinton, Gabbard was met with good cheer by Hawkeyes fans Saturday morning. A group of people at a tiki bar tailgate drank a round of Fireball whiskey shots in her honor, shouting \"Tulsi time!\" as she mingled with the crowd.

She's heard allegations about Gabbard's ties with Russia, but while she doesn't \"necessarily buy into it,\" Frazer said Americans should be wary of foreign governments' influence in the presidential election. \"I am concerned, not necessarily about Tulsi,\" she said. \"But it's something I'm very cautious about. I think we need to be cautious about in the future.\" Chris Forbes, a 52-year-old man in Iowa City, gave Gabbard a Twinkie as they talked politics. He already committed to caucus for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, but said it's important for foreign policy to take a bigger role in the presidential election\u00a0\u2014 something Gabbard brings. He doesn't agree entirely with Gabbard's positions. Forbes said\u00a0the U.S. military should still play some role in foreign conflicts, especially in cases when allies are at risk, like the Kurds in northern Syria following President Donald Trump's decision to leave the region. \"I agree that steps should be made to pull away from some of the actions of being the world's policemen,\" Forbes said. \"But I also believe the\u00a0standard of American democracy for 240 years has been to be a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. And as such, we need to have just enough present\u00a0to represent that freedom and world leadership toward democracy so that all groups can feel safe in being free to stand openly for what they believe.\" Gabbard said Clinton and other Democrats accusing her of being a \"Russian asset\" is a strategy to stop Americans from criticizing U.S. foreign policy decisions. \"This threatens our freedom of speech and is very revealing about the real motives behind this smear campaign that literally began the day I announced my candidacy for president,\"\u00a0Gabbard said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Richard Nixon nearly got impeached. Bill Clinton did. And Donald Trump could be next. A common thread running through all three imperiled presidencies? Hillary Clinton. In the 243-year history of the republic, just four U.S. presidents have faced impeachment inquiries.\u00a0In a bizarre plot twist that reads like bad fiction, Clinton \u2013 a former first lady, senator, secretary of State and almost-president \u2013 is connected to three of them. \u201cYou cannot make my life up. Really,\u201d Clinton joked recently with television host Stephen Colbert about her strange ties to the impeachment cases against the 37th, 42nd and 45th presidents. Clinton was still known as Hillary Rodham when, fresh out of Yale Law School, she was hired by the House Judiciary Committee to work on the impeachment case against Nixon during the Watergate scandal.\u00a0The memo they produced\u00a0is an official government document and is still relevant today in large part because it helps define what is considered an impeachable offense. Two decades later, Clinton was America\u2019s first lady, literally standing by her man, President Bill Clinton, in the White House Rose Garden, nodding her head in agreement as he decried \u201cthe poisonous venom of excessive partisanship\u201d following his impeachment in 1998. Two decades after that, Hillary Clinton would run for president herself and win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 to Trump, who is now facing an\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00a0amid accusations that he pressured a foreign power to investigate a political adversary, former Vice President Joe Biden. Impeaching Trump:Republicans condemn impeachment proceedings in resolution Clinton\u2019s office declined to comment for this article. But Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on\u00a0presidential impeachment, described Clinton\u2019s connection to impeachment proceedings against three presidents as \u201can odd coincidence\u201d and \u201ca testament to Hillary Clinton\u2019s longevity as part of the national political life.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a part of (the impeachment story),\u201d Bowman said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because she has been a part of the national story for so long.\u201d Before Watergate\u00a0in the early 1970s \u2013 a scandal that would eventually end Nixon's presidency \u2013 no American president had faced impeachment since Andrew Johnson a century earlier. Amid Watergate, with impeachment no longer a constitutional relic but a real possibility, the House Judiciary Committee tapped Clinton and a bipartisan team of young staffers to research the history of impeachment and explore possible grounds for impeaching Nixon. \u201cThe staff and members of the House understood that considering the impeachment of a president is a very big thing, and they wanted to make sure they understood the history and the law,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and expert on impeachment. Clinton and others on the bipartisan team produced a 64-page memo detailing the origins of impeachment dating\u00a0to the British Parliament more than 400 years ago\u00a0and the constitutional grounds that would be needed to impeach an American president. Among their conclusions: Criminal conduct is not needed to satisfy the definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d one of the thresholds the U.S. Constitution spells out for impeachment of a public officeholder. The 1974 memo \u201cis a tremendous piece of work,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much contribution Secretary Clinton had to that work, but given its length, I think it really covers the ground nicely. And I very much agree with almost all of its conclusions, particularly its conclusion about the kinds of things that are impeachable.\u201d The memo, an official government document, served as something akin to a road map for lawmakers as they embarked on the impeachment of Nixon. Over the course of four days in late July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee debated five articles of impeachment against Nixon and eventually approved three, accusing him of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. A week later, Nixon resigned before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment. Impeachment history:The times an American president was impeached (and the one time it came close) The memo that Clinton and her colleagues wrote was largely forgotten until 1998, when Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency was put in jeopardy by his extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. House Republicans dusted off and pored over the document as they began to contemplate articles of impeachment against the\u00a0husband of an author of the memo. \u201cPeople paid a lot of attention to it \u2013 partly because it was substantive and partly because of the irony,\u201d said Gerhardt, who himself cited the memo when he testified before a House committee contemplating Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. Then-Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who was one of the most vocal proponents of impeaching Bill Clinton, even used the memo to taunt the president\u2019s wife. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed addressed to \u201cDear Mrs. Clinton,\u201d Barr wrote that when he first raised the notion of impeaching her husband, \u201clittle did I realize your scholarly work 23 years ago would provide clear historical and legal basis and precedent for my proposition.\u201d \u201cI presume \u2013 but I must ask whether \u2013 you stand by your research and analysis today,\u201d Barr wrote before concluding with a caustic zinger: \u201cThank you, Mrs. Clinton, for giving Congress a road map for beginning our inquiry.\u201d On Dec. 19, 1998, Bill Clinton became the second American president to be impeached when the House, voting mostly along party lines, approved two articles of impeachment accusing him of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted him of both charges the following January. Mea culpa:After slamming Trump for 'lynching' tweet, Biden apologizes for using the term Hillary Clinton would go on to be elected U.S. senator from New York, serve as secretary of State under Barack Obama and lose her own bid for the presidency to Trump, who is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. And once again, Clinton figures into the impeachment discussions. Drawing on her own experience, Clinton has said in recent interviews that House Democrats had no choice but to open an impeachment inquiry against Trump following a whistleblower\u2019s claims\u00a0that Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Clinton \u201chas incredible insight to the impeachment process both personally and professionally,\u201d said author Amie Parnes, who has written a pair of books on Clinton\u2019s two unsuccessful campaigns for president. \u201cShe\u2019s seen what goes into an (impeachment) inquiry and also on the flip side, in her husband\u2019s case, how it can weigh on the president facing impeachment and, even in her case, how it impacts the president\u2019s family,\u201d Parnes said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen her really wrestle with the implications of impeachment even against someone like her former opponent President Trump.\" Clinton vs. Trump:Calling Trump a 'corrupt human tornado,' Hillary Clinton backs impeachment A couple of months ago, Parnes said, Clinton talked about how impeachment shouldn\u2019t be used for \u201ctrivial political\u201d purposes. \u201cBut I think, as with many Democrats, her views solidified with the whistleblower on the Ukraine call,\u201d Parnes said. \u201cI think for her this was a 'break glass for emergency' moment, even if some say she\u2019s almost too close to it.\u201d Clinton\u2019s impeachment memo has held up well over the years and could again serve as an important resource for lawmakers as they contemplate whether to file formal impeachment charges against Trump, Gerhardt said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have to go back and reinvent the wheel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis (memo) is sort of a good foundation, and my guess is the staffers have read it and it will be helpful to the current members.\u201d The prospect\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s memo could help bring down the man who dashed her own presidential ambitions is \u201cthe ultimate irony for Secretary Clinton,\u201d Parnes said, \u201cand in some ways, the ultimate vindication for her.\u201d \u201cIf she only knew then what she knows now.\" Perilous times for Trump:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeachment over Ukraine allegations, poll finds",

MANCHESTER, N.H.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s Hillary Clinton vs. Tulsi Gabbard on the sidelines of the 2020 presidential race. The Hawaii congresswoman fought back unsparingly after Clinton appeared to call her \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d in a recent interview and said she believes Republicans have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d Clinton, the former senator, U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, did not name Gabbard directly. In a series of tweets Friday, Gabbard called Clinton the \u201cpersonification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d Gabbard also alleged there has been a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to destroy her reputation since she announced her presidential run in January. \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me,\u201d Gabbard tweeted about Clinton. \u201cDon\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d More:Mueller sounded an alarm on Russian meddling in the 2020 election. Here is what happened last time There is lingering trepidation in the Democratic Party of a repeat of the 2016 presidential race, when Russia interfered in the U.S. election in an effort to help Donald Trump defeat Clinton. U.S intelligence agencies have warned that Russia intends to meddle in the 2020 presidential election, as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin has mocked that possibility, joking earlier this month that Moscow would \u201cdefinitely intervene\u201d again. During a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, Gabbard criticized a TV commentator who she said had called her \u201can asset of Russia.\u201d She called the comments \u201ccompletely despicable.\u201d Without naming Gabbard, Clinton seemed to echo the commentator\u2019s remark during a podcast appearance this week on \u201cCampaign HQ with David Plouffe.\u201d Plouffe was campaign manager for President Barack Obama in 2008 and served as a senior adviser to the president. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the person she had earlier identified as a woman \u201cwho\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary.\u201d \u2033They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d Clinton also called Trump \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s dream\u201d in the interview. She went on to say that Trump\u2019s inauguration speech was \u201clike a declaration of war on half of America.\u201d Clinton also describes 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d The Russians know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, Clinton added. Gabbard said later Friday on CBSN that she \u201cwill not be leaving the Democratic Party. I will not be running as an independent or a third-party candidate.\u201d Stein, who ran against Trump and Clinton as a Green Party candidate, received about 1% of the vote in the 2016 election, but some Democrats said her candidacy siphoned votes away from Clinton and helped Trump win, particularly in states like Wisconsin. The Senate Intelligence Committee asked Stein for documents as part of its probe into Russian interference in the election because she attended a 2015 dinner in Moscow sponsored by Russian television network RT with Putin. Stein has said she attended \u201cwith a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy and cooperation.\u201d In a tweet Friday, Stein accused Clinton of \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of private email and found violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action. The investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were \"culpable\" in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton's personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified. Although the report identified violations, it said investigators had found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\" However, it also made clear that Clinton's use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information. The Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative. More:Fact check: 12 questions and answers about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases. For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be. The report concluded \"that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.\" The department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton's private server to be \"top secret.\" Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign. Then-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges. The Justice Department's inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \"fairly confident that there wasn't an intrusion.\" Grassley started investigating Clinton's email server in 2017, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton's handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.",

      "author": "Nicholas Wu",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Hillary Clinton kicked off a political firestorm last week after making comments about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign on an Oct. 17\u00a0podcast. Clinton's comments were initially\u00a0erroneously reported as her saying\u00a0Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as a potential third-party presidential candidate. Clinton had actually suggested that it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had been speaking on Democratic strategist David Plouffe's podcast in a wide-ranging interview about President Donald Trump, impeachment, and the state of the 2020 Democratic primary. Several outlets picked up on the story, prompting a response from Gabbard on Twitter and elevating Gabbard\u00a0to the forefront of a news cycle. The problem is, however, that much of the controversy comes from\u00a0a misquote of Clinton's remarks. More:U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says Hillary Clinton 'knows she can't control me' Excerpts of Clinton's remarks started to go viral after the release of Plouffe's podcast, but it is important to put them in context since\u00a0some of the initial reporting missed some crucial\u00a0context around Clinton's remarks. In the podcast, Clinton had talked about how \"they've got their eye on somebody\" in the Democratic primary and are \"grooming her,\" followed by how \"she's the favorite of the Russians.\"\u00a0Out of context, it would appear that Clinton was referring to Russians \"grooming\" a candidate. They're also going to do third party. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who's\u00a0currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset, I mean totally. They know they can't win without a third party candidate. However, in the section of the podcast before those remarks, Clinton had been discussing the Republican Party's attempts to defeat Democratic presidential candidates and her concerns that a third-party candidate would take away votes in close races from a Democratic candidate, as some Democrats believe Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein did in 2016. On Oct. 18, as Clinton's misreported\u00a0comments started to pick up traction, and several news outlets published stories on her remarks,\u00a0Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang defended Gabbard, saying she \"deserves more respect and thanks than this.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, a Democratic presidential candidate, also defended Gabbard, tweeting that \"it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., responded to Gabbard's tweet\u00a0with a meme of his face from the first Democratic presidential debate. About a week after the initial controversy, several news outlets corrected the reporting of Clinton's remarks, including the version from the Associated Press used by USA TODAY. Clinton\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Nick Merrill highlighted The New York Times' correction and slammed the coverage of Clinton's remarks. \"I too am tired of talking about this, but let\u2019s again set the record straight,\" Merrill wrote on Twitter, using HRC to refer to Clinton.\u00a0\"HRC speculated that the only way the GOP is going to win in states where Trump can\u2019t hit a 50% majority is to 1) Suppress the vote, as they do widely and routinely, & 2) Bank on the 3rd party spoiler.\" Merrill added that media reports showed Russian propaganda and disinformation networks being used to bolster Gabbard's candidacy. Gabbard, however, has continued her criticism of Clinton and has used it as a way to rally her supporters. In an Oct. 23 tweet, Gabbard told Clinton to \"acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne.\" Gabbard tweeted that quote along with a link to a website for supporters to add their names to a list criticizing Clinton.",

After that incident, Clinton said she remembered thinking, \"truly he's been possessed.\" \"I don't understand\u00a0when it happened but it is a very clear case of a man who has gone over the edge\u00a0\u2013 probably pushed,\" she said. \"We need an exorcism,\" suggested Chelsea Clinton, who appeared with her mother on the CBS late-night talk show. Giuliani has been at the center of the impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine into opening a pair of investigations, one of them into former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats say Giuliani was conducting a \"shadow foreign policy\" in Ukraine to carry out\u00a0the president's wishes. The former New York City mayor has made several animated media appearances in defense of Trump since the president took office. Some of his statements, such as his declaration that \"truth isn't truth\" were widely lampooned and in other instances, he has appeared to reveal more than he intended, such as when he said Trump had used his own money ahead of the 2016 election to buy the silence of a woman alleging an affair with the former reality TV star.

      "content": "Hillary Clinton\u00a0shared the most out-of-line thing daughter Chelsea Clinton did while growing up in the White House, but it may not resonate with many parents. Appearing Tuesday on \"The Late Late Show,\" Hillary and Chelsea\u00a0were both asked by host James Corden about the \"most mischievous thing Chelsea did as a teenager in the White House.\" During President Bill Clinton's two terms in the '90s, Chelsea, now 39, moved into the Executive Residence at 12 and officially moved out at 20. Chelsea's answer? \"Nothing.\" \"I already know that's (expletive),\" Corden joked while reading over her shoulder. \"You did nothing mischievous?\" Chelsea responded with a smile: \"I was perfect, James.\"\u00a0But the former first lady had a different\u00a0recollection of her daughter's rebellious streak as a teen. \"My answer was 'order pizza,' \" Hillary said. \"Here's what I mean by that: When you're in the White House, you can't order pizza. And so when she would have friends over, they'd want to order pizza and it kept causing all kinds of commotion with the Secret Service. \"You'd get calls,\" she recalled. \"You know, 'There's a guy down here who says he's delivering pizza to the White House.' We'd say, 'No, no, that\u00a0\u2013 no!' \" \"Well, yeah. Yeah, they did, they ordered pizza,\" Hillary concluded. Chelsea Clinton\u00a0won't say how she felt that election night. But she was busy being a mom Hillary Clinton\u00a0says Duchess Meghan's race is 'certainly part of' media's treatment of her",

      "author": "Jeanine Santucci",
      "content": "In the latest development of the feud between Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, lawyers for the Hawaii congresswoman\u00a0sent a letter to Clinton demanding a retraction of comments alleging Gabbard is a \"favorite of the Russians.\" A political firestorm was set off after Clinton's remarks, made during an October podcast interview, that triggered a bipartisan outpouring of support and defense of Gabbard, from President Donald Trump to 2020 Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"Your statement is defamatory, and we demand that you retract it immediately,\" the lawyers wrote, adding that the retraction should be done at a press conference as well as in writing on social media and in the press. Explainer:What's the dispute between Hillary Clinton and Tulsi Gabbard about? Gabbard initially hit back at Clinton on social media and in media interviews, calling the former secretary of state the \"queen of warmongers.\" Gabbard has continued to rally her supporters with her criticism of Clinton. \"The statement is false. Congresswoman Gabbard is not being groomed by Russia to be a third-party candidate. Nor is she a Russian asset. Rather, she is a patriotic loyal American, a sitting four-term United States Congresswoman and a Major in the United States Army National Guard,\" the letter reads. Excerpts of Clinton's remarks started to go viral after the podcast's release but some of the initial reporting missed context around Clinton's remarks. It was later revealed by an aide that Clinton was referring to Republicans, not Russians, \"grooming\" Gabbard. Her remark that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" stands. \"They're also going to do third party. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who's\u00a0currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset, I mean totally. They know they can't win without a third party candidate.\" \"It appears you may now be claiming that this statement is about Republicans (not Russians) grooming Gabbard,\" the letter says. \"But this makes no sense in light of what you actually said.\" The lawyers went on to say that the comments were understood by the public to mean that Gabbard is a \"Russian asset.\"\u00a0They called Clinton's statement\u00a0\"so facially improbable that it is actionable as defamation.\" Here is what the lawyers want Clinton to say publicly: \"On October 17, 2019, I made certain statements about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Among other things, I accused her of being a Russian asset and that Russia was grooming her to be a third-party presidential candidate. I was wrong. I never should have made these remarks, and I apologize. I did not have any basis for making the statements. I acknowledge my grave mistake and error in judgment in this matter. I support and admire the work that Congresswoman Gabbard has done and will continue to do in serving our country.\" Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused\u00a0to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, \"I never say never to anything.\" The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was \"100%\" certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks \"all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.\" \"So\u00a0of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,\" she said. When she was asked a second time if she was ruling out another run, Clinton again declined to explicitly say she would not do it. \"I will certainly tell you, I'm under\u00a0enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,\" she said. \"But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.\" If Clinton does plan to enter the fray, time is not on her side as the filing deadlines have already passed in at least two states and others are fast approaching. And Clinton said Tuesday, \"it's way past time\" to get in the race. Trump vs. Clinton:Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton: Run for president again! Clinton to Trump: Do your job! Speculation about a 2020 rematch between Clinton and President Donald Trump, the man who defeated her in 2016, has swirled virtually since the moment the election results were announced three years ago. Though she declared in March\u00a0that \"I'm not running,\"\u00a0pundits began to rekindle the idea of a 2020 Clinton campaign after\u00a0former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's unexpected moves toward a late entry into the race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Duval Patrick is also said to be considering a last-minute run. Bloomberg is \"increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned\" to beat Trump, said his\u00a0adviser Howard Wolfson.\u00a0The New York Times reported Monday that wealthy Democratic donors have been hoping for fresh faces to enter the race amid concerns about fundraising totals and a lack of confidence in the strength of the leading candidates. Mark Penn, who was chief strategist for Clinton's 2008 presidential run, said Bloomberg's move could prod Clinton to consider a run and decide there's \"still a political logic there for her.\" Former Clinton adviser Philippe Reines said on Fox News last month that \"if she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump, I think she would think about it long and hard.\" And on Oct. 31., former President Bill Clinton dropped the aside that while he is ineligible for another term, his wife \"may or may not run for anything.\" In another BBC Radio interview on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton said, \"I try to give the best advice I can to the candidates who are running because my goal is to help retire the current incumbent.\" Clinton said she did not expect to endorse a candidate in the primary but would \"support them and answer their questions in any way that I can. But once we have a nominee to do everything I know to do to win.\" \"The process is unfolding,\" she said. \"And we'll see who emerges.\" More:Hillary Clinton says \u2018gutsiest' personal thing she ever did was stay in her marriage",

      "content": "When I heard about President Donald Trump's\u00a0unexpected weekend visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, honestly,\u00a0my first thought was the stress and strain of impeachment coupled with his Big-Mac-KFC diet finally got the better of him. Instead, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying, \u201cAnticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington D.C. to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed.\u201d Grisham would later add via tweet that \u201cfurther speculation beyond the extensive & honest info I put out is wholly irresponsible & dangerous for the country.\u201d But how\u00a0\u201croutine\u201d was this medical visit? And can you blame many of us for asking? Trump has made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days, according to The Washington Post Fact Checker.\u00a0He and his aides\u00a0have lied about everything from the trivial to important matters of national security. They lied about inauguration crowd sizes, his affair with porn actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels, and why he fired\u00a0FBI Director James Comey. This administration has lost any right to the benefit of the doubt. It\u00a0is beyond absurd for\u00a0Grisham, who has yet to conduct even a single White House press briefing, to expect anyone to believe a word she says. When it comes to speculating about health, Grisham might want to revisit the ghosts of Donald Trump\u2019s very recent past. In September 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton disclosed that she had pneumonia \u2014 a common illness that is the most common cause of hospital admissions\u00a0in the United States\u00a0(other than women giving birth). This of course prompted her then rival, Donald Trump, to attack her health and Trump\u2019s smear team of Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone to spread\u00a0conspiracy theories to allies on the right that Clinton had suffered from \u201cseizures\u201d or had \u201cbrain damage\u201d Before he was running Trump\u2019s campaign for president, Steve Bannon was running Breitbart News, pushing headlines such as, \u201cThere\u2019s Something Seriously Wrong with Hillary Clinton\u2019s Health.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity used his show to run a relentless crusade targeting Clinton\u2019s health. The Washington Post reported on a Thursday in August 2016 that Hannity had been hammering on a\u00a0debunked story every night that week, summoning \"a 'Fox News Medical A-Team' to probe the claim that Hillary Clinton has serious medical issues, covered up by a press that won\u2019t demand her medical records.\u201d I don\u2019t remember Grisham or Trump or anybody in their camp denouncing Hannity, Bannon, Corsi or Stone for being \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d or \u201cdangerous\u201d back then. We should have known:Donald Trump wrote his own medical report. Reckless language makes that obvious. Trump didn\u2019t seem to concerned with \u201cspeculation\u201d when, during an appearance on Fox, he invented a conspiracy theory that Clinton \u201cgoes away for five or six days and you don\u2019t see her. She goes to sleep.\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson didn\u2019t seem to be preoccupied by what was good \u201cfor the country\u201d when she appeared on MSNBC and made the insane allegation that Clinton was suffering from the language disorder \u201cdysphasia.\u201d Donald Trump has given us more pause to doubt his fitness for office than Hillary Clinton ever did. Which brings us to Trump\u2019s unscheduled visit Saturday to the doctor. Can you imagine what the Trumps and Bannons and Hannitys of the world would have done to Hillary Clinton had she gone to\u00a0an unscheduled doctor\u2019s appointment? Age is not just a number:Bloomberg + Sanders + Biden + Trump + Warren = 374. What's wrong with this 2020 picture? This White House is so steeped in lies and hypocrisy that it is virtually impossible to tell fact from fiction. The bottom line is you have to ask yourself two questions, and\u00a0answer them: \u25baIs this president capable of lying to the American people? Yes. \u25baIs the White House press secretary capable of lying to the press to cover up the president\u2019s lies?\u00a0Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders have shown us the answer to that question is also a resounding yes! Trump\u2019s unexpected doctor\u2019s visit could very well be an unplanned\u00a0but routine medical check in an effort to get ahead of his 2020 schedule. But it also could be something much more serious. At the very least, I think Trump deserves the same benefit of the doubt that he and his allies gave Hillary Clinton. None.
