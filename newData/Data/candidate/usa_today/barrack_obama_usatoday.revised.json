      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Lashing out at probes into his 2016 campaign and Russian election interference, President Donald Trump said Friday that investigators ought to look into a book deal signed by former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. \"Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\u00a0\"Let's subpoena all of his records.\" Though Trump didn't elaborate, he appeared to be referencing reports that the Obamas secured a $60 million advance for one book written each by Michelle and Barack Obama. The former first lady's book, \"Becoming,\" was published last year and quickly became a best seller. After summoning reporters to the Oval Office unexpectedly, the president sounded off on several issues: The president's reaction followed a high-profile hearing on Capitol Hill this week featuring former special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump, who acknowledged watching much of that hearing, has repeatedly criticized Democrats for holding it. \"All they want to do is impede, they want to investigate, they want to go fishing,\" Trump said. \"There is no collusion, there is no obstruction, they have nothing. It's a disgrace.\" During the hearing, Mueller largely summarized the report of his findings released in April.\u00a0While he said investigators did not gather sufficient evidence to prove a conspiracy, he said that \"problematic is an understatement\" to describe some of Trump's conduct. Specifically,\u00a0Mueller reinforced his conclusion that his investigation had\u00a0\"not exculpated\" Trump on the question of whether he sought to obstruct justice by trying\u00a0to impede the\u00a0investigation. Trump didn't limit his criticism of former President Obama to the book deal. He also took issue with a heating and cooling system installed by his predecessor. \"Now that they did the system,\" Trump said. \"It's freezing or hot in here.\"",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne Two professors from\u00a0the\u00a0American University of Afghanistan, one of whom is a U.S. citizen, were\u00a0released from Taliban captivity Tuesday as part of a prisoner exchange with the militant group previously announced by\u00a0Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. The two men \u2013 American Kevin King, 63,\u00a0and Australian Timothy Weeks, 50 \u2013 were ambushed at gunpoint while leaving the university\u00a0in 2016. They last appeared in a video released in 2017 appealing to President\u00a0Donald Trump to\u00a0secure their release. In the video, they appear pale and gaunt. The Taliban prisoners were\u00a0flown to Qatar for the expected swap for the American and Australian hostages, Taliban officials said Tuesday.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t immediately known if the two hostages\u00a0were handed over to the Afghan government or U.S. forces. The White House welcomed the news and thanked the Afghan government \"for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.\" Ghani confirmed the deal in a televised speech last week and said he hoped the move would \"pave the way for face-to-face\" peace talks with the Taliban. He said the decision was made in coordination with the United States and international community. Afghanistan peace process:2020 hopefuls owe Afghan women their support Three Taliban commanders\u00a0\u2013 Anas Haqqani, Haji Maali Khan and Abdul Rasheed Haqani \u2013 were released as part of the agreement, the president said. He did not specify where King and Weeks were held or to whom they would be\u00a0released. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien made separate calls to Ghani on Monday to discuss the prisoners'\u00a0release, Ghani\u2019s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The\u00a0American University of Afghanistan\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday that it \"shares the relief of the families of Kevin and Timothy.\" In September, Trump\u00a0ended months of U.S. peace\u00a0negotiations with Taliban leaders, who control large parts of Afghanistan, after the group\u00a0admitted killing a U.S. soldier in a suicide bombing that killed 12\u00a0people in total. The\u00a0canceled peace talks were to be held with the Taliban and the Afghan president at the U.S. president's country retreat at Camp David. The talks, complicated by the Taliban and Afghan\u00a0government's unruly relationship,\u00a0were aimed\u00a0at securing a peace deal to end nearly 20 years of war in Afghanistan, a conflict that has killed at least 2,400 U.S.\u00a0soldiers, according to the\u00a0Pentagon. In 2014, President Barack Obama announced the formal end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an invasion that took place after the\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001, attacks because the Taliban\u00a0provided\u00a0refuge to the perpetrators, al-Qaida. About 14,000 U.S. forces remain in the country under a NATO mission that has dragged on with no clear conditions for walking away. Withdrawing the majority of them is one\u00a0of Trump's signature campaign promises. Afghanistan War veterans:\u00a0Was the sacrifice worth it? U.S. Navy SEAL commandos attempted to rescue King and Weeks in a suspected Taliban hideout in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan shortly after they were kidnapped, The Guardian\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2017. They may have missed the men by only a few hours. The Taliban said King\u00a0suffered\u00a0from heart disease and had a kidney problem. \"If we stay here for much longer, we will be killed. I don\u2019t want to die here,\" Weeks said in the video released in 2017, addressing Trump. The three Taliban commanders who were released as part of the agreement are members of the Haqqani network, which is the same Taliban affiliate that held U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl captive in brutal conditions for five years after he walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009. Bergdahl was released in 2014 in a prisoner exchange with the Taliban\u00a0brokered by Qatar. A U.S. military judge\u00a0sentenced Bergdahl in 2017 to a dishonorable discharge and a reduction in rank but no time behind bars. Bergdahl\u00a0pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, and his case drew an especially\u00a0strong reaction from Trump, who branded Bergdahl a \"dirty rotten traitor.\" Trump has shown an active interest in freeing American hostages detained in Iran, Russia, Yemen\u00a0and other global hot spots. He has\u00a0talked about these cases on Twitter and leveraged the support of allies such as the United Arab Emirates and France to conduct raids aimed at freeing Americans. In September, Trump\u00a0appointed Robert O'Brien, the State Department's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, to the more high-profile national security adviser\u00a0role\u00a0vacated by John Bolton. Sunday, Trump tweeted that it would be \"a very positive\" step for U.S.-Iranian relations if Tehran returned Robert Levinson. Levinson, 71, worked\u00a0for the FBI before his disappearance from Kish Island, off the southern coast of Iran, in 2007. An Associated Press investigation revealed\u00a0Levinson was on an unsanctioned mission for the CIA in Iran.\u00a0Levinson was last seen alive in a\u00a0hostage video in 2011 and is the longest-held American hostage in U.S. history. Iran has long denied that it abducted Levinson or knows his whereabouts or even whether he is still alive. Trump raised the issue again after Iran's Revolutionary Court filed a\u00a0missing persons case connected to Levinson with the United Nations. \"The hard part is seeing one of our grandchildren doing something that's he's missing. I know how much he loves children and doted on our own,\" Levinson's wife, Christine, told USA TODAY in an interview. \"Bob's missed it all. High school years, college years. He's missed walking two daughters down the aisle.\" Contributing: Associated Press",

      "subtitle": "Trump can begin steps to pull US out of Paris climate deal",
      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For more than two years President Donald Trump\u00a0has talked about pulling the United States\u00a0out of the landmark Paris\u00a0climate agreement. Starting Monday he finally can do something about it. Even then, though, the withdrawal process takes a year and wouldn\u2019t become official until at least the day after the 2020 presidential election. In the Paris agreement, nearly 200 countries set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat-trapping gases. It was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by the United States and China and\u00a0went into effect\u00a0Nov. 4, 2016. The terms of the deal say no country can withdraw in the first three years. So Monday is the first time the U.S. could actually start the withdrawal process, which begins with a letter to the United Nations. And it doesn\u2019t become official for a year after that, which leads to the day after the election. If someone other than Trump wins in 2020, the next president could get back in the deal in just 30 days and plan to cut carbon pollution, said Andrew Light, a former Obama State Department climate negotiator now at the nonprofit World Resources Institute. Light and other experts say the withdrawal by the United States, the second biggest climate polluter and world\u2019s largest economy, will hurt efforts to fight global warming. \u201cGlobal objectives can\u2019t be met unless everybody does their part and the U.S. has to play the game,\u201d said Appalachian State University environmental sciences professor Gregg Marland, who is part of a global effort to track carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cWe\u2019re the second biggest player. What happens to the game if we take our ball and go home?\u201d Someone else, probably the biggest polluter China, will take over leadership in the global fight, said MIT economist Jake Jacoby, who co-founded the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The penalty for the U.S. \u201cis not in economic loss. The penalty is in shame, in discrediting U.S. leadership,\u201d Jacoby said. Asked what the U.S. plans next, State Department spokesman James Dewey on Friday emailed only this: \u201cThe U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement has not changed. The United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\u201d The agreement set goals of preventing another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) to 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) of warming from current levels. Even the pledges made in 2015 weren\u2019t enough to prevent those levels of warming. The deal calls for nations to come up with more ambitious pollution cuts every five years, starting in November 2020 in at a meeting in Scotland. Because of the expected withdrawal, the U.S. role in 2020 negotiations will be reduced, Light said. Climate change, caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas,\u00a0has already warmed the world\u00a0by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since the late 1800s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. And scientists say, depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century with\u00a0temperatures jumping by several degrees\u00a0and\u00a0oceans rising\u00a0by close to three feet (1 meter). Trump has been promising to pull out of the Paris deal since 2017, often mischaracterizing the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sided That\u2019s not the case, experts said. For example, the U.S. goal \u2014 set by Barack Obama\u2019s administration \u2014 had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in 2025 by 26% to 28% compared to 2005 levels. This translates to about 15% compared to 1990 levels. The European Union\u2019s goal was to cut carbon pollution in 2030 by 40% compared to 1990 levels, which is greater than America\u2019s pledge, said Stanford University\u2019s Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that track carbon emissions worldwide. The United Kingdom has already exceeded that goal, he said. \u201cThe U.S. agreement is not a tax on the American people. There is no massive wealth transfer,\u201d said Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, who was a lead State Department climate negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \u201cIn fact, the agreement obligates no country to make any financial payments.\u201d Formally getting out of the Paris agreement is bad, but at this point after years of rhetoric is more symbolic than anything, said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. She said she is more worried about other Trump carbon pollution actions, such as fighting California\u2019s tougher emissions and mileage standards and rollbacks of coal fired power plant regulations. The U.S. was not on track to reach its Paris pledge, according to the federal Energy Information Administration\u2019s latest projections. The EIA projects that in 2025 emissions will be at 4959 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 17% below 2005 levels, about 500 million tons short of the goal. Emissions in 2018 were nearly 2% higher than in 2016, the agency\u2019s\u00a0latest energy outlook\u00a0says. That spike likely was from extreme weather and economic growth, Marland and Jacoby said.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 As a National Security Council official\u00a0testified in the impeachment inquiry,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his\u00a0allies responded by attacking Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's\u00a0credibility and nationality, drawing rebukes from attorneys and even some Republicans. \"Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned'\u00a0today\u2019s Never Trumper witness,\" Trump said during a morning-long series of angry tweets criticizing the impeachment process. \"Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\" Some Trump supporters, meanwhile, stressed that\u00a0Vindman, a Ukraine expert with the National Security Council,\u00a0was born in Ukraine, questioning his patriotism in a manner that drew condemnation from legal analysts. \"They are so desperate to smear and attack anyone who dares testify against the president,\" said Bradley P. Moss, an attorney who specializes in national security issues. Some Republican lawmakers also criticized the tactic. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, a Trump supporter, decried the attacks on Vindman and others,\u00a0telling reporters:\u00a0\"It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this NATION.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky., said he would not address the merits of the House impeachment probe, but added:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to question the patriotism of any of the people coming forward.\" Though he claimed he had never heard of Vindman,\u00a0Trump later described him as \"a Never Trumper.\" \"How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\" Trump later tweeted. Vindman, a career military officer who was wounded in Iraq,\u00a0said he told superiors that Trump may have been undermining national security as he attempted to tie aid to Ukraine to its willingness to investigate U.S. political opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The demand was reflected in a July phone call between Trump and\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for\u00a0the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\"\u00a0Vindman wrote in his prepared remarks\u00a0obtained by USA TODAY. In what looked like a coordinated effort to undermine Vindman's credibility, Trump and allies spent most of the day attacking him\u00a0\u2013 including the fact he was born in Ukraine. Saying Vindman has \"an affinity\" for Ukraine, ex-U.S.\u00a0Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., told CNN that\u00a0\"it\u00a0seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy.\" Smears about some kind of \"dual loyalty\"\u00a0 are \"reprehensible and desperate,\" said Neal Katyal, an acting solicitor general during the Barack Obama administration. Chris Lu, the White House Cabinet Secretary for President Barack Obama, noted that Vindman was wounded in Iraq. \"When the facts are on your side, argue the facts,\" Lu tweeted. \"When the facts aren\u2019t on your side, argue about process. When a decorated Iraq War vet wounded in an IED attack delivers devastating testimony, question his loyalty to the country. This is what the GOP has been reduced to.\" In addition to attacking the witness, Trump again decried the entire impeachment process, and again called for identifying the whistleblower whose complaint began the process.\u00a0\"Where\u2019s the Whistleblower?,\" he said in another tweet, saying that anything beyond the transcript of his call \"is made up garbage.\" At another point,\u00a0Trump sought to shift the political agenda: \"The Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc. The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!\"",

And his next interaction with a president will certainly draw national attention. Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance for Saturday\u2019s\u00a0SEC West showdown between No. 2 LSU and No. 3 Alabama inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an honor, I think, that the President of the United States would be interested enough to come to the game,\u201d Saban said Wednesday morning.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do everything we can to welcome him.\u201d Saban, often considered the president/CEO of Alabama\u2019s football program, has had more than his fair share of presidential interactions throughout his head coaching career. That includes allowing the Secret Service to \u201cborrow\u201d Saban\u2019s\u00a0couch from his office in 1995, when he was head coach at Michigan State. \u201cBill Clinton came to Michigan State to speak at the graduation commencement ceremony, and they actually headquartered in our (football) facility building, so I had an opportunity to meet him and talk to him,\u201d Saban recalled Monday. \u201c(At one point), the Secret Service guys came and got my couch and asked if they could take it to his office so he could take a nap and I said, \u2018Certainly.\u2019 \u201d Saban notoriously declined a 2006 dinner opportunity with then-President George W. Bush while\u00a0he was head coach of the Miami Dolphins, because he had\u00a0training camp responsibilities. \"It was really a tough decision,\" Saban said in 2006, according to the AP. \"I feel like my first responsibility is our team. That in no way disrespects the importance of the opportunity;\u00a0I would have loved to have had to spend dinner with the president.\" Saban previously met Trump when Alabama\u2019s 2017 national championship team was honored during a mid-April 2018 visit to the White House. Saban and the Crimson Tide were also honored during four other trips to the White House under the Barack Obama administration in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2016. Saban also visited Washington in 2004 following LSU\u2019s 2003 national championship. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the White House several times and it\u2019s always a very, very flattering, unique experience,\u201d Saban said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 The game had not even started, and Lakers fans were already stirred up. They usually reserve applause for when LeBron James throws down a dunk or when Anthony Davis blocks a shot. Just like when they witnessed his countless game winners and determination to play through injuries, the fans reacted that way for Kobe Bryant\u2019s mere presence at the Staples Center before L.A.'s 122-101 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday. \u201cI got chills when the crowd started going nuts,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. So did the Lakers and the 18,977 fans when Bryant walked on the court with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The Lakers have become used to Hollywood celebrities attending their games. James has played before former President Barack Obama, former NBA star Michael Jordan and even the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But Bryant\u2019s presence meant something more. \u201cHow could you not be? That\u2019s one of the greatest players to ever play this game, take time out of his day on a Sunday,\u201d James said. \u201cHe\u2019s got one of the greatest female players that\u2019s about to come up sitting next to him in Gigi. So I\u2019m just trying to put on a show for him and give him a reason to think, \u2018OK, we might come to another game.\u2019 \u201d Bryant attended one Lakers game last season. Otherwise, he's kept a respectful distance since retiring following the 2015-16 season. Lakers governor Jeanie Buss has often expressed hope that Bryant will take\u00a0any role he wants in the team\u2019s organization, but Bryant has channeled his energy into his self-named company that specializes in books and digital storytelling. Bryant respectfully declined to talk to a handful of reporters, but he conversed with everyone that approached him. Before Bryant walked to his court-side seat, he caught Lakers center Dwight Howard by surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know who it was. He slapped me on the neck and I was about to elbow him,\u201d Howard joked. He shook hands with Howard and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, man. You\u2019re playing good.\u201d Bryant offered similar encouraging words to James shortly after the game began. In between a Hawks foul shot midway through the first quarter, James darted across the court toward Bryant. They shook hands and smiled at each other. On the next play, James sank a 3-pointer. The nature of James\u2019 relationship with Bryant has\u00a0evolved during James'\u00a017-year NBA career. First, James admired him from afar as a high school phenom from Akron, Ohio, eager to follow Bryant's footsteps in the NBA. Then, James and Bryant became respected rivals that never met in the NBA Finals. Then once he joined the Lakers last summer, James said Bryant \u201cwelcomed me with open arms.\" \u201cIt\u2019s just dope,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so surreal for me just a kid from Akron to be able to have a guy like Kobe just take time out of his day. Even at this point in my career, it\u2019s still special.\u201d Bryant mentored Davis since teaming up on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team in London. So when Davis made a turnaround jumper, Bryant yelled encouraging words to him. Davis said: \u201cI took that from you.\u201d Bryant has given Lakers third-year forward Kyle Kuzma just as much advice ever since the Lakers drafted him at No. 27 two months following Bryant\u2019s retirement. Since then, Kuzma estimated that Bryant visits him a few times a year, which has included house visits, dinners and phone chats. \u201cAny time I need something,\u201d Kuzma said, \u201che\u2019s right there for me.\u201d Bryant\u2019s relationship with Howard has warmed since he has revitalized his career. When they played together in the 2012-13 season, Bryant and Howard clashed endlessly over personality differences and roles. Howard left for Houston as a free agent partly because of concerns about Bryant\u2019s presence and his ability to overcome a surgically repaired left Achilles tendon. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the past,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThis is a new age and new day. We\u2019re all about positive vibes.\u201d That is because Bryant\u2019s presence Sunday only reminded them\u00a0of their glorious past and reinforced the team\u2019s aspirations to win the franchise\u2019s first title since Bryant won his fifth in 2010. So when the arena videoboard plugged his newest children\u2019s novel during a timeout midway through the second quarter, Lakers fans cheered as if Bryant scored. When the videoboard showed Bryant, the noise increased. Bryant clapped, put a hand over his heart and stood. He waved and thanked them for their support. \u201cHe deserves it. One of the greatest Lakers of all time and one of the greatest players of all time,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have him here in attendance and (he) definitely energized the crowd and our team.\u201d Follow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram",

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Isabel Toledo, the Cuban-American fashion designer with an avant-garde flair who created former first lady Michelle Obama's standout lemongrass-colored sheath dress and matching overcoat for her husband's 2009 inauguration, has died. She was 59. Toledo died of breast cancer, her studio said in an email. Further details were not immediately available. Though she presented her first collection in 1985, Toledo's work grabbed attention after Obama wore some of her looks at the inauguration, including the lemongrass shift dress in wool and lace. Born in Cuba, Toledo arrived in West New York, N.J., as a teenager, later attending but not graduating from fashion college. She met her Cuban-born husband, the fashion illustrator and painter Ruben Toledo, in high school. An avid seamstress from a young age, Toledo attended New York's Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons School of Design,\u00a0where she studied painting, ceramics, and fashion design. She was an independent designer but served briefly as creative director for Anne Klein. On the day of President Barack Obama's inauguration, Jan. 20, 2009, Toledo, her husband and their team were stunned to see the new first lady wearing one of her creations. \u201cWe\u2019re levitating \u2013 we really are,\u201d Ruben Toledo told WWD, minutes after watching Obama on TV. The husband-wife team tuned in surrounded by their staff in their New York showroom. They had not known what Obama planned. \u201cWe had no idea. We hoped she would wear something because she has bought Isabel\u2019s clothes before. We never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another shock, but a great shock.\u201d The fashion world began mourning\u00a0on social media. \"The fashion world has lost today a rainbow of talent and joy. RIP my friend Isabel Toledo. You and your husband Ruben inspired of all us. You created magic and showed us how love is the most powerful tool to create fantasy. Today is a sad day,\" posted Elle magazine editor and Project Runway judge Nina Garcia. The Toledos were known as an art couple as much as a fashion couple; eventually they became a true power couple in the design world as the embodiment of the intersections between fashion and art. \"What matters is to have free expression always,\" a philosophy they said they learned after meeting Andy Warhol by accident in 1977. Several of their museum exhibits focused on this theme: In 2000, \"Isabel and Ruben Toledo: A Marriage of Art and Fashion,\" opened at\u00a0Kent State University Museum. For an exhibit that opened at the Detroit Institute of Arts in December, they\u00a0created clothing, sculptures, paintings\u00a0and illustrations for a show, titled\u00a0\u201cA Labor of Love,\u201d that highlighted\u00a0the synergy between fashion and art.\u00a0She designed clothing to complement permanent artworks already on display in the museum\u2019s galleries, and he painted and illustrated accompanying imagery to works like Diego Rivera\u2019s famous Detroit murals. The result was a \"charmingly eclectic exhibition imbued with humor and pathos, in which the Cuban-American couple riffed on everything from the Diego Rivera \"Detroit Industry\" murals to art in the Egyptian and Early American galleries,\" said Michael H. Hodges, the Detroit News' fine\u00a0arts writer. In \"Synthetic Cloud,\" sky-blue dresses with puffy tulle skirts were suspended above a sculpture by Donald Judd\u00a0and a Frank Stella geometric painting. The effect is like \u201ca soft, poetic mist floating above you,\u201d Ruben Toledo told New York Magazine's The Cut. \u201cThey become like flowers floating up in the sky.\u201d For the fashion world, Isabel Toledo was a low-key designer who shunned the limelight and cared more about craft and construction than the lure of fame. But at the Fashion Institute of Technology, museum director Valerie Steele considered her a \"genius.\" In 2009, the FIT museum featured a mid-career retrospective of Toledo's work, \"Fashion from the Inside Out.\" On the wall at the entrance to the exhibit was a quote from the designer: \"I never thought of myself as a designer. I'm a seamstress.\" Contributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY",

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders are the top picks for Latino voters as the Democratic candidate\u00a0to combat President Donald Trump in next year\u2019s presidential elections, according to a new Telemundo poll. Biden, who served as vice president under former President Barack Obama,\u00a0garnered 26% of Democratic Latino voters in the survey, compared to 18% for Sanders, 10% for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 3% for Sen. Kamala Harris and 2% each for Julian Castro, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, according to the poll. O'Rourke dropped out of the race last week. \u201cThis is a phenomenon of name recognition,\u201d said Jeronimo Cortina, associate director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Houston. Biden has been \u201cattached to Obama and he has been in the political limelight for more than two decades.\u201d The survey \u2013 Noticias Telemundo\u2019s \u201cState of the Latino Vote Poll \u2013 One Year Out\u201d \u2013 interviewed 1,000 registered Hispanic voters nationwide over four days in late October. It offered some of the most detailed questions put to Latino voters in the run-up to the 2020 elections. Latino voters are likely to play a key role in that race. Next year's elections will mark the first time that Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13% of eligible voters, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. An estimated 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, higher than the 30 million eligible black voters, according to the Pew analysis. Democratic candidates vying for the presidential\u00a0nomination\u00a0have been courting Hispanic support, from answering questions in Spanish during televised debates to organizing forums with Latino leaders. Latinos represent\u00a0only 3.4% of eligible voters in Iowa, site of the first Democratic caucuses in February, but could play pivotal roles in other states with larger pools of Latino voters, such as Nevada (19%), New Mexico (43%) and Texas (30%). The Trump campaign has also set its sights on Latino voters. In June, Vice President Mike Pence,\u00a0speaking to a Latino crowd in Miami,\u00a0launched the \"Latinos for Trump\" coalition, an effort to woo Hispanic voters. In the Telemundo poll, 64% of respondents said they would like to see Trump replaced as president versus 25% who would prefer he get reelected. That means Trump, despite controversial immigration policies and congressional impeachment hearings, still holds roughly the same Latino support \u2013 28% \u2013 that helped elect him in 2016, according to exit polls. Other findings from the Telemundo poll include: Hispanic voters also showed they were strongly split along party lines for their support for Trump and on different issues, mirroring the political partisan divide evident across the U.S. Among Latino Democrats, 86% said they wanted Trump replaced next year, while 73% of Latino Republicans wanted him reelected. And 87% of Latino Democrats said they disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance as president, compared to 89% of Latino Republicans who approve of his performance. Overall, 57% of those polled supported impeaching the president, though that question also broke sharply down\u00a0political lines, with 79% of Latino Democrats supporting impeachment and 92% of Latino Republicans opposing the measure. \u201cIt points to the diversity of this electorate,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew Research Center. \u201cWhen you think about the Latino vote, it\u2019s not always the same.\u201d Most Latino voters \u2013 70% \u2013 felt that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has encouraged anti-immigrant sentiment, racism or discrimination in the U.S., according to the poll. But only 35% of those polled said they were \u201cvery\u201d worried of becoming the victim of a hate crime, such as the shooting at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart in August, while 25% said they were \u201csomewhat\u201d worried and 27% said they were \u201cnot at all\u201d worried.

      "author": "",
      "content": "BOSTON\u00a0\u2013 Deval Patrick is entering the\u00a0Democratic presidential primary so late that his name won't even make it on the ballots in Alabama and Arkansas and he will have to work fast\u00a0to make it on Michigan's. It's a \"Hail Mary from two stadiums over,\" the 63-year-old former two-term Massachusetts governor acknowledged to the Boston Globe in an interview Thursday. And yet Patrick, just 80 days before the primary kicks off with the Iowa caucuses, has made a calculation that he can break through\u00a0a still-fluid field of Democrats that hasn't found a front-runner with staying power. So has former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has also signaled he plans to enter\u00a0the fray. Both men\u00a0ruled out runs for president less than a year ago. Their sudden\u00a0shifts come as former Vice President Joe Biden has failed to seize\u00a0control of the race and has seen his poll numbers decrease. And some in the more moderate wing of the party are\u00a0wary Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are too far left to ensure victory\u00a0against President Donald Trump next year. \"I think Patrick probably views there being an opening as\u00a0a more-moderate in the race that's not Biden,\" said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at Tufts University.\u00a0\"Biden, I think, has some weaknesses as a candidate including his age, and there's\u00a0going to be someone in that space that's not as left as Warren or Sanders.\" More:Deval Patrick, former Massachusetts governor, enters 2020 presidential race So far, the only other candidate who has found traction in that lane to challenge Biden, Schaffner said,\u00a0is\u00a0former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Others like U.S Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Michael Bennett have\u00a0eyed that ground but have not gained traction. \"I suspect that Deval Patrick thinks that maybe\u00a0he could be competitive in that space,\" Schaffner said. \"That's probably the impetus.\" Patrick, the state's first African American governor, serving 2007 to 2015,\u00a0joined the private equity firm Bain Capital after his tenure. A\u00a0video announcing his bid played up\u00a0his humble beginnings growing up in the South Side of Chicago to reach the\u00a0\"American Dream.\" In an interview with CBS This Morning, where he was previously a\u00a0contributor, Patrick framed himself as a\u00a0unifier\u00a0who can\u00a0\"bring us together,\" echoing the kind\u00a0of message that former President Barack Obama was known for. Without identifying names, and applauding the Democratic field as \"really talented and really gifted,\"\u00a0Patrick outlined the lane he hopes will lead him to the nomination. \"We seem to be migrating to, on\u00a0the one camp, sort of nostalgia \u2014 'let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president and we can go back to doing what we\u00a0used to do,' \" Patrick said.\u00a0\"Or 'it's our way, our big idea, or no way.' And neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together and\u00a0bring some humility.\" Among the Democrats who Patrick spoke with Wednesday was Obama, a friend of Patrick's. He declined to discuss what was said. \"He has the same concerns and encouragement \u2014 concerns that you've expressed on air and encouragement that you've expressed off air,\" Patrick told CBS News anchor Gayle King.\u00a0\"Which is to say that we need to reach to the best of America, not just the best of our party.\" Patrick faces challenges in\u00a0fund-raising, staff-building and name recognition outside of New England. For his bid to take off, it's likely critical he perform well in neighboring New Hampshire, where he filed paperwork Thursday to run in the primary. He could be positioned to challenge Biden for African American voters in South Carolina, another early voting state,\u00a0if his candidacy gains momentum. John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said there's no data to suggest Democratic voters have any additional anxiety about their crop of candidates over what is typical in any election. In fact, he said enthusiasm among Democrats is higher than\u00a0last cycle. \"However, qualitatively, through the party insiders and beltway folks, etc., there seems to be anxiety regarding every element of the field \u2014 not just a particular person\u00a0\u2014 because there's no consensus yet about what their formula will be to take on and then beat Trump,\" Della Volpe said. \"I think it's part of a natural process.\" Patrick cited \"the\u00a0cruelty of our elections process\" when he ruled out a presidential run last December. He told WBUR, one of Boston's NPR radio stations,\u00a0that his wife had just been diagnosed with Stage 1 of uterine cancer a few weeks before his decision. Former Massachusetts Lt Gov. Tim Murray, who ran as a ticket with Patrick in 2006 and now\u00a0heads the Worcester Chamber of Commerce, said he talked to Patrick Thursday about his run but was not part of conversations leading up to his decision. \"Unlike most pols, who are kind of the consultant types, his checklist doesn't start with 'can I raise the money and can I put together the organization,' \" Murray said. \"I think the threshold question for him when he ran for governor in 2006 and runs for president now is 'do I feel that I've got a story and a vision to share that I think the American people are interested in.' \" Reach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.",

Lindsey Graham praised President Donald Trump on Wednesday, telling him the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will be remembered as the \"defining moment\" of his presidency and that if he wins reelection\u00a0it will be because of the federal judges he has put on the bench. The South Carolina Republican made the remark at a White House event celebrating the president's judicial appointments. \"The defining moment of your presidency, for me, was\u00a0the Kavanaugh hearing,\" said Graham, who sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation and has since become the committee's chairman.\u00a0\"This room would be empty if we had failed Brett Kavanaugh.\" Impeachment:Lindsey Graham says he won't read transcripts of testimony in 'sham' process 'This is a lynching, in every sense':Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate' During the confirmation process, Graham fiercely defended Kavanaugh after allegations of past sexual misconduct against the nominee surfaced.

Mr. President, thank you for not pulling the plug,\" he said. If people\u00a0had \"failed Brett Kavanaugh\" and let the allegations derail his confirmation, he said, it would have discouraged young conservatives who might have otherwise aspired to become federal judges.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chaired the Judiciary Committee through the Kavanaugh hearings, told Trump that \"20% of the people voted for you\" in 2016 because of his promise to put conservatives on the Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that on election night in 2016, when\u00a0it became clear that Republicans would control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in a decade, he knew the Supreme Court would be the most important thing on their agenda. McConnell said Trump \"had been helped enormously\" by \"a decision that I made,\" after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, to not allow then-President Barack Obama to \"fill that Scalia vacancy on the way out the door.\" Scalia died in February 2016,\u00a0about 11 months before Obama left office. McConnell did not allow Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland to come to the Senate floor for a vote, leaving vacant the seat that Trump eventually filled with Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And boy, you didn't blow it.

Donning a fedora, the senator-turned-kingmaker made a rare appearance before a roomful of reporters ahead of a fundraising event for 2020 Democrats at the Bellagio. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to start crossing people off the list,\u201d Reid said Sunday. One of the first four early-voting states in the Democratic nominating process, Nevada is a battleground where candidates look to prove the legitimacy of their campaign. Reid, who spent eight years as the Senate\u2019s top-ranking member and built a fabled voter turnout machine, left office the same month as Barack Obama, a close friend who he had encouraged to run for president. The storied Nevada senator talked about his distaste for dependency on polls numbers out of conservative-leaning\u00a0states like Iowa. \"Iowa is not representative of our country,\" Reid said. \"My personal feeling is I don\u2019t think it matters what happens in New Hampshire or Iowa.\" Pete Buttigieg\u00a0rocketed to\u00a0the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll\u00a0in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register\u2019s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register\u2019s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% \u2014 a 4 percentage point rise. Those four candidates began to pull away from the crowded field of Democrats and separate into a top tier of contenders in June's Iowa Poll. Biden, Warren and now Buttigieg have all taken turns atop the poll, with Sanders consistently in the top four. This latest poll underscores that separation. The group\u2019s next-closest competitor, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, trails well behind, at 6%. On Wednesday,\u00a0the House Intelligence Committee conducted the\u00a0first day of\u00a0public testimony\u00a0in the impeachment investigation\u00a0of President Donald Trump. The witnesses included\u00a0Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine,\u00a0and\u00a0George Kent, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. Reid applauded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her handling of the proceedings \u2013 a job he described as \"masterful.\" \"She\u2019s doing a remarkably good job in educating the American people as to what has gone on and whether or not she will move forward with impeachment,\" Reid said. \"Donald Trump has done irreparable damage to the Republican Party.\" The GOP will need time to recover from the Trump era and return to the party's roots, Reid said. \"Right now, those of us who served on the Senate prior to Trump look at the Republican senators and just shake our heads,\" Reid said. \"This isn\u2019t the way it used to be.\u201d Even in retirement, Reid wields\u00a0formidable political power \u2013 but he said there's no part of him that misses\u00a0Capitol Hill. He answered questions in a conference room at the Bellagio while sitting in a wheelchair. In 2018, he\u00a0underwent surgery\u00a0at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center in Baltimore to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas and later underwent\u00a0chemotherapy. Reid is content watching national politics unfold from Nevada. \u201cI believe in the Old Testament verse or two where it says that there\u2019s a time for planting and a time for harvesting, and that was my time in Washington,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI enjoyed every minute I was there, but I don\u2019t in any way want to be there now\u2026I did my time.\u201d Contributing: Des Moines Register.",

He also promoted the \"birther\" conspiracy during former President Barack Obama's time in office and said Obama was only elected because he is black. More:Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announces he will challenge Trump in Republican primary When asked by Stephanopoulos on Sunday\u00a0to address instances of his own racism, including his promotion of the false conspiracy that Obama is Muslim and remarks against Sen. Kamala Harris, Walsh said he has reflected on his previous statements. \u201cI said some ugly things about President Obama that I regret,\u201d Walsh said. In 2017, Walsh tweeted \u201cWe LOWERED the bar for Obama. He was held to a lower standard cuz he was black.\u201d \u201cI had strong policy disagreements with Barack Obama, and too often I let those policy disagreements get personal,\u201d he said Sunday. Walsh has a history of inconsistency in his opinions of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. At times, he has denounced the president as a racist.

It\u2019s offensive, ignorant, anti-American, and racist,\u201d Walsh tweeted. But it was not that long ago that Walsh thought Trump\u2019s language made him a bully, but not a racist, and that Walsh was still making racist claims about Obama: Walsh said the one good thing about Trump's language since he has been in office is that Trump has made him realize his attacks were inappropriate. The difference between them? \u201cWe have a guy in the White House who\u2019s never apologized for anything he\u2019s done or said. I think it\u2019s a weakness not to apologize,\" Walsh told Stephanopoulos.\u00a0\"I helped create Trump, there\u2019s no doubt about that. The personal, ugly politics, I regret that and I\u2019m sorry for that. And now we\u2019ve got a guy in the White House, George, that\u2019s all he does.\u201d",

      "content": "Sponsored by Healthy Gem WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is considering making a late run for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to two people with knowledge of his deliberations, underscoring some Democrats' deep uncertainty about the party's current crop of contenders. Patrick, a close friend and ally of former President Barack Obama, ruled out a presidential bid earlier this year but has since been talking with Democratic operatives and donors about launching a campaign. He has not made a final decision on whether to run, but he is expected to do so quickly, given fast-approaching deadlines to get on the ballot in key states. Patrick is the second Democrat to weigh jumping into the race at this late juncture, less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also reconsidering a run, citing concerns about the current Democratic frontrunners' ability to defeat President Donald Trump. Bloomberg is expected to make a final decision on his 2020 prospects within days. The people with knowledge of Patrick's deliberations spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide Though he ruled out a run earlier this year, Patrick reopened conversations with close friends and aides over the summer, but did not steps to form a campaign. In recent days, those conversations have intensified, with Patrick himself gauging interest in a run with donors and Democratic operatives. He would face big hurdles to launching a campaign at this late stage. Unlike Bloomberg, a wealthy billionaire who would self-fund, Patrick would have to quickly raise money to build out a campaign operation and boost his familiarity with voters. Some of his former political advisers are already working for other 2020 candidates. Patrick, who made history as Massachusetts' first black governor, could gain traction in neighboring New Hampshire, which holds the first primary contest. However, he'd face stiff competition from two other neighboring contenders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. The schedule:When are the 2020 presidential election primaries? New Hampshire's primary filing deadline is Friday. Patrick flirted with the idea of launching a 2020 White House bid before deciding late last year against jumping into the race. At the time, he cited what he called the \"cruelty\" of the election process. \"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\" Patrick posted on his Facebook page last year. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \"cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\" Associated Press writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.",

In a video released Thursday morning,\u00a0Patrick, 63, played up his poor upbringing on the South Side of Chicago\u00a0and traced his journey to the \"American dream,\" the path to which is \"closing off,\" he said. \"I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field.\u00a0They bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,\" he said. \"But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country.\" Patrick made a passing reference to President Donald Trump\u00a0but did not mention him by name. The election, he said, is \"about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader\" but about \"delivering instead for you.\" Election 2020:In California's 2020 primary, Latino voters could help Democrats defeat President Trump Patrick is a close ally of former President Barack Obama\u00a0and had explored a bid for the presidency before deciding not to run. In August 2018, allies of Patrick launched a political action committee called Reason to Believe, and Patrick spent time ahead of the 2018 midterms stumping for Democratic candidates. But in December, Patrick took his name out of the running, citing \u201cthe cruelty of our elections process.\u201d \"I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact,\" Patrick said in a statement posted to Facebook at the time. \"But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom (my wife)\u00a0and I love, but who hadn\u2019t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask.\" Patrick's decision reflects uncertainty from some about the direction of the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden entered the race as the front-runner and maintains significant support from black voters, whose backing is crucial in a Democratic primary. But he\u2019s facing spirited challenges from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, progressives whose calls for fundamental economic change have alarmed moderates and wealthy donors. Young voters:Can they again push Democrats to victory in 2020? Patrick\u2019s candidacy faces a significant hurdle to raise enormous amounts of money quickly and to build an organization in the traditional early voting states that most of his rivals have focused on for the past year. And he\u2019ll have to pivot to the expensive and logistically daunting Super Tuesday contests, when voters in more than a dozen states and territories head to the polls. Patrick graduated from Harvard Law School and later went on to be part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration as chief of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Patrick is not the only moderate Democrat who is seeking a late entry into the 2020 race. Michael Bloomberg is also weighing a bid, billing himself as a more centrist alternative who\u00a0could beat Trump. Because of his late bid in the race, Patrick will likely not make the debate stage in December, where he will need at least 200,000 unique contributors and at least 4% in four national or early state polls, or at least 6% in two early state polls. The Massachusetts Democrat will likely benefit from his state\u2019s proximity to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. Contributing: The Associated Press",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg missed oral argument Wednesday because of\u00a0 a stomach illness, less than three months after completing treatment for her fourth bout with cancer. Ginsburg, 86, was \"indisposed,\" Chief Justice John Roberts announced from the bench. But he said she would participate in deciding the two cases\u00a0argued Wednesday by reading briefs and the transcript of the oral argument. The leader of the court's liberal wing, Ginsburg has become a cultural icon during her third decade on the high court. She has kept up a rigorous travel schedule around oral arguments, most recently appearing at Georgetown University Law Center alongside the president who nominated her in 1993, Bill Clinton, and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. More:After cancer, Supreme Court's Ruth Bader Ginsburg hits the road to prove her vitality \u2013 and longevity Ginsburg missed two weeks of oral arguments in January following surgery for lung cancer, marking the first time in her 26-year Supreme Court career she had been absent. Then in August, she underwent three weeks of radiation for pancreatic cancer. The lone statement issued by the court after her latest bout was upbeat. \"The tumor was treated definitively and there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body,\" it said. \"Justice Ginsburg will continue to have periodic blood tests and scans. No further treatment is needed at this time.\" The justice's first encounters with cancer came in 1999, when she had colon cancer, and in 2009, when she had her first bout with pancreatic cancer, a particularly deadly form. \"As cancer survivors know, that dread disease is a challenge, and it helps to know that people are rooting for you,\" Ginsburg said in September during an appearance at the famed 92nd Street Y in New York City. She vowed to stay on the job \"as long as I'm healthy and mentally agile.\" Even if Democrats win the White House next fall, Ginsburg would have to\u00a0remain on the court at least until\u00a0January 2021 to avoid giving President Donald Trump and a\u00a0Republican-controlled Senate the opportunity\u00a0to replace her. Such a scenario could give conservatives a 6-3 hold on the high court,\u00a0solidifying their majority \u2013 perhaps\u00a0for decades to come. Ironically, one of the lawyers arguing before the court Wednesday was University of California, Berkeley Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, who wrote in 2014 that Ginsburg should step down so that President Barack Obama could nominate her successor. The justice did not follow that advice\u00a0\u2013 but she did make an appearance at Berkeley Law last month.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "There is nothing coincidental about President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden interest in sports. The clock is ticking, with the next presidential election now less than a year away. Like every president \u2013 heck, any politician \u2013 Trump needs to make himself relatable, and there are few better ways in a country that loves its sports than by attending games or participating in recreational activities. Both of the Bushes were avid baseball fans, and George W. Bush was often photographed jogging or biking. Barack Obama played pickup basketball, and filled out brackets for the NCAA tournaments. Trump plays golf \u2013 lots of golf \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily qualify as relatable. So we saw Trump at a World Series game two weeks ago and at a UFC fight last weekend. On Saturday, he\u2019s expected to attend LSU-Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium. \u201cNow that his election campaign is in full gear, he needs to use every opportunity he can to show he participates in popular culture,\u201d said Kenneth T. Walsh, a White House correspondent for U.S. News and World Report since 1986 and author of Celebrity in Chief: A History of the President and the Culture of Stardom. \u201cHe needs to bond with the country in as many ways as he can, and use sports to bond with key constituencies,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cHe recognizes different sports appeal to different people, just as different policies appeal to different people.\u201d THE BIG GAME:QB Joe Burrow on Trump attending Alabama-LSU: 'The president at the game is pretty cool' That isn\u2019t all, of course. Trump craves adoration, the kind of fawning reception he gets at his rallies, and he\u2019d go to a tiddlywinks tournament if it means people will cheer and chant his name. If it happens at a nationally televised event, or will be captured on video that he can promote on Twitter, all the better. That hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 yet. Trump was booed vigorously at the World Series, and fans at Nationals Park chanted \u201cLock him up!\u201d He was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos when he arrived for the fights at Madison Square Garden. It was no wonder, then, that Trump looked as much relieved as pleased when catcher Kurt Suzuki donned a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during the Washington Nationals\u2019 visit to the White House on Monday, and Ryan Zimmerman gushed about the president. Finally, after so much rudeness and disrespect, here were people who liked him! LSU-Alabama would seem to be an equally friendly environment. Trump won Tuscaloosa County by almost 20 points in 2016, and his net approval rating in Alabama is higher than in any other state. \u201cI\u2019m not very shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s visit, said Jason Castillo, president of the University of Alabama College Democrats. \u201cLSU-Alabama is a very high-profile game. Fans of both of these teams are going to be people who generally support him, so it\u2019s not very surprising to me at all really. It seems like a pretty safe bet.\u201d Nothing is guaranteed, however. Both Bushes, Obama, Harry Truman \u2013 all were booed at at least one sporting event. And Trump is more polarizing than all of them combined. When it seemed for a few hours Wednesday that Alabama might punish students who boo Trump, there was widespread outrage. Turns out, the \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d Alabama\u2019s Student Government Association had referenced was altercations between students \u2013 mix enthusiasm and alcohol, and bad things often happen. There\u2019s also been some grumbling about the heightened security, and the additional wait times and traffic jams that will result. Alabama\u2019s SGA asked students to be inside the stadium by 12:30 p.m., two hours before kickoff. \u201cThat\u2019s causing a little bit of frustration among students,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThere\u2019s less time for tailgating and more time waiting in line.\u201d And even those who might otherwise be supportive get irritated when they think a president is using a game or sporting event solely for show. Though Trump isn\u2019t as avid a sports fan as, say, Obama or George W. Bush, he did go to New York Yankees games when he was a private citizen and often attended night matches at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Since being elected, Trump attended the college football championship in 2018, as well as last year\u2019s Army-Navy game. He also went to the U.S. Women\u2019s Open when it was held at his club in Bedminster, N.J., in 2017. And of the 14 Presidential Medals of Freedom that Trump has awarded, seven have been to athletes. Eight when you consider that Alan Page was a Hall of Fame defensive tackle long before he was a Minnesota Supreme Court justice and education advocate. But Trump also has not been above using sports for his own gain. He has denigrated Colin Kaepernick, Megan Rapinoe and other athletes who have protested during the national anthem to draw attention to racism and social inequality. His interest in public sporting events has just happened to coincide with the escalation of the impeachment proceedings. \u201cOne of the dangers of presidents, in being very visible sports fans, is if people feel they are going too far and just using sports for crass political reasons,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cPresident Trump is willing to take the chance. He\u2019s willing to go to these events and risk being booed because he might get the opposite reaction,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cAnd he knows it will be covered widely. That fits in to his re-election purposes.\u201d If Trump doesn\u2019t get the warm reception he wants at LSU-Alabama, maybe he\u2019ll pop up at another sporting event next weekend. Oh, look! There\u2019s a NASCAR race. Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.",

Airing after an hours-long public impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill, the candidates were immediately asked about the president and the bombshell testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that Trump had created a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d scenario with Ukraine. \u201cWe have a criminal in the White House,\u201d Kalama Harris said. \u201cThe president felt free to break the law again and again and again and that is what has happened with Ukraine,\u201d Elizabeth Warren argued. \u201cWe have to establish the principle (that) no one is above the law.\u201d Trump has always cast a long shadow over the debates, but it was particularly true Wednesday as Americans continued to process hours of lengthy testimony delving into the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. That rub was clearly on display as the candidates attempted to break through wall-to-wall impeachment hearings coverage to elevate their own proposals. \u201cWe cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election,\u201d Bernie Sanders said. A Biden moment:Biden said you have to 'keep punching' to address domestic violence Is Tulsi a Democrat?:Gabbard prompts a brawl with Kamala Harris The debate came during what is potentially a reshuffling of the field, as Pete Buttigieg has surged in Iowa polling and the candidates have confronted the possibility of new challengers. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, is in the race but was not on stage. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid and is ready to spend millions. The debate was the first since Buttigieg has zoomed ahead in polling, but there was little sign initially that his higher status put a target on his back. There were few direct attacks on him during the first hour, and, at one point, Harris declined an opportunity to weigh into a controversy involving a stock image of a Kenyan woman on his website promoting a plan to address racial inequality. That changed as the debate neared its conclusion as Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar questioned his experience for the job. Buttigieg, whose rise has reportedly unnerved his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said that South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d On taxes, Warren began by touting her two-cent on the dollar tax on assets over $50 million. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. Booker criticized the plan, calling it \"cumbersome.\u201d Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. The next debate will take place Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. Biden touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was endorsed by the only African-American woman that has ever been elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself. Biden was likely referring to Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the Senate. The Illinois woman served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. As the stage erupted, Biden corrected himself to say the \u201cfirst\u201d African American woman. Things got testy between Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg during a lengthy exchange about what kind of experience is needed to be president. When Buttigieg suggested his military service prepared him to be commander in chief, the Hawaii congresswoman slammed him for saying this week he was open to sending troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels under certain circumstances. Buttigieg said Gabbard was taking his remarks out of context and then swiped back at her for meeting in 2017 with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in the country\u2019s civil war. \"If you're talking about experience, let's talk about judgment,\" Buttigieg said. \u201cI would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.\u201d Gabbard fired back, saying Buttigieg lacks the \u201ccourage\u201d to sit down with the nation\u2019s adversaries. -Michael Collins and John Fritze Two days after an association of Democratic\u00a0state\u00a0attorneys general became\u00a0the first national party committee\u00a0to impose an explicit abortion litmus test on its candidates,\u00a0Warren was asked whether there\u2019s room in the party for those who oppose abortion. Saying abortion rights are human rights and economic rights, Warren said they\u2019re fundamental to what the party stands for. She was pressed on whether the party should exclude recently-re-elected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards who has signed anti-abortion legislation. \u201cI have made clear what I think the party stands for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of the party.\u201d Klobuchar said she can\u2019t wait to be in a debate with Trump and tell him that 70% of the public support Roe v. Wade. \u201cHe is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said. Booker related abortion rights to voter suppression, saying it was voter suppression in Georgia that led to the election of a governor who supported anti-abortion legislation. - Maureen Groppe Cory Booker slammed Joe Biden for saying this week that he would not support legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. That view has put him at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties,\u00a0polls\u00a0show. - John Fritze Biden\u2019s response to how he would address domestic violence drew laughter for his unfortunate choice of words at the end of his response. The former vice president was on firm ground when he began his answer by reminding the audience that he authored legislation to address violence against women. He then argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said. \u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d - Maureen Groppe Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d -Michael Collins Biden and Sanders took issue with Steyer\u2019s claim to be the only candidate who would make addressing climate change his No. 1 as president. Steyer said he would declare a state of emergency over the issue on Day One and would also make it the top priority of his foreign policy. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Priority One,\u201d Steyer said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to get done.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from my friend,\u201d Biden interjected. He said that while he was working in the Obama administration on efforts to address climate change, Steyer was introducing more coal mines around the world. \u201cI welcome him back in the fold here,\u201d Biden said. Sanders said he\u2019s introduced legislation to declare climate change a national emergency and the government may also have to prosecute the fossil fuel industry for lying about how their product affects the planet. - Maureen Groppe Kamala Harris didn\u2019t mince words as she went on the attack over Donald Trump\u2019s policy in North Korea following reports that Kim Jong Un has no interest in another summit with the president. \u201cDonald Trump got punked,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d Would she make additional concessions to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table? No, Harris responded. Noting that Trump inherited North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons\u00a0program from the Obama administration \u2013 and other past administrations \u2013 Biden was asked how he would handle the issue differently from Obama. Biden pivoted to compare his approach to Trump\u2019s, saying he would work to rebuild U.S. alliances with allies in the region. -\u00a0John Fritze Cory Booker used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Pete Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in firsts place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. The New York Times recently reported that some candidates resent the attention and the campaign donations that have flowed Mayor Pete\u2019s way. - Michael Collins Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden offered subtly different answers over whether they believe Donald Trump should be prosecuted after his time in the White House is over. Sanders argued that no one is above the law and that, in his view, the president had obstructed justice and had committed other crimes. Biden said he would leave that decision to his Justice Department and that Democrats shouldn\u2019t go down the path of chanting \u201clock him up,\u201d a reference to a refrain often sounded at Trump campaign rallies about Hillary Clinton.\u00a0That chant has been heard at Sanders rallies, Maddow said. \u201cI would not direct my Justice Department like this president does,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI would not dictate who would be prosecuted.\u201d Sanders said he agreed with that part. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Sanders said, but then added: \u201cWhat I am of the opinion of is that the American people now do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d - John Fritze Buttigieg, whose recent surged in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has reportedly annoyed his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d He argued that he can go toe-to-toe with Trump because he comes from the kind of Rust Belt community that Trump is appealing to, his military experience and knows how to bring people together to get things done. A moderator followed up by asking Klobuchar about her recent comment that a female candidate with Buttigieg\u2019s experience probably would not have made it to the debate stage. First saying that she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be at the debate, she reiterated her belief that women candidates are held to a different standard. Otherwise, she quipped, people would be able to play the game \u201cName Your Favorite Woman President.\u201d \u201cWhich we can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, adding that female candidates, \u201chave to work harder, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d But if voters worry that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, she concluded, \u201cNancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d - Maureen Groppe It started with Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Tulsi claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from Kamala Harris, who accused Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and inuendoes because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\" What started it? Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard and that Gabbard was a \"favorite of the Russians.\" On Oct. 18, Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" -- John Fritze and Nicholas Wu Sen. Bernie Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during a discussion on health care. After Elizabeth Warren talked about the need to reform the nation\u2019s health care system and touted the benefits of Medicare for All, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his healthcare plan. - Michael Collins Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. President Barack Obama recently warned fellow Democrats that \u201cthis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.\u201d Asked about that in the context of Medicare for All, Sanders said Obama is right that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to tear down the system.\u201d But Washington does need to deliver on what the public wants, and people understand the health care system is \u201cnot only cruel, but dysfunctional,\u201d he said. - Maureen Groppe In past debates, Democrats opened with a lengthy exchange on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Elizabeth Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. What's Warren's plan?:Elizabeth Warren willing to show Bill Gates how much she'd tax him: 'I promise it's not $100 billion' \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" she said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome.' Saying that all the Democrats on stage support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" -\u00a0John Fritze Elizabeth Warren said she hoped ambassadorships would no longer be handed out \"to the highest bidder,\" a swipe at Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who spent much of Wednesday testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Appointing donors as ambassadors is nothing new \u2013 Democratic presidents did it, too. But Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about 30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Sondland gave $1 million to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen. \"These kinds of donations were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" - John Fritze The first question dived into the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with Warren being asked how she will try to convince her Republican colleagues to remove President Donald Trump if he is impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, `First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. Then Warren quickly pivoted to a key campaign theme of hers, corruption. \u201cHow did Ambassador (Gordon) Sondland get there?\u201d she asked of Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union whose dramatic testimony today of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d implicated top White House officials. Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said Sondland is an example of how money buys its way into Washington and, as president, she won\u2019t give away ambassadorships \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201d - Maureen Groppe The Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta is under way. Ten candidates will be seeking to differentiate themselves and break through hours of impeachment inquiry hearings earlier Wednesday. And that is the first question going to the candidates. -- John Fritze After October\u2019s three-hour debate, tonight\u2019s two-hour version may fly by. The candidates won\u2019t be giving opening statements and will have only about one minute at the end to make a final pitch. Tonight\u2019s questioners are an all-female panel of journalists: MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell join forces with Kristen Welker, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour are sponsoring the next debate on Dec. 19.\u00a0The Democratic National Committee has been ratcheting up the fundraising and polling levels that candidates must achieve to participate. - Maureen Groppe Although there are 10 candidates on stage, only three had a major presence outside Tyler Perry Studios. At least two dozen supporters of Pete Buttigieg held pickets with his campaign sign, at times chanting \u201cPETE FOR PRES.\u201d The Yang Gang was also out in full force. A huge fluorescent \u201cMATH\u201d sign was posted up and a man on stilts was walking around holding two large fans that said \u201cANDREW YANG.\u201d At times the group of supporters would chant some of Yang\u2019s signature phrases like \u201cPOWERPOINT.\u201d A group of Joe Biden supporters also represented the former Vice President. They would wave signs as cars passed by to enter Tyler Perry Studios. The largest groups outside the studios though were not for candidates, they were advocating for two different policies. A large group of advocates protested against family separation at the border and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. The demonstrators held banners that send \u201cEnd Deportations\u201d and \u201cChinga la migra.\u201d There were also demonstrators, who were mostly people color, advocating for charter schools. A marching band for KIPP Academy, a local charter school, marched in front of the gates of Tyler Perry Studios to advocate for charter schools. - Rebecca Morin Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is likely to get extra attention from both moderators and his fellow competitors because of his recent rise in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He\u2019s leading the field in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren can expect to be quizzed on her recent backing of a glide path into Medicare for All, a step she took after attacks from Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden that people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. Biden, who entered the race as the frontrunner, will be under pressure to show he can live up to that expectation. Unease about his performance so far is one reason why former Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval recently entered the race and why former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering it. - Maureen Groppe One candidate has been popping up on the television screens of early voting states a lot more than the others: Billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The $13 million he spent on advertising in the past month accounts for more than 50% of the total amount of advertising from all the candidates \u2013 including President Donald Trump, according to an analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project released Wednesday. \u201cResidents of early voting states are seeing many more television ads from presidential candidates this cycle than they did in the 2016 presidential race, and the reason can be summed up in one word: Steyer,\u201d said Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. What Steyer says:Tom Steyer shares his views on current issues Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock made their first ad buys in the past month. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also recently ramped up their spending. Buttigieg\u2019s recent surge in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire corresponds with his increased spending on both TV and digital ads, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not possible to attribute the surge entirely to his ad spending, it has certainly played some role in his recent success,\u201d Ridout said. \u201cA strong debate performance tonight, combined with continued heavy ad spending, could help cement his place in the top tier of Democratic candidates.\u201d The number of ads that have run is way up from a comparable point in the 2016 presidential race. One difference, however, is fewer ads are being paid for by outside groups. Candidates may have done so well at raising money from small-dollar donors that they haven\u2019t needed the support of political action committees that can collect large sums from wealthy donors, said Michael Franz, another co-director of the project. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he said, \u201cmany large-dollar donors may still be waiting out this race to see which horse to bet on.\u201d - Maureen Groppe",

      "content": "A petition on MoveOn.org to rename a New York City street in front of Trump Tower after former President Barack Obama has attracted more than 260,000 signatures. The petition, addressed to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council, requests that\u00a0\"the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets be renamed 'President Barack H. Obama Avenue.'\" Trump Tower is at\u00a0725 5th Avenue. \"I honestly started it as a joke,\" Elizabeth\u00a0Rowin, the petition's organizer said to Newsweek. \"I saw a comedian joke about how it would make Trump so mad if it was named after former President Obama and thought why not.\" The petition is unlikely to succeed, though. According to a 2012 city\u00a0video outlining New York City's street renaming rules, the honoree must be deceased and have the support of a petition signed by\u00a075% of the local residents. Obama, while out of political office, is not deceased. Furthermore, the local community board has placed a moratorium on street renaming,\u00a0District Manager\u00a0Wally Rubin told USA TODAY. \u201cI am sure the conditions can be changed,\u201d\u00a0Rowin told\u00a0Newsweek when the outlet asked her about the city's prohibitions on renaming streets after living people. Rowin added\u00a0that \u201cThese laws are arbitrary and can be worked around.\u201d The tactic of renaming a street after a figure's political opponent is not uncommon. In Washington, D.C. petitioners had the street\u00a0in\u00a0front of the Russian embassy named after\u00a0murdered opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. Petitioners have also advocated for the street in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy to be named after murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 After a day of playing defense on impeachment,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his allies spent Wednesday night attacking the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0and their views\u00a0\u2013 including support for impeachment. \"Democrats Have Been Obsessed With Impeachment from Day 1,\" said a statement from the \"rapid response\" arm of Trump's re-election campaign, one of a string of\u00a0emails, tweets, and texts sent by the president's supporters during the Democratic debate. At the end,\u00a0Trump campaign spokeswoman\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany said the \"2020 Democrats were short on solutions and heavy on their unhealthy obsession with taking down President Trump via an illegitimate coup.\" In the middle of the proceedings, Trump himself tweeted out his version of the highlights from a critical impeachment hearing earlier in the day, testimony that he said exonerates him. \"That means it's all over,\" Trump said in the video. Prior to the debate, Trump tweeted out a news story about poll numbers in Wisconsin. During the debate in Atlanta, the Democratic candidates for Trump's job cited evidence that he abused power by asking another country, Ukraine, to investigate one of their colleagues, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"We have to establish the principle no one is above the law,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0\"We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.\" Biden said he has learned one thing from the impeachment hearings: \"Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear.\" Throughout the day and the evening,\u00a0Trump and his supporters pushed back on testimony from a blockbuster impeachment witness. Ambassador Gordon Sondland said Trump appeared to support the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the country. Trump said he did not know Sondland \"very well,\" and cited the ambassador's\u00a0testimony that the president told him he did not want a \"quid quo pro\" from Ukraine over investigating the Bidens. Trump's campaign stayed busy throughout the debate, emailing and tweeting responses to the various candidates while arguing that the Democratic Party as a whole is backing impeachment for political reasons. \"The Democrat candidates continue to push the Ukraine scam in a desperate attempt to impeach President Donald Trump before he wins reelection in 2020,\" said a statement from the Republican National Committee. As for other issues,\u00a0Trump and the Republicans said Democrats want to raise taxes, increase government regulations, open the nation's borders, promote unlimited abortion rights, and impose climate change controls that will cost U.S. jobs. At one point, the campaign unit known as the\u00a0\"Trump War Room\" tweeted out video of Democratic candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticizing some party colleagues. \"Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,\" Gabbard said. The Trump-ites paid particular\u00a0attention to long-standing Democratic frontrunners Biden, Sen.Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. They also played up attacks on a new contender: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose poll numbers have shot up in the early contest states of Iowa and New Hampshire. \"Crime is rising, schools are suffering, and police are demoralized in the city Pete Buttigieg has managed for nearly eight years,\" said an email from the Trump campaign. For their part, the 2020 Democrats largely defined themselves in opposition to Trump. \"We can deal with Trump's\u00a0corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country,\" said Sanders, the Vermont senator. Trump's presidency, particularly the impeachment drive, hovered over the debate. \"It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate,\" tweeted David Axelrod, a political adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Kind of low energy.\" Hours before the event, during a tour of an\u00a0Apple manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said he\u00a0believes impeachment is an effort to defeat him in the 2020 election by Democrats who are angry over his 2016 victory. \"They are trying to take it away because they can't do it fairly,\" Trump said.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Stansberry Research WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Over her 86\u00bd years on earth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been lauded as a\u00a0women's rights pioneer, a Supreme Court justice and a cultural icon. These days, she receives hearty\u00a0ovations just for staying on the job. To satisfy some of her liberal allies, she must do that for at least another 16 months. Fresh off three weeks of radiation treatment\u00a0for her fourth bout with cancer, the woman fondly known as the \"Notorious RBG\" is traveling the nation giving speeches, staging conversations and accepting awards and honorary degrees. By demonstrating\u00a0her vitality before adoring audiences, she hopes\u00a0to tamp down\u00a0concerns about her longevity. \"As cancer survivors know, that dread disease is a challenge, and it helps to know that people are rooting for you. Now, it's not universal,\" she quipped\u00a0Thursday night at the famed\u00a092nd Street Y in New York City. She vowed to stay on the job \"as long as I'm healthy and mentally agile.\" The concerns are based on the political\u00a0calendar. Ginsburg must remain on the nation's highest court at least until January 2021\u00a0to avoid giving President Donald Trump and a\u00a0Republican-controlled Senate the opportunity\u00a0to replace her. Such a doomsday scenario for liberals would give conservatives a 6-3 hold on the high court\u00a0\u2013 solidifying their majority,\u00a0perhaps\u00a0for decades to come. Currently divided 5-4 and with John Roberts in the chief justice's chair, the Supreme Court has been less reliable than conservatives would like. With the help of Roberts or another conservative justice during the last term, the court's four liberals held sway in as many 5-4 decisions as their counterparts. More:Conservatives' takeover of Supreme Court stalled by John Roberts-Brett Kavanaugh bromance But add a sixth conservative justice and \"it becomes so much more difficult,\" says Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley School of Law, who caught flak in 2014 for suggesting Ginsburg should step down while President Barack Obama and a Senate Democratic majority could have replaced her. If Democrats eventually prevail in confirming a liberal-leaning justice to their liking, Chemerinsky says, \"This could be the swing vote down the road.\" Ginsburg's predicament is similar to that faced by the court's last civil rights pioneer, Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, in 1991. With his health declining as he approached his 83rd birthday, he\u00a0retired during the third year of Republican George H.W. Bush's presidency.\u00a0The New York Times headline blared:\u00a0\"Marshall retires from high court; blow to liberals.\" Marshall\u00a0ultimately lived four days into the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton. But by then\u00a0his seat was held by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, still the court's most conservative member. Ginsburg has shown no similar signs of\u00a0\"coming apart,\" as Marshall described himself in a calamitous 1991 press conference, though she did miss the first oral arguments of her career in January while recovering from lung cancer surgery. The lone statement issued by the court after her latest bout with pancreatic cancer was upbeat. \"The tumor was treated definitively and there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body,\" it said. \"Justice Ginsburg will continue to have periodic blood tests and scans. No further treatment is needed at this time.\" The\u00a0statement was issued Aug. 23, and three days later Ginsburg was at the University of Buffalo to receive an honorary degree and speak at several events. That was a warm-up act for her visit to North Little Rock, Ark., the following week, where she received a standing ovation from a crowd estimated at 16,000, including many in \"Notorious RBG\" T-shirts. \"We all hope that she will stay on that court forever,\" former President Bill Clinton, who nominated her to the Supreme Court in 1993, said by way of introduction. For her part, Ginsburg was more circumspect.\u00a0\"I\u2019m pleased to say\u00a0I am feeling very good tonight,\" she said. Then it was on to the University of Chicago and Georgetown University Law Center the following week, and two appearances in her native New York City this\u00a0week, where she took on directly the critique that\u00a0she should have stepped down years ago. \u201cWhen that suggestion is made, I ask the question: Who do you think that the president could nominate that could get through the Republican Senate that you would prefer to have?\" she said Wednesday night at the Yale Club, according to CNN. But Democrats controlled the Senate in 2014, when Chemerinsky started the drumbeat with a Los Angeles Times column. \"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should retire from the Supreme Court after the completion of the current term in June,\" he wrote that March. \"Only by resigning this summer can she ensure that a Democratic president will be able to choose a successor who shares her views and values.\" Ginsburg resumes her national hopscotching tour Monday at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C., where she\u00a0will appear before about 1,600 fans. The following week, she will be at Amherst College in western Massachusetts. The\u00a0court's 2019 term begins Oct. 7, briefly keeping Ginsburg in the nation's capital, where her latest accolade was a two-story mural\u00a0unveiled Monday on a downtown D.C. building. When two weeks of oral arguments are completed, she is scheduled to travel cross country to\u00a0California. \"It's\u00a0a travel schedule\u00a0that would exhaust the rest of us,\" says Marge Baker, executive vice president of the liberal group People for the American Way.\u00a0\u201cThis is a statement that\u2019s she\u2019s making, and she seems to draw energy from it.\u201d For years, Ginsburg has traveled and spoken publicly more than most of her colleagues. Before Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's death in 2016, the two ideological opposites occasionally made\u00a0joint appearances that called attention to their longtime friendship. Ginsburg has made more than 170 public appearances in the last five years; only Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor has done more. \"When I am active, I am much better than when I am just lying about feeling sorry for myself,\"\u00a0Ginsburg said at the Yale Club event. \"The necessity to get up and go is stimulating.\" Before her latest cancer was diagnosed, Ginsburg said\u00a0she\u00a0hoped to stay on the bench\u00a0for at least five more years, noting that Associate Justice John Paul Stevens served until age 90. Stevens died in July at 99. The latest health scare is particularly worrisome to many because it's her second bout with pancreatic cancer. The average five-year survival rate is 9%, lowest of all cancers. But\u00a0Ginsburg has lived 10 years since her first bout. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's website lists the names of public figures whose lives have been impacted by pancreatic cancer. The list includes 16 survivors such as opera singer Marilyn Horne, whose vow to live following her 2005 diagnosis Ginsburg admires. But it also names more than 250 public figures who succumbed to the disease. Julie Fleshman, the network's president and CEO, says\u00a0the three weeks of radiation Ginsburg received at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer\u00a0Center in New York is the go-to treatment for small, localized tumors. A more serious form of the cancer would have called for surgery or further treatment, she says. The justice's first major health scare was colon cancer in 1999. Chemotherapy and radiation left her depleted, so\u00a0her late husband Martin convinced her to get a personal trainer. She has worked out twice a week ever since. More:Squat, lift, kick, curl: Justice Ginsburg's workout is tough and it left me exhausted Her first bout with pancreatic cancer in 2009 was caught early following a routine blood test, and she made a full recovery. She\u00a0received a stent in a heart procedure in 2014. Then last November, she fell in her Supreme Court chambers and fractured three ribs, forcing her to miss new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's investiture ceremony. By then, her supporters were increasingly rattled. Twitter was flooded with good wishes as well as medical offers. \"Ruth Bader Ginsberg (sic)\u00a0can have my ribs,\" actress and #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano tweeted. \"And my kidneys and a lung. And anything else she needs.\" The fall proved fortuitous, because it enabled doctors to find and remove two malignant nodules from her left lung. To recover from surgery, Ginsburg was forced to miss two weeks of oral argument in January \u2013 the first time she's been\u00a0absent from the bench. Her latest\u00a0cancer has not slowed Ginsburg down, much to her supporters' chagrin. Fleshman says that may not be a bad thing. \u201cWe see so many patients who want to go back to their job, who want to resume their life the way that it was,\" she says. \"For her, it probably is the very best thing to stay at it.\" How long she can stay at it is anyone's guess. That's why both liberal and conservative interest groups are preparing for the inevitable. \"We\u2019ve been literally planning for her retirement for many years now,\" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which raised and spent millions of dollars to promote the Gorsuch and Kavanaugh nominations. \"Our commitment is to always be ready, because you can\u2019t predict when a\u00a0vacancy will come.\" For liberals, \"this will be the fight of our lifetime,\" Baker says\u00a0\u2013 both because of what Senate Republicans did in 2016 to block Obama's choice and because it could impact\u00a0the Supreme Court for generations to come. \u201cThere could not be a higher-stakes battle for our country were that vacancy to occur,\" Baker says. \"There will be an enormous mobilization\u00a0of people making their voices heard.\u201d If Ginsburg's health holds out, next year's presidential and Senate elections will decide whether Democrats or Republicans choose her successor. If the White House and Senate end\u00a0up in opposite hands,\u00a0a stalemate could result in an extended vacancy. That's a risk liberals would gladly take. \"It seems like for more than a decade, Supreme Court observers have been trying to guess Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s last day as a justice. It's a hopeless effort,\" says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. \"She has an unmatched drive to do superlative work and an iron will to do whatever it takes to keep her body in shape to do it.\"",

      "content": "NEW YORK\u00a0\u2014 Walter J. Minton, a publishing scion and risk taker with a self-described \"nasty streak,\" has died at age 96. As head of G.P. Putnam's Sons, Minton released works by Norman Mailer and Terry Southern, among others, and signed up Vladimir Nabokov's scandalous \"Lolita.\" Minton\u2019s wife, Marion, tells The Associated Press that he died Tuesday at their home in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. She cited no specific cause of death. The son of longtime Putnam president Melville Minton, Walter Minton was in his early 30s when he inherited the position in 1955 after his father's death and remained until he was forced out in 1978 by corporate parent MCA. (Putnam is now part of Penguin Random House.)\u00a0Minton presided over an era of profit and growth, including the acquisition of the Berkley Publishing Corp., although his abrupt style didn't gain him affection. Mailer paid an off-hand compliment when he called Minton \"the only publisher I ever met who would make a good general.\" In the mid-1950s, Mailer's novel \"Barbary Shore\" had flopped and raised questions about whether the author of \"The Naked and the Dead\" would have a lasting career. After Rinehart & Co. dropped Mailer's Hollywood saga \"The Deer Park\" because of concerns about obscenity, Minton offered Mailer a $10,000 advance, a record for Putnam at the time. \"The Deer Park\" became a best-seller, and Mailer would release several other works through Putnam, including his landmark \"Advertisements for Myself,\" the essay collection \"The Presidential Papers\" and the novel \"Why are We in Vietnam?\" More:Robert Evans, iconic 'The Godfather,' 'Chinatown' producer, dies at 89 Other Putnam successes under Minton's leadership included Merle Miller's oral biography of Harry Truman, \"Plain Speaking,\" and a pair of risqu\u00e9 novels: \"Candy,\" by Southern and Mason Hoffenberg; and a reissue of the 18th century erotic shocker \"Fanny Hill,\" the object of court battles in Massachusetts and New York in the mid-1960s. One of Minton's most lucrative decisions came soon after he started as Putnam's president. \"Lolita,\" Nabokov's classic about a literature professor's obsession with a 12-year-old girl, inspired shock and admiration when released in Europe in 1955. But it remained without a publisher in the U.S. Several companies turned down the novel, and an editor at Viking worried that anyone releasing \"Lolita\" could be jailed. More:The 5 best book-to-movie adaptations to binge-watch this weekend As noted in Sarah Weinman\u2019s \u201cThe Real Lolita,\u201d published in 2018, Minton offered differing accounts on when and where he first heard of the novel. \"Dear Mr. Nabokov,\" Minton wrote to the author in 1957, \"being a rather backward example of that rather backward species, the American publisher, it was only recently I began to hear about a book called 'Lolita.' I am wondering if the book is available for publication.\" Nabokov's European publisher, Maurice Giradios, was convinced that Minton never got around to reading \"Lolita.\" But, in 1958, Putnam released the novel, which sold millions of copies despite being panned as \"repulsive\" by The New York Times and shunned by other newspaper reviewers. \"There was no prosecution, except by the critics,\" Stacy Schiff, author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Nabokov's wife, Vera, later wrote. Minton was married two times \u2014 first to Pauline Ehst, and most recently to Marion Whitehorn in 1970 \u2014 and had three children with each wife. After leaving Putnam, he received a law degree from Columbia University and joked that he hoped to use his education to \"audit the returns to paperback houses.\" Born in New York in 1923, Walter Joseph Minton was a descendant of the 18th century financier Robert Morris, who signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. He attended Williams College before serving in the Army Medical Corps in World War II. He completed his undergraduate education at Harvard College and in 1947, joined Putnam, serving as a salesman and director of promotion and publicity before succeeding his father as president. A Minton gimmick helped Putnam land one of the best-selling books of recent times. In the early 1960s, he started a contest for the best unreleased novel in English, with the winner receiving a six-figure advance. Putnam received piles of entries and signed up numerous young authors to traditional contracts, hoping one of those books might take the prize. Contest judges never found a winner, but among the books Putnam acquired was a crime story by an indebted, middle-age novelist who needed money for his family after his previous works flopped. The manuscript, published in 1969, was Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather.\u201d",

      "content": "Sponsored by Definition ALBANY \u2013 Elise Stefanik made history in 2014 when she was elected at age 30 as the youngest woman to be elected to Congress. Now she is gaining new notoriety in Washington and the nation. The upstate New York Republican has become a staunch defender\u00a0of President Donald Trump during the House's impeachment hearings, drawing his praise but also scorn from Democrats. \"A new Republican Star is born. Great going\u00a0@EliseStefanik!,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning. The ascension is perhaps an unlikely role for Stefanik, who has sought to be a moderate Republican in a district that stretches from Saratoga County to the Canadian border and whose voters\u00a0backed Barack Obama twice before flipping to Trump in 2016. As the only Republican woman on the House Intelligence Committee, Stefanik, 35, has coveted the role of playing adversary to the Democratic-led impeachment proceedings. \"Thanks,\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0& EVERYONE for the outpouring of support!\" she wrote Sunday night on Twitter. \"I will continue to work hard to pursue the truth on behalf of my constituents. The Radical Left will continue their sick attacks on me but I\u2019m proud to represent the people of NY21!\" How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Democrats, however, have ripped Stefanik, leading to a frenzied stretch of campaign donations\u00a0for her and her opponent Tedra Cobb ahead of next November's\u00a0elections. \"This is about GOOD v EVIL, not politics NOT Democrat or Republican,\" state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, D-Pelham, Westchester County wrote Friday on Twitter. \"Truly a disappointment for the state of NY to have one our representatives on the wrong side of history.\" Stefanik has landed national attention for her piercing questions of witnesses during the hearings and her biting critiques of Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the Intelligence Committee. On Friday, she noted President Barack Obama's administration\u00a0also raised concerns with the service of Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, being on the board of the Ukraine-based energy company Burisma Holdings Stefanik insisted\u00a0the younger Biden\u2019s work for Burisma is\u00a0a vital point to raise. \u201cAnd yet our Democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry foul when we dare ask that same question that the Obama State Department was so concerned about,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cBut we will continue asking it.\u201d Later, Rep. Devin Nunes tried to\u00a0allocate time to Stefanik, but was disallowed by Schiff under House rules. \u201cWhat is the interruption this time?\u201d Stefanik responded.\u00a0\u201cThis is the fifth time you have interrupted duly elected members of Congress.\u201d Stefanik did criticize Trump, chiding him for tweets that targeted\u00a0U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch while she was testifying. \"I disagree with the tweet,\" Stefanik told reporters. \"I think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant, like many of our public servants in the foreign service.\" More:Impeachment hearing: Marie Yovanovitch calls Trump's attacks on her 'intimidating' As a minority party member, Stefanik is one of only 13 Republican women in the House. At one point, Republicans charged that Schiff was treating a woman lawmaker unfairly. \u201cYou are gagging the young lady from New York,\u201d Nunes said when Schiff prohibited her from speaking. The Harvard graduate's aggressiveness has drawn plaudits from her colleagues. \u201cShe\u2019s effective. She\u2019s a great spokesperson,\u201d\u00a0Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, another member of the Intelligence committee, told the Associated Press.\u00a0\u201cAnd these issues are in her wheelhouse.\u201d Republicans benefitted from having a woman lead the questioning of Yovanovitch, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., told the AP. Demings called Yovanovitch \u201ca female witness who is a career foreign service officer with an impeccable record.\" So if Republicans \"want to badger her, it\u2019s a better look when a woman has taken the lead on that.\u201d The major stage for Stefanik has led to national media profiles about her rise. The New York Post noted that she and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal New York lawmaker, are both among the youngest members of Congress, but have few similarities. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York City and grew up in Yorktown, Westchester, bested\u00a0Stefanik's record as the youngest woman elected to Congress in 2018\u00a0when she was elected at age 29. \u201cI am proudly the opposite of AOC,\u201d Stefanik told The Post. More:Trump draws backlash from GOP, Democrats over Yovanovitch tweet More:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compares Yorktown residency scrutiny to 'birther' attacks Stefanik's rise has led Republicans in New York to rally around her, while Democrats have used her prominence among conservatives to pounce on her re-election bid. Cobb announced Sunday she has surpassed $1 million raised, and Cobb received the backing of Star Wars icon Mark Hamill and celebrity Chrissy Teigen. \"I am happy to announce we raised $1 million dollars! It is impossible to express the feeling of gratitude I have tonight,\" Cobb wrote Sunday night on Twitter. \"Together we started something big but it\u2019s not over yet.\" Support for Cobb led to a fight on Twitter when George Conway, a Trump foe and husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Stefanik \"lying trash. Please give to her opponent.\" Nikki Haley, former U.S Ambassador to the United Nations, responded Monday, \"This is absolutely uncalled for and disgusting. What is wrong with people? George Conway is the last person that can call someone \u201ctrash\u201d. #Pathetic\" And Stefanik replied, \"The one thing I\u2019ve NEVER been called in my life is TRASH. You need serious help. My opponent Taxin\u2019 Tedra can have your sick mysogynist support.\" The barbs led Republicans to urge support of Stefanik, who is the first Republican to represent the district in 22 years, and to raise money for her re-election in 2020. She is just one of five Republicans among New York's 27 congressional members. The district stretches from the Capital region across the\u00a0Adirondacks and has 47,000 more Republicans than\u00a0Democrats. Local party leaders on Monday vowed in a joint letter their united support for\u00a0Stefanik \"as she leads our country through this historic moment.\" More:Judge delivers blow to Donald Trump's quest to shield his tax returns More:Donald Trump ordered to pay $2M to charity to settle Trump Foundation lawsuit",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00a0\u2014 Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is telling allies that he will join the 2020 presidential race, according to two people familiar with his plans. An official announcement is expected before Friday, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary. His move injects a new layer of uncertainty into the contest less than three months before the first votes. Patrick, a popular two-term Democratic governor with a moderate bearing and close ties to former President Barack Obama, is starting late but with a compelling life story and political resume. The two people with knowledge of Patrick\u2019s plans spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. In addition to Patrick, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City has taken steps toward launching a last-minute presidential campaign, filing candidate papers in Alabama and Arkansas. The moves reflect uncertainty about the direction of the Democratic contest. Joe Biden entered the race as the front-runner and maintains significant support from black voters, whose backing is critical in a Democratic primary. But he\u2019s facing spirited challenges from Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, progressives whose calls for fundamental economic change have alarmed moderates and wealthy donors. Patrick\u2019s candidacy faces a significant hurdle to raise enormous amounts of money quickly and to build an organization in the traditional early voting states that most of his rivals have focused on for the past year. And he\u2019ll have to pivot to the expensive and logistically daunting Super Tuesday contests, when voters in more than a dozen states and territories head to the polls. Bloomberg\u2019s team has said they will skip the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina to focus on the Super Tuesday roster. If he gains traction, Patrick could pull together multiple Democratic constituencies. A former managing director for Bain Capital, he has close ties to Wall Street donors. And as the first black governor of Massachusetts, Patrick could present himself as a historic boundary breaker who could dent Biden\u2019s support among African Americans. Patrick has remained active in politics since his term as governor ended in 2015. During the 2018 midterm elections, he traveled across the country in support of Democratic candidates, a move that helped raise his national profile. He also campaigned for Doug Jones during Alabama's contentious 2017 special election for U.S. Senate. By December, however, Patrick cooled to the idea of a White House campaign. \u201cAfter a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I've decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me,\u201d Patrick posted on his Facebook page at the time. Patrick said he and his wife worried that the \u201ccruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.\u201d For years, Patrick had been on an upward swing in Democratic politics, having served two terms as governor. He was only the country\u2019s second black elected governor since Reconstruction. In 2012, he gave a rousing speech in defense of Obama at the National Democratic Convention, urging fellow party members to \u201cgrow a backbone\u201d and fight for their ideals. Obama at the time was being challenged by former Republican Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney \u2014 Patrick\u2019s predecessor in the governor\u2019s office. Patrick grew up in Chicago, Obama\u2019s adopted home. Both men have campaigned for each other. Patrick has also tried to position himself over the years as slightly more moderate than some on the Democratic left. After Donald Trump\u2019s election, Patrick\u2019s initial criticism of the Republican president was somewhat less pointed than others in his party. He said he was \u201cold-fashioned in the sense that I think nobody should cheer for failure. We need our presidents to succeed,\u201d but said he was particularly concerned about what he described as Trump\u2019s belittling of those with opposing points of view. Patrick also urged the party at the time to look in the mirror, saying \u201cthe outcome of the 2016 election was less about Donald Trump winning than Democrats and our nominee letting him do so.\u201d Last year, some of Patrick's supporters and close advisers launched the Reason to Believe political action committee, \u201ca grassroots organization dedicated to advancing a positive, progressive vision for our nation in 2018 and 2020.\u201d The PAC held meetups across the country, including in early presidential primary states, and was seen as a possible vehicle to help support a Patrick candidacy. It was formally dissolved earlier this year. Early in his career, Patrick served as assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and later worked as an executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola. Since leaving the governor's office, Patrick has worked as a managing director for Bain Capital \u2014 a company co-founded by Romney. Patrick's record as governor is mixed. His successes include helping oversee the 2006 health care law signed by Romney that would go on to serve as a blueprint for Obama's 2010 health law. Also considered a success was a 2008 initiative pushed by Patrick that committed Massachusetts to spending $1 billion over 10 years to jump-start the state's life sciences sector. There were also rough patches, including turmoil at the state Department of Children and Families following the deaths of three children. Patrick was also forced to publicly apologize for a disastrous effort to transition to the federal health care law during which the state's website performed so poorly it created a backlog of more than 50,000 paper applications.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 During\u00a0a day of bombshell testimony by\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union\u00a0at the center of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, President\u00a0Donald Trump strenuously denied knowing the man well. Sondland, nominated to his post in 2018,\u00a0was among only a few dozen donors who gave $1 million or more to Trump's presidential inaugural committee in 2017. The rarefied group included owners of sports teams, the aerospace giant Boeing and some of the nation's leading investors. Many were invited\u00a0to\u00a0receptions, dinners and other events with the president during the inaugural festivities in 2017. It's not clear whether Sondland attended any of them. Trump raised $107 million for his inauguration, roughly double the amount President Barack Obama pulled in eight years earlier. At least\u00a047 people or organizations gave $1 million or more to Trump, according to the nonpartisan\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics. Some of those top-tier donors wound up serving in Trump's administration along with Sondland, an Oregon man who founded\u00a0a hotel chain called\u00a0Provenance Hotels and initially supported Jeb\u00a0Bush in 2016. Others had business pending before federal agencies. More:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group\u00a0Public Citizen. \"These kind of donations\u00a0were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" Donors at the $1 million level were granted access to a series of\u00a0dinners and receptions with Trump and other officials, the Center for Public Integrity reported in 2016. Ambassador donors The list of top donors to Trump's inaugural committee includes\u00a0Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who contributed at least $1 million along with her husband. Another $1 million donor:\u00a0Robert \"Woody\" Johnson, the owner of\u00a0the New York Jets. He's\u00a0now the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. San Diego businessman Doug Manchester, who gave at least $1 million to the committee, was nominated in early 2017 to serve as ambassador to the Bahamas. The White House withdrew his nomination\u00a0last week. Star witness:Jocular and unflappable, Sondland gave bombshell impeachment testimony Appointing donors as ambassadors is not new, but Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Other top inaugural donors included Sheldon Adelson, the\u00a0Las Vegas casino mogul, and Robert Mercer, a Republican mega-donor with longtime ties to Trump.\u00a0Robert Parsons, the billionaire philanthropist and GoDaddy founder, made the list. So did\u00a0Howard Lutnick, the chairman and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Testifying on Capitol Hill in the House impeachment inquiry on Wednesday,\u00a0Sondland confirmed the existence of a \"quid pro quo\" in which military aid to Ukraine was tied to Trump's desire for an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Sondland said\u00a0Trump's personal attorney,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, pressed the demand\u00a0that Ukraine announce an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump emerged from the White House early in the hearing and, reading from written notes, told reporters on the South Lawn that he didn't really know Sondland. \"This is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy, though,\" Trump said. \"He was with other candidates. He actually supported other candidates \u2013 not me.\u00a0Came in late.\" Pressed on that claim by lawmakers later in the day, Sondland described his relationship with Trump as \"professional\" and \"cordial\" and said he spoke with the president by phone about 20 times. Earlier, when asked if he used a vulgarity when telling Trump about Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky's desire to cooperate with the United States, Sondland said that sounded right. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words,\" he said. Fred Wertheimer\u00a0of the Democracy 21 watchdog group\u00a0said it's hard to know if Trump and Sondland spent time together at events.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard to believe that Trump, who was using Sondland as his intermediary for the extortion, hardly knew him,\u201d Wertheimer said. Presidential inaugural committees are private fundraising vehicles that pay for the concerts, balls and festivities that surround the swearing-in. Inaugural committees operate under less stringent rules than political campaigns. There are no limitations on how much a donor can give, for instance, and companies can\u00a0give directly. Trump's inaugural committee was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in New York earlier this year. Watchdog groups pay\u00a0particular attention to companies that give.Major corporate donors to Trump's inaugural committee included companies like AT&T, the communications giant that at the time was pushing to acquire Time Warner\u00a0\u2013 a merger the president opposed. Dow Chemical Co. donated $1 million; the company's former CEO,\u00a0Andrew Liveris, was tapped for\u00a0an advisory council on manufacturing. The Trump administration later ruled against banning a controversial Dow-made pesticide. \"In exchange for the contributions,\" Public Citizen wrote in a 2017 report, \"donors are to receive unprecedented access to the senior members of the incoming Trump administration and other U.S. government leaders.\"",

      "content": "Prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck was arrested on suspicion of running a \"drug den\"\u00a0after a third man allegedly suffered a\u00a0methamphetamine overdose last week at his Los Angeles home, authorities say. Buck, 65, faces felony charges of battery causing serious injury,\u00a0administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said in a statement Tuesday. Prosecutors described Buck as \"a violent, dangerous sexual predator\" who \"preys on men made vulnerable by addiction and homelessness\"\u00a0in court documents. The 37-year-old man injected with\u00a0methamphetamine survived the Sept. 11 incident, but\u00a0at least two other men have been found dead in Buck's home from overdoses in recent years, prosecutors say \"With this new evidence, I authorized the filing of criminal charges against Ed Buck,\"\u00a0Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. In the span of 18 months,\u00a0Gemmel Moore, 26, and Timothy Dean, 55, both black men, died in Buck's West Hollywood apartment, and prosecutors said he \"nearly killed a third victim last week.\" \"From his home, in a position of power, Buck manipulates his victims into participating in his sexual fetishes,\" prosecutors wrote in court papers, alleging that his \"aggressive and malevolent behavior\u00a0led to\" the two men's deaths. \"The defendant's predatory acts and conscious disregard for human life must be stopped,\" prosecutors wrote. Buck's bail was set at $4 million, and he is due in court Wednesday. He faces a\u00a0possible maximum sentence of five years and eight months in state prison if convicted, prosecutors say. Buck's attorney,\u00a0Seymour Amster, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. In January, Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives said they were investigating Buck\u00a0after\u00a0Dean was found dead. As with\u00a0Moore's death in July 2017, Buck was present at the home when detectives responded, authorities said at the time, and drug paraphernalia and sex toys were found in his apartment, court documents allege. An autopsy report said Moore died of a methamphetamine overdose, and he was found naked on a mattress in the living room. In both cases,\u00a0Amster described the men as friends of Buck and denied any wrongdoing by his client. Buck was not charged in either death at the time. \"Still not deterred despite two deaths in his apartment, Buck persisted in his malevolent\u00a0 behavior,\" prosecutors say in the court records filed Tuesday. The man who overdosed this month was identified only as\u00a0\"Joe Doe\" in court records, and authorities say Buck first administered a large dose of\u00a0methamphetamine\u00a0on Sept. 4. The man left the apartment to seek medical help because he thought he was overdosing, prosecutors say. The man returned days later, and\u00a0after Buck allegedly injected him with two large doses of methamphetamine, he \"thwarted\" the man's attempts to seek help, prosecutors say. The man was able to flee and called 911 for medical help, records show. Prosecutors also say sheriff's deputies found \"hundreds of photographs, taken in Defendant Buck's residence, of men in compromising positions.\" \"It is only a matter of time before another one of these vulnerable\u00a0young men dies of an overdose,\" prosecutors say. Buck is a former\u00a0West Hollywood City Council candidate and is well known in LGBTQ political circles in Los Angeles. According to Open Secrets, which tracks political contributions, he has donated thousands of dollars over the years to Democratic candidates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as the Democratic Party and affiliated political action committees.

      "content": "If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and Michelle Obama's new production company. The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would \"harness the power of storytelling\" and touch on\u00a0\"issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more.\" \"American Factory,\" the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising\u00a0sign for what's to come. The documentary, which won a directing award earlier this year at Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of how a Chinese billionaire opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese people to work there. The film\u00a0looks at how their\u00a0cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not\u00a0to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs. Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the\u00a0documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening.\u00a0The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There's also plenty of\u00a0How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers\u00a0Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar. At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects. What else does Higher Ground\u00a0have in the works? Here's what's planned so far: A new drama series about the fashion world:\u00a0\"Bloom\" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri (\"Thelma & Louise\"). A biopic about Frederick Douglass:\u00a0Higher Ground\u00a0plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \"Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom\" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery. An anthology series about unnoticed\u00a0deaths:\u00a0\"Overlooked\" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men. A traveling kids' food show:\u00a0\"Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents\" is a half-hour preschool series\u00a0from creators Jeremy Konner (\u201cDrunk History\u201d) and Erika Thormahlen\u00a0that will tell the story of\u00a0food. A Michael Lewis nonfiction series:\u00a0The show will be based on \"The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy,\" the book by the best-selling \"Moneyball\" and \"The Big Short\" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation. A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers:\u00a0\"Crip Camp\" will tell the story of\u00a0how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge has temporarily halted the first federal execution in 16 years as a lawsuit on how the government intends to carry it out continues. U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said in a Wednesday evening ruling that the public is not served by \u201cshort-circuiting\u201d legitimate judicial process. \u201cIt is greatly served by attempting to ensure that the most serious punishment is imposed lawfully,\u201d she wrote. Attorney General William Barr\u00a0unexpectedly announced in July\u00a0that the government would begin resuming executions starting Dec. 9, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment as the issue receded from the public domain. Most Democrats oppose the death penalty. By contrast, President Donald Trump has spoken often about capital punishment and his belief that executions serve as an effective deterrent and an appropriate punishment for some crimes, including mass shootings and the killings of police officers. Still, executions on the federal level have long been rare. The government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988, the most recent of which occurred in 2003, when\u00a0Louis Jones\u00a0was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier. In 2014, following a\u00a0botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs. Barr said in July that the Obama-era review had been completed, clearing the way for executions to resume. He approved a new procedure for lethal injections that replaces the three drugs previously used in federal execution with one drug, pentobarbital. This is similar to the procedure used in several states, including Georgia, Missouri and Texas. Impeachment latest:Fiona Hill calls allegation Ukraine meddled in 2016 a 'fictional narrative' Some of the chosen convicts challenged the new procedures in court, arguing that the government was circumventing proper methods in order to wrongly execute inmates quickly. Danny Lee, of Yukon, Oklahoma,\u00a0was the first person scheduled to be executed.\u00a0He was convicted in the 1996 deaths of an Arkansas family as part of a plot to set up a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cThis decision prevents the government from evading accountability and making an end-run around the courts by attempting to execute prisoners under a protocol that has never been authorized by Congress,\u201d said the convicts\u2019 attorney, Shawn Nolan. \u201cThe court has made clear that no execution should go forward while there are still so many unanswered questions about the government\u2019s newly announced execution method.\u201d The death penalty remains legal in 30 states, but only a handful regularly conduct executions. Texas has executed 108 prisoners since 2010, far more than any other state. Though there hasn\u2019t been a federal execution since 2003, the Justice Department has continued to approve death penalty prosecutions and federal courts have sentenced defendants to death.

      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 First-place finishers for the past four Iowa caucus cycles \u2014\u00a0with the\u00a0exception of\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all surged ahead sometime in the final months before the caucus, from November through\u00a0January. That\u2019s good news for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who jumped 16 percentage points\u00a0from September to lead the pack in November\u2019s Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, conducted by Selzer & Co. He is the first choice of 25% of\u00a0likely Democratic caucusgoers. That jump is an even more pronounced surge than Barack Obama\u2019s in 2007, when the Illinois senator jumped 6\u00a0percentage points\u00a0from October to November, then another 4 points\u00a0in December. Buttigieg has been drawing\u00a0parallels between himself and Obama. But a November surge also doesn't assure a victory. In\u00a0caucus cycles since 2004, only three candidates who were first in the November Iowa Poll\u00a0\u2014 Clinton, Obama and Mike Huckabee\u00a0\u2014 won their party's\u00a0caucus a few months later. The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was\u00a0in third in November\u00a02004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011. \u25ba More: Iowa Caucuses Results History: 1972 to 2016 Former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said a last-minute surge is the\u00a0key to a successful caucus campaign. It\u2019s a maxim that\u2019s become known in Iowa politics as the \u201cNagle Rule.\u201d \u201cThere are three rules to success in Iowa,\u201d Nagle said in a phone interview. \u201cRule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is:\u00a0You get hot at the end.\u201d With two and a half months left before the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses, Democratic presidential hopefuls\u00a0have plenty of time to \u201cget hot\u201d and move up, even within a shifting\u00a0field. Buttigieg\u2019s trajectory in Iowa so far resembles the path U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz took to win the 2016 Republican caucus. Cruz was polling comfortably near the rest\u00a0of the pack in the summer of 2015, though he\u00a0lagged significantly behind\u00a0early favorites Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, and businessman Donald Trump. In the October 2015 Iowa Poll, 10%\u00a0of likely Republican caucusgoers\u00a0chose Cruz as their first choice, ranking him third. Buttigieg started this autumn in a similar place. In the September Iowa Poll, he was fourth, with 9% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming him as their first choice for president. Buttigieg was 13 percentage points behind the poll leader, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at 22%. Both Cruz and Buttigieg leaped over previously leading candidates in a single poll.\u00a0 Cruz\u2019s support skyrocketed to 31% in the 2015 December poll, overtaking both Trump and Carson. From the early December poll through the February caucus, Cruz struggled somewhat to keep his momentum. In early January, his support had fallen to 25% and then to 23% in a poll right before the caucuses, when\u00a0he trailed Trump by 5 points. Cruz won the Republican 2016 Iowa caucuses, with 27.6% of the vote. But sometimes a mid-fall surge\u00a0dissipates as quickly as it\u00a0began. In the 2012\u00a0race, former House Speaker\u00a0Newt Gingrich shot to 25% and first place in a November poll of likely Republican caucusgoers, after polling at fifth place with 7% in October. The lead disappeared by the end of December, when he fell back to 12%. Gingrich was a distant fourth on caucus night. \"The caucuses are replete with stories (of candidates) who've gotten out early and then came under closer public scrutiny and couldn't maintain their position as the front-runner,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cI think, if I were, for example, looking at Mayor Buttigieg right now, I'd be a little worried. It's November. You don't want to be hot in November because then you become a target,\" he said. \"What you want to do is become hot in the last two weeks of January.\" As Gingrich enjoyed his moment on top of the polls, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania lay in wait. In that same November 2011 poll, Santorum garnered just 6% of the vote, tied with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in sixth place. Santorum\u00a0languished in early Iowa Polls. In June, October and November 2011, he gained only 2\u00a0percentage points, moving up from 4%. He was not\u00a0leading among any demographic groups.\u00a0He did not poll highest on any questions of positive or negative attributes. \u201cConservatives have kept talking up the chances of the former Pennsylvania senator, who has spent more time in the state than any other candidate,\u201d former Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich\u00a0wrote one month before the 2012 caucus. \u201cHe\u2019s just not a factor, and there\u2019s not much time left.\u201d Santorum and his family had moved temporarily to Iowa over the summer of 2011. While he didn\u2019t seem to be gaining traction among voters, he had campaigned in all 99 counties in Iowa. In the final Iowa Poll, published just days before the caucus, Santorum found his stride: He shot up to third place, with 15% of the respondents ranking him as their first choice. \u201cThe former Pennsylvania senator embodies the old political saw: Work like hell and get lucky at the end,\u201d Obradovich wrote in a column published two days before the 2012 caucuses. \u201cHe\u2019s logged over 100 days in Iowa, more than any other candidate, toiling in virtual obscurity.\u201d Santorum and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who had been a strong contender since the summer before, were nearly tied in returns on caucus night. Initially the caucuses were\u00a0called in favor of Romney by 8 votes, but two weeks and a recount later, the Iowa Republican Party announced that Santorum had a 34-vote advantage. \"If you're in this race, until the second week of January, it's not late,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cThe second week of January is when you want to start looking to who's moving up and who's falling back.\" One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle:\u00a0The race is more stratified at this point than most.\u00a0After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of Warren\u00a0at 16% and\u00a0U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of\u00a0Minnesota is at\u00a06%. Everyone else is at 3% or under. Still, candidates in previous cycles have picked up well over a dozen percentage points from\u00a0November polls to caucus night. Santorum\u2019s jump from the November poll to the actual result\u00a0was nearly 19 percentage points. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, climbed 22 percentage points\u00a0from\u00a0a November poll to\u00a0his caucus results. If a struggling 2020 candidate picks up just 10 percentage points\u00a0over the next two months, that candidate\u00a0could be in the running for one of the three\u00a0coveted tickets out of Iowa. Since\u00a0the modern Iowa presidential caucuses began in 1972, with just one exception,\u00a0no candidate in either party has gone on to win the\u00a0nomination without placing first, second or third when\u00a0Iowa has held\u00a0contested caucuses. The exception: In\u00a02008, eventual nominee John McCain\u00a0was barely edged into fourth place in Iowa. \"There's still time,\u201d Nagle said of low-polling candidates. \u201cIs it likely? No. But it's not unprecedented.\" Katie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at kakin@registermedia.com or at 515-284-8041. Follow her on Twitter at @katie_akin.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden, the former vice president and current front-runner in the sprawling Democratic primary field of more than 20 candidates, asked a curious question of New Hampshire voters at Dartmouth College on Friday: What if Barack Obama had been assassinated? During a discussion\u00a0of mental health and school shootings at a health care town hall in Hanover, the former VP turned\u00a0to his collegiate days, and spoke of the assassinations of his \u201cpolitical heroes,\u201d Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, who were assassinated within weeks of each other. Biden said, \"My senior semester, they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, if Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would've happened in America?\" The comments were reported on by multiple media outlets, including the New York Times, NBC, the Associated Press and the Washington Post. The startling question came\u00a0a day after Biden posted on Twitter posted about when Obama asked him to become his running mate in 2008. The 76-year-old served as Obama\u2019s vice president for the entirety of Obama's time in the Oval Office from 2009-2017. Only three days earlier at an event in Iowa, Biden initially misspoke, saying that Kennedy and King had been shot \u201cin the late 1970\u2019s\u201d instead of 1968. Of Biden's New Hampshire comments Friday, the New York Times reports he was trying to make a point about becoming politically aware and motivated in the turbulent times of the\u00a01960s and 1970s, discussing\u00a0the deadly Kent State shootings during a Vietnam War protest in 1970.\u00a0He successfully ran for Senate in 1972 when he was\u00a029 years old. Biden also said Friday he was accused of being gay decades ago because he supported women's rights, referring to the Equal Rights Amendment. \"An entire generation was energized. We finally finished the Voting Rights Act. We finally got the Civil Rights Act back on the road. We finally were in a position where we started to begin the women\u2019s movement, and began to treat women \u2014 I remember because I was such a big supporter of the E.R.A. in 1972, quote \u2014 to show you how things have changed, thank God \u2014 'Well, you know why Biden is for the E.R.A., he\u2019s probably gay.' Not a joke,\" Biden recalled. During a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., on Monday, Dr. Jill Biden, Biden's wife and the former second lady, said that Democrats should vote in the upcoming primaries and caucuses for who will ultimately beat President Donald Trump even if they don't agree fully with all of Joe Biden's policy stances. \u201cI know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who\u2019s going to win this race.\u201d Biden is seeking the Democratic nomination for president for a third time after two failed runs in 1988 and 2008.",

      "content": "BIARRITZ, France\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump doubled down on his support Monday for Russia returning to the G-7, telling reporters gathered for the group\u2019s annual meeting that he isn\u2019t concerned about the political blow back of such a move on him. Russia had been a member of the group \u2013 which at the time was known as the G-8 \u2013 but was ousted in 2014 because of its annexation of\u00a0Crimea. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of bringing Russia back into the fold to ease negotiations on global issues. Trump dismissed the notion that he would face criticism for advocating for Russia. Much of his presidency has been overshadowed by questions about Russian involvement in the 2016 election on his behalf. An investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found that neither Trump nor his campaign conspired with those efforts. \"I don't do things for political reasons,\" told reporters Monday. \"Is it good? Probably not. Maybe it is,\" Trump said of allowing Russia to join the group of the most industrialized countries. \"A lot of people say having Russia \u2013 which is a power\u00a0\u2013\u00a0having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room.\" Minutes later, Trump re-upped a claim that Russia was dropped from the group because Russian President Vladimir Putin had \"outsmarted\" then President Barack Obama. \"He was outsmarted,\" Trump said. The decision to expel Russia was backed not only by the U.S. but also\u00a0by the group's other six member countries.\u00a0The G-7 includes the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy. Trump has repeatedly heaped praise on\u00a0Putin, telling a Russian television reporter as recently as June that Putin is\u00a0\"a great guy,\"\u00a0despite the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered\u00a0in the 2016 presidential election.",

Calipari\u00a0\u2014 coach Cal\u00a0\u2014 posted photos with Obama on the green Friday and wrote that the two played a round of golf and spent four hours talking in the golf cart at Farm Neck Golf Club at Martha's Vineyard, a favorite spot for presidents to tee off and a longtime favorite of Obama's. \"\u202aIt was the greatest round of golf that you could ever play and all I can say is that he is a really serious golfer!\" the Kentucky coach wrote in an Instagram and Facebook post. \"He played well!\u202c\" The post got around 25,000 reactions on Facebook with fans both\u00a0elated and upset. Later, Calipari posted that\u00a0Robert Wolf, who worked in the\u00a0Obama administration on the Economic Recover Advisory Board, had set up the golf match. Wolf tweeted a photo of himself and Calipari Saturday and wrote, \"And can you believe this guy\u00a0@UKCoachCalipari\u00a0also sank the putt on 18 & happily took my money - ouch.\" The former president and the Kentucky coach go way back. In 2010, Obama called Calipari to talk about the Kentucky Wildcats' Hoops for Haiti fundraiser in which the team raised more than $1 million during a basketball tournament to donate to relief efforts after a 7 magnitude earthquake ravaged the\u00a0country. In 2012, after Kentucky won the national title, Calipari visited the White House and Obama. Calipari has also met with Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, President George Bush, President Bill Clinton, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Kelly Craft. He told the Courier Journal in 2017 that when he has a chance to meet with presidents, he will. \"If I\u2019ve got a chance to do it, I\u2019m going to sit down with the president, whoever that president might be.\"",

      "content": "WINTERSET, Iowa\u00a0\u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday night identified several prominent Democratic women who he said could serve as his vice president if he is elected president. At a town hall, Biden was asked who his vice presidential pick would be if he wins the Democratic nomination. \"You. Are you available?\" Biden joked to the questioner, before giving a serious answer. Biden didn't name anyone specifically but said there are a number of people who are qualified. \"I could start naming people but the press will think that\u2019s who I picked,\" he said, before obliquely referring to several potential candidates. His list included \"the former assistant attorney general who got fired,\" referring to Sally Yates; \"the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia,\" referring to Stacey Abrams; and \"the two senators from the state of New Hampshire,\" referring to U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Yates garnered national attention in 2017 when President Donald Trump fired her from the U.S. Justice Department for refusing to defend his administration's travel ban. She was acting U.S. attorney general at the time. Abrams, a former state lawmaker in Georgia, came close to winning that state's gubernatorial election last year and said in Iowa this month that she would be \"happy\" to run as a vice presidential nominee. Biden also expounded on his own relationship with President Barack Obama, for whom he served as vice president. He said the most important thing is to pick a running mate who aligns with you philosophically and who you can trust with big assignments. He said he would express his agreements with Obama privately, but then was dedicated to carrying out the president's agenda. \"We were philosophically in agreement and we strategically agreed on everything. We disagreed on tactics sometimes. And a vice president cannot be in a position even in a cabinet meeting where he or she is taking on the president,\" Biden said. \"We\u2019ve had arguments, we\u2019ve shouted at each other in private, but we always completely trusted each other,\" he said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "\"Between Two Ferns: The Movie\" on Netflix (streaming now) presents a star-studded probable finale to the viral internet reign\u00a0of the absurdist\u00a0Funny or Die show of the same name, sending host Zach Galifianakis and his parody public-access series on a road trip. But before the series, which began\u00a0more than 10 years\u00a0and 20 episodes ago, takes its signature plants out of the spotlight, we asked for some dirt. Galifianakis and the film's director, Scott Aukerman, took USA TODAY behind the ferns for some insider tidbits about the series, from jokes that barely survived, stars that almost were on the show\u00a0and a back story on the show's problematic theme song. Though Galifianakis plays a contemptuous interviewer unafraid to ask celebrities inappropriate questions in \u201cFerns,\u201d in real life the comedian refused\u00a0certain jokes. That is, until Aukerman convinced him otherwise. For example, Galifianakis balked at asking Natalie Portman: \u201cYou shaved your head in\u00a0'V for Vendetta,' did you also shave your V for vagina?\u201d \u201cI thought that that question was too much. I actually asked them to edit that out,\u201d\u00a0 Galifianakis says. After that interview, the \u201cFerns\u201d co-creators developed a \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d dynamic, as Aukerman puts it.\u00a0\u201cHe reads the paper and goes, \u2018Oh, I'm not going to\u00a0say this,\u2019 and then looks to me,\" and Aukerman will adamantly insist\u00a0Galifianakis ask the question. This happened in 2014 when he interviewed Barack Obama and asked, \u201cHow does it feel to be the last black president?\u201d \u201cFerns\u201d rules require guests to come on the show without knowing the questions beforehand. When the camera rolls, Galifianakis improvises and riffs on prewritten questions. Celebrities just have to react. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp wanted the nominee to do a \u201cFerns\u201d interview, but \u201cthey didn't want to do it the way that we normally do,\u201d with Clinton going into the interview blind. Aukerman refused\u00a0and Clinton\u00a0ultimately agreed to his terms. But her team was scared about how it would turn out. \u201cPeople get really worried about (the interview), and then you put it out and they love it,\" Auckerman said. \u201cWe asked Bernie Sanders to do one and he said no,\u201d says Galifianakis, who appreciated that the politician wouldn't\u00a0try\u00a0to win over voters with an off-brand comedy video. \u201cI respected him so much for that.\u201d Less than appreciated: When representatives ask to get their celebrity client on the show, and\u00a0the star ultimately passes after planning has begun. According to Aukerman, that\u00a0happened with Oprah Winfrey and Elton John. The Obama jokes\u00a0had to be cleared by his speechwriters beforehand. \u201cThat's the one that we sort of struck a compromise,\"\u00a0says Aukerman, who understood that an exception could be made for the commander in chief. And when it came to the 2011 Jennifer Aniston interview, Galifianakis ultimately felt bad about the plan\u00a0to surprise her\u00a0with a Brad Pitt lookalike on camera.\u00a0He asked her beforehand\u00a0if she was OK with it, and, as Aukerman recalls,\u00a0\u201cShe, I think rightly, was like, \u2018It's not that I don't think it's funny. It's just anything that continues this conversation about me and Brad Pitt just prolongs me having to talk about it.\u2019 And so we said no.\u201d Fun fact: The \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d theme is actually taken from a certain famous 1976 Robert De Niro movie. Aukerman didn't\u00a0know that 11 years ago, when the music became part of the first \u201cFerns\u201d episode. \u201cI thought it was elevator music,\u201d says Aukerman. \u201cIt was a low-budget show and we couldn't write music for it.\" He had no idea the music was from\u00a0\u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and would ultimately cost so much money to use. \u201cIt's literally been a problem for 10 years.\" 'Between Two Ferms':Zack Galifianakis reveals celeb questions that (maybe) went too far Netflix in October:Meryl Streep, Eddie Murphy, Paul Rudd, Cardi B, more 'Kominsky'",

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Former President Barack Obama announced a new initiative to combat partisan redistricting\u00a0on Monday, an issue that he says he has made a priority from his \"2008 campaign until now.\" \"The movement for fair maps will determine the course of progress on every issue we care about for the next decade. And we can\u2019t wait to begin organizing when the redistricting process starts in 2021. We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2013 right now,\u201d a webpage for the new project, says quoting Obama According to thewebsite, the project -- named \"Redistricting U\" --\u00a0 \"is a free, in-person organizing training initiative\" that sends \"trainers to cities to train volunteers, giving them the tools to impact the redistricting process in their state and empower them to be leaders in the movement for fair maps.\u201d The All On The Line website describes the broader organization as a national campaign launched to \u201crestore fairness to our democracy and ensure every American has an equal say in our government.\u201d The All On The Line\u00a0campaign began after\u00a0Organizing for Action, an Obama\u00a0political organization,\u00a0merged\u00a0with\u00a0his former Attorney General Eric Holder's group, the National Redistricting Action Fund.\u00a0The merged organization, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC), launched the All On The Line campaign. In July 2018, Obama appeared in a view released by the NDRC\u00a0 and said that \"rethinking the way we draw our congressional districts\" is vital to American democracy. \"It's why your district might be shaped like a corkscrew. But it\u2019s also how a party gains more seats, while winning fewer votes. Which isn\u2019t fair,\u201d Obama said. Despite growing concern about\u00a0partisan redistricting among Democrats and progressives -- including at the highest echelons of the Democratic Party with the likes of Obama and Holder -- the Supreme Court ruled in late June that partisan election maps are constitutional despite their one-sided nature. \u201cHow do you decide where the line is between acceptable partisanship and too much partisanship?\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said from the bench in announcing the 5-4 opinion he'd penned, joined by the court's other conservatives.\u201cAt some point, it should occur to you that what you\u2019ve been asked to do is not judging at all.\" More:Supreme Court says federal courts cannot strike down partisan gerrymandering The chief justice said the challengers from\u00a0North Carolina, seeking to overturn a map drawn by the state's Republicans, and Maryland, seeking to overturn a map drawn by the state's Democrats, asked for \u201can unprecedented expansion of judicial power\u201d that would\u00a0have broad consequences. \u201cThere will be\u00a0no end to the litigation,\u201d he said. But Justice Elena Kagan decried the ruling on behalf of the court's four liberals. \"Of all the times to abandon the court's duty to declare the law, this was not the one,\" she said. \"The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government.\" Contributing: Richard Wolf",

      "content": "\u201cBorder Grill\u201d was among featured restaurants at the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience with Martha Stewart in Los Angeles.\u00a0 Chefs & founders Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger built their empire after taking \u2018back roads\u2019 to emerge as culinary stars.\u00a0 Despite formal culinary training and considerable experience under their belt, they ventured to Mexico to explore family kitchens and street vendors, barbecues and taco stands. The nuances of Mexican cuisine became very real, and Border Grill was born.\u00a0Today, with Border Grill locations throughout Los Angeles, including food trucks and catering, and another in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino since 1999, the critically acclaimed chefs, entrepreneurs, authors and TV personalities (\u201cToo Hot Tamales\u201d on The Food Network, among others) remain avid enthusiasts of the culinary adventure. Q&A with Chef Mary Sue Milliken What\u2019s your morning routine? At least 3-4 days a week, I\u2019m up and out hiking or cycling or working out in time to see the sun come up.\u00a0 The other mornings, I drink loads of hot Darjeeling tea and read until I have to leave for work.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like to eat sweet morning foods and I really try not to eat much until midday as I find if I eat breakfast then I\u2019m ravenous by lunchtime. What inspired you to be a chef? I met an amazing, inspiring chef/friend of my older sister\u2019s when I was 16.\u00a0 He cooked us dinner in record time, chopping and entertaining us all the while.\u00a0 I decided then and there to go into the profession. Who\u2019s your mentor? There have been so many generous and brilliant people who have guided me throughout my career.\u00a0 The extraordinary restaurateur, Joven Treboyevic, owner of Le Perroquet in Chicago, who took me under his wing and taught me about the restaurant business and about life. \u00a0Rich Melman and his awesome team, including David Swinghamer and Gerard Centioli - all business gurus who helped me learn how to be an entrepreneur and survive through the hard times. The many women chefs and restaurant owners who have led me by example and always been there to answer questions: Joyce Goldstein, Barbara Tropp, Alice Waters, Lydia Bastianich, Dominique Nahmias, and many more. Describe your formal training When I realized I wanted to be a professional chef at 16, I accelerated my high school education and enrolled in Washburne\u2019s two-year chef program. \u00a0To enhance my learning, I worked nights- first at the Conrad Hilton Hotel banquet kitchen and then at Maxim\u2019s of Paris.\u00a0 After graduating, I worked for over a year at Le Perroquet which led to an apprenticeship at Michelin 2-star Restaurant D\u2019Olympe in Paris. \u00a0After France I felt ready to be my own boss and along with my business partner (of nearly 4 decades now), opened City Caf\u00e9 in 1981. What do you get out of participating in the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience? I love these events because I interact with so many people, learn from my colleagues and celebrate the ever-exploding food scene in this country. What do you cook at home? I love to cook for my family at home where I challenge myself to create mainly plant based dishes that are irresistible to even hardcore carnivores. What\u2019s your favorite dish? There are so many dishes I love \u2013 but my Greek Aunt taught me to make egg lemon soup and when I\u2019m feeling tired or sick I always make it from homemade chicken stock I keep in the freezer.\u00a0 It never fails to magically perk me up. What\u2019s your favorite holiday dish? Oysters on the half shell always feel festive.\u00a0 We eat them on Christmas, New Years, birthdays, anniversaries, memorials, etc. What was best day in the kitchen? It was exhilarating to work for the US State Department on culinary diplomacy in Sicily. Met migrant women who wanted to learn about professional cooking and workshop entrepreneurial skills and competed in the international couscous festival (beating the Moroccan team and taking home the best presentation honor!). Who is the coolest person you\u2019ve cooked for? I\u2019m not a huge fan of organized religion, but I thought it was pretty cool to cook for the Polish Pope John Paul II in 1979 on his visit to Chicago.\u00a0 Not having been exposed to the current, Argentinian Pope Francis, I think he would be the coolest if only I could wrangle an invitation to cook for him. What\u2019s your favorite food trend happening right now? Conscious cooking with the health of the diner and the health of the planet top of mind. Tell us something you would like your followers to know about you. I wasn\u2019t sporty, nor did I exercise until I was 42 when I tried playing soccer to lose some weight from my second baby.\u00a0 Now, I either work out with a trainer, cycle, hike or play soccer at least 5 out of 7 days per week! How do you end your day? On a good day, I end it with my husband\u2019s homemade ice cream. What\u2019s the weirdest food combination that you enjoy? Raw vegetables with Japanese barley miso paste \u2013 cucumber, celery, carrots, sweet peppers are so yummy!\u00a0I eat this for daytime snacks several times per week. What\u2019s the next new concept percolating in your world? (What new plans do you have in store?) We\u2019re opening Socalo in Santa Monica \u2013 an all day, neighborhood Mexican restaurant with an eye toward conscious cooking and eating. What achievement are you most proud of (awards or recognition or other)? Apart from a 30+ year marriage, 2 wonderful sons and a 40+ year business partnership with Susan Feniger \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of the recent honor from the Julia Child foundation for \u201cmaking a profound and significant difference in the way America cooks, eats and drinks\u201d. What advice would you give to cooks at home? Repetition is the gift of cooking professionally.\u00a0 You get the chance to cook the same over and over and over, noticing the nuanced differences and learning.\u00a0 Don\u2019t constantly create new dishes without perfecting the ones you already know. Trust your instincts and your taste buds in your kitchen.\u00a0 Use common sense and allot enough time to really honor the ingredients, avoiding waste and seeking out the very best flavors. Q&A with Chef Susan Feniger What\u2019s your morning routine? Wow, in the morning typically Liz (my wife) and I go with our two dogs down to the ocean and walk them (well they walk us) Of course before that we make a delicious coffee, often a vegetable/fruit drink, and then we go. If I am too lazy, then our one pup, Fanny, chases the ball over and over\u2026while I\u2019m having coffee listening to music and throwing it! What inspired you to be a chef? My mom was an incredible cook. All growing up, she would be in the kitchen late at night, sometimes I would hang out with her, licking the fudge paddles, making Velveeta cheese dreams with her and I\u2019m not sure but that might have been my first inspiration. In general, she had really good taste buds, so her salads, her brisket, her lady finger desserts all were really great. I had my first job as a sophomore at Smith\u2019s Cafeteria. I loved the spirit of that kitchen. I think because I was also such a jock, the camaraderie in a kitchen reminded me of sports teams. I found myself falling in love with the kitchen then. But, never thought it would be my career until I was in college when I worked in kitchens there. That\u2019s where I realized it was for me. More than anything I ever did, time flew by for me when I was cooking. I just felt at home in the kitchen. Everything about it. Who\u2019s your mentor? In the beginning, I think the army cook, who ran the kitchen while I was in college, really had a huge part in helping me see that this was a potential career. He encouraged me to go to the CIA. After the CIA, and working in French restaurants, I worked for some great people. The chef I worked for in upstate NY, was\u00a0someone who was very tough, but ran a great small kitchen. Then working in Chicago, the chef there, although fantastic, taught me how I didn\u2019t want to be. Then Wolfgang Puck, at Ma Maison in Los Angeles, helped me to see how a kitchen could be serious and fun. My friend Alan Wagoner, who was a cook, living in India, really influenced me in a huge way, my shift in direction from French food to something way more eclectic, way more spice and flavor. He probably was my biggest influence. Describe your formal training I went to the CIA in Poughkeepsie NY. Worked in a great fish market after school for about 8 months, then a cool little French restaurant in Brewster NY. All that together created my two years of formal training. What do you get out of participating in the USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience? Making new connections with the community around us. The USA TODAY Wine & Food Experience was a blast! What do you cook at home? Home, when I am there and cooking, is pretty simple. \u00a0Often late at night we just have pistachios, apples, almonds, raisins, mashed avocados, carrots, fennel, etc. Sometimes a big bowl of freshly popped popcorn, butter and salt! But, often I do wok stir fry, soba, or make a vegetable curry and rice, or grill marinated ribeyes, steamed artichokes, saut\u00e9ed green beans, winter squash, marinated tomatoes from the garden with fresh basil, St. Andre cheese, dates\u2026. pretty simple. What\u2019s your favorite dish? Artichokes with mayo/lime/cracked black pepper; mashed avocado with lime, extra virgin olive oil, and potato chips! What\u2019s your favorite holiday dish? Fried chicken at times, or brisket that is chilled then seared chunks, with homemade applesauce and horseradish crema. What was best day in the kitchen I\u2019ve had so many very fun, cool days\u2026don\u2019t even know how to answer that. Who is the coolest person you\u2019ve cooked for? President Obama What\u2019s your favorite food trend happening right now? Loroco in pupusas\u2026and our burnt ends brisket we serve in burritos at BBQ Mexicana at Mandalay Bay Tell us something you would like your followers to know about you. I love our dogs. They bring me endless joy\u2026day in and day out. They help me to value every moment. They are my idols! How do you end your day? Often at the end of my day, Liz and I meet out for dinner, have a drink and talk\u2026love that. sometimes we meet friends, sometimes not. Sometimes I come home, we both have finished work, we take a hot tub, then watch something great on TV (she\u2019s an incredible writer/director) so something like Fauda or Bodyguard! What\u2019s the weirdest food combination that you enjoy? Hmm\u2026don\u2019t really think I have weird food combos? When I get a leg cramp, dill pickle juice and honey! Or late at night pistachios and apples. What\u2019s the next new concept percolating in your world? (What new plans do you have in store?) Newest concept is breakfast, lunch and dinner at Socalo\u2026opening in May in Santa Monica\u2026also BBQ MEXICANA, a concept we opened at Mandalay Bay that is smoked brisket, pork, chicken and tofu burritos with spicy slaw, house made chips and BBQ sauce. What achievement are you most proud of (awards or recognition or other)? I think right now, I\u2019m most proud of the formation of the Culinary Kitchen at the new Anita May Rosenstein campus for the LA LGBT Center. A kitchen that we will be training young homeless youth, to learn a skill, develop a culinary family, learn about team work and prepare them to go out in the world with a skill. That is being built now and will open on our new campus in LA in the Spring. This is something I\u2019m very, very proud of. Of course, the Julia Child Foundation Award is absolutely unbelievable, as she was an icon, that I adored and admired as a chef, a teacher, a mentor and a friend. What advice would you give to aspiring chefs? You must find yourself loving everything about this career\u2026the craziness of prep, service and structure, the comarderie\u00a0with your peers, with your employees, with the guests, all that must be there, along with the creativity demands and pleasures, the ability to handle multiple situations at one time, the discipline, the lifestyle. Without these passions, year after year, you will fall out of love with this life. For me, the whole package has been who I am for so long. The restaurant business is a lifestyle. What advice would you give to cooks at home? Remember you can\u2019t do wrong. Experiment, learn, be playful, enjoy. When throwing a party, plan\u00a0a menu, write your grocery list, do your prep list for day ahead, day of, night of, along with timing and what dishes things will go in and then have a cocktail! From the time your guests walk in\u2026music, vibe, drinks, apps, through dessert and after dinner drinks.\u00a0 It\u2019s the experience along with the delicious food, but most importantly enjoy your guests as well as the process.

      "content": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 World-famous performers, civil rights leaders and people who know her good works are gathering for the funeral of international opera star Jessye Norman in her Georgia hometown. Norman will be laid to rest Saturday afternoon at the William B. Bell Auditorium in Augusta, Georgia, with a private burial to follow. Actor Laurence Fishburne is expected to speak and musicians Wycliffe Gordon and J\u2019Nai Bridges from the Metropolitan Opera will perform. Norman\u2019s longtime friend and civil rights activist Vernon Jordan will talk about the singer\u2019s life along with elders at her family\u2019s church in Augusta. Norman\u2019s funeral will be streamed live. Norman died Sept. 30 at age 74. She was a trailblazing performer, and one of the rare black singers to attain worldwide stardom in the opera world. Hundreds of people paid their respects to Norman, whose soaring soprano filled the sanctuary of Mt. Calvary Baptist Church during visitation Thursday and Friday. The mourners included Deanne Brown, daughter of singer James Brown \u2014 The Godfather of Soul and one of Augusta\u2019s most famous musicians. There were sorority sisters, a church music director who met Norman after a concert, a woman who went to the then-segregated Lucy C. Laney High School with Norman in Augusta and remembered how her choir solos even then commanded the tiny stage. And there was a woman who went to music school at the University of Michigan with Norman and said she had never heard anything like her before or since. Obit:Jessye Norman, Grammy-winning international opera star, has died at 74 More:Robert Forster, Oscar-nominated actor for 'Jackie Brown,' dies at 78 \u201cHer voice would captivate you. You could feel exactly the emotion in her soul. And it wasn\u2019t just opera. She could sing anything better than just about anyone else. She found her place in opera, but she was just as good singing with a pop choir in England or a gospel group here,\u201d said Stephen Mitchell, a music director at a church in Athens, Georgia, who met Norman once \u2014 after a concert in Birmingham, Alabama, and was instantly mesmerized. Augusta named a street for her Friday just outside the Jessye Norman School of the Arts, which she founded in 2003 to provide free fine arts education to disadvantaged children. Norman won four Grammy Awards and had 15 nominations. She won her first in 1985 for best classical vocal soloist performance for \u201cRavel: Songs Of Maurice Ravel.\u201d She earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. She received the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honor as well. Her performance of\u00a0\u201cAmazing Grace\u201d\u00a0at the 1995 Kennedy Center Honors tribute to Sidney Poitier brought the actor to tears. Norman was awarded the National Medal of Arts from former President Barack Obama and is both a member of the British Royal Academy of Music and Georgia Music Hall of Fame. She sang the works of Wagner, but also Duke Ellington. \u201cPigeonholing is only interesting to pigeons,\u201d Norman said in a 2002 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.",

      "content": "Ethiopia Prime Minister\u00a0Abiy Ahmed has won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for \"for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea.\" The Nobel committee said during its announcement Friday that the coveted prize was also meant to recognize all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions. Ahmed\u00a0clinched a peace deal with Eritrea President Isaias Afwerki last year that ended 20 years of the \"no peace, no war\" stalemate between the two countries. According to\u00a0TIME, at least 70,000 people\u00a0were killed since the border disputes began in 1998, five years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia. Nobel literature prizes:Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk, Austrian author Peter Handke win Although thousands of political prisoners have been freed since Ahmed\u00a0took office in April 2018, Ethiopia's internal issues\u00a0still divide the country. The Nobel committee acknowledged this in its\u00a0announcement saying that even if much work remains in the unstable country, Ahmed had initiated important reforms that give \"many citizens hope for a better life and a brighter future.\" The African country faces elections next year. The Norwegian Nobel Institute said they still haven't been able to get a hold of the Ethiopian leader. The committee received nominations for 223 individuals and 78 organizations for the Swedish 9-million kronor, or $918,000, award. The list is kept secret for 50 years. Last year\u2019s winners were Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi Kurdish activist Nadia Murad for \u201ctheir efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.\u201d Although the list can\u2019t be confirmed for another five decades, teenage climate activist\u00a0Greta Thunberg and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern were also predicted frontrunners for the prize. President Donald Trump was also nominated for the 2019 prize by U.S. Republican congressional members for his efforts at securing denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Past winners who came under criticism include former U.S. President Barack Obama, who won in 2009 after less than a year in office for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" Critics interpreted his win as a political repudiation of George W. Bush's presidency. Contributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Associated Press. Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

Amy Astley is no stranger to the twinkling lights and vibrant pulse of the magazine world. As the editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest,\u00a0Astley has translated her years of editorial experience at the likes of Vogue, Teen Vogue\u00a0and House & Garden to take the helm of the 100-year-old Architectural Digest\u00a0brand, molding it into a massive digital and print platform for the ages. Astley\u2019s position at Architectural Digest\u00a0\u2013 which just released \u201cArchitectural Digest at 100: A Century of Style,\u201d a book that takes readers into the homes of everyone from Barack Obama to David Bowie \u2013 cements her spot as a magazine industry icon. USA TODAY caught up with the magazine editor-in-chief and author to talk about everything from lapsang souchong tea and Frank Ocean to taking the reins as founding editor of Teen Vogue and the importance of leaning into technology. Question: How did you get your start in the industry? Amy Astley: When I was 11, I fell in love with New York City and I fell in love with ballet, and those two things really propelled what happened to me next. I graduated from Michigan State University and came straight to New York. I wasn\u2019t a strong enough dancer to be professional after college, and my second passion is reading, writing\u00a0and storytelling. Magazines really deeply appealed to me; I liked the idea of putting visuals and words together and telling a story with that. That\u2019s how I started. I started at House & Garden Magazine, worked there for five years, and worked my way up from being the editor-in-chief\u2019s assistant to being everybody else\u2019s assistant. I learned a lot, and the women there were amazing \u2013 there were lots of mentors there\u00a0\u2013 like Wendy Goodman was a huge mentor to me \u2013 and then Mr. (S.I)\u00a0Newhouse closed it. A mutual friend recommended me to Anna Wintour, and I went to Vogue. I ended up loving it and staying just shy of a decade, and at the end of the decade she asked me to work on Teen Vogue, this idea she had of a spinoff of Vogue for young people. I founded Teen Vogue and ran it for 13 years. Teen Vogue was editor-in-chief bootcamp: I learned how to run a team, how to hire people and manage them, make a digital product\u00a0and how to be a mentor to other people and let them shine. It really prepared me for the next step, which was Architectural Digest.\u00a0I hate to use a clich\u00e9 like dream job, but I think all the currents of my life were pointing me towards AD. I\u2019m fortunate that that\u2019s what happened. I got to come full-circle back to where I started, back to shelter, after a long career in fashion, beauty\u00a0and the teen world. These decades of working were honing my eye and helping me develop really deep networks and trust among people in the art world, the fashion world, the social world\u00a0and the entertainment world. Now, I\u2019m able to call on all the networks of people and bring it all back to AD. The decades of doing that work brought me to this place, and I relish it. It\u2019s the perfect job, which is such a gift. 100 years:Architectural Digest celebrates Q: What does a typical workday look like for you? Astley: There\u2019s a lot of variety which is great, yet there\u2019s a rhythm to it. I\u2019m an early riser, and I\u2019m up at 6 a.m. I\u2019m a newshound, so I devour The New York Times, read to the New York Post\u00a0and read a ton online. The morning for me is calm with my tea: I really relish my mornings, and I try to have an hour alone before my kid is up for school. I just take in as much news as I can; there\u2019s just so much to take in, and I\u2019m curious about it and drawing on all of it for ideas. Everything happening in the world is relevant for AD because it\u2019s all about people and how they live and how they\u2019ll live into the future. Child\u2019s up at 7:00 a.m. and at school by 8:00 a.m., and sometimes I walk my dog or go to the gym. I have a lot of breakfasts in the morning with people from the industry or sometimes I\u2019ll go scout an apartment or house in the morning. I\u2019m often at work at 9, and I don\u2019t like to go out for lunch, so I stay in the office all day. I have an open-door policy, and anybody who wants to see me I try to see them that same day. It\u2019s staff meetings, corporate meetings \u2013 there\u2019s plenty to talk about as far as budgets and corporate business \u2013 and my favorite meetings are looking at art, seeing the issues\u00a0and looking at the houses. That\u2019s the most inspiring and fun part of the job. My day is sort of 9 to 6, and in the evening I go out for work pretty much every night. New York is so social, and I have friends in so many fields here and they\u2019re all doing events all the time. It\u2019s pretty endless, and I love it. I don\u2019t really sit at home much or watch TV much, (then)\u00a0I do more email in the evening, and it\u2019s intense. I try to exercise every day, somewhere in there. I try to work in about five workouts a week. There is no delineation between my work and my personal life; they actually flow into each other, which is why I\u2019m able to thrive in my job. I don\u2019t find it too grueling; I just enjoy it. It\u2019s all one piece. Q: What\u2019s your favorite part about your job? Astley: I love seeing the visuals. The most satisfying thing is the houses and seeing them through, from hearing about (them)\u00a0to scouting to the shoot to the pictures realized and having them come in. I felt this way at Teen Vogue, too: that is the most exciting thing, is seeing the art that we are going to use to make the product. I\u2019m really proud of AD; we put a lot of labor and love and effort and sweat and tears into what we select and how we photograph it and the flow of the spreads, and I feel that we make a collector\u2019s item out of each issue. That\u2019s gratifying. I also love the staff and the team. I really enjoy talking to them and seeing what they do. It\u2019s a pleasure. Q: To what do you credit your success? Astley: Ballet, a Midwestern mom, perseverance, working hard\u00a0and no sense of entitlement. I don\u2019t think I deserve anything. I think you work for it, and you earn it, and the only thing I think we all deserve is respect. Q: How do you balance work, life\u00a0and such a busy schedule? Astley: I tend to work all the time, but I know my limits and I know the things that make me feel taken care of. Exercise is a key thing, and I definitely take care of my body and my health that way. I\u2019ll go every day if I can squeeze it in.\u00a0 That gives me a lot of balance and clarity. My kids are older now, so they\u2019re not as intense to raise as when they were little, but they were always my first priority and continue to be. You don\u2019t do it all; it\u2019s a balance. Everything\u2019s a give-and-take, and I don\u2019t have perfect balance, but I think my friends and family see the struggle. Also, my husband\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t not give a shoutout to my husband; everything would fall apart without him. Q: What have been some of your career highlights? Astley: Launching Teen Vogue was a huge career highlight for me. It was so exciting being told by Cond\u00e9 Nast and Mr. Newhouse himself that they believed in it and that they wanted me to run it. I had carte blanche, and, I mean, how often can that happen to you in your career? Probably never, in a creative career like mine. I had the resources of Cond\u00e9 Nast and my own creativity to make it into what I wanted, which was to make it very female-centric. It was totally unique to the market, and it was very satisfying. I will say, doing AD has possibly even topped that \u2013 all of that has been meteoric and super satisfying. For me, it\u2019s a culmination of my career. Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Astley: Embrace technology; be completely receptive and open to everything new that comes along; just say yes to everything, every experience and every person; try to take in as much as you can and not close down into your own little small world.\u00a0If someone\u2019s interested in my career, my career is unique and it\u2019s not going to repeat. The magazine industry and the book industry, these things are all changing [but] there\u2019s always going to be storytelling. Always. I think being a good storyteller will always be a great talent, but you\u2019re going to be telling it through different technologies and different platforms. It\u2019s just staying on top of it and being at the forefront of all those developments. If you\u2019re a storyteller, you can always find ways to tell your story. \u2022\u00a0What\u2019s your coffee order? I\u2019ve never had a cup of coffee in my whole life. I drink a lot of tea \u2013 lapsang souchong is my favorite. \u2022\u00a0What is your favorite book? There are some classics I\u2019ve rediscovered with my teenage daughter that I\u2019ve reread that I loved as a kid, and I really love Edith Wharton and Henry James. \u2022\u00a0What is your favorite song at the moment? I love Billie Eilish \u201cBad Guy,\u201d and my daughter\u2019s a Swiftie so I\u2019ve been listening to \u201cLover\u201d and it\u2019s good (I think she\u2019s so talented). My favorite musician is Frank Ocean \u2013 I like everything from Frank Ocean \u2013 and I love Childish Gambino and Chance the Rapper. \u2022\u00a0Who have been your biggest mentors? It really does start with my mother. As a child, I remember listening to her typing as I went to bed. She went back to school\u00a0to get her master's degree and I could hear her typewriter going, and that was hard. She raised three little kids, there were no nannies or housekeepers or any kind of that stuff, and she did it all. Her discipline, her love of education\u00a0and her sense of bettering yourself and pushing yourself are all very clearly part of my personality. I was a serious ballet dancer, and I have so many teachers who mentored me, especially one in Michigan named Diane Newman. Professionally, Anna Wintour, definitely. A long time with that one. Anna\u2019s always been a key supporter in my career. \u2022\u00a0What is the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever done? My kids. It\u2019s such a clich\u00e9, but the older you get the more you realize it\u2019s all about your family. My career? I\u2019m proud of it. But, my kids and my long marriage with my husband? That\u2019s the coolest thing I ever did, was make a family.",

      "content": "I have two friends with opposite views. Both are bright women and have amassed a meaningful amount of wealth.\u00a0One sold all her stocks when Barack Obama won the presidency.\u00a0The other liquidated her portfolio of equities after Donald Trump\u2019s election.\u00a0 Both were wrong. Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500, produced a cumulative, total return of 116.5% from President Obama\u2019s election day in 2008 through President Trump\u2019s election in November 2016.\u00a0Stocks have risen 47.4% since then.\u00a0Investing in one\u2019s politics can be a risky business. Think of the opportunity cost to my two friends. J.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s 2019 Retirement Guide demonstrates the peril to investors of missing the best days in the stock market over a 20-year period. Cars have a problem:They last longer, and the insides get grubby and outmoded Get money for college:\u00a0Apply for FAFSA college aid money starting Oct. 1 From Jan. 4, 1999, through Dec.r 31, 2018, the S&P 500 produced an annualized return of 5.62%.\u00a0If an investor missed just the ten best days over that 20-year period their annualized return would have been 2.01%.\u00a0Talk about opportunity cost! Missing the 20 best days?\u00a0Your return would have dropped to a negative 0.33% annualized.\u00a0Whatever the reason, attempting to time the market is dangerous to your net worth. The willingness to own equities and the determination of how much to own should be based on your risk tolerance, age, income needs and other personal factors.\u00a0But if you are interested in being exposed to stocks it is always wise to tune out the noise and remember what the great Peter Lynch of Magellan fame advised:\u00a0\u201cThe key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.\u201d This year amid all the conflicting economic data and an easing Fed under siege by a presidential tweetstorm, it may all come down to trade. Why is trade important to the average investor?\u00a0Well, it may be as simple as the warning Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx,\u00a0 gave on the company\u2019s recent and disappointing earnings call.\u00a0Smith said the company was reducing capacity because the trade deal \u201chas reduced the movement of goods internationally.\u201d Reduced movement of goods slows growth and growth is mother\u2019s milk to corporate earnings. To be sure, it isn\u2019t just trade troubles with China.\u00a0The administration is about to announce a new, narrow trade deal with Japan after years without a deal.\u00a0NAFTA 2.0 (USMCA) is languishing in Congress, and the president has threatened tariffs on European autos.\u00a0 Trade conflict with multiple trading partners gives corporate CEOs pause.\u00a0We have seen that concern reflected in the lack of capital expense spending this year, which has resulted in a slowdown in industrial activity. The trade conflict has put stress on the economy, though not yet on the consumer.\u00a0Low unemployment, rising wages, lower taxes and lower gas prices at the pump have put more money in the consumer\u2019s pocket. It's best to buy great companies you know and understand, collect and reinvest the dividends and avoid the noise of politics and investment pundits who don\u2019t consider your personal objectives.\u00a0If the trade issues resolve \u2013 all things being equal \u2013 the market may experience another leg up. And\u00a0it would be a shame to miss it.

      "content": "He spent a month sleeping on the floor. The room was freezing cold.\u00a0His back hurt for two years. The bad cough lasted longer. Pedro Chilel Ramirez was 17 when he was picked up by the Border Patrol. He arrived in the wave of migrant children that flooded the border in 2014,\u00a0but his experience may track\u00a0closely with what thousands of migrant children encountered this year, and it illustrates the long-lasting effects that their time in Border Patrol custody may have on their lives. Lawsuits have alleged children held by the Border Patrol are deprived of their rights and treated inhumanely. An inspector general's report concluded that some migrant children would suffer mental trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. For the tens of thousands of children who arrived this year, the long-lasting effects may not have surfaced yet. Chilel said he remembers the air conditioning at the Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, was kept so cold it felt like he was living inside \"a freezer.\" He was given an aluminum blanket, but it was not nearly enough to keep warm. \"We slept on mattresses thrown on the floor. It was really thin,\" Chilel said, holding  two fingers about an inch apart to demonstrate the thickness of the mattresses. The only thing to do all day was watch cartoons and\u00a0telenovelas on a television\u00a0mounted on the wall, Chilel said. In 2014, Chilel left Ixchiguan, a small town in the western highlands of Guatemala, and became one of the nearly 70,000 minors mostly from poverty- and violence-plagued Central America who crossed the southern border illegally into the USA. \"It was horrible, just horrible,\" Chilel said of his time in detention. \"It was so cold. They didn't let us outside. We were only inside all day.\" The sudden influx of unaccompanied minors set off a crisis in the USA. Lacking enough beds in government-contracted migrant shelters, the Obama administration resorted to holding unaccompanied minors\u00a0for extended periods of time in Border Patrol stations, then in large-scale detention facilities the government opened to deal with the emergency.\u00a0One in Nogales, Arizona, held 900 children at a time. After an outcry, the Obama administration closed the child detention facilities once the number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the southern border subsided. Chilel was part of the first of\u00a0two large waves of underage migrants. The United States\u00a0has struggled in both instances to house and care for the minors. When a new mass of unaccompanied minors began arriving at the border in 2018, the Trump administration resumed holding migrant children in Border Patrol stations and large-scale detention facilities but on a far bigger scale, drawing intense criticism in several blistering reports from internal government watchdogs and outside groups. As of the end of August, the Border Patrol had apprehended 72,873 minors who entered the USA\u00a0illegally\u00a0without a parent or legal guardian. That is 60%\u00a0more than the same period the year before. A month before the end of the fiscal year, the number has surpassed the record number in fiscal year 2014. In early August, the Department of Health and Human Services, under fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers, announced that all remaining migrant children had been removed from a child detention center in Homestead, Florida, that had housed more than 3,000 children a day. A federal lawsuit filed by the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law\u00a0said holding migrant children for prolonged periods of time in large-scale detention centers violated a long-standing court agreement known as the Flores Settlement. Under the agreement, the Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied\u00a0migrant children to the Department of Health and Human Services'\u00a0Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours. Migrant children must be held in the least restrictive setting as possible until they can be placed with family members or other sponsors in the USA, the agreement says. Migrant children who arrive seeking asylum typically spend 45-50 days in government custody in foster homes or shelters, said Andrew Lorenzen-Strait, a former DHS official who is children and family services director at the Baltimore-based\u00a0Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. The migrant children are released to family members or other sponsors while they pursue their asylum cases, he said. The\u00a0majority never receive asylum and probably end up \u201cliving their lives unauthorized and in the shadows,\u201d he said. Only a small fraction receive the help of lawyers through nonprofit programs that provide free legal assistance. Few can afford to hire their own lawyers, Lorenzen-Strait said. In July, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged it was considering opening massive holding facilities for arrivals of migrant children in several cities, including Phoenix,\u00a0San Antonio, Houston and the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, toured the facility in\u00a0Homestead, Florida, before it closed. The day she was there, 1,684 migrant children were held. She said she observed cramped quarters of 144 children sleeping in one room\u00a0and small rooms with bunk beds tightly packed together, which a tour guide said children preferred because it was \"like a sleepover.\" \"Children are quite obviously suffering psychologically and physically while inside Homestead,\" O'Mara Vignarajah told members of Congress on July 24 during a\u00a0House subcommittee hearing into the treatment of unaccompanied minors.\u00a0Her\u00a0organization advocates for placing unaccompanied minors in foster homes or small, state-licensed group homes until they can be reunited with family members or other sponsors. An inspector general report released in September found migrant children separated from their parents by\u00a0the Trump administration suffered\u00a0mental trauma, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Chilel's\u00a0journey to the USA\u00a0came after a difficult childhood. Chilel said his parents abandoned him, and he was raised by a\u00a0grandmother in Guatemala. In his hometown,\u00a0he worked on his grandmother's small farm, growing potatoes and corn. After some men threatened to take away her land, he said, his grandmother borrowed money to pay a smuggler about $1,500 to take him by bus to\u00a0the USA. After crossing the border illegally near McAllen, Texas, he turned himself over to Border Patrol agents, who took him to their station, he said. He recalled there were about 16 other unaccompanied minors, mostly teenagers like himself, held in the same room. They were separated from adult migrants and families who also had been apprehended by the Border Patrol, he said. He eventually was\u00a0flown to Phoenix to live with a relative who agreed to sponsor him while he went through the immigration process.\u00a0Chilel, 21, said he received his green card in 2018 with the help of a lawyer who took on his\u00a0case free of charge. He rents a room in\u00a0a house on the west side of Phoenix, where he works two jobs, as a landscaper during the week and cleaning houses on weekends. He's paying for braces for his teeth with some of the money he earns. He plays on a soccer team with other Guatemalan immigrants. \"My life is much better now,\" Chilel said. \"And I'm happy I have papers.\" Reach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8312.

I\u2019m so sorry for her family and close friends.\" The office of\u00a0Barack Obama issued a statement on behalf of the former president and first lady. \"She was a trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men; a constant over forty years of a shifting media landscape and changing world, informing voters about the issues of our time and mentoring young journalists every step of he way,\" the statement read. \"She will be missed \u2013 and we send our condolences to her family.\" President Donald Trump called her a \"real professional\" while speaking with\u00a0reporters aboard Air Force One. \u201cI never met her.

John McCain) going at it and then off-camera laughing, shaking hands, having the collegial relationship that reporters and principals used to have, and she\u2019s just one of the greats of all time, ever.\u201d Whoopi Goldberg praised Roberts as \u201can amazing giant in the world of journalism, a great woman,\u201d adding that her \"influence and impact cannot be overstated.\" Joy Behar called Roberts \u201creliable and smart and to the point, and she had a great sense of humor.\u201d \"Cokie Roberts was kind.

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- In a series of tweets Monday, President Donald Trump criticized Democrats for their inquiries into his administration, and called for a shift in focus to former President Barack Obama's business moves. Instead of investigating reports suggesting that Trump is using his presidency to enrich his businesses, Democrats should look at Obama's book and Netflix deals, the president said. \"I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal,\" Trump tweeted. The former president and former first lady Michelle Obama launched a film production company in partnership with Netflix last spring, reportedly a \"high eight-figure deal,\" according to CNN. They also secured book deals worth $60 million each, according to reports. Michelle Obama's book \"Becoming\" was published last year\u00a0and quickly became a best seller. \"House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION.\u00a0So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that 'Trump'\u00a0has done over his lifetime. But it doesn't... work that way,\" Trump tweeted. Trump has previously called for an investigation into Barack Obama's book deal, despite it not being unusual for commanders in chief to publish books after their time\u00a0in office. Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan all authored books after their terms ended, for example. In July\u00a0Trump told reporters, \"Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day one... They could look into the book deal that President Obama made. Let's subpoena all of his records.\" The tweets Monday come after Democrats have sounded the cry for an impeachment investigation, fueled by allegations that Trump has obstructed justice and is profiting off of his time in office. Recently Vice President Mike Pence came under scrutiny for staying at a Trump-owned resort on an official trip to Ireland, and Trump was slammed for suggesting that next year's\u00a0G-7 summit be held at\u00a0one of his resorts in Florida. Trump has repeatedly claimed that his time in office has not benefited his personal wealth or that of his companies. \"I will, and have always expected to, lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS... for the privilege of being your President,\" Trump also\u00a0tweeted Monday.",

One of the morning witnesses will be Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert at the National Security Council, who listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and reported concerns to the council's top lawyer. The committee will also hear from Jennifer Williams, a National Security Council aide to Vice President Mike Pence, who also listened to the July 25 call.

The book, titled \"A Warning,\" paints a dire picture of Trump's presidency and suggests he might refuse to leave office even if convicted in impeachment hearings or defeated narrowly in the 2020 election. The author also says Trump\u00a0is preparing his followers to see either outcome as a \"coup\"\u00a0that could warrant resistance. White House officials have pushed back against the book's claims, emphasizing the fact that the author has chosen to remain in the shadows. Some welcome rain is on the way for portions of parched and fire-weary California beginning Tuesday. The first significant rain and snow of the season is expected in southern California, which will bring some relief from the state's abnormally dry conditions, the Weather Channel said. More than\u00a081% of the state is considered \"abnormally\" dry, including a small percentage in the first stages of drought, according to the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor. Up to an inch of rain is possible in both Los Angeles and San Diego this week. In addition to southern California, showers and thunderstorm coverage will also increase Tuesday afternoon and evening across Arizona, New Mexico and southern Utah, the weather service said. Michelle Obama is inviting readers to discover their own voices and stories through journaling in a new book out Tuesday.\u00a0\"Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice\"\u00a0is the journal companion to her memoir \"Becoming,\" last year's top-selling book on USA TODAY's best-selling books list. \"Writing is a way to process, to understand, to grow, and yes, to remember,\" writes the former first lady. The book, which has been featured on Oprah Winfrey's coveted list of \"Favorite Things,\"  includes more than 150 quotes, writing prompts, and even a \"Becoming\" playlist. Bei Bei the giant panda is leaving the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for a new home in China on Tuesday.\u00a0As part of an agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all panda cubs at the National Zoo move to China at 4 years old. Bei Bei will make the 15-hour-plus flight\u00a0aboard the appropriately named FedEx Panda Express, a custom-decaled Boeing 777 Freighter aircraft, out of Virginia's Dulles International Airport. A panda keeper and veterinarian will accompany Bei Bei on his nonstop flight to Chengdu, monitoring him and providing him treats like apples, carrots and sweet potatoes, according to the zoo.",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 There are times you need to nut up or shut up. If you're bringing back the beloved \"Zombieland\" to theaters, you'd better\u00a0amp up what we didn't know we needed\u00a0in an undead\u00a0action comedy: President Barack Obama's killer \"Beast\" limousine, Elvis and Terminator zombies. (And\u00a0Bill Murray somehow rising from the dead\u00a0after his tragic death in the original\u00a0would be cool, too). Director Ruben Fleischer conjures\u00a0all that with the return of the most dysfunctional family to roam the zombie apocalypse \u2013 Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee, Emma Stone's Wichita, Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus and Abigail Breslin's Little Rock\u00a0\u2013 in\u00a0\"Zombieland: Double Tap\" (now in theaters). \"Raising the stakes is always a good thing for a sequel,\" says Fleischer. The original 2019 movie\u00a0depicted a devastating viral outbreak that brought zombie global domination\u00a0and four bickering survivors together, bonding over great\u00a0kills. But the virus has\u00a0mutated over the decade, to\u00a0create stronger, more oppressive\u00a0zombies\u00a0who earn the Terminator-inspired moniker T-800s. Bill Murray is alive!\u00a0How the tragic 'Zombieland' victim ended up in the sequel Zombie killing hits the White House:'Zombieland: Double Tap' first trailer \"They are harder-to-kill, relentless zombies that stop at nothing. And it causes everyone\u00a0concern as they learn how to meet the new threat,\" says\u00a0Fleischer. This required better zombie thespians, well above the typical drooling norm for shambling undead types in lesser productions. \"Our first T-800 was a dancer stunt guy who had strong physical control of his body (and was)\u00a0able to do those movements that seemed inhuman,\" says Fleischer But the T-800s aren't\u00a0the only new creatures roaming the land. The evolving disease has created\u00a0whole other undead categories, include \"The Homer\"\u00a0(moronic even by zombie standards), \"The Ninja\" (skilled at moving and fighting) and \"The Hawking\" (dangerously smart). \"All of this makes the zombie landscape more compelling,\" says Fleischer. With the\u00a0greater threat comes the need for greater vehicles, including the original \"Beast\":\u00a0Tallahassee gets his hands on the monster Cadillac limousine that\u00a0protected President Obama with a 5-inch thick armor plating of steel and bulletproof glass. The neglected \"Beast\" comes with the group's\u00a0new home, a deserted White House. Tallahassee's upgrades include a\u00a0zombie-clearing plow, machine-gun mount and decorative bullhorns. \"It resembles Obama's car to a T\u00a0but it turns into the\u00a0ultimate 'Mad Max' zombie-killing machine,\" says Fleischer.\u00a0\"It's one of the perks of moving into the White House.\" Fun fact: The filmmakers actually took over two leftover presidential limos from the 2013 White House action flick \"Olympus Has Fallen,\" then promptly destroyed the cars while filming \"Zombieland 2.\" One was gloriously finished off by the monster truck Big Fat Death,\u00a0which rolls up on the limousine during a righteous, random moment of carnage. \"We've\u00a0killed this 'Beast' from future movies,\u00a0unless there's a\u00a0true post-apocalyptic movie needing\u00a0detritus,\" says Fleischer. Amid the other film's disturbing\u00a0revelations, \"Zombieland 2\"\u00a0goes for full heartbreak. Brace yourself. Elvis Presley's famed Graceland has been torched. On the bright side, many of The King's artifacts, right down to his blue suede shoes, are on display at the Hound Dog Hotel, run by newcomer Nevada (Rosario Dawson). Elvis lore and the undead are a heaven-sent match, enhanced by a zombie bludgeoned by guitar\u00a0and Harrelson's character riffing about his love of the icon in a moment of real-life truth. Tallahassee\u00a0dresses the part, does a right-on\u00a0impression\u00a0and even sings \"Burning Love.\" Mercy.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne President Hassan Rouhani announced Tuesday that Iran\u00a0will start\u00a0injecting uranium gas into centrifuges, further unraveling a nuclear deal with world powers and effectively advancing\u00a0the country's ability to make a nuclear bomb. The centrifuges previously spun empty under the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement that President Donald Trump withdrew from more than a year ago. Rouhani unveiled the move during live remarks on Iranian state TV. He said Iran would inject uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges at its\u00a0Fordow nuclear facility. Crisis redux:Iran announces nuke deal violations 40 years after\u00a0hostage crisis While the development is significant because it\u00a0enables\u00a0Iran to more quickly enrich uranium to the higher levels needed\u00a0to produce a nuclear weapon, Tehran has long insisted that its nuclear activities are for peaceful, civilian energy use only. No evidence has emerged to indicate Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon. Tehran's latest step away from the accord\u00a0comes\u00a0a day after Iran's nuclear\u00a0chief said Iran doubled the number of advanced centrifuges in operation. It also represents\u00a0Iran's\u00a0\"fourth step\"\u00a0away from the deal\u00a0inked\u00a0by former President Barack Obama, which saw Iran agree to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Exiting the deal was a Trump campaign promise. Experts differ on how long they believe it would take Iran to produce a nuclear bomb\u00a0\u2013\u00a0assuming it wants to \u2013 with estimates ranging from months to a year. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to Rouhani's\u00a0comments. White House on Monday sanctioned members of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle as part of its maximalist campaign against Tehran, a move that came\u00a0as Iran marked\u00a0the 40th anniversary of the 1979 student takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and a subsequent\u00a0444-day hostage crisis that has set the tone for decades of animosity\u00a0with the United States. The collapsing nuclear deal has coincided with mysterious attacks on oil tankers and Saudi oil facilities the U.S. has blamed on Iran. Tehran denies\u00a0the allegation, though it did seize oil tankers and shoot down a U.S. military surveillance drone. The U.S. has since increased its military presence across the Middle East, including basing troops in Saudi Arabia for the first time since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The Saudis and neighboring United Arab Emirates are believed to be talking to Tehran through back channels to ease tensions. Rouhani stressed Tuesday that the steps Iran has taken so far, including going beyond the deal's uranium enrichment and stockpile limitations, could be reversed if European signatories to the accord, who have not withdrawn from the agreement, find a way for Tehran to avoid U.S. sanctions that have choked\u00a0off its foreign oil sales. \"We should be able to sell our oil,\" he said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The selection process for next year's G-7 summit of leading industrial nations is a stark departure from past precedents for selecting the site, former administration officials say. Former Barack Obama and George W. Bush administration\u00a0officials said\u00a0the Trump Doral resort should not even have been under consideration because of the perception of conflicts of interest. Their comments to USA TODAY came after\u00a0White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's Thursday announcement that the 2020 G-7 summit of leading industrial nations\u00a0would be hosted at the Trump National Resort in Doral, Fla., was met with fury from Democrats and at least one Republican senator. In a statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler called it \"among the most brazen examples yet of the President\u2019s corruption,\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters\u00a0it was not appropriate to use taxpayer dollars at a Trump resort. In a press briefing about the administration's search process, Mulvaney argued they had used the same criteria as previous administrations, but\u00a0\"it became apparent at the end of that process that Doral was, by far and away \u2013\u00a0far and away \u2013 the best physical facility for this meeting.\" The Trump National Doral resort is owned by the Trump Organization, a collection of business entities owned mostly by President Donald Trump, though it is unclear what degree of involvement he has in the management in the company.

Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney defends hosting G7 summit at Trump property More:Dems debate, Trump's acts on Turkey and impeachment heats up: The week in politics news \"You wouldn't even look at the property because it doesn't matter if it's the best property on Earth. There's a perception of\u00a0impropriety,\"\u00a0said Johanna Maska, who handled the Obama administration's advance preparations for the 2012 G-8 in Camp David, Md. She noted that while Hawaii and Chicago had been under consideration for the 2012 G-8, they had taken all possible steps to work with city vendors and avoid any potential conflicts of interest. Though, \"I guess it's a little different when the vendor is your family,\" she said. Greg Jenkins, who worked on the Bush administration's advance preparations for the 2004 G-8 in Sea Island, Ga., said that administration would have never considered holding the event at a venue like the Bush ranch in Texas. \"I mean, to be handed a list of places, like 'oh, look at that. Looks like the only place it's going to work in all of America is a place that happens to be owned by the President.' Right. Well, that's not a coincidence at all,\" said Greg Jenkins, who worked on the Bush administration's advance preparations for the 2004 G-8 in Sea Island, Ga. Summits like the G-7 are a massive undertaking, with delegations following every world leader and thousands of journalists from international press corps descending on the location. According to Maska, the \"host country has a lot of control\" over the planning of summits of world leaders like the G-7 or the G-20, unlike other summits like those for NATO, which have strict guidelines. There are \"a number of different pressing, different staff needs, different leader needs, security needs, and all of those are taken into account,\" she explained. It has to be a secure venue, with private entrances, she noted. One would not want to hold it in a hotel with lots of glass windows, she explained. Other major concerns would be potential locations for photo ops, for each delegation to have a working space, and locations for leaders to meet up with each other. Jenkins said that in the Bush administration, it was at least a two-step process to identify a venue. \"We identified a bunch of venues around the country that would be just candidates to be considered,\" he explained.\u00a0\"And we did what essentially a lot of desk-side research first, to cull the list,\" before anyone flew out to visit sites. Mike Ready, who oversaw security coordination for the Secret Service for large events like the G-7, said they would have assessed \"The security impact on where we're going. Is it something that we can secure easily? Or is this something that's going to be, you know, a severe challenge or maybe have a major impact on the community be there?\" More:White House: Next G-7 meeting will take place at Trump's Doral facility in Florida More:Reports: Trump Organization properties see profits decline, no longer desirable to tenants More:House Judiciary Committee to investigate Trump's desire to use his Doral resort to host next G-7 summit Despite some earlier reports, the city was not entirely blindsided by the announcement. The Trump administration had advised the city of the possibility of the G-7 being held there last June after news had leaked,\u00a0Doral\u00a0Mayor Juan Carlos Bermudez told USA TODAY. The city had budgeted about $311,000 for potential overtime pay and equipment for officers in the event the G-7 were to be held there, he said. Since June, though, the mayor said he had not had any contact with the Trump administration or the Secret Service, nor had his police chief been in contact with the administration. Since the announcement, he had one \"brief conversation\" with a staffer in the\u00a0White House Intergovernmental Affairs Office. He looked forward to seeing the G-7 come to Doral, though, calling it a \"great opportunity for us to showcase ourselves to the rest of the United States and the world.\" Bermudez said he was a former Democrat, now a registered Republican who had voted for Trump in 2016, though the city's mayoral position was nonpartisan. The hosting of a summit of world leaders at a resort with ties to the presidency is not without precedent. The 1976 G-7\u00a0summit was held\u00a0at a resort in Puerto Rico owned by Laurance Rockefeller, the younger brother of then-Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Nelson Rockefeller, as CBS News reports, took much more extensive steps to disclose his financial dealings and released a dozen years of tax returns once he became vice president. Trump, however, has not released his tax returns.",

      "content": "DETROIT \u2013 Founders Brewing Co. co-founder Dave Engbers said, and repeated, last Friday that Founders was confident in winning the\u00a0racial discrimination lawsuit a fired employee had filed against the brewer. Six days later \u2013 as anger built across the craft beer community and beyond, and as uncertainty surrounded the closed Founders Detroit taproom \u2013 the tune changed. The Grand Rapids-based brewery, Michigan's largest, announced Thursday it reached a settlement with former Detroit taproom events and promotions manager Tracy Evans, one year after the lawsuit was filed.\u00a0Evans alleged\u00a0that Founders tolerated a \"racist internal corporate culture\" and that Founders fired him in retaliation for complaints to human resources about racism on staff. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Engbers and fellow co-founder Mike Stevens released a statement Thursday saying they are \"pleased\" the case has been settled and that they can now \"focus on the future.\" MillerCoors name change:Now known as Molson Coors, looks to cut up to 500 jobs Veterans Day military discount:Target is offering a 10% military discount Nov. 3-11. Here's how to sign up \"Through recent discussions with Tracy, we listened, engaged in self-discovery, and reached common ground to make amends,\" the statement read. \"We agreed that nobody be viewed at fault here. Most importantly, this serves as an opportunity to place our full attention on the work we now have to do, as a company of more than 600 dedicated team members, to rebuild our relationships.\" In addition, Stevens and Engbers said they are dedicated to bringing diversity and inclusion\u00a0to Founders and that every employee should be \"valued, respected and safe.\" That said, the company is looking to replace its diversity and inclusion director, Graci Harkema, who\u00a0announced her resignation last Friday. Founders said it has no further comment on the case. Evans also released a statement about the settlement, saying there is power when one steps up and makes themselves heard. He plans to move on from the issues he faced at Founders and fight against racial discrimination around the world. \"I don't know what happens from here within the doors of Founders Brewing Co.\u00a0I do know this; we have legal resolution and we have started looking at how ALL of this is affecting human lives,\" Evans said in the statement. \"Learning from our mistakes is also part of the mission. Founders as a whole made some bad choices. I, as an individual made some mistakes but\u00a0on this day we look to move forward.\" Evans had filed the lawsuit \u2013\u00a0Evans v. Canal Street Brewing Co., LLC\u00a0\u2013 in October 2018. Founders denied most of the allegations in the suit, including that two printers at the Grand Rapids headquarters were electronically labeled \"black guy printer\" and \"white guy printer,\" though it admitted in its lawsuit response\u00a0that multiple employees said the N-word around Evans and weren't immediately fired. As the case worked its way through court, the story exploded in national headlines and on social media on Oct. 21\u00a0due to a leaked deposition from the case. In the deposition, first posted that morning\u00a0by the Detroit Metro Times,\u00a0then-Founders Detroit taproom general manager Dominic Ryan, who fired Evans, would not answer whether Evans is black, and later wouldn't confirm whether Barack Obama, Michael Jordan or Kwame Kilpatrick were black because he's never \"met\" them. Founders' Detroit taproom:Michigan brewery closes Detroit taproom indefinitely amid racial discrimination lawsuit The leak \u2013 along with Founders' response to it later that day, saying it is \"more confident than ever that it will prevail\" in the lawsuit \u2013 sparked outrage across social media, led to a boycott from Eastern Market Brewing Co.\u00a0and drove Detroit-area shops and bars to pull Founders products from their shelves and taps. Founders later last week issued a new statement from its co-founders, pulled out of the popular Fall Beer Festival in Detroit's Eastern Market and closed the Detroit taproom \"until further notice,\" citing employee safety. Last Friday, Engbers told the Free Press that Dominic is still with Founders, but that he was removed from the Detroit taproom and placed on leave. He also said that one of two\u00a0employees who said the N-word around Evans is still with the company. There is no word yet on when the Detroit taproom will reopen. In the meantime, Founders will have work to do in rebuilding strained relationships with the Detroit community, the craft beer community at large and with businesses that vowed to stop serving Founders products. Further complicating matters is the coming sale to an overseas company. In January, Spain's largest beer company, Mahou San Miguel, will acquire a 90% stake in Founders, with Stevens and Engbers each retaining 5% ownership. Though Founders maintains that day-to-day operations will not change, questions remain about its status as an American craft brewer.

      "content": "Barack and Michelle Obama are going strong! The former first couple swapped celebratory\u00a0messages on social media to commemorate their 27th wedding anniversary. The Obamas, who share daughters Malia and Sasha, wed on Oct. 3, 1992. The country's former commander-in-chief invoked the spirit of\u00a0the Beatles in his anniversary salute to his wife Thursday, taking to Instagram to share\u00a0a photo of the two of them from behind, rocking baseball caps and looking off into the sunset in an embrace. Though the former president is known for being a man of many words, he kept things short and sweet in his post. \"Like the Beatles said: It\u2019s getting better all the time,\" he wrote in the post. \"Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years!\" The \"Becoming\" author shared a photo of the couple laughing near the water, opening up about the \"magic\" that connects them. \"27 years ago, this guy promised me a life full of adventure. I\u2019d say he\u2019s delivered,\" she\u00a0wrote on the\u00a0Instagram post.\u00a0\"Here\u2019s to our next chapter of becoming empty nesters and discovering what\u2019s next\u2014while still feeling the magic that brought us together all those years ago. Happy anniversary, Barack.\" And the Obamas show no signs of slowing down. They launched\u00a0Higher Ground Productions last spring\u00a0in\u00a0partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would \"harness the power of storytelling\" and touch on\u00a0\"issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more.\" The former first lady also beat\u00a0out Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey as the most admired woman this summer, according to\u00a0a July poll by YouGov.

      "content": "More than 400 inmates in Oklahoma will be released Mondayafter a law signed this year retroactively reduced the sentences for individuals who committed low-level crimes. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board approved the commutation of 462 inmates unanimously, and on Friday, Gov. Kevin Stitt\u2019s office has processed the recommendations for final approval. It is the largest mass commutation \u2013 or reduction of a sentencing \u2013\u00a0in\u00a0U.S. history. President Barack Obama released 330 federal prisoners on his last day of office. In 2016, referendums passed in Oklahoma made simple drug possession a misdemeanor instead of a felony\u00a0and raised the threshold of felony property crimes \u2013 including theft, vandalism, shoplifting and robbery \u2013\u00a0up to $1,000. Earlier this year, Stitt, a Republican, signed a law that would apply these changes retroactively for current inmates. \u201cThis event is another mark on our historic timeline as we move the needle in criminal justice reform, and my administration remains committed to working with Oklahomans to pursue bold change that will offer our fellow citizens a second chance while also keeping our communities and streets safe,\u201d Stitt said in a statement Friday. The board considered 814 eligible cases, and 527 were recommended for a lesser penalty given the severity of those crimes.\u00a0Sixty-five\u00a0of those individuals are still held on detainers. \u201cWith this vote, we are fulfilling the will of Oklahomans,\u201d said Steven Bickley, the executive director of the Pardon and Parole Board. \u201cHowever, from day one, the goal of this project has been more than just the release of low level, nonviolent offenders, but the successful reentry of these individuals back into society.\u201d Oklahoma will save nearly $12 million by releasing these low-level offenders, as opposed to keeping them incarcerated.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 When the Supreme Court considereds the plight Tuesday of nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, one of them was seated front and center at the defense table. Luis Cortes\u00a0Romero, who arrived in the country at the tender age of 1 three decades ago, is an immigration lawyer. He's also among\u00a0the immigrants who could be deported by the Trump administration if it wins its effort to have the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program declared unlawful. Cortes'\u00a0rapid rise in\u00a0the legal profession may be unusual, but he's not alone among DACA recipients. Others are prosecutors and defense lawyers, paralegals and law students, even plaintiffs in the three cases heard Tuesday.\u00a0Their\u00a0experiences in a country that denies them a path to citizenship have led them to the law\u00a0\u2013 literally. \u201cIt affects your life so much that you become obsessed with how to fix it,\" says Cortes, 31, a partner at the\u00a0Immigrant Advocacy & Litigation Center in Washington State. \"Being a DACA recipient and being so desperate for an answer really has\u00a0me entrenched.\u201d DACA recipients include people like Pedro Villalobos, a family violence prosecutor in Travis County, Texas, home to the attorney general who has led the effort to end the program. They include people like Jose Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, whose path to immigration law began when his home state of Arizona cracked down on financial aid for undocumented students. They include people like Dulce Garcia, whose experience running\u00a0her own small law firm in San Diego led her to become a lead plaintiff in the battle. When she worried that her prominence could endanger undocumented members of her family, she said,\u00a0her mother responded: \"It's time to stand up, even if it means we're going to get deported.\" And they include students at some of the nation's most prominent law schools, from Harvard\u00a0\u2013 where Mitchell Santos Toledo was motivated to apply because of the roadblocks in his way\u00a0\u2013 to UCLA, where Lisette Candia Diaz will begin\u00a0her studies next fall after working for the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrant Rights Project. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a question\u00a0for me that I wanted to be a lawyer,\" says Diaz, 26, who arrived from Chile when she was 6. \"I saw my parents struggle with their status and how they were taken advantage\u00a0of by a lot of people.\" More:Supreme Court leans toward Trump plan to end DACA program for nearly 700K undocumented immigrants More:As Supreme Court takes up Trump plan to end DACA, American dreams at stake for nearly 700,000 immigrants Like their hundreds of thousands of compatriots, these lawyers and law students lack credible options if they cannot remain in the only country they have ever known. Maga\u00f1a-Salgado and Toledo were brought from Mexico when they were 2. Villalobos was 3. Garcia was 4. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s about life,\" Maga\u00f1a-Salgado says. \"This is going to affect our careers, our decisions about higher education, even family planning issues.\" More:As Supreme Court takes up Trump plan to end DACA, nearly 700,000 immigrants\u00a0await their fate It's not surprising that many of the \"children\" President Barack Obama sought to protect from deportation in 2012 are examples of the American dream\u00a0\u2013 not just lawyers but doctors and engineers and teachers, with roots in their communities and children of their own. To qualify every two years for DACA, they had to be students, high school graduates,\u00a0holders of an equivalency degree, or\u00a0honorably discharged from the military. They could not have been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or more than three lesser misdemeanors. Texas challenged the program's legality in 2017 after successfully blocking Obama's effort to extend protections to millions of undocumented parents. Noting that a deadlocked Supreme Court had allowed that ruling to stand, the state threatened to sue the Trump administration unless it rescinded DACA. \"Congress has never given the executive carte blanche to grant lawful presence to any alien it chooses not to remove, let alone benefits including work authorization, health care, unemployment, and a pathway to citizenship,\" Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins argued in Supreme Court papers on behalf of 12 states. Faced with the threatened lawsuit, the Department of Homeland Security decided to end the program, citing then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' assertion that it was unconstitutional and beyond the agency's authority. It said it would not accept any new applications and would limit renewals. \"At best, DACA is legally questionable,\" U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court in legal papers. \"At worst, it is illegal.\" That's not what federal\u00a0district and appeals courts have found, however, resulting in three challenges\u00a0from California, New York and the District of Columbia reaching the Supreme Court. The justices will hold 80 minutes of oral argument Tuesday. \"The administration could have left DACA in place,\" Theodore Olson, who will argue the case along with California Solicitor General Michael Mongan,\u00a0argues in court papers. \"It did not have to end this humanitarian policy that allows nearly 700,000 people to stay in the only country they have ever really known. It did not have to eliminate the opportunity for these individuals to earn a living to support themselves and their families.\" The legal battle culminating in a second Supreme Court showdown this week has captivated one group of DACA recipients more than others: those making a career in the law. Leading the pack is Cortes, who will sit\u00a0at the counsel's table with Olson, a legendary Supreme Court litigator, on Tuesday. Cortes, who was in high school when his father was deported in 2003, later went to law school in Idaho \"to stop things like that.\" Soon after Trump entered the White House, Cortes was the first lawyer to get involved in the case of a Washington State DACA recipient threatened with deportation because of alleged gang ties that he denied. \u201cBecause I have DACA, I had a sense of how alarming it was,\" he\u00a0says. Within days, major law firms and constitutional law professors had joined the case. When the Trump administration terminated DACA months later, they were among the first to go to court. \"It's\u00a0heavy emotionally, because\u00a0this is a type of professional\u00a0milestone that you can only dream about,\" Cortes\u00a0says. \"It also feels heavy in responsibility.\" Garcia grew up \"in the shadows\"\u00a0just miles from the Mexico border in San Diego, where her family lived in fear of being deported. Her younger brother was put in a detention center for a time. Her older brother was beyond the age limit to qualify for DACA. \u201cThis is why I practice immigration law,\" says Garcia, 36, who will travel to the nation's capital for Tuesday's oral argument. \"There\u2019s still a date when I become deportable, and no one knows what\u2019s going to happen at the Supreme Court.\" Maga\u00f1a-Salgado was a business major at Arizona State University when his home state cracked down on financial aid and other benefits for undocumented immigrants. \"That is what put me on this path,\" he says. To help himself and others, \"I needed to be a lawyer.\" He went to law school in Texas, interned with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and found upon graduation that without a work permit he could not sit for the bar exam. In 2012, DACA solved that problem. Now 33, Maga\u00f1a-Salgado owns a small consulting firm, helping nonprofits and others involved in immigration. But he worries about his future if the program is ended. \"At the end of the day,\" he says, \"the government has all of our home addresses.\" Like many of his fellow lawyers, Villalobos was motivated by the roadblocks in his path: first the lack of government loans to attend college, then not having a work permit to help pay the costs. When his parents became legal permanent residents, he was too old to qualify. \"I learned the importance that laws have on people's everyday lives,\" Villalobos, 28, says. At the University of Texas School of Law, he set his sights on becoming an immigration lawyer, but he found it \"hit a little bit too close to home. I felt like I would be too invested in every single person's case and would burn out very quickly.\" Instead, he is nearing his three-year anniversary as an assistant county attorney\u00a0\u2013 helping to maintain law and order in his adopted country. Cinthia Padilla believed she was a U.S. citizen as she accumulated a 4.0 grade point average in high school, and she had Harvard in her sights. When she learned she lacked documentation, having come from Mexico as a 1-year-old,\u00a0her sights shifted to a less expensive college, but her ambition remained the same: to fight crime. Padilla, 29, graduated from Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tenn., in 2011 and went to work as a legal assistant. She applied for DACA the following year and began law school in 2017 at Loyola University in New Orleans, where she will graduate next year. In between all that, she watched helplessly as her father was deported back to Mexico. Her three younger brothers all are U.S. citizens. Only she and her mother\u00a0are undocumented. \"I came to law school trying to find answers for myself,\" Padilla says. \"The threats are very real to me.\" Santos'\u00a0path to Harvard Law School passed through\u00a0community college in California, then the University of California-Berkeley, where he majored in legal studies and authored a project on undocumented students. \u201cIt was a personal thing,\" Santos, 28, says. \"I wanted to\u00a0help other people in very similar situations to me.\" He will graduate next May and plans to take the bar exam in California next summer \u2013 just months before his two-year DACA protection requires renewal. Despite his background in the law, he says he's \"just as worried as anyone else.\" \"The community of undocumented lawyers is very small,\" Santos\u00a0says. \"It takes a lot to get to that point, considering all the roadblocks you have to overcome.\" Diaz's path from Chile to her next destination, UCLA School of Law, went through New York's Long Island. Once armed with DACA, she attended Harvard as an undergraduate, where she wrote a thesis on DACA's impact on mixed-status families. \"I think DACA recipients are in such a strange position,\" Diaz\u00a0says.\u00a0\"A lot of us grew up here, grew up American, with\u00a0all of these ideals of the American dream\u00a0and what it means to make it. \u201cAt the same time we\u2019re being told all of that, there\u2019s another group of people saying we don\u2019t belong here.\"",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES\u00a0\u2013 Eddie Murphy\u00a0is suddenly everywhere again bringing the laughter. Just don't call it a comeback. The 58-year-old comedian is stepping up on\u00a0the big screen\u00a0in grand 1970s pimp attire as real-life\u00a0comedy pioneer Rudy Ray Moore for\u00a0\"Dolemite Is My Name\"\u00a0(in theaters Friday in New York, Los Angeles and Memphis before\u00a0streaming on Netflix\u00a0Oct. 25). The movie's roll-out is\u00a0accompanied by\u00a0a barrage of high-profile entertainment events that\u00a0have\u00a0Murphy\u00a0fans giddy. There's his return to \"Saturday Night Live\"\u00a0as host on\u00a0Dec. 21 before Murphy undertakes\u00a0a national stand-up comedy tour for the first time in three decades. The laughs continue with a sequel to 1988's \"Coming to America,\" set for a 2020 release. Review:Eddie Murphy's 'Dolemite Is My Name' is his greatest-hits role, and we are here for it Prolific fatherhood:Eddie Murphy welcomes his 10th child, a baby boy Max, with\u00a0Paige Butcher Impressive, yes.\u00a0But the chilled-out Murphy insists it's all about\u00a0finally pushing himself off the supremely comfortable couch longtime\u00a0girlfriend Paige\u00a0Butcher had\u00a0specially built for him at home, on which he has luxuriated for the last six years or so. \"People are saying, 'You\u2019re back!\u00a0It\u2019s a comeback!' \" says Murphy, going to into excited fan voice while sitting beside his \"Dolemite\" and \"Coming 2 America\" director Craig Brewer. \"I\u2019m like, no,\u00a0I\u2019m not trying to do a comeback. I\u2019ve just been enjoying sitting on the couch so much. A few years ago, I\u00a0was like, 'I could sit on this couch and stay here watching 'Little Women: LA' and their exploits.' \" \"Dolemite\" provided the dynamite that sparked the push off the couch to the stage. The feel-good biopic\u00a0about\u00a0Moore's efforts to break into outrageous comedy and\u00a0low-budget movies\u00a0was a natural segue\u00a0into more humor \u2013 certainly more than his last film, the little-seen 2016 drama \"Mr. Church.\" in which he played a family caretaker. In further divine signs, \"Dolemite\"\u00a0even allowed for Murphy's couch belly to be required playing Moore, a middle-age\u00a0man\u00a0referred to as \"doughy\" in the film.\u00a0It's a\u00a0 Murphy shows off with unfettered confidence in \"Dolemite.\" \"After a while, you start to grow on the couch, and it\u2019s like\u00a0whoooa,\" Murphy says. \"Usually before a movie,\u00a0I have to get my body together. But this\u00a0was perfect. It\u2019s like I went all the way Method.\" Murphy is all about the comfort, talking\u00a0about his deep admiration for the period clothes, but dislike of wearing the dreaded platforms. (\"They are a young man's shoes,\" he scowls.)\u00a0The costume designer had a pair of sneakers custom-made for Murphy to resemble platforms. \"Still, every day\u00a0I would come to Eddie\u00a0and be like, 'Here\u2019s what the day is about,' \" says Brewer. \"And his first question was always, 'Will you be seeing my feet?' \" As \"Dolemite\" came together, Murphy became inspired to make his return to \"SNL,\" stoked by his brief 40th anniversary appearance, which left Murphy hungry for more at night's\u00a0end. \"Then it was like, 'Hey, everybody, it would be fun to do a sketch.' \" \"Dolemite\" opened the door to a repeat visit, and Murphy says\u00a0he'll bring back his beloved \"SNL\" characters this time, including Gumby,\u00a0Mister\u00a0Robinson and Buckwheat. President Barack Obama provided key encouragement, meeting Murphy before the star received his Mark Twain Prize for American Humor\u00a0in 2015. Obama asked him two questions: What kind of hair rinse was he using?\u00a0\"And 'When are you doing comedy again?' \" says Murphy, stepping into Obama's serious voice. \"I was like, 'That\u2019s your question?'\u00a0When you go into the Oval Office and the president asks when are you doing stand-up, it\u2019s time to do some jokes.\" Murphy is vowing a less-brash return to the stage than his\u00a0R-rated '80s routine, but still taking material from his own life. \"The last time I did stand-up, I had no kids, I had never been married and I was 27 years old,\" says Murphy. \"I\u2019m 58. I have 10 kids. I\u2019ve been married and divorced. So I have so much stuff to talk about.\" The final push is\u00a0\"Coming 2\u00a0America.\"\u00a0Of\u00a0the\u00a040 movies he has\u00a0starred in, Murphy says the story of his naive\u00a0African Prince Akeem attempting to pose as a regular American is the one that resonates most\u00a0with his fans. Akeem returns to America as king in the sequel, which is halfway through filming and reunites the core\u00a0cast \u2013 including James Earl Jones, who just shot his scenes. Murphy is\u00a0the only one who's really aged, he insists. \"I pull this\u00a0all together when I see people, but if\u00a0you saw me on the couch, I\u00a0would be unrecognizable,\" he deadpans. Don't expect the comedy onslaught to continue. The former box-office juggernaut\u00a0says his days of doing two or three\u00a0movies a year will never happen again. It's too much work, and he's over it. \"I cannot imagine being an old dude and you get a call for\u00a06 a.m. pickup,\" Murphy says. But the current spate of work will provide a strong end to a chapter in his\u00a0storied career. If he's is inspired, Murphy\u00a0can take interesting projects on. Or if he wants to chill out with bad reality TV, that's OK, too. \"I\u2019m going to leave knowing the last things I did were really funny and successful. In the event I never got off the couch again, it's a nice way to leave it.\"",

      "subtitle": "Sales of new classic cars and SUVs stalled in regulatory limbo",
      "author": "",
      "content": "A change to U.S. law could open the door to a flood of companies building new versions of classic vehicles like the \u201965 Ford Mustang, first-generation Ford Bronco, \u201963 Chevy Corvette Stingray and '60s-80s Toyota FJ Land Cruisers. But first, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must issue a regulation required by the law, which has been on the books for nearly four years. Businesspeople involved say that\u2019s the only thing keeping a new industry from growing. Tom Scarpello, CEO of Revology Cars, which restores classic Mustangs at about $180,000 apiece, expects his Orlando, Florida, company to expand almost immediately when NHTSA sets the rules for what safety features the replicas must have. \u201cWe just need to find a bigger building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn less than a year, we could double, triple or quadruple our business,\u201d from the three restored classic Mustangs Revology currently builds each month. Replicas:Are those fake Lamborghinis and Bugattis sold online just about fun? Or is it fraud? Buying a car for your teenager?Here's what you should keep in mind Nationwide, the law could create $120 million-$150 million a year in U.S. sales and several times that much from exports, according to the Specialty Equipment Market Association, which represents parts and vehicle makers for classic and modified cars, trucks and motorcycles. \u201cInvestors see the potential the law has to create a new business segment,\u201d Scarpello said. Loosely referred to as the Replica Car Bill, the law was part of a package President Barack Obama signed into law on Dec. 4, 2015. The law called for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NHTSA to create regulations to guide companies making new versions of classic vehicles. The EPA did its part, signing off on engine, transmission and emissions packages that meet current standards and can be used in replica cars, said Stuart Gosswein, SEMA director of government affairs. SEMA is suing NHTSA to allow manufacturers to start making replica cars immediately. \u201cWe have a lot of eager customers waiting to order their cars,\u201d Gosswein said. \u201cWe expect there to be 20-30 cars making up to 1,500 replicas a year\u201d for U.S. customers. The law allows each company to sell up to 5,000 vehicles annually, with a limit of 325 in the U.S. \u201cThe agency is aware of the filing but does not comment on matters relating to pending litigation,\u201d said a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, which includes NHTSA. Bringing a classic car into rough compliance with modern standards isn\u2019t easy, but you can argue the EPA\u2019s half of the process was simpler than NHTSA\u2019s. Emissions standards are a measurable goal. Safety is a fuzzier concept. SEMA argues the cars must meet standards for features like lights and brakes. \u201cModern\u201d advances like antilock brakes, shoulder belts \u2014\u00a0or in the case of classics like the \u201932 Ford, any seat belt at all \u2014\u00a0should be left to the maker\u2019s discretion. \u201cThe customer for these vehicles knows what they\u2019re buying and how it should be used,\u201d Gosswein said. Essentially, SEMA believes the cars will be used occasionally by drivers who know what they\u2019re getting into. A 45-year-old CPA on a Saturday jaunt in an $80,000 Stingray replica is less likely to drive like an idiot than a 16-year-old in a Hyundai Tiburon. Caveat emptor. Companies can currently sell classics without those features because regulations distinguish between \u201crestored\u201d vehicles \u2014\u00a0those built when the car was new and refurbished or fitted with modern engines, audio systems, etc. \u2014\u00a0and replicas, which are brand new vehicles built to the specifications of the original. Basically, if you\u2019ve got a piece of metal attached to the vehicle identification number (VIN) of an old vehicle, you can build anything you like around it. Without a VIN, specialty companies can build a \u201crolling chassis\u201d a replica without an engine. The customer can add an engine and have a drivable car. The company can\u2019t. It\u2019s an arbitrary distinction SEMA argues is blocking the creation of a small industry of replica car builders. Clarity from NHTSA would reduce prices and increase supply of new versions of classic vehicles, Scarpello said. \u201cRestoring old vehicles isn\u2019t a scalable, predictable business, because it\u2019s dependent on finding the old vehicles. To do it at any kind of reasonable price, you\u2019ve got to have a predictable business model. \u201cThe law could create a new market for specialty reproduction vehicles.\u201d Contact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or\u00a0mmphelan@freepress.com.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to side with the Trump administration in its effort to end a program\u00a0that lets nearly 700,000 young, undocumented immigrants live and work in the USA\u00a0without fear of deportation. During an extended, 80-minute oral argument inside a packed courtroom that included some of the threatened immigrants, several conservative\u00a0justices noted\u00a0the Department of Homeland Security laid out several reasons for its decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that the case's \"sympathetic facts ... speak to all of us,\" but he said the large number of people affected and the impact ending DACA would have on employers and entire communities was taken into consideration. The court's four liberal justices argued that the decision to end DACA should rise or fall on the administration's tenuous claim that it was illegal, rather than what\u00a0Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said might be a more legitimate reason: \"We don't like DACA, and we're taking responsibility for that, instead of trying to put the blame on the law.\" Chief Justice John Roberts looked to be the key vote, as he was in June when he voted with the court's four liberal justices to strike down the Trump administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. This time, he said the attorney general might be justified to say DACA was illegal after a related ruling\u00a0by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that the Supreme Court upheld on a 4-4 vote in 2016. \"You've got a court of appeals decision affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court,\" Roberts said. \"Can't he just say that's the basis on which I'm making this decision?\" The\u00a0court's ruling\u00a0probably won't be handed down until next spring, when the 2020 presidential election campaign is in full swing. Even if the court allows the program to be rescinded, most DACA recipients will retain the two-year protection\u00a0until President Donald Trump or his Democratic successor takes the oath of office in January 2021. Dreamers:As Supreme Court takes up Trump plan to end DACA, American dreams at stake for nearly 700,000 immigrants Lawyers:'Time to stand up:' Undocumented immigrants who chose careers in the law await Supreme Court's ruling The\u00a0threat of losing their protected status prompted hundreds\u00a0of DACA recipients to march, ride or fly to Washington for Tuesday's argument and stage demonstrations outside the court. Inside, the audience included University of California President Janet Napolitano, who authorized DACA as\u00a0secretary of Homeland Security in 2012 and sued the Trump administration over its elimination; Ken Cuccinelli, Trump's acting director of Citizenship and Immigration\u00a0Services; and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat. Until now, nearly every federal judge to hear the dispute has sided with the so-called DREAMers,\u00a0leaving the program intact nationwide. But the\u00a0Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0June to hear the case\u00a0signaled\u00a0a potential\u00a0win for the White House. How it wins would be crucial. If the justices simply refuse to overrule the Department of Homeland Security's discretionary decision, the next president just as easily could renew the program. If they agree with the Justice Department that it's unlawful, Congress would have to step in. The question before the justices Tuesday was not whether the Trump administration can wind down the program, which is undisputed. Rather, they were asked to decide if the administration's initial reason for doing so\u00a0\u2013 that DACA was illegal from the start\u00a0\u2013 was accurate and sufficient. Some of the conservatives questioned U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco on whether the administration adequately considered DACA recipients' reliance on the program, as well as that of employers, universities and others. Roberts,\u00a0whose vote is pivotal,\u00a0said that even if the program is illegal, the administration doesn't have to \"go back and untangle all the consequences of that.\" The liberal justices seemed inclined to rule against the administration\u00a0\u2013 particularly Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said the administration had not come clean about its reasons: \"This is not about the law. This is about our choice to destroy lives.\" Theodore Olson, a former U.S. solicitor general representing DACA recipients, agreed that \"the administration did not want to own this decision\" by acknowledging its opposition to the program. Later, however, Francisco stated bluntly: \"We own this.\" President Barack Obama created the program in 2012 after negotiations with Congress to create a path to citizenship faltered. He\u00a0sought to extend similar protections to more than 4 million undocumented parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents, but that was shot down by federal courts. Texas threatened to sue over DACA if the Trump administration didn't end it. When the Department of Homeland Security did so, lawsuits were filed from California to New York and several places in between, and two federal judges blocked the action nationwide. The\u00a0U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in California and a thorn in Trump's side, ridiculed the effort to deport \"blameless and economically productive young people with clean criminal records.\" To qualify every two years for DACA, recipients generally must be students,\u00a0high school graduates\u00a0or be enrolled or honorably\u00a0discharged\u00a0from the military. They cannot have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor\u00a0or more than three lesser crimes. Nearly three dozen legal briefs were\u00a0submitted on their side by groups representing big business, educators, religious institutions, labor unions, law enforcement and\u00a0national security groups, along with immigration and civil rights organizations. Beyond the reprieve\u00a0the program provides for the DREAMers, the case is important for several legal, policy and political reasons: \u2022 It represents\u00a0a major separation-of-powers wrestling match between the executive and legislative branches of government. \u2022 It is\u00a0the third major immigration battle to reach the court in which the Trump administration has used shifting justifications for its actions. The court upheld Trump's travel ban\u00a0against several majority-Muslim nations last year but blocked his effort this year to put the\u00a0citizenship question on the 2020 census. \u2022 It advances the Trump administration's effort to dismantle policies put in place by the Obama administration. The president has been unable to do away with\u00a0the Affordable Care Act's health care protections but was successful\u00a0in ending the Clean Power Plan, Obama's\u00a0signature climate change policy. \u2022 A win at the Supreme Court would enable Trump to resume negotiations with Congress by offering to extend\u00a0DACA\u00a0in exchange for\u00a0increased border wall funds. It also would make the program a major issue in the 2020 elections. Even before the case was heard Tuesday, the president was playing dealmaker on Twitter, suggesting \"a deal will be made with Dems\" if the Supreme Court sides with his administration on winding down the DACA program.",
