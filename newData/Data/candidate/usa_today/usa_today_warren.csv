Tribal accounts said villagers evacuated in advance of the attacks but soldiers burned winter food stores, leading to widespread starvation and suffering.

The high school got rid of the Native American man in a headdress 15 years ago in response to concerns that the image was offensive. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the mascot has returned in the past two years on banners, walls and the gym floor as the school marked its 50th anniversary. Banners designed for a Hall of Fame induction ceremony include the image of a Native American man in headdress along with the current lion mascot. Administrators and some board members said the mascot was included to honor alumni who identify with the original mascot and motto of “Indian Pride.” Carissa Corrow, an alumna, parent and former teacher at the school, said the image is “at best ignorant, and at worst racist and immoral.” She’s organizing a petition to remove the image and create a policy ensuring the mascot will not be used in the future. The chair of the New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs, Kathleen Blake, signed the petition. She wrote that the district’s decision was “offensive and ill-advised.” The school board is expected to discuss the petition and the role of the former mascot at its meeting in December."

When asked on Nevada Newsmakers if the development of a proposed relief airport in Ivanpah Valley would push Southern Nevada to the point of critical mass of its water supply, Director Brad Crowell said, “To be blunt, I think we are already at that point, quite honestly.” Crowell questioned if a proposed pipeline to bring water from rural Eastern Nevada to the Las Vegas Valley is the best solution for Southern Nevada’s water scarcity. Crowell, son of Carson City Mayor Robert Crowell, said other solutions should be considered, especially with the expense of building a 300-mile pipeline from White Pine County to Las Vegas. Nevada’s top water regulator, State Engineer Jason King, in August stopped the Southern Nevada Water Authority’s application to pump groundwater from White Pine County to Las Vegas. Yet, that decision did not settle the issue. Multiple court challenges have yet to be determined, Crowell said. Las Vegas water officials have considered plans to pipe groundwater into Las Vegas since 1989, according to reports. The current plan, however, has drawn opposition from Utah and Nevada counties, ranchers, Native-American tribes, recreation enthusiasts and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The legal fight will probably continue for 12 to 24 months and will have a strong impact on Nevada water law, Crowell said. Crowell noted the Las Vegas Valley gets 90% of its water from the Colorado River, with the rest coming from existing ground-water. That plan, however, might not be sustainable."

It found he repeatedly violated ethics rules and used his office to benefit private clients whose payments he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest.

She was 106. Greenwood died on Friday at her Denver residence, said Elder Shane Stringfellow of Caldwell Kirk Mortuary. Greenwood was one of the first black teachers to be hired by Denver Public Schools, which would later name an elementary school after her. In the 1940s, Greenwood was a member of an interracial group that used lawsuits and other means to force restaurants and shops to serve blacks. In the 1960s, she served on a Denver Public Schools committee that studied racial inequalities in school funding and staffing in the district. As a high school student in Denver in the 1920s, the girls’ dean told Greenwood she shouldn’t waste her parents’ money on college because she could never aspire to be more than a maid. Greenwood went on to graduate No. 3 in her class, go on to what is now the University of Northern Colorado to earn a teaching degree and return to Denver Public Schools. Greenwood was born Nov. 24, 1912, in Los Angeles. An only child, she moved with her parents to Denver in 1925. Greenwood and her late husband, William, an accountant who once ran the budget office at Denver’s now-defunct Lowry Air Force Base, had four children. Funeral services were pending."

It encourages people to report feral hog sightings to the state Department of Livestock, reporting that officials said is crucial to preventing an invasion. The “Squeal on Pigs” campaign mirrors a previous effort in the Pacific Northwest, according to the Billings Gazette. The hogs can spread disease and cause widespread property and crop damage. The most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate put swine damages at $1.5 billion annually. It’s probably closer $2.5 billion now, said Dale Nolte, who leads a USDA feral swine damage program. There has been a population boom of feral hogs in Canada, and photographs taken last year showed the swine within 5 miles of the U.S. border. University of Saskatchewan researcher Ryan Brooks said the hogs can be difficult to spot from the air because they bury themselves in mud and also burrow into the snow to make “pigloos.” Montana law prohibits the hunting of feral swine and requires people to report a sighting of the animals within 24 hours. Officials are hoping the “Squeal on Pigs” campaign will create enthusiasm among residents for reporting. The pigs consume 3% to 5% of their body weight each day, from high-dollar crops like watermelons or lettuce, to fawns and songbirds."

This additional criminal provision is totally unnecessary for border security, and for a century, it was rarely enforced. But since the early 2000s, it has been used to build and sustain a massive immigration detention complex. In 2016, over half of all federal criminal prosecutions were for immigration violations — more than prosecutions for terrorism, organized crime, hate crimes, or financial fraud. This obsessive focus ties up federal prosecutors and overwhelms federal courts. It’s costly and unnecessary."

The South Dakota Education Equity Coalition recently presented the idea to the committee at the state Capitol in Pierre with hopes of getting legislative backing to create charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated by a group such as a nonprofit or university. Sarah Pierce, one of the group leaders, said the schools would be a space where students can be “unapologetically Indian.” South Dakota, along with North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and Vermont, does not have legislation for such schools. The coalition was formed in August, aimed at making charter schools that strike a balance between offering indigenous culture and academic rigor. But it’s not just culture that Native Americans are looking to create space for in schools. They want better education. Native American students, who comprise about 11% of the public school student population in South Dakota, perform worse on exams than white students, according to the 2018-19 school report cards. The data shows that although 61% of white students in South Dakota met or exceeded the English language arts test score goal, only 23% of Native American students did. Native American students also did worse in science; 14% of them passed, compared to 53% of white students."

The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group said it’s continuing its legislative efforts."

Matt Bevin and the GOP-led legislature committed to full pension funding.

Supporters of the ordinance said the restrictive rules deterred businesses from the area, especially restaurants relying on alcohol sales. Opponents were concerned that the loosened liquor laws could potentially increase the number of impaired drivers. But supporters said people would drive outside of the city to buy liquor anyway. Livingston Alderman Wade Wilson championed the ordinance and said he was confident the ordinance would pass. Both towns have to approve local rules for businesses selling alcohol.

The groups also have proposed three clean-energy measures, which would go even further than last year’s proposal, for the November 2020 ballot. They’re awaiting ballot titles from the Oregon Secretary of State’s office before collecting signatures. The 2019 legislation would have placed an economy-wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon. It passed the House of Representatives and was expected to pass the Senate. But Republican senators staged a walkout, forcing Democrats to kill the bill in order to finish the session. Brown will work with Legislative leadership to pass a clean energy bill before considering executive action, her spokeswoman, Kate Kondayen, said Monday."

A Safe Haven Baby Box was unveiled Monday in Angola. The fire station is just minutes from the Michigan border, which was a factor in the location. Before leaving office, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder last year vetoed a bill that would have allowed baby boxes. The boxes allow someone to drop off a baby without fear of criminal prosecution. The box has an alarm that immediately alerts a local hospital or emergency responders.The Steuben County Community Foundation helped pay for the box, and others donated their services for the installation. When Snyder vetoed the Michigan bill, he said it was better to hand a baby to a person. That option is available under state law."

Lawmakers decided in 2015 to require state education officials to either close a school that failed for over four years or select a board to run the district.

The decision follows the release of a report detailing Wheatley High School’s poor performance and the board’s alleged wrongdoing. Houston ISD is suing the state, arguing that the takeover would disenfranchise black and Hispanic voters.

Hawaiian red shrimp are beginning to thrive at the site of a former boat ramp on Hawaii Island’s Pohoiki shoreline, Hawaii Public Radio reported Monday. More than 700 homes were destroyed after Kilauea erupted in May 2018. State Department of Land and Natural Resources researchers observed the activity in newly formed anchialine pools, which are land-locked and filled with brackish water. The pools that formed 14 months after Kilauea’s lava stopped flowing are connected to the ocean and the area’s groundwater and flow with the tide. New coastlines such as the one formed by the eruption can be difficult to observe, state biologist Troy Sakihara said. He encouraged people to enjoy the sight of the pools without disturbing them, noting that sunscreen and body oil can harm wildlife."

The lawsuit was filed Monday by the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance. A Mississippi law enacted in 1924 requires naturalized citizens to show a certificate of naturalization or another similar document that proves citizenship when they register to vote. Mississippi residents born in the U.S. must only check a box on a voter-registration form to say they are citizens. The lawsuit said the system is unconstitutional because it treats one group of citizens differently from others. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice are among the groups representing the plaintiffs. The Lawyers’ Committee said in a news release that Mississippi is the only state that requires naturalized citizens to prove citizenship before registering to vote. The lawsuit is filed against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, who is the state’s chief elections officer. Hosemann declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday, spokeswoman Anna Moak said."

Secure Energy said the landfill would operate safety within “stringent” regulations.

The others were built in Texas and Colorado. The Cullman pyramid has six tiers. Most feature traditional Christmas imagery such as the nativity, nutcrackers and Santa Claus, The Times reported.
