      "content": " INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 For the first time, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg\u00a0will\u00a0have a target on his back when he walks onto the debate stage Wednesday in Atlanta. Buttigieg has surged into the lead in recent polls in Iowa after hitting Sen. Elizabeth Warren hard on how she would pay for her massive\u00a0Medicare expansion. At the same time,\u00a0he's navigating troubling accusations in South Carolina that his campaign grossly overstated black support for his sweeping platform for African Americans. The three other frontrunners \u2014 Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 can no longer afford to mostly ignore him as little more than a smooth-talking Midwestern curiosity, pundits say.\u00a0And for the long term, if he emerges from the debate politically unscathed, he's going to have to find a way to convince voters of color that he has their backs. \"In the past debates, he's come out swinging and he's landed some punches,\" said\u00a0Chad Kinsella, assistant professor of political science at Ball State. \"As his popularity has grown, I don't think they're going to let him go. I think a couple of people will come after him and bring him back down to Earth.\" New frontrunner?\u00a0Buttigieg shoots to the top of the 2020 field in Iowa poll A campaign spokesman for Buttigieg declined to comment on debate strategy, other than to say the mayor will be prepared. Buttigieg's record on race clearly remains his greatest vulnerability.\u00a0When a white South Bend police officer shot a black man wielding a knife in June, the mayor's bumpy relationship with African Americans was exposed. Things haven't much improved. African Americans make up a significant portion of the Democratic base and as long as he's polling at near zero percent with black voters, his path to the nomination remains murky at best. He clearly\u00a0knows he has to make up ground, recently announcing a $2 million advertising purchase in South Carolina, where the campaign has been heavily promoting his Douglass Plan, named after\u00a0abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and where he remains\u00a0mired in fifth. Things are\u00a0not going well. Prominent African Americans in South Carolina are\u00a0accusing\u00a0his campaign of embellishing\u00a0black support for the\u00a0Douglass Plan. Their criticism stems from an open letter\u00a0published Nov. 15 in the HBCU Times,\u00a0purportedly written by 400 South Carolinian\u00a0supporters of the Douglass Plan, including several elected officials, pastors, business owners and students. \"Together, we endorse his Douglass Plan for Black America, the most comprehensive roadmap for tackling systemic racism offered by a 2020 presidential candidate,\u201d the letter states. The trouble started soon after publication. Several elected leaders denied they had endorsed the plan, according to The Intercept, a\u00a0digital news publication.\u00a0A review by the publication showed many of the 400 supporters were white and some lived out of state.\u00a0The Intercept also reported a woman in a photo used to promote the platform lives in Kenya, and had never heard of the plan. According to the campaign, some leaders withdrew previously made endorsements and their names were removed.\u00a0The list of 400 people was intended to show biracial support, the campaign said,\u00a0not just endorsements from African Americans. And the photo\u00a0is a stock image, the campaign said. \u201cOur campaign is working to build a multi-racial coalition, and we sought and received input from numerous black policy experts and advisers to create a comprehensive plan to dismantle systemic racism: the Douglass Plan,\" the campaign said in a prepared statement. \"We asked a number of black South Carolinians, as well as South Carolinians from many backgrounds, to support the Douglass Plan, and we are proud and grateful that hundreds agreed to do so.\" Buttigieg scored by hitting Warren on spending. But how will he pay for his own plans? Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics\u00a0at the University of Virginia, said the rollout has been sloppy but it's not a campaign killer. Still, he said Buttigieg will have to weather a barrage of criticism. The more important question, he thinks, is whether Buttigieg can win over voters of color. In addition to the polls of African Americans, Sabato referenced\u00a0a survey\u00a0in California where the mayor had little support among Latinos. \"He doesn't just have a black problem,\" Sabato said. \"He has a brown problem.\" At Wednesday's debate, Buttigieg's response to the controversy might reveal his strategy with African American voters moving forward. In the June debate, he took responsibility for the ongoing tensions between his police department and black citizens, saying, \"I couldn't get\u00a0it done.\" That moment aside, Buttigieg has had it pretty easy at the debates so far. He's taken on the frontrunners, made his points on policy, while easily swatting away\u00a0attacks from lower-tier candidates such as\u00a0Eric Swalwell,\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Beto O'Rourke and\u00a0Amy\u00a0Klobuchar. But Wednesday, pundits don't think\u00a0Warren and Sanders, in particular, can stay on the defensive as he continues to hammer away at their more progressive positions, most notably on health care. Elizabeth Bennion,\u00a0a politics professor at Indiana University-South Bend, said there's some risk that attacking Buttigieg could simply raise his profile even higher. But she thinks the frontrunners will want to slow down his rise heading into Iowa and New Hampshire. \"As Warren, Sanders, and Biden compete with Pete Buttigieg to win the first-in-the-nation caucus in Iowa, I expect that the three national frontrunners will be more forceful in drawing distinctions between themselves and Mayor Pete,\" she said.\u00a0\"The candidates head into the November debate with many Iowa, and national, voters undecided.\" Biden might be the least likely to target Buttigieg. In fact, pundits think the former vice president would prefer Buttigieg win Iowa over Warren, who had been leading. Biden's support among African Americans remains strong, positioning him for a comeback in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, when several southern states vote. From that perspective, Warren is Biden's more significant long-term threat. Then again, Biden might be tired of Buttigieg's strategy to replace him as the moderate candidate. \"Somebody will go after Buttigieg,\" Sabato said. \"I don't know which one, maybe all of them. Warren seems the most anxious to do so.\" Warren and Buttigieg have clashed on Medicare for All. She released a $20.5 trillion funding proposal after Buttigieg and others criticized the lack of details in her proposed expansion. Meanwhile, progressive groups have dismissed Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It counterproposal as not bold enough. There's cause to think Buttigieg would win that fight. Sabato said he recently commissioned a study that showed Medicare for All was a loser among voters in Congressional races in 2018. Warren notably didn't talk much about her plan to expand Medicare at a recent trip through Iowa, which might be a sign she knows it's troubling for some Democrats. Unions, in particular, remain a strong force in the Democratic base, and they fought for health-care benefits as part of their salaries. Progressive groups have taken another tactic that might foreshadow what happens at the debate. Pointing to past tweets and statements, they accuse\u00a0Buttigieg of\u00a0flip flopping, once supporting but now opposing Medicare for All. While Buttigieg's campaign pushes\u00a0back on that, being saddled with the flip-flopper moniker has hurt others, perhaps most notably\u00a0Al Gore\u00a0in 2000. It's also possible Biden, Sanders and Warren continue to ignore Buttigieg, for the most part. If that happens, Sabato said\u00a0it's a sure sign that their internal information says he's still not much of a threat beyond Iowa. If that's the case, Buttigieg\u00a0might be positioned to continue to attack the leaders while fending off the rest of the field. And be sure, the rest of the field is likely to continue to target him. \"We'll have to see what their internal calculations are,\" Sabato said of the frontrunners. \"For the second-tier candidates, there is a lot of jealously and resentment of Buttigieg. They\u00a0see him as arrogant and inexperienced.\" In that scenario, his biggest vulnerability remains his first:\u00a0He remains the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend.

      "content": "  Sponsored by Throne DURHAM, N.H.\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Ashlyn Giroux and Phoebe Mulry held signs on stage\u00a0for Bernie Sanders\u00a0when the U.S.\u00a0senator from Vermont had\u00a0a rally here in September. But in between classes at the University of New Hampshire\u00a0Wednesday, the two freshmen made their way to hear Sen. Elizabeth Warren speak on campus.\u00a0Both said they've donated $5 to Warren's presidential campaign, although only Mulry has fully\u00a0committed to backing the Massachusetts Democrat in the primary. Both\u00a0plan to get more active ahead of voting. \"Elizabeth Warren is my candidate,\" Mulry said, explaining\u00a0that she donated to the campaign after a discussion\u00a0in her\u00a0government class about mobilizing the electorate.\u00a0\"I wanted to feel like I was a part of her campaign.\" One year out from the 2020 presidential election, and less than 100 days\u00a0before the first votes are counted in the Iowa caucuses, Democrats are working\u00a0to energize one of their biggest strengths\u00a0\u2013\u00a0young voters. It's not just a short game\u00a0for Democrats seeking the party's nomination. Democrats, from county organizers to national party leadership,\u00a0are looking\u00a0to build on last year's momentum to defeat\u00a0President Donald Trump in the general election. In the 2018 midterms, turnout among\u00a0voters ages 18 to 29 more than doubled from 2014, and they overwhelmingly backed Democrats. Like past cycles,\u00a0students are\u00a0coordinating with campaigns and enlisting supporters.\u00a0College Democrat\u00a0groups, especially those in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, are hosting town halls and meet-and-greets with presidential hopefuls. Democrats are also training students to caucus and register first-time voters. But\u00a0those\u00a0efforts also come as political activism among\u00a0young liberals is already heightened \u2013 on\u00a0display in 2018 and\u00a0again this summer, when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets\u00a0across the U.S. demanding\u00a0action on climate change. Neither\u00a0Murly nor Giroux, both 18, were old enough to vote in 2016.\u00a0Giroux said she's still split between Sanders and Warren, calling the other Democrats in the field \"very in the middle, and I'm way more far left.\" Mulry said young progressives are\u00a0motivated because of the\u00a0\"severity\" of what's at stake in 2020. Carolyn DeWitt,\u00a0president and executive director of Rock the Vote, said young voters have \"incredible power\" to determine the direction of the country, noting nearly 40% of the electorate in 2020 will be millennial or Generation Z voters.\u00a0Rock the Vote, a nonpartisan nonprofit,\u00a0has\u00a0worked for three decades\u00a0to register young voters, inform them of the voting process and increase their participation. \"If young people, young adults, turn out to vote, it's kind of a game-over situation,\" DeWitt said. \"They can dominate and determine pretty much everything. The record-breaking numbers we saw last year, I expect that we will continue to see those next year, (but) there is a lot of work that we need to do.\" More:Young Iowa Democrats, coming of age in the Trump era, approach 2020 caucuses with new urgency With\u00a0progressive causes such as gun control and\u00a0climate change bringing louder battle cries from young voters,\u00a0and\u00a0competitive races in traditionally conservative states like Texas and Georgia,\u00a028.2% of eligible youth voters\u00a0went to the polls in 2018. That's compared with 13% of eligible young voters who voted\u00a0in the 2014 midterms, according to research from the nonpartisan Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement\u00a0(CIRCLE) at the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. Voters 30 and\u00a0older increased their turnout as well, but only by 10 percentage points. Democratic congressional candidates won 67% of voters ages 18 to 29 in 2018\u00a0\u2013 a greater than 2-to-1 margin than the\u00a032% of young people who voted for Republicans. It marked the largest share of the youth vote won by Democrats\u00a0in recent political history, surpassing even the margins under\u00a0President Barack Obama, when Democratic congressional candidates\u00a0won\u00a060% of the youth vote in 2008 and 2012. Obama won 66% of young voters in 2008. \"Things have really shifted, and there's no sign of slowing that down right now that I can tell,\" said\u00a0Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of CIRCLE. She said it's not simply a backlash against Trump. Rather, issues like racial equity, climate change and gun control have attracted young people, who tend to be more diverse, to Democrats. \"There's a definite, explicit statement from young people that they need leaders that will support their priorities.\" At a recent Cory Booker meet-and-greet\u00a0in Washington, D.C., Madeline Sweitzer, 24, called 2020\u00a0\"probably the most important presidential election of our lifetime.\"\u00a0The\u00a0nonprofit worker, who is leaning toward supporting\u00a0Warren,\u00a0said her vote is less\u00a0about partisanship for a Democrat and more about removing a president she believes has pushed policies that hurt\u00a0working people. \"When I vote, I guess I'm not just voting for a Democrat, I'm voting for someone that I think would actually help people and make their lives better,\" Sweitzer said. Kawashima-Ginsberg\u00a0said registration of first-time young voters before 2020 is already one\u00a0year ahead of a typical cycle, a strong indicator they are already receiving\u00a0contact from campaigns and advocacy groups. \"No\u00a0question,\" she said,\u00a0youth turnout will\u00a0increase from 2016, when 46% of eligible voters 18 to 29 voted,\u00a0according to the U.S. Census. In the 2016 presidential election, voters 18 to 29 years were the only age group to increase\u00a0their voting rate from 2012, with a bounce of 1.1%t, according to Census figures. But Hillary Clinton received a smaller share of the youth vote than Obama.\u00a0Although she won 55% of the youth vote, topping Trump's 40%, it was a 5-point drop from Obama's level in 2012 and an 11-point drop from 2008. To\u00a0have success against Trump\u00a0in 2020, some\u00a0Democrats say it's\u00a0critical to turn that trend around. The caveat: Young people, who historically don't vote at the same levels as older\u00a0age groups,remained underrepresented in the 2018 midterms.\u00a0Despite the gains, young people accounted for just 11% of the overall vote, even though they accounted for 21% of all eligible voters and 18% of registered voters. But young voters made up significant ground. Their share of\u00a0overall votes cast increased\u00a0by 4 percentage points from 2014, while it decreased by 4 percentage points among voters 30 and older. It\u00a0means young people had greater influence as a voting bloc\u00a0than past elections, and their influence will\u00a0expand further\u00a0in 2020 if that pattern holds. \"If we can stay on this trajectory, and use due diligence in supporting young voters and growing\u00a0voters,\u00a0I think they will be pivotal,\" Kawashima-Ginsberg said. \"There's no question about that. I think they will decide the race, starting in the primary.\" Youth turnout in 2018, according to CIRCLE, increased by more than 20 percentage points from 2014 in four states:\u00a0New Jersey,\u00a0California,\u00a0Virginia\u00a0and Minnesota. The states with the highest youth turnout in 2018 among youth were Minnesota (43.7%), Montana (42.7%), Colorado (40.8%)\u00a0and Oregon (39.2). Most of these states are considered safe or leaning for Democrats\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0Only\u00a0Montana voted for Trump in 2016, although the Trump campaign has targeted Minnesota as a state to\u00a0pick up. Erin Perrine, deputy communications director for Trump's reelection campaign, said the president is\u00a0\"energizing and engaging voters of all ages, and will do so well past 2020\" when asked about the surge of young people who voted for Democrats in the midterms. \"His common-sense policies coupled with a booming economy has benefited all Americans \u2013 whether you are a college graduate entering the workforce or a retiree whose\u00a0prescription drug prices have been lowered, this administration has delivered.\" She added: \"We will not only expand on the 2016 electoral map, but we will also increase support across demographics.\" Coura Fall, a 19-year-old from American University in Washington, D.C., who supports Warren, was among the new voters who cast her first ballot\u00a0in the 2018 midterms. She will be voting absentee next year in\u00a0Rhode\u00a0Island.\u00a0The daughter of undocumented immigrants from Senegal, Fall\u00a0said Trump's election was a \"rude awakening\" for young people who thought they were \"living in a post-racial society and everything was going to be great.\" \"I just feel like the power to vote is just so important and so massive,\" Fall said,\u00a0\"and it seems so simple, but like, you literally get to shape your government to what you want it to be, and that's why I take it so seriously.\" Marissa Soltoff, a 22-year-old\u00a0recent\u00a0graduate of\u00a0George Washington University, said she supported Sanders in\u00a0the 2016 primary and almost cried at Clinton being the nominee but voted for her anyway. This year she's deciding between Sanders, Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Kamala Harris. \u201cBernie is the OG,\u201d Soltoff said, adding that she likes candidates who are \u201cnot just playing into the establishment that we currently have.\u201d She said each is \"actually fighting for and advocating for real change that\u2019s actually going to benefit people rather than just the party establishment.\" Warren, Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are among campaigns\u00a0that have national directors devoted solely to the youth vote.\u00a0Several campaigns\u00a0have\u00a0paid staffers in early primary states devoted to student organizers and college outreach. Each touts canvassing\u00a0efforts aimed at young voters. Buttigieg, 37,\u00a0the youngest candidate in the race, has adopted the tagline a\u00a0\"new generation of American leadership.\" His campaign credits a CNN town hall performance earlier this year for spawning a \"Students for Pete\" across the country. The Sanders campaign held an online \"summer school\"\u00a0for more than 1,500 students at\u00a0627 colleges and community colleges. It was billed as a two-week crash course on political organizing. Similarly, former Vice President Joe Biden has a Team Joe Organizing Fellowship, an eight-week online program aimed at teaching \"the ins-and-outs of grassroots organizing.\" Warren held a conference call with organizers to kick off \"Students With Warren,\" which includes students at high schools, community colleges, universities and graduate schools. \u201cThis is our moment to dream big, fight hard and win,\u201d Warren told the crowd at last week's University of New Hampshire town hall. She opened her remarks with a nod to young voters,\u00a0blasting a new New Hampshire state law, backed by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, that created tougher voting restrictions. Critics have said it will make it more difficult for out-of-state college\u00a0students to vote. \"I want to say something that I know is very controversial in some places in New Hampshire, like maybe the governor's office. I believe in the right of every American citizen to vote, including college students.\" In the 2016 Democratic primary, Sanders used a wave of support among youth voters to carry his bid\u00a0against Clinton. But this time around,\u00a0support among young voters is more split in the primary, particularly with Warren,\u00a0polling has shown.\u00a0Both have pushed socially and economically\u00a0liberal\u00a0messages that include eliminating student debt and free college tuition. A generational divide dominates Democratic voters, a new New York Times/Siena College poll of Iowa Democrats found, with more than 85% of voters younger than 30 saying they prefer a candidate promising fundamental change. Seventy percent of voters older than 65 said they want a candidate who will return Washington to normalcy. It helps explain the popularity of Sanders and Warren among young people, whose economic populist messages have also raised questions about their electability in a one-on-one matchup against Trump. Joe Calvello, a campaign spokesman for the Sanders campaign, said young people have \"experienced the failures of the current system.\" He said they are \"shackled by student debt, are on track for a lower standard of living than their parents\" and \"know better than anyone how much is at stake in 2020.\" \"We need to nominate a candidate for president that will inspire millions upon millions of young people to be engaged in the political process for the first time, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that will do that.\u201d Marisol Samayoa, Buttigieg's deputy national press secretary, said \"a real crisis\" faces young people with issues like climate change and voting rights. She said that's why young people are responding to Buttigieg's \"platform of structural and generational change.\" \"Young voters are done waiting for Washington to act on these issues and Pete\u2019s the only candidate ready to meet these challenges with the urgency it requires,\" she said. A Quinnipiac University national poll in October found that 31% of Democratic voters ages 18 to 34 support Sanders while 30% back Warren. Third among young voters in the poll was Buttigieg at 12%. Biden was at 6% in the 18-34 category, tied\u00a0with Harris. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll found Sanders also leading voters ages 18-34\u00a0with 23%, but Biden faring much better, tied with Warren with young voters at\u00a019%. But the New York Times/Siena College poll painted a troubling picture for Biden in Iowa, including\u00a0less support among voters 45 or younger than Andrew Yang. Biden, who\u00a0tops his peers significantly in support of people over the age of 65,\u00a0pushed back\u00a0when asked about his lagging support among youth voters during an interview on \"60 Minutes.\" Some progressive Democrats have warned a Biden nomination would not excite young people like other candidates would. \"The fact of the matter is, if you take a look at who votes in these primaries, overwhelmingly people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,\" Biden said in the interview.\u00a0He added that he wants people engaged and voting, but criticized proposals such as Medicare for All as relying on \"far-reaching assertions\" that can't deliver true change. Pete Kavanaugh, Biden's\u00a0deputy campaign manager, said the campaign is going to compete for every vote and takes youth organizing \"very seriously.\" \"Are there going to be some variants in polling across ages and demographics?\" Kavanaugh said. \"Sure, but I think we are making very concerted efforts to reach out to younger voters and I think we're beginning to see the fruits of that labor, especially when we're able to engage with students in a one-on-one setting.\" Reach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards won a second term Saturday despite an all-out effort by President Donald Trump to flip the seat to the Republican column.\u00a0Edwards narrowly beat wealthy Republican businessman Eddie Rispone, who invested more than $14 million of his own money to finance his campaign\u00a0and tied himself to Trump from start to finish.\u00a0Trump headlined three Louisiana rallies to oust Edwards, telling\u00a0Louisiana voters the race was a symbolic referendum on his presidency. But in the end, Trump\u2019s coattails weren\u2019t long enough to carry Rispone across the finish line. As a Democrat, Edwards is\u00a0an anomaly both in the South and in Louisiana as he is the only Democrat to hold statewide office. There was a hitch in\u00a0Colin Kaepernick's planned NFL workout\u00a0Saturday in Atlanta.\u00a0The showcase for the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback\u00a0moved from the original location at the Atlanta Falcons' practice facility after Kaepernick and his representatives said\u00a0the NFL's process was not \"legitimate.\" They said their desire for\u00a0a \"transparent and open process\" was\u00a0the reason behind the change.\u00a0The NFL said in a statement Saturday that Kaepernick informed the league he wasn't attending the workout a half hour before the scheduled start time, the same time his representatives alerted the public. The workout,\u00a0attended by at least a few NFL scouts, was\u00a0streamed live. Kaepernick has not appeared in an NFL game since 2016. Pete Buttigieg\u00a0has rocketed to the top\u00a0in the latest reshuffling of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll.\u00a0Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Des Moines Register\u2019s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend mayor.Biden, Warren and now Buttigieg have all taken turns atop the poll, with Sanders consistently in the top four. Hong Kong students armed with bows and arrows battled police firing tear gas and blasting water cannons\u00a0as escalating violence\u00a0paralyzed the educational system of the beleaguered semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\u00a0Late Sunday,\u00a0police used loudspeakers to order the evacuation of Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\u00a0Many protesters stayed behind, some setting fires to block the advance of riot police.\u00a0Police said dozens had been arrested.\u00a0The protest was the final holdout from a series of demonstrations that shut down several major universities last week. The conflict stems from a government extradition proposal earlier this year that would have allowed suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China, which was later withdrawn. As investigators continue to search for a motive behind the deadly shooting at a Southern California high school Thursday morning, the community of Santa Clarita is coming together to remember the children it lost.\u00a0Dominic Michael Blackwell, 14, and Gracie Anne Muehlberger, 15, died Thursday when another student opened fire at Saugus High School, injuring three others. The 16-year-old suspect, who shot himself, died Friday night. GoFundMe pages that appeared to be created by family members of the two students killed had each raised tens of thousands of dollars by Saturday. On Friday, the city of Santa Clarita launched a Saugus Strong website, which provides the community resources and encourages viewers worldwide to submit messages of love and support. By Saturday morning, the website had received more than 200 messages from across six continents. A vigil, \"Saugus Strong,\" is scheduled for 7 p.m. PT Sunday. Contributing: Associated Press",

      "content": " OK, but who can win? In a marathon day, congressional Democrats\u00a0led explosive hearings to consider\u00a0whether the House should impeach President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 with almost no expectation that the Republican-controlled Senate would then vote to remove him from office. During a slow-starting Democratic debate in the evening, 10 presidential hopefuls finally got animated when they argued about how they would defeat Trump\u00a0\u2014 amid nervousness among many in the party that they could hand the president a second term by making the wrong choice. \"The issue isn't what is the fight; the issue is, how are we going to win?\" Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, suggesting that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, wouldn't be able to generate strong turnout among\u00a0African Americans, the party's most loyal voters. \"We have to rebuild the Obama coalition.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg's tenure as mayor of a small, Democratic-leaning city meant he could win in red and purple districts, as she has in Minnesota. \"He said the right words, but I have the experience,\" she said.\u00a0\"I think experience should matter.\" Buttigieg was ready for that charge. \"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small,\" he said. \"But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.\"\u00a0The focus on Buttigieg reflected his remarkable rise to the front\u00a0of the field in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire since the last debate,\u00a0in October. That made him a target. 'I thought you might have been high':Quips from candidates and other top moments from the November Democratic debate But the tone of the debate, sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post,\u00a0was largely civil, and the candidates'\u00a0efforts to draw sharp distinctions with one another more subdued than in previous forums. That may have reflected the sobering effect of the impeachment hearings, which have convinced many Democrats of two things: that Trump committed impeachable offenses, and impeachment is not likely to remove him from office. That is more likely to depend on the 2020 election. The evening was an object lesson in the way Trump and the impeachment debate are defining the moment, a reality likely to continue through the end of this year and into the\u00a0next. The House investigation of the president, and the Senate trial that would follow passage of Articles of Impeachment, are\u00a0taking the spotlight from and heightening the stakes for the Democrats who want to succeed him. All that has overshadowed the ideological divides in the sprawling field. Perhaps most notably,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorse Medicare for All, a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system that former Vice President Joe Biden called too radical to sell to swing voters or pass in Congress. But Democratic voters say their top concern isn't policy; it's\u00a0politics. In poll after poll, most say they care more about nominating a candidate who can win than they do about nominating one who agrees with them on issues. Scorecard:Here are the winners and losers from the Democratic debate On that front, there were some disquieting signs for Democrats in surveys released Wednesday before the debate.\u00a0A Marquette University Law School Poll\u00a0showed Trump for the first time surging ahead of the top four\u00a0Democrats in hypothetical head-to-head matchups in the crucial state of Wisconsin. And the Gallup Poll\u00a0showed Trump's national approval rating actually ticked up a bit as the impeachment hearings began, albeit to an anemic 43%. At the debate, Biden\u00a0argued he could not only win back the White House, but also help win back a Democratic majority in the Senate to make it possible to get things done. He noted his strong support among African Americans, though he stumbled in saying he has\u00a0been endorsed by \"the only black woman elected to the United States Senate.\" That was news to Harris, who is black. \"I'm right here!\" she interjected to laughter. Biden corrected himself, saying he had been endorsed by the first black woman elected to the Senate:\u00a0former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois. It was an unwelcome reminder of his tendency to stumble verbally. November debate:Donald Trump and allies attack Democratic candidates over impeachment drive The forum in Atlanta\u00a0opened about an hour\u00a0after the House Intelligence Committee concluded an impeachment hearing at which\u00a0Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor-turned-diplomat, testified\u00a0there had been a quid pro quo \u2014\u00a0a demand by the Trump team that nearly $400 million in military aid wouldn't be released until Ukraine announced investigations into unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden, the frontrunner, tried to spin even that\u00a0as a sign of his strength.\u00a0\"I learned that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee, that's pretty clear,\" he said. The presidential hopefuls fielded questions on addressing climate change, providing paid child care, protecting abortion rights, dealing with North Korea. But in a sign of how difficult it may be to command attention on the campaign trail while the impeachment proceedings continue on Capitol Hill,\u00a0the discussions seemed a little flat compared to the bombshells that had exploded during the day's hearings. Because the real question for Democrats is: Who can win?",

      "content": " Sponsored by Throne Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered to meet with Microsoft founder Bill Gates after he joked that her proposed wealth tax might cost him $100 billion. Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Conference on Wednesday, Gates said that he's open to higher wealth taxes: \"I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. I'm glad to have paid\u2014if I'd had to pay $20 billion, that's fine.\" \"But when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK,\u00a0then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over,\" Gates said. \"Sorry, I'm just kidding.\" Gates also said he wasn't sure Warren would be open to \"sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money\" to discuss policy ideas. Warren responded in a tweet Thursday, saying, \"I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.)\" In the plan Warren released last week to pay for her proposed Medicare for All plan, she outlines a tax on billionaires of 6% net worth above $1 billion. More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Gates' net worth is estimated by Forbes to be nearly $107 billion. The Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Gates how he felt about that plan, and estimated it would add $6 billion to what Gates already pays in taxes. \"I'm all for super progressive tax systems,\" Gates said, but he added later that, \"I'd love somebody to find a middle ground approach,\" and said that taxing too much could harm the idea that the United States is a good place to \"do innovative companies.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another candidate running for president with a Medicare for All plan, also weighed in. \"Say Bill Gates was actually taxed $100 billion,\" Sanders tweeted on Thursday. \"We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country.\" \"Bill would still be a multibillionaire,\" Sanders continued. Sanders has come under scrutiny for saying he believes billionaires should not exist in America. 2020 candidate Tom Steyer,\u00a0a billionaire himself, also sent a message to Gates on Twitter: \"a wealth tax is the right thing to do. Don\u2019t panic - you\u2019ll be alright.\" Asked if he would vote for Warren if she were the Democratic nominee facing off against President Donald Trump, Gates declined to answer. \"I'm not going to make political declarations, but I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach...\u00a0I would weight the most,\" Gates said.

      "content": " CEDAR FALLS, Ia. \u2014 When the first notes of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" started playing over the sound system at\u00a0a cattle call of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates this summer, the crowd roared. The pounding keyboard riff\u00a0signified to those in the audience\u00a0that Sen. Elizabeth Warren was ready to take the stage. Unlike the other candidates before her, people\u00a0didn't need to wait until Warren's name was announced to know who was up next. Her campaign speech at the Democratic Wing Ding fundraiser\u00a0didn't break new ground from the stumps she's\u00a0given throughout Iowa since announcing her presidential campaign in January. Instead, what\u00a0sets Warren\u00a0apart from the more than a dozen\u00a0other Democratic presidential candidates traipsing across Iowa is the\u00a0systematic approach she's taken with her\u00a0campaign.\u00a0From her opening song \u2014 which channels themes of class, politics and populism \u2014 to the \"selfie\" lines and the \"2\u00a0cents\"\u00a0chants that ripple through crowds,\u00a0Warren employs\u00a0a methodical approach to events and organizing that has coincided with a steady rise in the polls. \"There's a culture that other campaigns don't have,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. In addition, Warren has built a highly visible ground team that has made itself known to Iowa politicos as it canvasses cities and organizes caucus leaders.\u00a0It's that robust organizational presence that could explain, in part, her rise in the\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Iowa Democrats have said. In\u00a0September,\u00a022%\u00a0of likely Democratic caucusgoers said Warren was their first choice for president, compared with 20% for former vice president Joe Biden and 11% for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. No other candidate reached\u00a0double digits. Warren said her Iowa strategy was born out of the decision to run a grassroots campaign. Instead of holding private fundraisers, she decided to spend time on the ground and in town halls, she said. \"(I decided) I was going to take the money that came in and put it right back into organizing and to hiring a paid organizing staff so that volunteers have a place to go, so they have a way to get connected. And it's worked,\" Warren told the Des Moines Register before a town hall in Cedar Falls recently. \"My job, mostly, has just been I'll show up and do the town halls and say to my Iowa team, 'Go get 'em.'\" Here's a look at some of the Warren-specific aspects of\u00a0the campaign: The senator from Massachusetts\u00a0spends about 30 to 45 minutes at each Iowa event outlining the reasons she's running for president:\u00a0To make government work for the working class, not the rich and powerful. To overhaul America's tax system.\u00a0To get corruption out of politics. But before she\u00a0takes the stage, whoever introduces her makes a promise: Every person who wants a photo with the senator will get a photo. And at every campaign stop in Iowa, she\u00a0stays until the last person in line gets their shot. The \"selfie line\"\u00a0\u2014 this is Warren's phrasing, though it's actually a photo taken by another human, therefore, not a selfie \u2014 is highly organized. More:'That's what girls do': Elizabeth Warren tells young Iowa girls why she's running for president, with a pinky promise At least eight staffers or volunteers usher people through the line.\u00a0Each interaction takes less than 10 seconds, but can have a lasting impact on the candidate's supporters. \"You don't have to hustle and bustle and try to elbow your way through a crowd to have a moment to ask a question or a moment to get a photo,\" said Michelle Mouton, a professor at Cornell College at a Warren house party in\u00a0Mount Vernon. Mouton, who has yet to decide for whom she'll caucus\u00a0in February,\u00a0posted her photo with Warren on Facebook. She, like others before her and others after her, also asked the senator a question. It's in these selfie lines where Warren says she's able to connect with her supporters in a different way than\u00a0her competitors do. \"For me, you know, because I do the selfie lines, it's often the people who come through and get to say just to me, 'Here's what I want you to hear,'\" Warren said. Earlier that week, in Indianola, Warren said a\u00a0couple explained to her they had amassed $100,000 in medical bills when he developed an aneurysm and she was diagnosed with cancer, even though they had \"gold-plated\" health insurance. They asked her to keep fighting for \"Medicare for All,\" she said. \"It's a lot of individual stories I get to hear,\" Warren said. Her campaign team estimates she's taken more than 10,000 selfies in Iowa. What started at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair has now become a rally cry from supporters at Warren's events. Since then, nearly every Iowa crowd erupts into a chant of \"2\u00a0cents! 2\u00a0cents!\"\u00a0when the candidate explains her \"ultra-millionaires\" tax and what\u00a0it can pay for. \"All we're saying is, when you make it to the top, pitch in 2\u00a0cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it in America,\" she says, before the chant starts its ripple. Her plan, which would impose a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, would fund universal child care and pre-kindergarten, provide tuition-free college, invest $50 billion into historically black colleges, and\u00a0cancel\u00a0student loan debt\u00a0for an estimated 42 million people, she says. \"2 cents! 2 cents!\" with an image of Warren on two pennies is now a\u00a0Raygun T-shirt. The shirt comes\u00a0in the campaign's signature\u00a0\"liberty green\" after an Iowa organizer requested it and\u00a0tweeted the company the color code. Two organizers regularly appear at events wearing cardboard pennies. A 25-foot inflatable dog, a\u00a0likeness inspired by\u00a0the senator's own pup, Bailey, wore two pennies on its collar at her rally before the Iowa Democratic Party's\u00a0Liberty and Justice Celebration\u00a0early this month. At every Iowa event, Warren says six words that have come to define her campaign: \"I've got a plan for that.\" The phrase encapsulates a key way she has\u00a0branded herself in this campaign \u2014 taking complicated policies and ideas and boiling them down into a form that is instantly recognizable. When Iowans across the state tell Warren about their struggles affording health care, paying student loan debt\u00a0or finding quality child care at a reasonable price, she replies with the catchphrase.\u00a0Then she\u00a0launches\u00a0into the systemic reason for the\u00a0problem, her plan to fix it, and how she will pay for it. Warren has created a policy-rich campaign focused on \"rewriting the basic rules\u00a0in our economy\" that\u00a0she says now favor\u00a0the wealthy and leaves behind working families. She has rolled out more policy proposals than any other presidential candidate in the 2020 cycle. Several Iowa Democrats have said Warren has built an Iowa team that has\u00a0the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state. It started when Warren announced a presidential exploratory committee. That same week, she\u00a0made her first trip to Iowa, announced she had\u00a0hired four of the state's top Democratic political operatives\u00a0and then quickly built\u00a0one of the state\u2019s largest organizing teams. \"If she ends up winning this, one of the factors very well may be that she took the time to recruit top talent and have that talent in place and focused on a plan before announcing,\" said\u00a0Matt Paul, a Des Moines operative who ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Iowa caucus campaign but does not have a favorite for\u00a02020. \"That continues to pay dividends.\" Bagniewski, the Polk County Democrats chair, said Warren's focus on\u00a0organization has continued in the 11 months since. The local party affiliate asked all Democratic campaigns\u00a0for help finding 40 precinct captains for caucus night. Warren's campaign was the only one to offer volunteers\u00a0\u2014 and her staff\u00a0found 20 people in fewer\u00a0than 48 hours, he said. \"Their organization is one of the best in the field, if not the best,\" he said. \"They're very conscientious and thoughtful on the way they give back to the party and their community.\" The campaign's\u00a0on-the-ground organizing\u00a0\u2014 canvassing every weekend, \"Pints and Policy\" discussions, game nights, a community garden and phone banking\u00a0\u2014 also caught the eye of Our Iowa Values, a\u00a0Republican-leaning Super PAC. \"Elizabeth Warren has earned her place in the polls,\"\u00a0the organization tweeted in August. \"Iowa Values has been running a massive field effort across Iowa since our launch and we have only run into canvassers from one campaign anywhere in the state \u2014 Warren for President.\" Her campaign focuses on organizing at major candidate events in Iowa, too. At the\u00a0Polk County Steak Fry, Warren's team turned the rally site outside the venue\u00a0into an \"organizing HQ,\"\u00a0where the\u00a0staff trained volunteers to canvass the crowds inside. Warren\u00a0volunteers bearing clipboards and trailing \u201cliberty green\u201d floating balloons fanned out across the massive event space.\u00a0(Sanders' campaign took a similar approach at that event, but knocked on area doors instead.) At the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration on Nov. 1, the campaign team participated early in the day in sign wars and loud chants. But it\u00a0also used the opportunity to host a caucus-night training for its supporters gathered from across the state. Warren made a surprise visit to thank\u00a0volunteers for knocking on doors, making phone calls and engaging people in conversation while in line at the grocery store. \"Every time you do that, you not only add to our campaign, you not only increase our chances that we win come November 2020\u00a0\u2014 you repair a little thread of democracy,\" she said. \"I'm so deeply proud of what we\u2019re doing together.\" Reporters Brianne Pfannenstiel and Anna Spoerre contributed to this story.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of\u00a0Connecticut was speaking about a push for universal background checks as news of the shooting\u00a0was breaking from the other side of the country at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita. \"We are complicit in these deaths if we fail to act,\" Blumenthal said as he read what was on the slip of paper.

How can we refuse to see that shooting in real time, demanding our attention, requiring our action?\" A gunman\u00a0opened fire on five other students\u00a0at the Los Angeles County high school, according to authorities, killing two and wounding four, including the suspected shooter. All the victims are between the ages of 14 and 16. Blumenthal and his fellow senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, had\u00a0been advocating on the floor for Republicans to take up gun control legislation for a vote.

      "content": "ATLANTA \u00a0\u2014 Ten Democratic presidential candidates have qualified for next Wednesday\u2019s debate in Georgia, giving voters a smaller lineup on stage to consider even as the party\u2019s overall field expands. The Democratic National Committee confirmed the lineup Thursday after reviewing polling and grassroots fundraising thresholds. Those on the stage will be: Former Obama administration housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro is the most high-profile remaining candidate to miss the cut. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas ended his campaign last month. Those two created headlines with their earlier debate performances, including some spirited exchanges with each other. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson already have missed debates as the party chairman, Tom Perez, continues to raise qualification requirements. More:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide This month, candidates were required to have reached 3% in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5% in two early nominating state polls since that date, while also having collected contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors, with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states. Some candidates have criticized Perez for the requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters other ways. Perez counters that candidates have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn\u2019t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Donald Trump. More:Still a chance? 2020 longshots insist race is up for grabs Perez already has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks: 4% in four national polls or 6% in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors with at least 800 each from 20 states. Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg \u2014 the four who top most national and early state polls \u2014 are not threatened by those goals. Harris and Klobuchar already have met them, as well. But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries. More:DNC: New December debate location will be Loyola Marymount\u00a0University Patrick has strong ties to Wall Street and deep-pocketed Democratic donors. Bloomberg is among the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals. Both may be able to afford television advertising and other campaign operations relatively quickly. But, as Perez has said throughout the process, party leaders consider debate slots not as rewards for the amount a campaign raises or spends, but as a recognition of how much support a candidate has attracted. Patrick seemed unconcerned Thursday in New Hampshire. \u201cAll of that is important,\u201d he told reporters in Manchester, \u201cbut I think I'm more interested in forums where you can actually engage with regular voters and not just ones where the moderator is tempted to treat it like a cage fight.\" Next week\u2019s debate will be broadcast on MSNBC from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EST.

      "content": " Both Republicans and Democrats \u00a0in Iowa say the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump will make it easier\u00a0for their party\u00a0to win the 2020 election, according to a Des Moines Register/CNN/ Mediacom Iowa Poll. Sixty percent\u00a0of registered Iowa Republicans who do not plan to attend the Democratic caucuses say the impeachment inquiry will make it easier for Trump to win reelection. Twenty-six percent\u00a0say it will make it harder for Trump to win, and 15% are unsure. Among likely Democratic caucusgoers, 45% say the impeachment inquiry will make it easier for a Democrat to win the election, compared with 24% who say the inquiry will make it\u00a0harder for the\u00a0Democratic nominee. Twelve percent say it will\u00a0make no difference, and 19% are unsure. Iowa Poll:President Trump's popularity sky high among registered Republicans The poll of 500 likely 2020 Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0and 502 registered Republicans who don't plan to participate in the Democratic caucuses was conducted Nov. 8-13 by Selzer and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points for each population. The polling came in the days before and during\u00a0the first public impeachment hearings before\u00a0members of\u00a0the U.S. House of Representatives. Those hearings\u00a0began Wednesday and have featured testimony from former U.S. diplomats stationed in Ukraine. A phone call\u00a0July 25 between Trump and\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked the inquiry. During the call,\u00a0Trump encouraged Zelensky\u00a0to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son\u00a0Hunter. Congressional Democrats say Trump\u2019s request and the temporary holdup of $400 million in military aid amounted to improperly directing U.S. foreign policy for his own political gain.\u00a0Congressional Republicans say that Trump did nothing wrong or that his actions did\u00a0not amount to an impeachable offense. Registered Iowa Republicans who responded to the poll\u00a0largely\u00a0agree with Republicans nationally who dismiss the validity of\u00a0the inquiry. In the poll, 72% of the Iowans say\u00a0Trump did not use his office improperly to gain political advantage against a potential opponent. Fourteen percent\u00a0say Trump acted improperly. \u201cPersonally, I think the whole basis for the impeachment is made up, and I think it\u2019s going to burn the Democrats,\u201d says Todd Shafer, 53, a\u00a0Republican poll respondent from Ankeny. Shafer, who works in the financial sector, says he believes Trump\u2019s actions were within the normal realm of foreign policy and the president was within his rights to ask the Ukrainians to address areas of concern before sending the country military aid. He says that Democrats are stretching to say Trump engaged in a quid pro quo and that the media aren\u2019t correcting the record. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to get a large percentage of voters that are going to vote for Trump because of the media,\u201d he says. More Iowa Poll: Among registered Republicans who say\u00a0they would\u00a0consider voting for someone other than Trump or would definitely vote for someone else \u2013 22% of the Republicans surveyed \u2013 47% say the president used his office improperly. Forty-six percent of\u00a0likely Democratic caucusgoers are paying very close attention to the impeachment inquiry, and 23% say they track events fairly closely. Ginny Ordman,\u00a064, a respondent and an Iowa City Democrat, watched\u00a0former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testify. She says having witnesses testify under oath and on camera bolsters the Democrats\u2019 case. \u201cI believe the public hearings are adding credibility to the impeachment investigation and showing exactly what happened, the facts,\u201d the retired high school teacher says. Ordman, who names Biden as her first choice for president, says\u00a0Republicans are trying to turn the public\u2019s attention away from Trump\u2019s behavior by calling for Hunter Biden to be investigated. \u201cI'm not worried because I think that was 100% President Trump's intent, to drag down the name and to look for anything with zero substance to support it,\" she says. \"I'm not going to let him get away with that. And I feel pretty bad for both Bidens for having their names dragged through the mud in this fashion when there's no evidence.\u201d A majority of Republicans say they follow the impeachment proceedings very closely (30%)\u00a0or fairly closely (25%). The Iowa Poll,\u00a0conducted Nov.\u00a08-13\u00a0for\u00a0The Des Moines Register,\u00a0CNN and Mediacom by Selzer of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 500 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses and 502 registered Republicans\u00a0who do not plan\u00a0to participate in the Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 2,012 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with \u00a0phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. For the registered Republican sample, responses for the 533 registered Republican contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active registered Republicans in the voter registration list. Questions based on the sample of 500 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, as does the sample of 502 registered Republicans. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2013 such as by gender or age \u2013 have a larger margin of error.

      "content": " The University of Florida's student body president is facing calls for impeachment after paying Donald Trump Jr. $50,000 in student tuition fees to speak on campus. Five student government senators allege\u00a0president Michael Murphy abused his power when he brought Trump Jr. to campus for a speaking engagement\u00a0last month. The impeachment\u00a0resolution was first obtained by the Tampa Bay Times. The senators argue that the university's student government policies prohibit using tuition funds \"in support of or against a political party at any level,\" according to the resolution. \"Mr. Murphy not only endangered students marginalized by the speakers' white nationalist supporters,\" the resolution says,\u00a0\"but also abused his power to advance a particular political party at the expense of the students he should represent.\" Murphy did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. The event, which drew hundreds of protesters, was framed by Murphy and event organizers to attendees\u00a0as a non-political speaking engagement. At the Oct. 10 event, Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly\u00a0Guilfoyle,\u00a0discussed immigration and unemployment rates, according to The Washington Post, which reported the event \"had the atmosphere of a (President) Trump campaign rally.\" 'You're getting a little hot on social':Donald Trump Jr. says dad told him to tone down tweets: Trump Jr.'s 'The View' stop:Joy Behar lists president's scandals, while Donald Trump Jr. hits back in heated exchange A month before Trump Jr.'s talk,\u00a0the Independent Florida Alligator \u2013\u00a0the University of Florida's student newspaper \u2013\u00a0published email exchanges between Murphy and Caroline Wren, the national financial consultant for President Trump's 2020 reelection committee, Trump Victory. In the emails, Wren inquired\u00a0about a speaking engagement for Trump Jr. on the University of Florida campus, noting that they had previously met at a Fourth of July party. The message was\u00a0sent from her work email, suggesting that it would be a campaign\u00a0event,\u00a0though she told the Tampa Bay Times that it was intended to be a personal message. Murphy responded a day later, writing that \"he'd love to hop on a call\" about the speaking engagement. Murphy confirmed the meeting to the Alligator\u00a0but emphasized that he also wanted to invite Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders in a non-political capacity. \u201cThe only difference (between inviting Trump Jr. and Sanders)\u00a0was Sen. Sanders\u2019 non-campaign staff declined our invitation to speak in his official capacity,\u201d Murphy wrote in an email to the Alligator. \u201cAny attempt to try and separate one from the other with allegations of impropriety is deceptive and inflammatory.\u201d Ben Lima, a senior at University of Florida and\u00a0one of the\u00a0senators taking the lead on\u00a0impeachment, told USA TODAY\u00a0Murphy \"has shown no remorse for spending $50,000 of student fees to enrich\" Trump Jr. and\u00a0Guilfoyle. \"This was an unethical and illegal expenditure made in collaboration with a Trump campaign official,\" he told USA TODAY. Murphy has also been scrutinized for his family's ties to the Republican party, according to the Times. His father, Dan, works as a lobbyist for the BGR Group and has donated $5,600 \u2013 the maximum amount an individual can donate per election cycle \u2013 to Trump's campaign in 2019. Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle are\u00a0currently on a book tour promoting \"Triggered:\u00a0How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,\" which included stops at UCLA, where an event was shut down by far-right protesters, and \"The View.\" The Florida event was not related to the book's promotion.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had bought into a \"conspiracy theory\" after the senator, a Democratic presidential candidate, accused The Post of anti-Sanders bias. \u201cSen. Sanders is a member of a large club of politicians \u2013 of every ideology \u2013 who complain about their coverage,\u201d Baron told The\u00a0Post in a statement. \u201cContrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest.\u201d At a Monday town hall in\u00a0Wolfeboro, N.H., Sanders suggested that some critical coverage of his campaign was linked to his own\u00a0criticism of Amazon, noting that Amazon paid little corporate tax last year. More:Bernie Sanders' unique plan to legalize marijuana \"Anybody here know how much Amazon paid in taxes last year?\" \"Nothing,\" shouted back the audience. \"I talk about that all of the time, and then I wonder why The Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, doesn't write particularly good articles about me. I don't know why, but I guess maybe there's a connection,\" said Sanders, to laughter from the audience. Jeff Bezos, the CEO and founder of Amazon, also owns The Washington Post, though the paper stresses its editorial independence and separate management. Sanders has been openly critical of Amazon for its labor and business practices. The company raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October 2018 after a backlash from Sanders and other progressive politicians. Sanders has also\u00a0called for the company to pay more in taxes\u00a0after reports alleged the company paid no federal income taxes in 2018. More:After Newtown, Pulse, Vegas caused little change, gun-control advocates hope latest shootings push significant gun laws More:Kamala Harris hits back at NRA after group criticizes her gun control proposals In July, The Post published a story about labor disputes on the Sanders campaign. The campaign's union had sparred with management as they formed a union, and some staff had complained to The Post about not being paid $15 an hour. Sanders later told\u00a0The Des Moines Register that he was \"disappointed\" in the campaign employees that had complained to the press about the campaign's labor disputes. \"It does bother me that people are going outside of the process and going to the media,\" he said at the time. \"That is really not acceptable. It is really not what labor negotiations are about, and it's improper.\" President Donald Trump has echoed similar criticism of The Post, using the hashtag #AmazonWashingtonPost in tweets and accusing the newspaper of furthering Amazon's corporate goals.",

Biden received\u00a020% of support from New Hampshire's likely Democratic primary voters. Following behind were\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 16%, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg bringing in 15%, and Sen. Bernie Sanders received 14%. Those numbers reflect the same\u00a0top tier of candidates that are also shown in several recent Iowa polls, including a USA TODAY/ Suffolk University\u00a0poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said, \"New Hampshire has mountains. Iowa has plains. They couldn't be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier. Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it's far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs.\" The poll reflected there\u00a0could be some fluctuation within the state as 61% of voters said they could change their mind before the primary, and 14%\u00a0said they\u2019re completely undecided at the moment. Sanders' base reflected as the most enthusiastic and loyal within the state with 57%\u00a0of backers claiming their minds are made up. Biden followed\u00a0at 43%, and Warren at 29%. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0received 6% in the poll. She is now one poll away from the December Democratic debate\u00a0but needs to improve fundraising to qualify.\u00a0Most of her support in the poll comes from voters who describe themselves as conservative or independent. More:Still a chance? 2020 longshots insist race is up for grabs Businessman Andrew Yang has received\u00a0the fundraising needed for December\u2019s match-up and is now halfway through the polling threshold from making it to the December debate stage following this New Hampshire poll. All other candidates received 1% or less of support, including Sen. Kamala Harris, who\u00a0pulled staff out of the state last week to focus her campaign efforts in Iowa. About one-third of Democrats polled listed \"someone who can win the general election\" against President Donald Trump as the most important quality in\u00a0a candidate. Biden excelled in this area, receiving\u00a031%\u00a0of the vote among those who say that electability is a necessity for their candidate. Warren followed\u00a0at 20%, Buttigieg at 19%, and while Sanders only received 6%. Additionally, pollsters\u00a0asked\u00a0New Hampshirans about their probability of voting for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg after\u00a0he\u00a0recently opened the door to join the crowded primary field. Only 2% said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg, 37% said they would consider voting, while a whopping 54% say they definitely would not vote for him. Opinion:\u00a0Bloomberg + Sanders + Biden + Trump + Warren = 374. What's wrong with this 2020 picture? Healthcare came in as the most important issue to voters at 28%. Following closely behind was climate change at 25%, and then the economy at 12%. The poll\u00a0was conducted from November 6th to the 10th, and\u00a0surveyed 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of\u00a03.8 percentage points,according to Quinnipiac.

      "author": "",
      "content": "According to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, \"Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history.\" No matter your political preference, there's no denying Sanders' statement. Since payouts began in 1940, Social Security has been providing a financial foundation for tens of millions of Americans, many of whom are retired workers. As of today, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, it's a program that singlehandedly keeps more than 22 million people out of poverty, including 15.3 million retired workers. Aside from being a financial lifeline, it's also a highly misunderstood program, with a number of myths and misconceptions taking on a life of their own, especially following the advent of social media. Below, you'll find three facts about Social Security that you might find hard to believe, but I can assure you are 100% true. Bernie Sanders:We should expand Social Security Chances are that you've heard the Social Security program is in some pretty big trouble and facing a large cash shortfall over the next 75 years. The latest Social Security Board of Trustees report, released in April, pointed to a $13.9 trillion cash shortfall between 2035 and 2093 that, if not resolved with added revenue, lower expenditures, or some combination of the two, could lead to an up to 23% reduction in benefits for retired workers beginning in 2035. The big sticking point of the Trustees report is the projected depletion of the program's asset reserves \u2013 i.e., the net-cash surpluses that the program has saved up since its inception. Beginning in 2020, Social Security will expend more than it collects, thereby shrinking its $2.9 trillion in asset reserves. There's a widely held belief that once this excess capital is gone, Social Security is going to go bankrupt. In other words: Sorry, millennials, no soup for you! Bad news:The average millennial's net worth is shockingly low But this couldn't be further from the truth. The Social Security program is designed in such a way that it can never go bankrupt. And that's not exaggeration \u2013 I literally mean never. With the exception of Congress altering how the program is funded, there's absolutely zero chance of the program going belly up as it's designed now. The reason it can't go bankrupt is because Social Security has two built-in sources of recurring revenue: the 12.4% payroll tax on earned income (wages and salary, but not investment income) up to $132,900 in 2019, and the taxation of Social Security benefits for certain income thresholds. Pretty much as long as the American public keeps working, revenue will keep flowing into the Social Security program that can then be disbursed to eligible beneficiaries. What is possible, though, are future cuts to benefits, as noted in the latest Trustees report. If the revenue collected over time is insufficient to meet the existing payout schedule, then benefit cuts could be passed along to all beneficiaries in order to make ends meet. So, yes, your Social Security payout could shrink in the future, as well as struggle to keep up with inflation. But as long as you've met the requirements to receive a retired worker benefit, there's a 100% chance (again, barring congressional changes to how the program is funded) that you'll receive a payout during retirement. Economy:The economy is strong, but doing little to bolster President Trump's support Another common thought with the Social Security program is that it would be in considerably better shape if payments weren't being made to people who never contributed to it. Namely, critics point to illegal immigrants, who they surmise are reaping the rewards of Social Security payouts and further straining the program. But, like the idea of Social Security going bankrupt, this belief\u00a0is completely false. Maybe one of the most important things to know about Social Security is just how crucial legal immigration is to its success. Most legal immigrants to this country tend to be young, meaning they'll wind up working in the labor force for decades to come, thereby contributing to payroll tax revenue. By the time they retire, it's likely they, too, will have earned more than enough lifetime work credits to receive a Social Security retired worker benefit. On the other hand, undocumented workers aren't able to receive a Social Security benefit, period. Since undocumented workers have no Social Security number, they have no pathway to accrue lifetime benefits, or be protected by Social Security's survivor benefits or long-term disability benefits. In short, they're not receiving a dime from the program, contrary to popular belief. Jobs:Teachers are 3 times more likely to need a second job to make ends meet What asylum-seekers and other immigrants may have access to is Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. Even though SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration, it's funded by the federal government's General Fund. Traditional Social Security is not. It generates revenue from the payroll tax, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and interest income on its asset reserves. Claiming that undocumented workers are getting SSI is not the same as receiving a traditional Social Security benefit, so make sure not to conflate the two. As it stands now, illegal immigrants are having absolutely no negative impact on Social Security. If you've ever read the comments section of Social Security article on social media, there's an almost 100% chance you've come across a reader who proclaimed that the program's cash shortfall was fully to blame on Congress, which raided the Trust Fund to pay for wars and never put any of the money back. These folks firmly believe that if Congress were to repay what they \"stole,\" with interest, the program would be solvent for a long time to come. Yet what might come as a surprise to many is the fact that Congress hasn't stolen anything from the Social Security's Trust Fund, and, best of all, the program is generating interest on Uncle Sam's dime. By law, Social Security's net-cash surpluses are required to be invested in special-issue government bonds, and to a far lesser extent certificates of indebtedness. These interest-bearing assets have varying maturity dates and interest rates, with the nearly $2.9 trillion in asset reserves today yielding more than 2.8% a year. In layman's terms, the federal government is borrowing (not to be confused with stealing or raiding) Social Security's excess cash, and currently paying the program more than $80 billion in interest each year in return. That works out to more than 8% of Social Security's annual income in 2018. Housing market:If you bought in San Fran 10 years ago, here\u2019s how much it could be worth now If you were to go to a bank and buy a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) with $5,000 that you had lying around in a savings account, the bank hasn't stolen or raided your money. It's very likely going to take your $5,000 and loan it out to someone else to make a profit, but your CD is going to earn you interest. In other words, the nature of the asset has changed, but it hasn't decreased in value. The same is true with Social Security's investment holdings. Just because the program has $2.89 trillion in bonds as opposed to cold, hard cash doesn't mean Congress has stolen a dime. Every cent is accounted for. Worse yet, if Congress were to pay the money back, Social Security would lose out on an estimated $800 billion-plus in interest income over the decade. To sum this point up: Congress hasn't stolen anything and is already paying interest to the program. Paying the money back would be the last thing we should hope Congress does.

      "content": " Sponsored by Throne Ten Democrats took the stage in Atlanta Wednesday for the fifth primary debate, featuring a fresh round of attacks on President Donald Trump amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry and public hearings. Candidates were asked right off the bat to weigh in on impeachment, and as in previous debates, discussion on top Democratic policy priorities was punctuated by candidates offering sharp criticisms of fellow rivals. Here are some of the top moments from the debate: The debate stage was set shortly after the closing of a full day of impeachment testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and moderators asked the candidates to dive in on the topic. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked how she would convince her Republican colleagues to vote to remove the president should he be impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, 'First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. More:Catch up on USA TODAY's coverage of Wednesday's impeachment hearings In light of today's testimony from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Warren took a stab at what she says is corruption in politics, dinging Trump for appointing Sondland to his post after \"he wrote a check.\"\u00a0Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said she would not appoint donors to ambassadorships, though the practice is longstanding in administrations from both sides of the aisle. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar called for holding Trump accountable. He is accused of improperly pressuring the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into domestic politics, including into 2020 frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that while Trump is \"likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America,\" his campaign cannot only focus on it. \"We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u2019re going to lose the election,\" Sanders said. In past debates, Democrats opened with lengthy exchanges on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said, but also noted that \"doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.\" Rather, she says, it's about asking those at the top to contribute to others. \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" Warren said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome\" and difficult to evaluate. Saying that all the Democrats on stage\u00a0support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Warren's wealth tax is also part of her plan to fund Medicare for All. After taking heat from 2020 rivals at previous debates for dodging the question of how she would fund for the policy, Warren released a plan that she says would not raise taxes on the middle class. Sanders and Warren defended their Medicare for All\u00a0approaches while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during the health care discussion. After Warren talked about the need for reform, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his health care plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. Biden supports a Medicare option that builds on the Affordable Care Act, and says that people don't want to lose their current health insurance plans. \u201cI trust the American people to make a judgement that they believe is in their interest,\" Biden said. Gabbard prompts brawl with dig at Democratic Party Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the\u00a0November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a\u00a0Twitter firestorm\u00a0between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Quick wit served several candidates on stage as they sparred with each other over policy issues, prompting laughter and applause from audience members and spreading widely on social media. And as Trump's rapid response team fired off emails to counter Democrats' points, they also fired off quips aimed at the president. Booker slammed Biden for saying this week that he was not prepared to support\u00a0legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said to Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. His earlier comments included that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug.\" That view has puts Biden at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties, according to polls. Booker also used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates in the polls for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in first\u00a0place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said, taking a stab at Trump. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d Before the debate even began, the Biden campaign mistakenly sent an email to supporters that was meant to go out after the debate had ended. \"I hope I made you proud out there,\" the email said. But that wasn't the end of it, as Biden turned some heads with comments he made on stage, after a respite in his notorious verbal flubs in public appearances. Biden\u2019s response to how he would address sexual violence drew laughter for an unfortunate choice of words. He started\u00a0by reminding the audience\u00a0he authored legislation to address violence against women. He argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said, but then added.\u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d The former vice president also\u00a0touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, then saying that he was endorsed by \"the only African American woman who'd ever been elected to the United States Senate,\" likely referring to\u00a0Carol Moseley Braun. The Illinois woman, the first black woman elected to the Senate,\u00a0served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself, incredulously, as the stage erupted and Biden quickly tried to correct by saying he meant to say \"the first,\" black woman elected.

      "author": "Elizabeth Weise",
      "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 When Donald Bell was growing up in a small town in Illinois, the only place to get information about being gay was the public library. \u201cIn the Webster\u2019s unabridged dictionary, when you got to the entry for homosexuality there were smudges because a lot of people had been there. The same with the Encyclopedia Britannica entry,\u201d said Bell, 70. Some years later, when Bell was a college student in the 1960s, being gay was illegal. A dean expelled some of his friends because of their sexual identity. Now Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay man, is running for president of the United States and leading in some Democratic primary polls. In fact,\u00a0The Des Moines Register's Iowa Poll found 25% of Iowa's likely Democratic caucus-goers said he was their first choice for president, besting\u00a0rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, all of whom\u00a0were about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Ind., mayor. Iowa Poll:President Trump's popularity sky-high among registered Republicans The Iowa caucuses are the first in a series of state contests in 2020. Winning the state\u2019s Feb. 3\u00a0caucus gives candidates momentum and national attention as they head into the three other early states that precede the huge chunk of delegates at stake on Super Tuesday in March. For many older gay Americans, Buttigieg's candidacy is an important moment. Whether or not they support him for president, he represents a new era in sexual freedom and civil rights. \u201cThe fact that Buttigieg is a legitimate candidate makes me feel terrific. But it also reminds of me of what it cost for us to get here,\u201d said Bell, a retired college administrator. As an African-American, Bell remembers dissolving into tears when he entered the voting booth in 2008 to vote for President Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president. \u201cSomething had happened that I never conceived could have happened in my lifetime,\u201d he said. For some LGBTQ people, he expects those same tears should Buttigieg make it to the general election ballot in 2020. Buttigieg, 37, is a Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar who was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve and served in Afghanistan in 2014. He is a practicing Episcopalian and more moderate than some Democratic hopefuls. He married his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a junior high school teacher who took his name, in 2018 after the pair dated for three years. It\u2019s that combination of attributes \u2013 moderate, high-achieving and a person of faith \u2013 that makes Buttigieg far more than a one-note candidate. \u201cMayor Pete\u2019s not running as a gay candidate, he\u2019s embracing who he is in all its dimension, including being an openly gay man who\u2019s married to his husband,\u201d said JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs with the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBTQ civil rights organization based in Washington, D.C. Buttigieg himself says he\u2019s mindful of the example he sets. On his campaign bus last week,\u00a0 he said he couldn\u2019t imagine what it would have been like for a teenage version of himself to see a viable, \"out\" candidate for president. \u201cPeople \u2013 often young people but often people almost my parents\u2019 age also \u2013 share with me that they never dared to think something like this was possible,\" he said.\u00a0\"It just shows you what representation can do. It\u2019s not the reason for my candidacy. But it certainly has become a reason to make sure we do everything we can to be a good example and to make them proud.\u201d Every day he\u2019s in the race changes the landscape for every other candidate who\u2019s going to follow him, said Annise Parker, the former mayor of Houston who\u2019s now the executive director of the Victory Fund, a political action committee in Washington, D.C., that works to grow the number of openly LGBTQ public officials in the United States. \u201cTo have someone who is so high-profile, so visible, is a game-changer,\u201d Parker said. The question of whether an openly gay man can be elected president of the United States is still an open one, but polls make it seem less impossible than it once might have seemed. Buttigieg has stood out not for being gay\u00a0but for winning over voters with his intelligence, message of unity and pragmatism. He calls for \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d and keeping private insurance but also making a government-backed health insurance option available. He\u2019s not for free college but has a plan for\u00a0public colleges to be free for students from families earning less than $100,000 a year. He sees the Green New Deal as a set of goals for dealing with climate change but not as a way to\u00a0overhaul the economy. He wants to raise taxes to invest in education and transportation to give the poor and middle class more opportunities. That has\u00a0turned some voters, including gay ones, off because he isn\u2019t more progressive in an election season when Sens. Bernie Sanders'\u00a0and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s calls for a fundamental overhaul of how America functions economically are raising lots of interest. A recent poll of voters in Georgia, where the state\u2019s Democratic primary is slated for March 24, found Buttigieg beating President Donald Trump 46%-43%. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution poll found other Democratic contenders running better than Buttigieg against Trump, but not significantly so. It had Trump losing to Biden in Georgia by 8 percentage points, 51%-43%, Sanders winning 48%-44% and Warren ahead 47%-44%. The numbers aren\u2019t surprising given that 66% of Americans support marriage equality, and in every state at least 50% of voters support legal equality for gay people, Winterhof said. A concern is whether his sexuality \u2013\u00a0or politics \u2013\u00a0will be a turnoff\u00a0for some black voters, who make up about one-fifth of the Democratic electorate.\u00a0Internal focus groups conducted by his campaign this summer showed his sexuality was a barrier for some black voters in South Carolina, an early primary state. Some young, progressive activists, including some LGBT leaders,\u00a0have also raised complaints about Buttigieg being too moderate and not doing enough for people of color. Violent crime, for example, is rising in South Bend, where Buttigieg\u00a0also has faced criticism for firing the city\u2019s first black police chief. Some voters have also expressed pessimism about whether the U.S., which\u00a0made gay marriage the law of the land only in 2015, is ready for an openly gay president. Roughly 37% of respondents in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll in late October said they were either definitely or probably not ready for a gay president, while 50% of respondents said that wasn\u2019t an issue for them. Michael Bronski\u00a0said Buttigieg might face the so-called Bradley effect, where voters lie to pollsters to mask their prejudices. Bronski\u00a0is a gay activist and professor of women's\u00a0and gender studies at Harvard University whose most recent book is \"A Queer History of the United States for Young People.\" Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, ran for California state governor in 1982. Many polls in the final days of the campaign showed Bradley winning. But once they were all counted, Bradley lost to the Republican candidate George Deukmejian. \u201cPeople lied because they didn\u2019t want to sound racist,\u201d said Bronski, who worries Buttigieg could face a wave of voters telling pollsters one thing but voting a different way at the ballot box. Buttigieg isn\u2019t the first major-party presidential candidate who is openly gay. In 2012, longtime political consultant Fred Karger sought the 2012 Republican nomination but failed to gain traction. Buttigieg is the first LGBTQ candidate to be seen as having a potential shot at winning. His run builds on almost 50 years of LGBTQ political candidates winning, first in local and state elections in the 1970s, then in the U.S. House and multiple recent wins in the U.S. Senate and state governorships, said Marc Stein, a professor of political history\u00a0at San Francisco State University. While large portions of the U.S. population will now consider voting for LGBTQ candidates, it\u2019s no accident that the first serious presidential contender is white, male, Midwestern, a veteran, highly educated, married and moderate, Stein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that the U.S. public would be prepared to accept and support an openly LGBTQ presidential candidate who was less conventional,\u201d Stein said. Joe Negrelli, 67, remembers all too well what it was like to be a young gay man in the 1960s. He had stepped out of the Stonewall Inn bar in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village on the night of June 28, 1969, to get a breath of fresh air. He was standing across the street when the police pulled up and raided the bar \u2013 and when the gay and lesbian patrons fought back. That night of rioting 50 years ago marked the beginning of a gay activism wave that is still commemorated in June by gay pride parades worldwide. Negrelli says he couldn\u2019t have imagined what it would be like to even consider a gay candidate back in 1969 when he was still in high school. Even 20 years ago, when Negrelli was the age Buttigieg is now, it would have been inconceivable, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s married. That\u2019s something that only came after a long, hard fight. When I was 37, that wasn\u2019t even an option,\u201d he said. Negrelli hasn\u2019t yet made up his mind on who'll get his vote\u00a0but says he cares more about the issues the candidates stand for than their sexual orientation, and he\u2019d like to see a lesbian or man of color running. \u201cBut if we need a starting point, then Mayor Pete is a good starting point,\u201d he said. Eric Temple is\u00a0head of Lick-Wilmerding, a\u00a0private high school in San Francisco. Many of his students have a level of comfort and acceptance around sexual and gender identity far different from his experiences growing up, a shift for which he is grateful. It also gives them a different perspective on Buttigieg. \u201cI love the fact that young people look past core identifies to think more about his positions,\u201d said Temple, 57. For Temple and his husband, Buttigieg resonates deeply. \u201cNever in my imagination did I ever think an openly gay presidential candidate would garner the national attention he\u2019s garnered. For my generation it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s really moving,\u201d he said. Buttigieg\u2019s comfort with himself is part of what\u2019s so important and especially important for young people, said Temple, who describes himself as \u201call in\u201d for the South Bend mayor. \u201cI hope that people see themselves differently because of how he presents himself. You don\u2019t have to be ashamed, you don\u2019t have to hide, how you are is awesome \u2013 and you can be president! \u2013 if you want to,\u201d he said. For Lujira Cooper, 72, a retired fundraiser who now writes novels and teaches writing, one of the best things about Buttigieg is that he\u2019s new to national politics. \u201cYouth is on his side. It may not be this year, it may not be next year (that he\u2019s elected). But having somebody youthful, energetic and purposeful will eventually resonate. It gets tiring to see the same people run again and again,\u201d she said. But the fact that he\u2019s gay is also important to her as someone who\u2019s African-American and lesbian. \u201cBeing part of a group that has been marginalized makes him more vocal.\u00a0He can see oppression better than some of the candidates,\u201d she said. Then there\u2019s the criticism that Buttigieg is just too mainstream. The Victory Fund\u2019s Parker says she has seen comments on social media that Buttigieg isn\u2019t gay enough \u2013 but that misses the point, she says. \u201cWhen Pete stands on the stage and makes an offhand reference to his husband, Chasten, it\u2019s transformative. It\u2019s not waving a rainbow banner in the street, but it has more impact.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s so matter-of-fact that it almost becomes subversive.\u201d Contributing: Maureen Groppe in\u00a0 Washington, D.C.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The 2020 Democratic field in Iowa is led by four candidates for president, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg gaining ground in the last few months, according to a poll released Tuesday. The Monmouth University poll\u00a0found that Buttigieg is the favored candidate of 22% of respondents, putting him in the lead for the first time in Iowa. Former Vice President Joe Biden was backed by 19%, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 18% and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 13%.\u00a0All other Democratic candidates received single-digit support in the survey. But, the survey results suggest that the race is still fluid; less than one-third of respondents said they are firmly set on their choice. Buttigieg bus tour:2020 candidate talks stress dreams, misconceptions, \u2018just in case\u2019 letter to parents More:Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg shares his views on current issues Buttigieg's support has grown since Monmouth's August survey, where he\u00a0was at 8%. Biden, meanwhile, has ticked down since the summer, when he was the pick of 26% of Monmouth respondents. The Monmouth survey's\u00a0margin of error was plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. The results are based on\u00a0results among 451 Iowans likely to participate in the state's Democratic caucus. Monmouth also asked respondents about former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has recently signaled intentions to run. He was the top pick of a single voter out of 361 surveyed after he was added to the lineup, and when asked about his favorability, he came out with\u00a0a net negative 31 points. Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said that when voting begins in February, voters are more likely to turn a candidate that has been in the field longer if the race still seems wide open. \"It makes more sense to pay attention to someone like Amy Klobuchar in this scenario than look for a white knight to come riding to the rescue,\" Murray said. Klobuchar stood at 5% in this poll. Buttigieg has recently performed well in early state polling. A Quinnipiac poll in New Hampshire had the Democratic hopeful\u00a0with 15% of support, within striking distance of Biden at 20% and\u00a0Warren at 16%. Sanders stood at 14%. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll conducted nationally also found him holding his own against\u00a0Biden, Warren and Sanders. More:Who is running for president in 2020?

      "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 On a recent\u00a0Sunday, Victor Garcia left his Silicon Valley apartment and traveled an hour north to attend a rally by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Garcia, a 20-year-old political science major, is eager to vote both in the November 2020 election and in California\u2019s moved-up primary\u00a0on March 3.\u00a0But as curious as he is about Yang, a passionate\u00a0proponent of a monthly $1,000 Universal Basic Income payment, Garcia\u00a0is still candidate-shopping. He wants to see which politician is most attuned to issues that concern the state\u2019s growing Latino population. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d Garcia says as a largely youthful\u00a0crowd gathers at Civic Center Plazain San Francisco ahead of Yang's speech. \u201cThat said, most candidates really aren\u2019t reaching out to us yet.\" With California's earlier\u00a0primary date giving\u00a0the state newfound clout in choosing who takes on President Donald Trump, political experts say presidential hopefuls would do well to step up their courtship of the Golden State\u2019s increasingly powerful Latino voters. According to the Pew Research Center, not only are\u00a0Latinos the majority-minority, with\u00a039% (or 15 million) of the state's 40 million residents, but they also represent roughly a third of the state\u2019s eligible voters (at\u00a07.7 million). While Latino voter turnout lags that of other ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 45% of Latino adults are likely to vote, compared with 68% of whites, according to the Public Policy Institute of California \u2013 those numbers have been shifting. In the 2018 midterms, contests\u00a0that\u00a0traditionally draw\u00a0fewer voters than general elections, Latino voter turnout hit 36%, a doubling from 2014 that helped California Democratic candidates\u00a0flip seven perennially Republican House\u00a0seats. California Democrats gather:Here's what you need to know And Latino turnout expectations are heightened for the 2020 presidential election. At play not only are robust voter registration efforts aimed at a heavily Democratic constituency \u2013 58% register as Democrats, compared with 15% who register as Republicans \u2013 but also\u00a0a powerful resentment of Trump, whose disapproval rating hovers at 70% among Latinos, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. According to a Nov.\u00a013 statewide Latino Decisions poll commissioned by the Latino Community Foundation, 74%\u00a0of registered Latino voters say they plan to vote in the March 3 primary. Concerns about racism was cited by 76%\u00a0of respondents. The poll also reveals that 31% planned to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 11% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro came in at 9%, and California\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris was at 8%. \u201cThe message we want all Latinos to hear is that they have the power to determine who is going to run against Trump\u00a0and who will win in November,\u201d says Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO of San Francisco- based Latino Community Foundation, which is working to get out the Latino vote across the state. \u201cThe political climate we are in has awoken a new generation of voters,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate the term sleeping giant, because we\u2019ve been working, not sleeping. Now the candidates have to engage.\u201d Democrats making a run for the White House will have an opportunity\u00a0to lock in Garcia\u2019s vote on Nov.\u00a016 in Long Beach, California, site of a televised Univision forum that will include Harris, Warren, Sanders, Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Yang. The event represents a rare in-state gathering by candidates who by and large have been visiting\u00a0California mostly for lucrative private fundraising trips. Many have so far focused their campaigning on\u00a0Iowa and other early battleground states. In fact, Biden has skipped all events hosted by the state\u2019s Democratic Party \u2013\u00a0 but has attended posh donor events up and down the state. He\u00a0recently announced he would not be at the state\u2019s party convention in Long Beach Nov.\u00a015 through 17. Rounding out the Univision forum's field of eight \u2013 and serving as last-minute replacements for original invitees\u00a0Biden, Warren and former Texas Congressman\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, who ended his once-promising campaign Nov. 1 \u2013 will be billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The cost of not grabbing the attention of Latinos across the state is\u00a0high, says Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cA presidential candidate cannot win California without getting a very significant portion of the Latino population, so ignoring outreach here is a huge strategic mistake,\u201d Romero says. USA TODAY reached out to the campaigns of all those initially invited to the upcoming Univision forum to talk about Latino voters in California. Yang\u2019s team was the only one to arrange an interview. \u201cAs a child of immigrants, I appreciate that communities may have unique issues,\u201d Yang tells USA TODAY in a makeshift greenroom just off Mission Street that by night is a chic cocktail bar. \u201cBut my campaign focuses on topics\u00a0that affect all of us.\u201d Yang says that by highlighting the coming negative effects of automation on retail, transportation and food service jobs, he is in fact directly addressing the concerns of Latino voters. \u201cMany communities will be adversely affected by this coming economic natural disaster,\u201d Yang says. \u201cBut those who will suffer the most will be people of color.\u201d So who has the edge? A recent Telemundo poll of Latino voters nationally showed\u00a0Biden leading with 26%, followed by Sanders at 18% and Warren at 10%. The next closest was\u00a0Harris at 3%. But 36% of Latino voters said they were undecided. Those findings largely were borne out in conversations with a range of California Latino leaders, from the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to a popular radio deejay. \u201cMost Latinos certainly know who Joe Biden is, so he\u2019ll get solid support, especially from the older generation,\u201d says Xavier Becerra, the state's first Latino\u00a0attorney general. His office has\u00a0sued the Trump administration more than 60 times on a range of issues. Becerra says that for many Latino voters, name recognition is key. \u201cFour years ago, I was campaigning for Hillary (Clinton) and Sanders was having a tough time gaining traction with Latinos, and now he\u2019s way up there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that shows is Latinos, like others, want to know who you are before they turn to you.\u201d Interest in Sanders and Warren indicates Latinos are \u201ctrending on the progressive side, which makes sense when you see the growth of younger voters,\u201d\u00a0Becerra says. Currently, 44% of eligible Latino voters are in the millennial age bracket, 18 to 33, according to Pew. Chuy Gomez, a longtime Bay Area radio broadcaster, often has the ear of younger Latino voters. \u201cA lot of people I speak with want Bernie in,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cHe speaks to the common folks, the workers. He\u2019s anti-rich.\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, has endorsed Warren. \u201cShe talks about bread and butter issues in a Midwest way, but it\u2019s all about paying the rent, getting more power as a worker, and our community relates to those issues,\u201d she says. When asked about Julian Castro, the lone Latino in the shrinking cluster of Democratic candidates, many say that while Latinos instantly relate to a man with a familiar last name and life story, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has their vote. \u201cWe want Castro in the race because he lives like us and represents us, so him being president is secondary to him just being on that stage,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe should be an example for the nation. We were scapegoated by this president as a way to win the last election. So we want to help galvanize Latinos everywhere to vote.\u201d Political pundits often like to talk about voters being driven largely by specific issues. But conversations with Latinos make it clear this is not a monolithic group. In fact, they hold a range of views, from progressive to conservative, and care about a rainbow of issues ranging from income inequality to climate change. \u201cThere is no issue that is not a Latino issue,\u201d says Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state who is also the first Latino to hold that position. \u201cWe want what everyone else wants. An opportunity for a good-paying job, access to health care, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing. Our dream is the American dream.\u201d Padilla says many Latinos see that dream as increasingly under threat by the Trump\u00a0administration, which has appealed to its base by attacking illegal immigration\u00a0and calling for tougher security\u00a0at the Mexican border. That, however, has served only to galvanize Latinos in a way that reminds Padilla of California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed by the state\u2019s voters 25 years ago this month. Prop 187 denied undocumented immigrants access to health care and education. Although a day later the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, it created a movement that eventually saw 1 million California Latinos become citizens and arguably launched the ethnic group on a path toward\u00a0increased power at the polls. Latino political activists agree that while the debate over illegal immigration is deeply upsetting to Latinos, candidates would be making a mistake if they focused their messaging on this one topic. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for these candidates to understand that it is not the case that if you know what one Latino wants, you know what we all want,\u201d says Latino Community Foundation CEO Martinez Garcel. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m a Dominican from New York, so when I hear AOC (progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) speak, I don\u2019t hear socialism, I hear policies that care about the poor,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Another mistake for candidates would be displaying a level of sympathy that teeters into pity. \u201cSometimes presidential candidates don\u2019t talk about Latinos in uplifting ways but just as victims, and we need to challenge that image,\u201d says Sarah Souza, president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, the first DACA recipient (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), or \"Dreamer,\" to be appointed to the post. Souza, who originally is from Brazil, says candidates who push for access to home ownership and financial resources for Latinos will find a ready audience. \u201cWe want economic opportunities just like everyone else,\u201d says Souza, adding that she supports Castro, Sanders and Warren. \u201cThey\u2019re the most progressive and have an agenda that is for people of color, a group that has long been a target when it comes to economic equity.\u201d For Alma Beltran, mayor of Parlier, California, just south of the agricultural mecca of Fresno, the upcoming primary and general election are about restoring opportunity and dignity to the lives of her 15,000 constituents \u2013 98.8% of whom are Latino, including her and the entire City Council. Though times are tough in Parlier because of scarce economic opportunities and looming water quality issues, Beltran\u00a0finds encouragement in the younger generation. \u201cI talk to some people who will say \u2018It won\u2019t make a difference if I vote,\u2019 but then I run into young people like my son, who is 17 and told me when he gets older he wants to run for office,\u201d Beltran says. \u201cYou think maybe they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re watching. They\u2019re the people who will make a difference.\u201d The crowd waiting for Yang at Civic Center Plaza is in fact mostly younger. Signs invariably tout the merits of his basic income plan, while most of the baseball caps say, \"MATH,\" a play off Trump's MAGA slogan that stands for Make America Think Harder. Marching with a smile is Eliana Jaramillo. Her large sign features a cartoon drawing of Yang as Uncle Sam, and in Spanish it reads, \u201cUniversal Basic Income: I want you to have $1,000 a month.\u201d Jaramillo says she was drawn to Yang\u2019s campaign specifically because that kind of stipend would have allowed her and her two children to flee an abusive relationship sooner. \u201cI\u2019m marching in the hope that other women don\u2019t have to go through what I did,\u201d she says. Nearby, Milo Alvarez bops up and down on his toes as he tries to get his infant son to sleep in his chest-mounted sling. \u201cI was a Bernie fan, but now I like Yang because I love this idea of a universal basic income,\u201d\u00a0says Alvarez, a scooter repairman from Daly City just south of San Francisco. Alvarez reels off the other issues that are important to him, including health care and climate change. He says he doesn\u2019t particularly mind\u00a0if candidates don't appeal to him specifically as a Latino. \u201cI care about the issues, which cut\u00a0across a lot of ethnicities,\u201d he says. Whether a\u00a0broad political appeal, like that made by Yang, will be enough to woo California's Latino voters come the elections in March and November remains to be seen. California\u00a0Secretary of State Padilla\u00a0suggests it may not be. \u201cYou cannot compete in California without paying deep respect and responding to the Latino community,\u201d he says. \u201cBottom line.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apologized Monday to a man\u00a0she had blocked on Twitter as part of a settlement of a federal lawsuit he brought against her earlier this year. The New York Democrat said she had reconsidered her decision to block\u00a0former New York state Assemblyman\u00a0Dov Hikind, who had often criticized her on the social media platform, particularly her\u00a0comparison of migrant detention centers to concentration camps. \"Mr. Hikind has a First Amendment right to express his views and should not be blocked for them,\"\u00a0she said in a statement. \"In retrospect,\u00a0it was wrong and improper and does not reflect the values I cherish. I sincerely apologize for blocking Mr. Hikind.\" But Ocasio-Cortez, who has said she has received many threats,\u00a0reserved the right to block those she felt were harassing her. Hikind said in a news conference that he was pleased with Ocasio-Cortez's apology and that he \"couldn't ask for much more at this point.\" He said he hoped it would be the start of a dialogue between himself and the congresswoman. From unknown to US Congress:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0says sudden fame is like 'a tattoo on your face' More:Bernie Sanders says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will work in his administration if he's president \"Every public official needs to unblock the public from following them on Twitter,\"\u00a0Hikind said. \"You want to be in elective\u00a0office? Don't be afraid of what people have to say to you.\" His lawsuit was filed after a federal appeals panel ruled that President Donald Trump could not block Twitter users who criticized him. The panel said that because Trump often made policy announcements and conducted official business through his Twitter account, he was silencing critics and violating their First Amendment rights by blocking them. Voices:Trump blocked me on Twitter. I sued (and won) because modern town halls happen online. Hikind\u00a0said that people who \"cross the line\" and threaten public officials are \"another story.\" \"But just because you don't like what someone is saying, or you don't like the way they're\u00a0saying it, does not give you a right to abridge their freedom of speech,\" he said. Ocasio-Cortez has more than 5.7 million Twitter followers on her account, which she uses to discuss topics ranging from mundane personal matters to legislation and congressional affairs.

      "content": "   DES MOINES \u2014 Last month\u00a0in Des Moines, Stephanie Medina got into her Nissan hatchback\u00a0and drove west. The organizer\u00a0for Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0was soon sharing\u00a0tamales with Iowans at\u00a0a predominantly Spanish-speaking event in Perry. Hours later, she was in Denison, home to another large Latino community,\u00a0to eat chips and salsa at a restaurant with several Latino families, including a couple who moved to the area from Mexico more than half\u00a0a century ago. \"I'm willing to drive anywhere,\" said the Des Moines-based\u00a0Medina. She joined Warren's Iowa campaign over the summer as a Latinx constituency coordinator.\u00a0\"\u2026 I find myself saying, 'It's only two hours;\u00a0it's only two hours away, one way.'\" In the massive Democratic presidential field, having a staffer with a title like Medina's\u00a0is no longer singular.\u00a0Compared to previous cycles, the 2020 campaigns have\u00a0expanded their efforts to court Latinos, a small but growing voting bloc in the predominantly white first-in-the-nation caucus state. Latinos now\u00a0make up about 6.2% of Iowa\u2019s population, a figure that's\u00a0projected to roughly\u00a0double by 2050,\u00a0according to a\u00a0State Data Center of Iowa report. That gives them\u00a0a powerful voice in\u00a0politics. Latinos are responding by not only turning out at the ballot box,\u00a0but jumping into local and state elections as candidates. At an October presidential town hall in Des Moines\u00a0hosted by the\u00a0League of United Latin American Citizens, known as LULAC, Sindy Benavides,\u00a0the organization's CEO, indirectly\u00a0referred to President Donald Trump's immigration policies and language on immigrants. She predicted it would compel\u00a0Latinos to show up in 2020. \"When we\u2019re called things and told that we\u2019re the 'other,' let us remember our rich history as Latinos in America,\" Benavides said. \"For we, too, are American,\" she added, before translating in Spanish: \"Somos Americanos.\" Outside the convention venue, staff\u00a0for former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii\u00a0were among the campaigns handing out reading material in Spanish and promoting upcoming events geared toward Latinos. (O'Rourke has since dropped out of the race.) As he does his work, Camilo Haller\u00a0uses himself\u00a0as a profile of someone\u00a0involved in politics. A field organizer for former Vice President Joe Biden's Iowa campaign, he\u2019s \u00a0a bilingual Colombian immigrant who came to the United States when he was 7\u00a0and passed his citizenship exam this year. Haller, who was raised in Oklahoma,\u00a0is based in Storm Lake, in\u00a0northwest Iowa. A\u00a0big part of his\u00a0job is connecting with the Latino community. \"There are a lot of immigrants in Storm Lake, and I\u2019m an immigrant myself, so I think, I just like to show my example as a way to normalize like, you know, it\u2019s not just out-of-touch people who don\u2019t get the immigrant experience that are out here that are involved. There are a lot more people like me,\" he said. In October, Biden's campaign launched \"Todos Con Biden,\" or, Everyone with Biden\u00a0\u2014 a national effort to connect to Latino supporters through phone banking, community events, days of action and fundraising. Biden\u00a0campaign officials have\u00a0also emphasized the diversity of their staff. Haller is one of several bilingual field organizers\u00a0in Iowa, and Biden's deputy Iowa state director, Claudia Chavez,\u00a0is\u00a0bilingual and Latina. Biden's campaign is one of many stressing the need for Latino Iowans to get involved. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has had several prominent campaign surrogates from the Latino community hold events in Iowa on her behalf. Recently, Dolores Huerta, a national civil rights and labor leader,\u00a0held a \u201cPara La Gente,\u201d\u00a0or, For the People,\u00a0house party in Des Moines. The campaign plans to\u00a0hold caucus training sessions in Latino communities. In August,\u00a0Harris also won the endorsement from\u00a0the very active\u00a0Asian & Latino Coalition, which has hosted many of the presidential candidates this year. Prakash Kopparapu, the Asian\u00a0and\u00a0Latino Coalition chair, said the endorsement means the coalition offers support\u00a0to Harris' campaign when she comes to Iowa, whether through members\u00a0becoming precinct leaders or by discussing policy items with the campaign's leadership team. \"We asked our members after the process: What prompted you to vote for Sen. Harris?\" Kopparapu said. \"They like her policy on health care ...\u00a0\u00a0she knows immigration issues, not only undocumented and otherwise, but the legal immigration process. That clearly resonated a lot.\" Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has several organizers who speak Spanish. Medina, Warren's top organizer in the state on Latino issues, committed to attending several Latino festivals this year so she could\u00a0hear directly from members of the community. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0has opened field offices in Storm Lake and Marshalltown, two areas with large Latino communities. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00a0got a strong reception at the LULAC presidential town hall. Ahead of the Nov. 5 municipal\u00a0elections, Sanders endorsed Chelsea Chism-Vargas, a\u00a0Peruvian-American running for Des Moines City Council,\u00a0and had his volunteers knock doors for\u00a0her. Juli\u00e1n Castro also endorsed\u00a0Chism-Vargas. Misty Rebik, Sanders' Iowa state director, said in a memo that \"our turnout operation is paying special attention to Latinx voters in Iowa.\" The Sanders campaign recently texted Iowa Latinos a\u00a0Spanish language digital ad\u00a0that highlighted\u00a0Sanders'\u00a0father's story of immigrating to the United States. The goal, according to the memo from Rebik, is \"fundamentally transforming the Iowa electorate.\" Sanders'\u00a0near draw with Hillary Clinton in 2016 shows the value of the Latino vote in the caucuses, said Joe Henry, political director of LULAC's Iowa chapter. \"The Sanders campaign would not have gotten as close as it did last time around if it were not for the Latino vote,\" Henry said. He's\u00a0endorsed Castro, the former U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama. Obama's historic caucus win in 2008 was also aided by Latino caucusgoers, Henry said. If campaigns want to gain active support from Latinos in Iowa, they need to devote time and money to knocking on doors, sending fliers and calling households in Latino neighborhoods\u00a0\u2014 all things at which Obama's campaign excelled, Henry said. Castro\u00a0is the only Latino candidate in the Democratic presidential race. He's an accomplished politician\u00a0\u2014 he was also the mayor of San Antonio\u00a0\u2014 but he said he's often asked by national media to weigh in on immigration and Trump's anti-immigrant\u00a0rhetoric. \"I usually get the first question on immigration,\" Castro said at a town hall in Des Moines of his role\u00a0in the televised Democratic primary debates. In the October debate:\u00a0\"We spent three hours and we didn't talk about climate change.We didn't talk about housing.\" Some Latino caucusgoers said they also feel, and sometimes resent, the focus on immigration. When Haller met with Linda Yvonne Torres, a 22-year-old first-time caucusgoer in Storm Lake, she told him immigration is one of her top priorities, but not the only one. The others\u00a0are global warming, college tuition and\u00a0the economy. \"When people make the immigration issue just about Latinos, I think that\u2019s a step in the wrong direction,\"\u00a0Haller said. Organizers say it's important to acknowledge the breadth of issues that Latinos want to talk about.\u00a0Medina, with Warren's campaign, often brings a whiteboard along to events and\u00a0poses a variation of the same question:\u00a0\u201cWhat issues matter to you?\" She includes the question in Spanish. One by one the responses come in: Climate change. Reproductive rights. Affordable health care. Wages. Education. \"They're not single-issue voters,\" Medina said.\u00a0\"They care about a lot of different things.\" Still, the future of immigration policy looms large for many\u00a0Latinos. Mary Campos, 89 and a well-known\u00a0activist in the community,\u00a0attended one of Castro's town halls\u00a0in Des Moines in October. She asked him about his plans to help recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that provided\u00a0temporary legal protection to\u00a0immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Trump administration rescinded the program, though the\u00a0move was tied up in court challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide its future in its current term. \"I'm worried about my godchildren,\" Campos\u00a0told Castro, whose presidential bid she supports. \"What am I going to do with them? What\u2019s going to happen to us?\" Castro reassured her that he would do \"everything he can\" to help\u00a0DACA recipients. \"It's true there's tremendous anxiety in a lot of Latino households right now because of how bad the Trump administration has been on the issue of immigration,\" Castro told theDes Moines Register. While Castro has endorsements from Latino activists like Campos and Henry, he has struggled to gain broad support. In a September\u00a0Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll,\u00a0 just 1% of likely Democratic caucusgoers named him as their first choice. Reaching out to Latino\u00a0Iowans and making\u00a0sure they are informed about the 2020 general election is only half the battle. The other is getting them\u00a0to caucus in February, said Henry, with LULAC. \"Iowa caucuses has always been an inside game, usually reserved for those who are white, who are higher income, those who have been part of the process before,\" Henry said. It takes patience and steady outreach to explain the caucus process to\u00a0first-time caucusgoers, he said. That's also true for immigrants who don't speak fluent English, Haller, the Biden organizer, has found.While the Iowa Democratic Party will provide written or verbal translation services for Iowans who request language accommodations on caucus night, the process of caucusing is \"not the easiest\u00a0system to understand,\" he said. \"There are not enough bilingual organizers or bilingual politicians or bilingual community leaders that can explain simply what a caucus is,\" he said. \"That is honestly probably the biggest barrier I see to people practically being able to caucus.\" Haller encountered another problem when he knocked on Ramon Medina-Rios' door on a recent October afternoon:\u00a0Medina-Rios' voting-age sons weren't home. The two men work at the Tyson meatpacking plant\u00a0in Storm Lake, Haller said. It meant Haller had to change his door-knocking strategy to try to arrive either late in the evening,\u00a0during a lunch break, or early in the morning, before they leave for work. Haller has spoken to the men on previous visits to the home, and Medina-Rios assured him that he and his family still support Biden. Still, Haller left them some pamphlets just in case. Although he said he gets paranoid that first-time caucusgoers won't show up,\u00a0every indication is that they'll come out to caucus. \"Yeah, 2016 really did light a fire under people to do things that they never did, like caucusing,\" he said.

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 First-place finishers for the past four Iowa caucus cycles \u2014\u00a0with the\u00a0exception of\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all surged ahead sometime in the final months before the caucus, from November through\u00a0January. That\u2019s good news for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who jumped 16 percentage points\u00a0from September to lead the pack in November\u2019s Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, conducted by Selzer & Co. He is the first choice of 25% of\u00a0likely Democratic caucusgoers. That jump is an even more pronounced surge than Barack Obama\u2019s in 2007, when the Illinois senator jumped 6\u00a0percentage points\u00a0from October to November, then another 4 points\u00a0in December. Buttigieg has been drawing\u00a0parallels between himself and Obama. But a November surge also doesn't assure a victory. In\u00a0caucus cycles since 2004, only three candidates who were first in the November Iowa Poll\u00a0\u2014 Clinton, Obama and Mike Huckabee\u00a0\u2014 won their party's\u00a0caucus a few months later. The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was\u00a0in third in November\u00a02004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011. \u25ba More: Iowa Caucuses Results History: 1972 to 2016 Former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said a last-minute surge is the\u00a0key to a successful caucus campaign. It\u2019s a maxim that\u2019s become known in Iowa politics as the \u201cNagle Rule.\u201d \u201cThere are three rules to success in Iowa,\u201d Nagle said in a phone interview. \u201cRule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is:\u00a0You get hot at the end.\u201d With two and a half months left before the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses, Democratic presidential hopefuls\u00a0have plenty of time to \u201cget hot\u201d and move up, even within a shifting\u00a0field. Buttigieg\u2019s trajectory in Iowa so far resembles the path U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz took to win the 2016 Republican caucus. Cruz was polling comfortably near the rest\u00a0of the pack in the summer of 2015, though he\u00a0lagged significantly behind\u00a0early favorites Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, and businessman Donald Trump. In the October 2015 Iowa Poll, 10%\u00a0of likely Republican caucusgoers\u00a0chose Cruz as their first choice, ranking him third. Buttigieg started this autumn in a similar place. In the September Iowa Poll, he was fourth, with 9% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming him as their first choice for president. Buttigieg was 13 percentage points behind the poll leader, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at 22%. Both Cruz and Buttigieg leaped over previously leading candidates in a single poll.\u00a0 Cruz\u2019s support skyrocketed to 31% in the 2015 December poll, overtaking both Trump and Carson. From the early December poll through the February caucus, Cruz struggled somewhat to keep his momentum. In early January, his support had fallen to 25% and then to 23% in a poll right before the caucuses, when\u00a0he trailed Trump by 5 points. Cruz won the Republican 2016 Iowa caucuses, with 27.6% of the vote. But sometimes a mid-fall surge\u00a0dissipates as quickly as it\u00a0began. In the 2012\u00a0race, former House Speaker\u00a0Newt Gingrich shot to 25% and first place in a November poll of likely Republican caucusgoers, after polling at fifth place with 7% in October. The lead disappeared by the end of December, when he fell back to 12%. Gingrich was a distant fourth on caucus night. \"The caucuses are replete with stories (of candidates) who've gotten out early and then came under closer public scrutiny and couldn't maintain their position as the front-runner,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cI think, if I were, for example, looking at Mayor Buttigieg right now, I'd be a little worried. It's November. You don't want to be hot in November because then you become a target,\" he said. \"What you want to do is become hot in the last two weeks of January.\" As Gingrich enjoyed his moment on top of the polls, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania lay in wait. In that same November 2011 poll, Santorum garnered just 6% of the vote, tied with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in sixth place. Santorum\u00a0languished in early Iowa Polls. In June, October and November 2011, he gained only 2\u00a0percentage points, moving up from 4%. He was not\u00a0leading among any demographic groups.\u00a0He did not poll highest on any questions of positive or negative attributes. \u201cConservatives have kept talking up the chances of the former Pennsylvania senator, who has spent more time in the state than any other candidate,\u201d former Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich\u00a0wrote one month before the 2012 caucus. \u201cHe\u2019s just not a factor, and there\u2019s not much time left.\u201d Santorum and his family had moved temporarily to Iowa over the summer of 2011. While he didn\u2019t seem to be gaining traction among voters, he had campaigned in all 99 counties in Iowa. In the final Iowa Poll, published just days before the caucus, Santorum found his stride: He shot up to third place, with 15% of the respondents ranking him as their first choice. \u201cThe former Pennsylvania senator embodies the old political saw: Work like hell and get lucky at the end,\u201d Obradovich wrote in a column published two days before the 2012 caucuses. \u201cHe\u2019s logged over 100 days in Iowa, more than any other candidate, toiling in virtual obscurity.\u201d Santorum and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who had been a strong contender since the summer before, were nearly tied in returns on caucus night. Initially the caucuses were\u00a0called in favor of Romney by 8 votes, but two weeks and a recount later, the Iowa Republican Party announced that Santorum had a 34-vote advantage. \"If you're in this race, until the second week of January, it's not late,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cThe second week of January is when you want to start looking to who's moving up and who's falling back.\" One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle:\u00a0The race is more stratified at this point than most.\u00a0After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of Warren\u00a0at 16% and\u00a0U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of\u00a0Minnesota is at\u00a06%. Everyone else is at 3% or under. Still, candidates in previous cycles have picked up well over a dozen percentage points from\u00a0November polls to caucus night. Santorum\u2019s jump from the November poll to the actual result\u00a0was nearly 19 percentage points. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, climbed 22 percentage points\u00a0from\u00a0a November poll to\u00a0his caucus results. If a struggling 2020 candidate picks up just 10 percentage points\u00a0over the next two months, that candidate\u00a0could be in the running for one of the three\u00a0coveted tickets out of Iowa. Since\u00a0the modern Iowa presidential caucuses began in 1972, with just one exception,\u00a0no candidate in either party has gone on to win the\u00a0nomination without placing first, second or third when\u00a0Iowa has held\u00a0contested caucuses. The exception: In\u00a02008, eventual nominee John McCain\u00a0was barely edged into fourth place in Iowa. \"There's still time,\u201d Nagle said of low-polling candidates. \u201cIs it likely? No. But it's not unprecedented.\" Katie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at kakin@registermedia.com or at 515-284-8041. Follow her on Twitter at @katie_akin.",

The poll showed his approval rating drop to 38% from 44% in July. The president has repeatedly criticized his standing in polls and approval ratings in a variety of surveys throughout his presidency.

      "content": " In the latest development of the feud between Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, lawyers for the Hawaii congresswoman\u00a0sent a letter to Clinton demanding a retraction of comments alleging Gabbard is a \"favorite of the Russians.\" A political firestorm was set off after Clinton's remarks, made during an October podcast interview, that triggered a bipartisan outpouring of support and defense of Gabbard, from President Donald Trump to 2020 Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"Your statement is defamatory, and we demand that you retract it immediately,\" the lawyers wrote, adding that the retraction should be done at a press conference as well as in writing on social media and in the press. Explainer:What's the dispute between Hillary Clinton and Tulsi Gabbard about? Gabbard initially hit back at Clinton on social media and in media interviews, calling the former secretary of state the \"queen of warmongers.\" Gabbard has continued to rally her supporters with her criticism of Clinton. \"The statement is false. Congresswoman Gabbard is not being groomed by Russia to be a third-party candidate. Nor is she a Russian asset. Rather, she is a patriotic loyal American, a sitting four-term United States Congresswoman and a Major in the United States Army National Guard,\" the letter reads. Excerpts of Clinton's remarks started to go viral after the podcast's release but some of the initial reporting missed context around Clinton's remarks. It was later revealed by an aide that Clinton was referring to Republicans, not Russians, \"grooming\" Gabbard. Her remark that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" stands. \"They're also going to do third party. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who's\u00a0currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset, I mean totally. They know they can't win without a third party candidate.\" \"It appears you may now be claiming that this statement is about Republicans (not Russians) grooming Gabbard,\" the letter says. \"But this makes no sense in light of what you actually said.\" The lawyers went on to say that the comments were understood by the public to mean that Gabbard is a \"Russian asset.\"\u00a0They called Clinton's statement\u00a0\"so facially improbable that it is actionable as defamation.\" Here is what the lawyers want Clinton to say publicly: \"On October 17, 2019, I made certain statements about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Among other things, I accused her of being a Russian asset and that Russia was grooming her to be a third-party presidential candidate. I was wrong. I never should have made these remarks, and I apologize. I did not have any basis for making the statements. I acknowledge my grave mistake and error in judgment in this matter. I support and admire the work that Congresswoman Gabbard has done and will continue to do in serving our country.\" Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": " \u00a9 Copyright 2019, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. Likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0are divided on what they want when it comes to health care, according to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. The poll\u00a0shows more than half of respondents prefer a plan other than \"Medicare for All,\"\u00a0underscoring\u00a0conflicts\u00a0over the best course of action on health care. The poll finds 36% of likely caucusgoers support a Medicare for All\u00a0plan that would eliminate private health insurance and cover everyone through a government-run health system similar to Medicare.\u00a0Close to the same share, 34%, back creation of a public option, a\u00a0health insurance program run by the government that people can choose to buy into. Another 20% say they want to restore provisions lost from\u00a0the Affordable Care Act and work incrementally from there. The 2010 law, known as Obamacare, expanded health care coverage to millions of Americans but has long been derided by Republicans. The poll\u00a0of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0was conducted Nov. 8-13. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Health care has been a dominant topic in the 2020 presidential election cycle among Democrats. On the campaign trail, Iowa crowds ask more questions about health care than any other topic, and the candidates have discussed health care extensively during televised presidential\u00a0debates. Harmony Kennis, a poll respondent and 25-year-old waitress in Ames, said she supports improving the Affordable Care Act. But she also likes the idea of a Medicare for All\u00a0plan that eliminates private insurance. Election\u00a02020:Majority of young voters want Trump impeached, removed from office, poll finds Kennis names Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as her first choice for president, and\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as her second choice. Klobuchar supports creating a public option, while Sanders backs Medicare for All. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the solution is,\u201d Kennis said. \u201cI\u2019m really open to a solution that the majority of the American people can get behind.\u201d Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both support Medicare for All. The poll shows 68% of\u00a0Warren's\u00a0supporters\u00a0and 77% of\u00a0Sanders' supporters prefer Medicare for All. Andy Monphei, a poll respondent and 37-year-old software engineer in Jefferson, backs Medicare for All. He names Sanders as his first choice for president and Warren as his second choice. \u201cThere just needs to be a safety net for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other plans that I\u2019ve heard \u2026 some people still might not be able to afford that. And I just don\u2019t think that, being the richest country in the world, that should really be something that happens.\u201d Monphei said he feels like he understands the health care debate in the Democratic presidential race because he consumes \"quite a bit\" of news daily. He\u2019s also talked several times with the Sanders campaign about Medicare for All. \u201cWhen people talk about improving the ACA, I don\u2019t always know exactly what they mean, and I don\u2019t really know how they think that\u2019s going to help,\u201d he said. 'Medicare for All':Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Other top-polling\u00a0candidates, including\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, support a public option that keeps private insurance. Forty-eight percent\u00a0of\u00a0Buttigieg supporters\u00a0and 42% of\u00a0Biden\u00a0supporters prefer a public option. But nearly a quarter or more of their supporters favor\u00a0making improvements to the Affordable Care Act (24% of Buttigieg's supporters and 29% of Biden's). Added together, 72% of Buttigieg supporters and 71% of Biden supporters opt for a choice other than Medicare for All. The division among likely Democratic caucusgoers on\u00a0health care policy relates to another split examined in the poll: whether they want their party's\u00a0nominee to advocate for big changes or\u00a0for more modest ones that have a better chance to pass. Impeachment coverage:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage A\u00a0majority of likely caucusgoers, 52%, say they would rather see the party's nominee advocate for proposals that have a good chance of\u00a0becoming\u00a0law, even if the\u00a0changes aren't as big.\u00a0That\u2019s more than the 36% who prefer a candidate who will back big ideas, even if there is a lower\u00a0chance\u00a0they would become law. Warren and Sanders have focused their campaigns on big changes, and majorities of their supporters want that from a nominee (58% of Warren supporters and 54% of Sanders supporters). Majorities of\u00a0Biden\u00a0supporters (60%) and\u00a0Buttigieg\u00a0supporters (62%) want changes that have a good chance of becoming law. The Iowa Poll, conducted November 8-13, 2019, for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 500 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses and 502 registered Republicans who are not planning to participate in the Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 2,012 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. For the registered Republican sample, responses for the 533 registered Republican contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active registered Republicans in the voter registration list. Questions based on the sample of 500 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, as does the sample of 502 registered Republicans. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.

DES MOINES, Iowa \u2013 Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register\u2019s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who led the Register\u2019s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% \u2013 a 4 percentage point rise. Those four candidates began to pull away from the crowded field of Democrats and separate into a top tier of contenders in June's Iowa Poll. Biden, Warren and now Buttigieg have all taken turns atop the poll, with Sanders consistently in the top four. 2020 campaign:Democratic hopefuls will converge on the Las Vegas Strip Sunday to make their cases This latest poll underscores that separation. The group\u2019s next-closest competitor, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, trails well behind, at 6%. \u201cThis is the first poll that shows Buttigieg as a stand-alone front-runner,\u201d said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cThere have been four candidates that have sort of jostled around in a pack together, but he has a sizable lead over the nearest contender:\u00a09 points. So this is a new status for him.\u201d At 3% are U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, billionaire businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who moved toward a late entry into the presidential primaries last week, is at 2%. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado follows at 1%. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania round to 0%. Former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland and author Marianne Williamson were not named as a first choice by any poll respondents. More respondents \u2013 30% now, compared with 20% in September \u2013 say they have a first choice and their minds are made up. That still leaves ample opportunity for more surges and slides in the 2\u00bd months before the caucuses: 62% say they have a first choice but could still be persuaded, 1% are unsure and 7% have not made a first choice. In September, 16% of caucusgoers said they had not made a first choice. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Nov. 8-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers indicate growing enthusiasm. According to the poll, 63% say they will definitely, rather than probably, caucus, an uptick of 3 percentage points since September. Typically, Selzer said, commitment and enthusiasm reach their highest point just before the caucuses. But the percentage of those now saying they will definitely attend the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses already eclipses the 53% who said they would do so just before the 2008 caucuses. \u201cThis is one of the signals that this is going to be, potentially, a different kind of caucus,\u201d Selzer said. But even as their enthusiasm is high, likely Democratic caucusgoers remain skeptical about the current candidates\u2019 chances of beating Republican President Donald Trump. A majority \u2013 63% \u2013 say it\u2019s more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance to beat the president than to nominate a Democrat who shares their positions on major issues. Thirty-two percent say the opposite. But poll respondents are far from certain that any of the four leading candidates will win in a general election against Trump. Of the four candidates tested, Sanders shows the most weakness, with 31% saying they are \"almost certain\" he will lose. It's 24% for Warren, 21% for Biden and 19% for Buttigieg. Biden fares best, with 25% saying they are \"almost certain he will beat\" Trump. It is 17% for Sanders, 16% for Buttigieg and 15% for Warren. Among all poll respondents, 52% say they are fairly confident or almost certain Biden will beat Trump. Biden is the only one of the four top candidates to reach a majority. For Buttigieg, the poll\u2019s front-runner, just 27% of his own supporters say they are \u201calmost certain\u201d he will beat Trump. Selzer said that may be the worst number for Buttigieg in this poll. \"That's 30 points behind Biden, yet Buttigieg leads in this poll,\" Selzer said. \u201cIf the most important thing is to win, his supporters don\u2019t have that confidence that he\u2019s the one to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo as this goes forward, he has more convincing to do or someone else will rise up.\u201d Selzer said two of the race\u2019s latest entrants \u2013 Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick \u2013 may view this skepticism about the current field as inviting their entry into the race. \u201cThat, to me, is what others might be seeing in their own polling that says, \u2018This campaign is suffering from a lack of confidence, and they need a new candidate that can relieve them of their doubt,\u2019 \u201d Selzer said. In September, Warren led the field by a modest 2-point margin over Biden. It represented months of slow, steady climbing in the polls. But her rise coincided with sharper attacks from her competitors, particularly over her plan for how to pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Her slide into a statistical tie for second place with Biden and Sanders coincides with Buttigieg's rise. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s slipped in the Iowa Poll. Forty-eight percent of poll respondents describe her political views as \u201cabout right\u201d \u2013 down slightly from 54% in March. The share of those who describe her as \u201ctoo liberal\u201d has risen from 23% in March to 38% today. That\u2019s better than Sanders, though, who is described as \u201ctoo liberal\u201d by 53% of likely Democratic caucusgoers and \u201cabout right\u201d by 37%. \u201cI just think they are way, way out in left field, as far as being too liberal,\u201d Dolores Roberts, an 88-year-old poll respondent who lives on an acreage north of Floyd, said of Warren and Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t think the majority of maybe even the Democrats are going to go along with all of their ideas for free stuff.\u201d Roberts has Biden as her first choice and Buttigieg as her second. Biden does better than both Warren and Sanders, with 55% saying his views are \u201cabout right.\u201d However, that\u2019s down substantially from the 70% who said so in March. Today, more say he\u2019s \u201ctoo conservative\u201d (28%) than did in March (14%). Buttigieg fares best of the four candidates, with 63% saying he\u2019s \u201cabout right,\u201d 13% calling him \u201ctoo conservative\u201d and 7% saying he\u2019s \"too liberal.\u201d Biden and Buttigieg may also be benefiting from the 52% of likely Democratic caucusgoers who say they would rather see their nominee advocate for proposals that have a good chance of becoming law even if they do not represent big change. That\u2019s more than the 36% who prefer a candidate who backs big ideas, even if there is a lower chance they would become law. As might be expected, majorities of likely caucusgoers who support Warren (58%) and Sanders (54%) want big ideas. Majorities who support Buttigieg (62%) and Biden (60%) want changes that can become law. \u201cThere is kind of an overall sense in this poll, across things, that a more moderate candidate is preferred,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cSo that says to me that, again, if Biden is continuing to decline, it gives an opening for Buttigieg to rise.\u201d Andrew Couch, a 22-year-old business analytics student at Iowa City's University of Iowa, said he likes Buttigieg, particularly his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" approach to health care. He said he appreciates someone who can be relatively moderate but still call out flaws in the health care system. \"I'm not really that big a fan of Medicare for All, just because I don't think it's really a realistic thing that can be passed in Congress,\" he said. \"And also I think people should have an option for their health insurance, instead of being forced to join a government-ran health insurance company.\" Buttigieg has been among those more directly criticizing Warren\u2019s health care plan recently, and he\u2019s dug in to present himself as the younger, fresher alternative to Biden. His supporters came out in force to the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Liberty and Justice dinner Nov. 1, and he\u2019s enjoyed a steady flow of positive news stories highlighting his surge in other rounds of polling. Selzer said Buttigieg\u2019s support is \u201cdistinctively broad\u201d across demographic groups. When looking at the entire footprint of his support in Iowa, he now leads the field, with 68% saying they are actively considering him in some capacity. That includes the 25% who say he is their first choice, the 14% who name him as their second choice and the 29% who say they are actively considering him. That lead further \"cements Buttigieg's front-runner status\" in this poll, Selzer said. On that footprint score, Buttigieg leads Warren (now at 66%, down from 71% in September), Biden (58%), Sanders (54%), Harris (46%), Klobuchar (39%), Booker (36%), Yang (33%), Steyer (26%), Castro (18%), Gabbard (17%), Bloomberg (14%), Bennet (11%), Bullock (8%), Delaney (7%), Williams (7%) and Sestak (3%). Second choices are particularly important in the Iowa caucuses, where candidates must earn the support of at least 15% of those attending a precinct\u2019s caucus to be considered viable. Supporters of candidates not considered viable have the chance to move to their second-choice candidate. Warren is the second choice of 20% of likely caucusgoers, revealing an underlying strength for her, Selzer said. Buttigieg is the second choice of 14%, with Sanders and Biden at 13%. Harris has typically done well as a second choice, but at 7%, she is now only 1 point ahead of Klobuchar. \"Harris was always on the cusp of being a front-runner,\" Selzer said. \"But her first-choice vote has been cut in half. Her second-choice vote is half what it was at its high point. So there\u2019s a clear signal that people are moving away.\u201d If the poll respondents who name candidates with less than 15% support as their first choice are reallocated to their second choice, however, it does not create any newly viable candidates or meaningfully reorder the top four candidates. If a front-runner were to stumble, where might their support go? For Warren and Sanders, both popular among those who describe themselves as \"very liberal,\" more of their supporters name the other as their second choice than pick any other candidate. Forty-five percent of Sanders' supporters select Warren as a second choice, and 39% of Warren\u2019s supporters choose Sanders as the next-best option. Although Biden and Buttigieg are seen as competing in the same moderate lane, a plurality of Buttigieg\u2019s supporters (28%) back Warren as their second choice, whereas 25% of Biden\u2019s supporters name Buttigieg as their second option. Sanders, though, benefits from an extremely enthusiastic and committed core of supporters. Fifty-one percent of his supporters describe themselves as \"extremely enthusiastic.\" That\u2019s far ahead of Warren (35%), Buttigieg (33%) and Biden (25%). \"The part that is impressive is the enthusiasm that his supporters have. He might not be growing his base, but they\u2019re stuck with him \u2013 in the good way,\" Selzer said. \"It feels like they will not budge.\" Selzer said Buttigieg\u2019s rise from 1% in the March Iowa Poll to the top of it today reflects the ultimate selling point of Iowa\u2019s caucus system. \u201cIt proves up what I say about the beauty of having a place like Iowa go first, which is anyone can start anywhere and potentially win,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a chance.\u201d Contributing: Katie Akin and Stephen Gruber-Miller.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 A new Quinnipiac University poll out of South Carolina has former Vice President Joe Biden leading the pack of 2020 Democratic contenders\u00a0by\u00a020 points. Biden commanded the field at 33%, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren earning 13% and Bernie Sanders holding at 11%.

An interactive guide South Carolina is the first southern state to hold a presidential primary, and currently, 55% of likely voters said they might change their minds before the primary, with another 18% still undecided. \"Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear frontrunner in the Democratic primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad-based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters,\u201d Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Mary Snow stated. \u201cWhere South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.\" Among black voters, Biden dominated at 44%, followed by Sanders at 10%, Warren at 8%\u00a0and Buttigieg receiving less than 1%. Buttigieg\u2019s low polling number in South Carolina among black voters comes amid\u00a0The Intercept's reporting\u00a0that three South Carolina politicians - who\u00a0were included in a list promoted by the campaign of more than 400 South Carolinians supporting Buttigieg\u2019s \"The Douglass Plan\"\u00a0- felt\u00a0they had been mischaracterized as endorsing Buttigieg.

Snow added that\u00a0Patrick \"has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him. More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough - but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably.\" This poll counts for the December Democratic primary debate. Steyer has now hit the polling threshold to make it to the debate stage, but still needs donors. Yang needs just one more poll to qualify, following hitting 4% with this one.

The Grammy Award-winning rapper posted a video on Instagram Tuesday in which\u00a0she\u00a0discussed\u00a0the unemployment rate and increasing the minimum wage with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders \"A couple of weeks ago I asked my followers if you all had the chance to ask a Democratic candidate a question, what would that question be? The topic that was mentioned the most by all of you was about raising MINIMUM WAGE,\" she wrote in the caption of her roughly 90-second video. More:Stacey Abrams: I'd be 'honored' to be running mate of any 2020 Dem presidential candidate More:Steve King: 2020 presidential candidates, GOP challenger, condemn 'rape and incest' remarks Cardi B,\u00a0whose real name is\u00a0Belcalis Marlenis Alm\u00e1nzar, has been outspoken on social media about her politics, particularly about her support for Sanders and her criticisms of President Donald Trump. In Tuesday's video clip, Cardi B began by saying:\u00a0\"What are we going to do about wages in America?\" \"Like, for example me, as a New Yorker, not now, but you know, when I was not famous, I just felt like no matter how many jobs I get, I wasn't able to make ends meet,\" she continued. \"Like, I wasn't able to pay my rent, get transportation and eat.\" Sanders said that it was an \"excellent and important question.\" Increasing the federal\u00a0minimum wage has been one of Sanders' key policy initiatives for years. He wants to increase the national\u00a0minimum wage to $15/hour. \"Right now we have tens of millions of people who are earning what I consider to be starvation wages. Can you imagine\u00a0somebody today earning $9 an hour?\" Sanders said. \"It don't make no sense,\" Cardi B\u00a0responded. \"No, it doesn't,\" Sanders replied. Sanders also highlighted legislation passed by the House of Representatives in June that would increase\u00a0the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by October 2025. Cardi B also seemingly dissed Trump, who has repeatedly touted the low unemployment rate in America, particularly for African Americans and Latinos, and claimed credit for the statistics as he seeks re-election.

      "author": "William Cummings",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday that more study is needed to determine whether marijuana is \"a gateway drug,\" making him the only one of the leading Democratic presidential primary candidates to oppose legalization on the federal level. Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who said in 2010, \"I still believe it's a gateway drug,\" and\u00a0\"legalization is a mistake\"\u00a0\u2013 was asked at a town hall in Las Vegas if his position had changed. \"No, it hasn't changed,\" Biden said. He explained that although he supports allowing states to determine their own marijuana policies, \"the truth of the matter is, there has not been nearly enough evidence acquired as to whether or not it's a gateway drug.\" Though Biden opposes\u00a0legalization on the federal level, he said anyone incarcerated for marijuana should be released and\u00a0criminal records should be expunged of any marijuana charges. He supports removing marijuana from the list of Schedule 1\u00a0drugs, which says it has no medical use, to Schedule III, which would make it easier to research. The gateway drug theory says marijuana use can lead to the use of harder drugs such as heroin or cocaine because it fuels an appetite to experiment with other drugs and enters the user in\u00a0a social circle where other drugs are available. Critics of the theory say myriad factors contribute to addiction and no evidence has been found that pot's effects lead to hard drugs. \"It's a debate. Before I legalize it nationally, I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it,\" Biden\u00a0said. He said it \"is not irrational to do more scientific investigation to determine, which we have not done significantly enough, whether or not there are any things that relate to whether it's a gateway drug or not.\" The National Institute on Drug Abuse agrees with Biden that more study is needed. It said research shows that most users of hard drugs\u00a0tried marijuana first, but the majority of people who use marijuana don't go on to more dangerous substances. It said another explanation could be that\u00a0\"people who are more vulnerable to drug-taking are simply more likely to start with readily available substances such as marijuana, tobacco\u00a0or alcohol.\" Biden's stance contrasts with most other Democratic candidates who seek the nomination from voters who heavily favor legalization. According to a poll from the Pew Research Center that was released Thursday, 78% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say marijuana should be legal. Presidential pot:Why 2020 Democrats are ready to legalize marijuana More:Where the 2020 Democratic candidates for president stand on marijuana legalization Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed to legalize marijuana by executive order in his first 100 days if he is elected president. Sanders is a co-sponsor of a bill, along with\u00a0fellow 2020 candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet, that would make marijuana legal and expunge criminal records. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who acknowledged last month that he used pot a \"handful of times a long time ago,\" favors total legalization and\u00a0the expungement of records. He opposes incarceration for the possession of any drug. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have approved the use of recreational marijuana,\u00a0and 33 states allow the use of medical marijuana. Fifteen states have decriminalized marijuana possession. Contributing: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",

      "content": " MILWAUKEE \u2014 Support for impeachment has slipped in Wisconsin, according to Wednesday's Marquette University Law School Poll. And for the first time, President Donald Trump has surged ahead of all four top Democratic rivals in potential head-to-head matchups. Just 40% of Wisconsin registered voters believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 53% disagree, according to the survey The poll of 801 registered Wisconsin voters was conducted\u00a0Nov. 13 through Sunday, during the opening week of public hearings in the\u00a0House impeachment inquiry. In October, before public testimony\u00a0began, the Marquette poll showed that 44% said the president should be impeached and removed while 51% said he should not be. Diving deeper into this month's numbers on impeachment, 52%\u00a0said Trump asked the Ukraine president to investigate his political rivals, while 29% said he did not. Forty-one percent said Trump held up military aid to pressure the Ukraine president while 38% said he did not. \"We don't know how this story is going to end.\u00a0At the moment just over half think there was an ask,\" Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin said. Forty-two percent believe Trump did something seriously wrong, 9% thought he did something wrong, while 38% said he did not do something wrong. In head-to-head matchups,\u00a0Trump led former Vice President Joe Biden by 47% to 44%, within the poll's margin of error. In August, Biden led the president by 51% to 42%. \"Call it a small advantage to Trump,\" Franklin said. Trump led U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 48% to 45%, and had a lead of 48% to 43% over U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Trump had a significant advantage over South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 47% to 39%. \"Republicans have moved 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0points in the president's direction, whether it's on vote preference or support for him over impeachment,\" Franklin said. \"Democrats have become just a little bit, again 2, 3, 4\u00a0points less opposed to the president whether it's on impeachment or on vote\" preference. Marquette used a half sample of voters to poll Trump against U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. Trump led Klobuchar by 50% to 36%, while Booker led the president, 45% to 44%, well within a margin of error of plus or minus 5.8%. \"There are more younger voters in the Booker half sample than the Klobuchar half sample,\" Franklin explained. With 30% support, Biden was the first choice of those who say they'll vote in the April Democratic presidential primary. Sanders was at 17%, Warren slipped from 24% in October to 15%, Buttigieg was at 13%\u00a0and Booker and Klobuchar were at 3% each. Ten percent did not know who they would support. Voters' views on the economy are also looking up, with 42% saying the economy has improved in the last year and 35% saying\u00a0it would be better\u00a0next year. Last month, Trump's job approval was\u00a046%, against 51% disapproval. He ticked up to 47% approval in November. Voters approved of his handling of the economy by 55% to 43% disapproval. Just 55% approved of Trump's handling of foreign policy against 52% disapproval. Only 37% said the president's foreign policy has helped America's standing in the world while 53% said his policy\u00a0has hurt. The margin of error for the full sample was plus or minus 4.1%. On the Democratic primary poll, the margin of error was plus or minus 6.4%.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 After a day of playing defense on impeachment,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his allies spent Wednesday night attacking the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0and their views\u00a0\u2013 including support for impeachment. \"Democrats Have Been Obsessed With Impeachment from Day 1,\" said a statement from the \"rapid response\" arm of Trump's re-election campaign, one of a string of\u00a0emails, tweets, and texts sent by the president's supporters during the Democratic debate. At the end,\u00a0Trump campaign spokeswoman\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany said the \"2020 Democrats were short on solutions and heavy on their unhealthy obsession with taking down President Trump via an illegitimate coup.\" In the middle of the proceedings, Trump himself tweeted out his version of the highlights from a critical impeachment hearing earlier in the day, testimony that he said exonerates him. \"That means it's all over,\" Trump said in the video. Prior to the debate, Trump tweeted out a news story about poll numbers in Wisconsin. During the debate in Atlanta, the Democratic candidates for Trump's job cited evidence that he abused power by asking another country, Ukraine, to investigate one of their colleagues, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"We have to establish the principle no one is above the law,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0\"We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.\" Biden said he has learned one thing from the impeachment hearings: \"Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear.\" Throughout the day and the evening,\u00a0Trump and his supporters pushed back on testimony from a blockbuster impeachment witness. Ambassador Gordon Sondland said Trump appeared to support the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the country. Trump said he did not know Sondland \"very well,\" and cited the ambassador's\u00a0testimony that the president told him he did not want a \"quid quo pro\" from Ukraine over investigating the Bidens. Trump's campaign stayed busy throughout the debate, emailing and tweeting responses to the various candidates while arguing that the Democratic Party as a whole is backing impeachment for political reasons. \"The Democrat candidates continue to push the Ukraine scam in a desperate attempt to impeach President Donald Trump before he wins reelection in 2020,\" said a statement from the Republican National Committee. As for other issues,\u00a0Trump and the Republicans said Democrats want to raise taxes, increase government regulations, open the nation's borders, promote unlimited abortion rights, and impose climate change controls that will cost U.S. jobs. At one point, the campaign unit known as the\u00a0\"Trump War Room\" tweeted out video of Democratic candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticizing some party colleagues. \"Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,\" Gabbard said. The Trump-ites paid particular\u00a0attention to long-standing Democratic frontrunners Biden, Sen.Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. They also played up attacks on a new contender: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose poll numbers have shot up in the early contest states of Iowa and New Hampshire. \"Crime is rising, schools are suffering, and police are demoralized in the city Pete Buttigieg has managed for nearly eight years,\" said an email from the Trump campaign. For their part, the 2020 Democrats largely defined themselves in opposition to Trump. \"We can deal with Trump's\u00a0corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country,\" said Sanders, the Vermont senator. Trump's presidency, particularly the impeachment drive, hovered over the debate. \"It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate,\" tweeted David Axelrod, a political adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Kind of low energy.\" Hours before the event, during a tour of an\u00a0Apple manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said he\u00a0believes impeachment is an effort to defeat him in the 2020 election by Democrats who are angry over his 2016 victory. \"They are trying to take it away because they can't do it fairly,\" Trump said.",

      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2013 Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will not endorse a 2020 candidate until the early caucus\u00a0in Nevada concludes\u00a0in February. Donning a fedora, the senator-turned-kingmaker made a rare appearance before a roomful of reporters ahead of a fundraising event for 2020 Democrats at the Bellagio. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to start crossing people off the list,\u201d Reid said Sunday. One of the first four early-voting states in the Democratic nominating process, Nevada is a battleground where candidates look to prove the legitimacy of their campaign. Reid, who spent eight years as the Senate\u2019s top-ranking member and built a fabled voter turnout machine, left office the same month as Barack Obama, a close friend who he had encouraged to run for president. The storied Nevada senator talked about his distaste for dependency on polls numbers out of conservative-leaning\u00a0states like Iowa. \"Iowa is not representative of our country,\" Reid said. \"My personal feeling is I don\u2019t think it matters what happens in New Hampshire or Iowa.\" Pete Buttigieg\u00a0rocketed to\u00a0the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll\u00a0in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register\u2019s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register\u2019s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% \u2014 a 4 percentage point rise. Those four candidates began to pull away from the crowded field of Democrats and separate into a top tier of contenders in June's Iowa Poll. Biden, Warren and now Buttigieg have all taken turns atop the poll, with Sanders consistently in the top four. This latest poll underscores that separation. The group\u2019s next-closest competitor, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, trails well behind, at 6%. On Wednesday,\u00a0the House Intelligence Committee conducted the\u00a0first day of\u00a0public testimony\u00a0in the impeachment investigation\u00a0of President Donald Trump. The witnesses included\u00a0Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine,\u00a0and\u00a0George Kent, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. Reid applauded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her handling of the proceedings \u2013 a job he described as \"masterful.\" \"She\u2019s doing a remarkably good job in educating the American people as to what has gone on and whether or not she will move forward with impeachment,\" Reid said. \"Donald Trump has done irreparable damage to the Republican Party.\" The GOP will need time to recover from the Trump era and return to the party's roots, Reid said. \"Right now, those of us who served on the Senate prior to Trump look at the Republican senators and just shake our heads,\" Reid said. \"This isn\u2019t the way it used to be.\u201d Even in retirement, Reid wields\u00a0formidable political power \u2013 but he said there's no part of him that misses\u00a0Capitol Hill. He answered questions in a conference room at the Bellagio while sitting in a wheelchair. In 2018, he\u00a0underwent surgery\u00a0at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center in Baltimore to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas and later underwent\u00a0chemotherapy. Reid is content watching national politics unfold from Nevada. \u201cI believe in the Old Testament verse or two where it says that there\u2019s a time for planting and a time for harvesting, and that was my time in Washington,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI enjoyed every minute I was there, but I don\u2019t in any way want to be there now\u2026I did my time.\u201d Contributing: Des Moines Register.",

      "content": "   WASHINGTON -- Democrats clashed over taxes, health care and the direction of the party during a fast-paced debate in Atlanta on Wednesday, but the candidates agreed on the need to impeach President Donald Trump. Airing after an hours-long public impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill, the candidates were immediately asked about the president and the bombshell testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that Trump had created a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d scenario with Ukraine. \u201cWe have a criminal in the White House,\u201d Kalama Harris said. \u201cThe president felt free to break the law again and again and again and that is what has happened with Ukraine,\u201d Elizabeth Warren argued. \u201cWe have to establish the principle (that) no one is above the law.\u201d Trump has always cast a long shadow over the debates, but it was particularly true Wednesday as Americans continued to process hours of lengthy testimony delving into the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. That rub was clearly on display as the candidates attempted to break through wall-to-wall impeachment hearings coverage to elevate their own proposals. \u201cWe cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election,\u201d Bernie Sanders said. A Biden moment:Biden said you have to 'keep punching' to address domestic violence Is Tulsi a Democrat?:Gabbard prompts a brawl with Kamala Harris The debate came during what is potentially a reshuffling of the field, as Pete Buttigieg has surged in Iowa polling and the candidates have confronted the possibility of new challengers. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, is in the race but was not on stage. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid and is ready to spend millions. The debate was the first since Buttigieg has zoomed ahead in polling, but there was little sign initially that his higher status put a target on his back. There were few direct attacks on him during the first hour, and, at one point, Harris declined an opportunity to weigh into a controversy involving a stock image of a Kenyan woman on his website promoting a plan to address racial inequality. That changed as the debate neared its conclusion as Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar questioned his experience for the job. Buttigieg, whose rise has reportedly unnerved his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said that South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d On taxes, Warren began by touting her two-cent on the dollar tax on assets over $50 million. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. Booker criticized the plan, calling it \"cumbersome.\u201d Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. The next debate will take place Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. Biden touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was endorsed by the only African-American woman that has ever been elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself. Biden was likely referring to Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the Senate. The Illinois woman served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. As the stage erupted, Biden corrected himself to say the \u201cfirst\u201d African American woman. Things got testy between Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg during a lengthy exchange about what kind of experience is needed to be president. When Buttigieg suggested his military service prepared him to be commander in chief, the Hawaii congresswoman slammed him for saying this week he was open to sending troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels under certain circumstances. Buttigieg said Gabbard was taking his remarks out of context and then swiped back at her for meeting in 2017 with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in the country\u2019s civil war. \"If you're talking about experience, let's talk about judgment,\" Buttigieg said. \u201cI would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.\u201d Gabbard fired back, saying Buttigieg lacks the \u201ccourage\u201d to sit down with the nation\u2019s adversaries. -Michael Collins and John Fritze Two days after an association of Democratic\u00a0state\u00a0attorneys general became\u00a0the first national party committee\u00a0to impose an explicit abortion litmus test on its candidates,\u00a0Warren was asked whether there\u2019s room in the party for those who oppose abortion. Saying abortion rights are human rights and economic rights, Warren said they\u2019re fundamental to what the party stands for. She was pressed on whether the party should exclude recently-re-elected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards who has signed anti-abortion legislation. \u201cI have made clear what I think the party stands for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of the party.\u201d Klobuchar said she can\u2019t wait to be in a debate with Trump and tell him that 70% of the public support Roe v. Wade. \u201cHe is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said. Booker related abortion rights to voter suppression, saying it was voter suppression in Georgia that led to the election of a governor who supported anti-abortion legislation. - Maureen Groppe Cory Booker slammed Joe Biden for saying this week that he would not support legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. That view has put him at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties,\u00a0polls\u00a0show. - John Fritze Biden\u2019s response to how he would address domestic violence drew laughter for his unfortunate choice of words at the end of his response. The former vice president was on firm ground when he began his answer by reminding the audience that he authored legislation to address violence against women. He then argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said. \u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d - Maureen Groppe Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d -Michael Collins Biden and Sanders took issue with Steyer\u2019s claim to be the only candidate who would make addressing climate change his No. 1 as president. Steyer said he would declare a state of emergency over the issue on Day One and would also make it the top priority of his foreign policy. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Priority One,\u201d Steyer said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to get done.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from my friend,\u201d Biden interjected. He said that while he was working in the Obama administration on efforts to address climate change, Steyer was introducing more coal mines around the world. \u201cI welcome him back in the fold here,\u201d Biden said. Sanders said he\u2019s introduced legislation to declare climate change a national emergency and the government may also have to prosecute the fossil fuel industry for lying about how their product affects the planet. - Maureen Groppe Kamala Harris didn\u2019t mince words as she went on the attack over Donald Trump\u2019s policy in North Korea following reports that Kim Jong Un has no interest in another summit with the president. \u201cDonald Trump got punked,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d Would she make additional concessions to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table? No, Harris responded. Noting that Trump inherited North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons\u00a0program from the Obama administration \u2013 and other past administrations \u2013 Biden was asked how he would handle the issue differently from Obama. Biden pivoted to compare his approach to Trump\u2019s, saying he would work to rebuild U.S. alliances with allies in the region. -\u00a0John Fritze Cory Booker used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Pete Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in firsts place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. The New York Times recently reported that some candidates resent the attention and the campaign donations that have flowed Mayor Pete\u2019s way. - Michael Collins Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden offered subtly different answers over whether they believe Donald Trump should be prosecuted after his time in the White House is over. Sanders argued that no one is above the law and that, in his view, the president had obstructed justice and had committed other crimes. Biden said he would leave that decision to his Justice Department and that Democrats shouldn\u2019t go down the path of chanting \u201clock him up,\u201d a reference to a refrain often sounded at Trump campaign rallies about Hillary Clinton.\u00a0That chant has been heard at Sanders rallies, Maddow said. \u201cI would not direct my Justice Department like this president does,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI would not dictate who would be prosecuted.\u201d Sanders said he agreed with that part. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Sanders said, but then added: \u201cWhat I am of the opinion of is that the American people now do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d - John Fritze Buttigieg, whose recent surged in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has reportedly annoyed his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d He argued that he can go toe-to-toe with Trump because he comes from the kind of Rust Belt community that Trump is appealing to, his military experience and knows how to bring people together to get things done. A moderator followed up by asking Klobuchar about her recent comment that a female candidate with Buttigieg\u2019s experience probably would not have made it to the debate stage. First saying that she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be at the debate, she reiterated her belief that women candidates are held to a different standard. Otherwise, she quipped, people would be able to play the game \u201cName Your Favorite Woman President.\u201d \u201cWhich we can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, adding that female candidates, \u201chave to work harder, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d But if voters worry that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, she concluded, \u201cNancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d - Maureen Groppe It started with Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Tulsi claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from Kamala Harris, who accused Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and inuendoes because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\" What started it? Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard and that Gabbard was a \"favorite of the Russians.\" On Oct. 18, Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" -- John Fritze and Nicholas Wu Sen. Bernie Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during a discussion on health care. After Elizabeth Warren talked about the need to reform the nation\u2019s health care system and touted the benefits of Medicare for All, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his healthcare plan. - Michael Collins Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. President Barack Obama recently warned fellow Democrats that \u201cthis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.\u201d Asked about that in the context of Medicare for All, Sanders said Obama is right that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to tear down the system.\u201d But Washington does need to deliver on what the public wants, and people understand the health care system is \u201cnot only cruel, but dysfunctional,\u201d he said. - Maureen Groppe In past debates, Democrats opened with a lengthy exchange on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Elizabeth Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. What's Warren's plan?:Elizabeth Warren willing to show Bill Gates how much she'd tax him: 'I promise it's not $100 billion' \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" she said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome.' Saying that all the Democrats on stage support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" -\u00a0John Fritze Elizabeth Warren said she hoped ambassadorships would no longer be handed out \"to the highest bidder,\" a swipe at Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who spent much of Wednesday testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Appointing donors as ambassadors is nothing new \u2013 Democratic presidents did it, too. But Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about 30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Sondland gave $1 million to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen. \"These kinds of donations were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" - John Fritze The first question dived into the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with Warren being asked how she will try to convince her Republican colleagues to remove President Donald Trump if he is impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, `First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. Then Warren quickly pivoted to a key campaign theme of hers, corruption. \u201cHow did Ambassador (Gordon) Sondland get there?\u201d she asked of Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union whose dramatic testimony today of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d implicated top White House officials. Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said Sondland is an example of how money buys its way into Washington and, as president, she won\u2019t give away ambassadorships \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201d - Maureen Groppe The Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta is under way. Ten candidates will be seeking to differentiate themselves and break through hours of impeachment inquiry hearings earlier Wednesday. And that is the first question going to the candidates. -- John Fritze After October\u2019s three-hour debate, tonight\u2019s two-hour version may fly by. The candidates won\u2019t be giving opening statements and will have only about one minute at the end to make a final pitch. Tonight\u2019s questioners are an all-female panel of journalists: MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell join forces with Kristen Welker, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour are sponsoring the next debate on Dec. 19.\u00a0The Democratic National Committee has been ratcheting up the fundraising and polling levels that candidates must achieve to participate. - Maureen Groppe Although there are 10 candidates on stage, only three had a major presence outside Tyler Perry Studios. At least two dozen supporters of Pete Buttigieg held pickets with his campaign sign, at times chanting \u201cPETE FOR PRES.\u201d The Yang Gang was also out in full force. A huge fluorescent \u201cMATH\u201d sign was posted up and a man on stilts was walking around holding two large fans that said \u201cANDREW YANG.\u201d At times the group of supporters would chant some of Yang\u2019s signature phrases like \u201cPOWERPOINT.\u201d A group of Joe Biden supporters also represented the former Vice President. They would wave signs as cars passed by to enter Tyler Perry Studios. The largest groups outside the studios though were not for candidates, they were advocating for two different policies. A large group of advocates protested against family separation at the border and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. The demonstrators held banners that send \u201cEnd Deportations\u201d and \u201cChinga la migra.\u201d There were also demonstrators, who were mostly people color, advocating for charter schools. A marching band for KIPP Academy, a local charter school, marched in front of the gates of Tyler Perry Studios to advocate for charter schools. - Rebecca Morin Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is likely to get extra attention from both moderators and his fellow competitors because of his recent rise in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He\u2019s leading the field in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren can expect to be quizzed on her recent backing of a glide path into Medicare for All, a step she took after attacks from Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden that people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. Biden, who entered the race as the frontrunner, will be under pressure to show he can live up to that expectation. Unease about his performance so far is one reason why former Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval recently entered the race and why former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering it. - Maureen Groppe One candidate has been popping up on the television screens of early voting states a lot more than the others: Billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The $13 million he spent on advertising in the past month accounts for more than 50% of the total amount of advertising from all the candidates \u2013 including President Donald Trump, according to an analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project released Wednesday. \u201cResidents of early voting states are seeing many more television ads from presidential candidates this cycle than they did in the 2016 presidential race, and the reason can be summed up in one word: Steyer,\u201d said Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. What Steyer says:Tom Steyer shares his views on current issues Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock made their first ad buys in the past month. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also recently ramped up their spending. Buttigieg\u2019s recent surge in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire corresponds with his increased spending on both TV and digital ads, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not possible to attribute the surge entirely to his ad spending, it has certainly played some role in his recent success,\u201d Ridout said. \u201cA strong debate performance tonight, combined with continued heavy ad spending, could help cement his place in the top tier of Democratic candidates.\u201d The number of ads that have run is way up from a comparable point in the 2016 presidential race. One difference, however, is fewer ads are being paid for by outside groups. Candidates may have done so well at raising money from small-dollar donors that they haven\u2019t needed the support of political action committees that can collect large sums from wealthy donors, said Michael Franz, another co-director of the project. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he said, \u201cmany large-dollar donors may still be waiting out this race to see which horse to bet on.\u201d - Maureen Groppe",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary, sharply criticized Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday for attending a \"secret dinner\" with President Donald Trump. \"Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers,\" the senator from Massachusetts\u00a0tweeted. \"And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members \u2013 a major Trump donor \u2013 had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple.\" Warren's tweet linked to an\u00a0article from NBC News, which first reported Thursday that Zuckerberg joined Trump for a previously undisclosed dinner during his trip to Washington in October. \"As is normal for a CEO of a major US company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,\" a spokesman for Facebook told USA TODAY in a statement, though he could not confirm when the dinner took place. Mark Zuckerberg:Facebook is transparent about cleaning up hate speech and violence, others aren't More:Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook fact-checking policy with false ad saying Zuckerberg endorsed Trump Facebook board member Peter Thiel\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who donated to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign\u00a020and was a speaker that year at the Republican National Convention\u00a0\u2013 also attended the dinner, according to NBC News. It was not clear what was discussed at the dinner or why it was not disclosed before. \"This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability,\" Warren said of the dinner. She vowed that if elected president, she would not \"cozy up to Facebook\" and would \"root out corruption in Washington.\" Zuckerberg also had a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office when he went to Washington in September. Warren has long expressed distrust toward large corporations. And n a March op-ed posted on Medium, she announced that as president she would break up Facebook, Amazon and Google because those\u00a0companies have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In leaked audio from July, Zuckerberg said\u00a0he would \"go to the mat\" and \"fight\" any attempt to break up Facebook, and that if Warren \"gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\" he added. \"What would really 'suck'\u00a0is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren replied in a tweet. Warren and Zuckerberg butted heads again in October when she purchased an ad on Facebook that falsely claimed Zuckerberg and Facebook had endorsed Trump as a form of protest against the social media's policy that it would not fact check political ads on its site. \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks,\" Warren's ad said.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Ilhan Omar asked that a federal judge show \"compassion\u201d when sentencing the man who threatened to kill her. Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., 55, pleaded guilty Monday for threatening to assault and murder a United States official, and for being in possession of firearms, a Department of Justice statement says. These charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine. More:From impeachment testimony to Democratic debate, Wednesday could be wild Omar wrote\u00a0to Chief U.S. District Judge Frank P. Geraci that she acknowledges the crimes Carlineo pleaded guilty to are \u201cgrave\u201d and were a \u201cthreat against an entire religion, at a time of rising hate crimes against religious minorities in our country.\u201d But she\u00a0questions, \u201cwho are we as a nation if we respond to the threats of political retribution with retribution ourselves?\u201d and argues that a severe sentence would not \u201crehabilitate him.\u201d \u201cA punitive approach to criminal justice will not stop criminals like Mr. Carlineo from committing a crime again or prevent others from committing similar acts,\u201d Omar penned. \u201cOnly restorative justice can do that. He should understand the consequences of his actions, be given the opportunity to make amends and seek redemption.\u201d According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of New York, Carlineo called Omar\u2019s DC office in March and asked a staffer if they \u201cworked for the Muslim Brotherhood?\" \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a (expletive) terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull.\u00a0 Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her (expletive).\u201d The staff member recalled Carlineo saying, \u201cI\u2019ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.\u201d After the call, the threat was referred to the Threat Assessment Section of the United States Capitol Police who began an investigation in coordination with the FBI. He was arrested\u00a0in April. Omar was one of the first two Muslim women\u00a0elected to the United States House of Representatives. More:Woman who threw slushie on Matt Gaetz at Pensacola event sentenced to 15 days in prison Carlineo told investigators\u00a0that he was a \u201cpatriot, he loves the President, and that he hates radical Muslims in our government.\u201d His sentencing before Judge Geraci is scheduled for Feb. 14, 2020. \"If we truly want to prevent crimes like Mr. Carlineo's, we must address the root causes of these crimes,\"Omar added. \"The desire to commit violence is not inherent in people. People who threaten or commit violence are often themselves the victims of systemic alienation and neglect. They seek violence because they are taught violence. We must address the systemic alienation through community reintegration and social services.\" Carlineo,\u00a0a previously convicted felon, possessed a loaded .45-caliber handgun, three rifles, two shotguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition at his home in Addison, New York, prosecutors said. Having been convicted in 1998 of criminal mischief, he was legally prohibited from possessing a firearm. Her letter drew praise from Senator Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States whom Omar has endorsed. Omar wrote, \"We must teach the defendant love. For this reason, I do not believe the defendant would be served by a severe prison sentence or substantial financial fine and ask you to show compassion in your sentencing.\"",

      "content": "Ten candidates for president will be on stage Wednesday night\u00a0in the fifth debate of the Democratic primary. The debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post,\u00a0will start at 9 p.m. ET, last for two hours and\u00a0will be hosted at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta The debate comes in the midst of a shuffling among the top-tier of candidates. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has seen a surge in support in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, leading his rivals former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in some polls. But Buttigieg still trails his rivals in some key states and areas.\u00a0A recent poll in South Carolina showed him registering less than 1% support among black voters, a key voter bloc in the primary and a group\u00a0Democrats will need in the general election to win the White House. TV broadcast: MSNBC Online stream:\u00a0MSNBC.com, washingtonpost.com, and the NBC News and Washington Post mobile apps.\u00a0USATODAY.com also will provide live coverage throughout the night. Candidates will be arranged on the debate stage based on polling with the highest ranking\u00a0in the center. The following candidates will appear, in order from left to right: To qualify for the November debate, candidates must have received\u00a0individual donations from at least 165,000 people, consisting of at least 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.This is up from the previous requirement of 130,000 donors and at least 400 donors in 20 states, which were the marks set for the September and October debates. The polling threshold has also been bumped up but includes another category of polls that could be used to qualify. Candidates must stand at 3% or higher in at least four\u00a0approved national or early state polls. Or\u00a0they can reach 5% or higher in two early state polls. Early states include Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Two candidate who appeared on the October debate stage will not be on stage Wednesday. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro did not qualify and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas dropped out of the race earlier this month. The complete list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide Candidates will answer questions from a panel of moderators made up of all women. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, MSNBC host and NBC News\u00a0correspondent Andrea Mitchell, NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post reporter Ashley Parker will moderate. The announcement comes after criticism that the Democratic primary debates have so far lacked substantial discussion on\u00a0women's health issues. At the October debate, Harris\u00a0and\u00a0 Booker\u00a0both raised concerns about reproductive health care, and candidates chimed in later when a question on abortion was asked. Candidates will have 75 seconds to answers questions that are directed at them and 45 seconds for follow-ups, at the discretion of the moderators, according to NBC News.\u00a0Candidates also will be able to respond if they've been referred to by name by another candidate, but that is also at the moderators' discretion. They also will be asked a \"balance number of questions.\" There will be no opening statements\u00a0and three commercial breaks, according to NBC News.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a top-tier candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary field, used an op-ed published Monday in the Columbia Journalism Review\u00a0to release\u00a0his plan to \u201ctake concrete action\u201d against \u201ctoday\u2019s assaults on journalism by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley, and Donald Trump,\u201d calling the situation a \"crisis.\" Sanders writes that the convergence of several trends has resulted in the \u201cdecimation of journalism\u201d as communities have lost local newspapers and newsrooms have lost employees. Newsroom employment across the country has declined by a quarter since 2008, Sanders writes, citing government data analyzed by\u00a0the Pew Research Center. \u201cAt precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis, the climate emergency, and economic inequality, we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip, as local news outlets are eviscerated,\u201d Sanders writes. News outlets\u00a0have been looking\u00a0for ways to make money as traditional advertising dries up and jobs cuts have been necessary. Sanders acknowledges that much of that revenue\u00a0potentially still exists in digital advertising, but that that\u00a0money largely goes to Facebook and Google, who \u201ccontrol 60 percent of the entire digital advertising market.\u201d Sanders also faults\u00a0mergers between outlets and conglomerates, and greed from places like Wall Street. For example, he mentions the proposed acquisition of Gannett by Gatehouse Media.\u00a0Gannett owns USA TODAY and more than 100 other daily publications and digital marketing services. If he is elected president\u00a0in 2020, Sanders said his administration will start \u201crequiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs.\u201d The senator also said he would appoint an attorney general who will enforce antitrust laws against \"tech giants like Facebook and Google, to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk, and defund news organizations.\u201d \"Their monopoly power has particularly harmed small, independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back,\" Sanders added. On top of also appointing \u201cnew, progressive leadership at the FCC\u201d Sanders writes that he will appoint\u00a0Federal Trade Commission officials who will, along with his attorney general, enforce antitrust laws against companies like Facebook and Google. Additionally, Sanders would work to pass his Workplace Democracy Plan, which boosts media workers' efforts to form unions. Sanders plan comes at a time when\u00a0violence and mistrust against the media is on the rise. According to the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, the U.S. was among the top five deadliest countries\u00a0for journalists in 2018. Additionally. the US Press Freedom Tracker has recorded 27 attacks against journalists so far this year. In the op-ed, Sanders also takes on President Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s dislike\u00a0of the media, which he frequently calls \"fake news.\" \u201cWe also know that Donald Trump is making things far worse. He is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies,\u201d Sanders pens. \u201cWorse, he has called the media the 'enemy of the people'\u00a0in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected. But let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse,\u201d he continues. This plan comes despite Sanders recently\u00a0growing frustrated himself with the media, included suggesting that Jeff Bezos, who owns both Amazon and the Washington Post, had influenced the Post\u2019s coverage of his campaign. At a town hall,\u00a0Sanders suggested that some critical coverage was linked to his own criticism of Amazon, noting that Amazon paid little corporate tax last year. More:Washington Post editor says Bernie Sanders favoring 'conspiracy theory' by linking coverage to Amazon, Jeff Bezos Sanders is not the only 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful to announce a plan intended to help journalism. Entrepreneur\u00a0Andrew Yang has proposed a Local Journalism Fund, writing that the public \"should recognize that local journalism has a vital public function.\" In his op-ed, Sanders writes:\u00a0\"Our constitution\u2019s First Amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy. More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda.\"",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has released a $16.3 trillion climate plan that builds on\u00a0the Green New Deal\u00a0and calls for the United States to move to renewable energy across the economy by 2050 and declare climate change a national emergency. While the Vermont senator had already endorsed the sweeping Democratic proposal to combat climate change and had\u00a0teamed up with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0of New York on climate legislation, Sanders' climate plan provides the most detail yet on how he envisions the climate change moonshot taking shape if he is elected president. Sanders describes his plan, released Thursday, as a \"ten-year, nationwide mobilization centered on equity and humanity\" that would create 20 million new jobs. The Green New Deal resolution, which Ocasio-Cortez put forth with Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls on the nation to eliminate its carbon footprint by 2030 and to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Among Sanders' ideas is sourcing 100% of the country's electricity from renewable and zero-emissions power. He is calling for committing $2.18 trillion in grants for low- and middle-income families to weatherize and retrofit their homes and businesses, with the goal of reducing residential energy consumption by 30%. He would charge the Energy Department with making sure that both new and existing commercial structures, as well as high-income home owners, meet his administration's energy retrofitting goals. NATO force\u00a0announces:2 US service members killed in Afghanistan Sanders also is calling for an overhaul of the nation's transportation system by investing in electric vehicles, high-speed rail and expanded public transit. He calls for spending $526 billion in modernizing the electrical grid across the United States. In his plan, Sanders notes that communities of color are disproportionately affected by the climate emergency. He says the Green New Deal is an \"opportunity to uproot historical injustices and inequities to advance social, racial and economic justice.\" A Northern California community ravaged last November by the state's deadliest wildfire on record will serve as the backdrop for Sanders' climate announcement. Scientists and policymakers have blamed climate change for California's worsening wildfires, which have killed more than 100 people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes in recent years. As scientists warn of the imminent consequences of global warming, the Green New Deal has been a rallying point for liberals in the party's base as well as\u00a0Democratic presidential contenders\u00a0in the crowded field. But Republicans have argued that the plan is too radical and would drive the economy off a cliff and lead to a huge tax increase. Hundreds of thousands of Africans were enslaved in America:Wanda Tucker believes her relatives were the first Sanders is the latest Democratic presidential contender to release details of his climate plans. Former Vice President Joe Biden released\u00a0a $5 trillion-plus climate proposal\u00a0that he says would lead the U.S. to net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050, and he is calling for $1.7 trillion in federal spending over 10 years. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has\u00a0proposed investing $2 trillion\u00a0in federal funding in clean energy programs as part of a Green New Deal, including her Green Apollo Program to invest in clean energy research and development and a Green Marshall Plan devoted to encouraging countries to buy and use American-made clean energy technologies. Before abandoning his presidential bid Wednesday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who\u00a0staked his campaign\u00a0on the issue of climate change, released a $9 trillion plan to cut emissions. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke\u00a0called for spending $5 trillion\u00a0over 10 years to combat climate change. Sanders' plan calls for a $16.3 trillion investment, and the campaign is proposing covering the costs over 15 years by a patchwork of measures that includes eliminating existing fossil fuel subsidies and taxes on that industry; income tax revenue on the 20 million jobs created by his plan; and an estimated $1.3 trillion saved through a reduced need for safety net programs because of the creation of those jobs.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0In March, when\u00a0thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers in Los Angeles went on strike\u00a0over low pay and lack of benefits,\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to slam\u00a0the companies and accuse them of \"squeezing\" workers while executives cashed in. \"The drivers are fighting for living wages and better working conditions, and I stand with them,\u201d the U.S. senator from Massachusetts\u00a0wrote. That same day, her campaign\u00a0entered\u00a0expense reports for seven Lyft and 54 Uber charges totaling more than $850. Warren condemned the companies again in May for using a \u201cbusiness model [that] depends, in part, on low wages for their drivers.\u201d But between January and June, her campaign paid nearly $12,000 to the companies, according to public Federal Election Commission filings. The only candidate to top Warren on ride-sharing expenses was Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who\u00a0spent\u00a0almost $15,000. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is general counsel of Uber, though Harris also voiced support for striking drivers. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, who like Warren has frequently promised on the campaign trail to rein in big corporations,\u00a0has also complained about the ride-sharing companies. His message for the companies? \u201cThe greed has got to end.\u201d His campaign still spent over $9,000 on Ubers and Lyfts in the first half of 2019. Sanders and Warren were also among the top spenders at a few other large technology companies, a class of businesses they have railed against repeatedly. In total, the progressive senators paid almost two million dollars to Uber, Lyft, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Their criticisms range from the companies'\u00a0practices on labor to their policies on privacy. The candidates have objected to the working conditions at Amazon warehouses, which Sanders called \u201cunconscionable.\u201d Sanders also introduced legislation \u2013 the \u201cStop BEZOS Act\u201d \u2013 in\u00a0the Senate proposing a tax on Amazon over the public benefits its employees receive. The duo even wrote to CEO Jeff Bezos warning him to stop the company\u2019s \u201cpotentially illegal anti-union behavior\u201d after a video leaked last fall that warned managers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores of the consequences of unionizing. They have also been vocal critics of what they see as monopolistic tendencies at the company. Sanders singled out Amazon for \u201cmoving very rapidly to be a monopoly\u201d at a Washington Post event in July. Sanders also frequently remarks that Amazon \u201cdid not pay one nickel\u201d in federal income taxes, despite raking in billions in profits. Earlier this month, at a New Hampshire campaign event, Sanders noted that he talks about this \u201call of the time.\u201d \u201cAnd then I wonder why The Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, doesn\u2019t write particularly good articles about me. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Sanders in remarks that drew comparisons to the criticisms President Donald Trump regularly lobs at Bezos and the Post. Trump has tweeted or retweeted criticism of The Washington Post more than 50 times since running for president. He has repeatedly accused The Post of being a \"lobbyist newspaper\" that Bezos uses\u00a0\"as protection against antitrust claims\"\u00a0against Amazon, despite assurances from top editors that Bezos allows the newsroom \"to operate with full independence.\" Like Sanders, Trump has also criticized Amazon for not paying taxes, writing on Twitter in 2015 that they are a \"big tax shelter\" with the \"power to screw public.\" He has said he is looking into antitrust policy regarding Amazon as well as\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and Google \u2013\u00a0both of\u00a0which he has also accused of anti-conservative bias. Despite his qualms, the Trump campaign paid Amazon about $17,500 in six months. In contrast, the Sanders camp spent almost $140,000 on office supplies, event supplies, and technology from Amazon in the first two quarters, while Warren spent more than $80,000 on the same goods and services. No other candidate spent even close to that amount, with Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker, D-N.J.,\u00a0coming in third at $31,000. For her part, Warren sums up her concerns about Amazon by suggesting it is acting as both \u201cthe umpire\u201d and \u201cthe player\u201d in online retail by running both the sales platform and selling its own goods. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be an umpire and have a team in the game,\u201d she says. Amazon's ability to collect data and information on all its users gives it an unfair advantage in the marketplace, Warren has said. Amazon has pushed back on this narrative. In April, the corporate Amazon News Twitter account retweeted video from a town hall where Warren discussed why she wanted to break\u00a0up big tech. \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual sellers\u2019 data to launch private label products (which account for only about 1% of sales). And sellers aren\u2019t being \u201cknocked out\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re seeing record sales every year,\u201d the tweet said. Warren responded by accusing Amazon of \u201cintentionally\" misconstruing the facts. Both Sanders and Warren have pledged that, if elected, they will seek to break up Facebook, Google\u00a0and Amazon. Warren published a plan\u00a0on the subject on Medium, vowing to make \u201cbig, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\u201d She wants regulators to roll back\u00a0big tech mergers, like Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and online retail company Zappos; Google buying navigation app Waze and smart home products maker Nest; as well as Facebook purchasing messaging platform WhatsApp and photo-driven social media site Instagram. Warren was also a top spender on Google and Facebook, which do\u00a0business during presidential campaign cycles with internet advertising, digital media\u00a0and subscriptions. She spent over $440,000 on Google, second to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg who almost hit $500,000. And she purchased over $1.17 million of Facebook advertising, more than any other candidate. Yet she accused Google and Facebook of having \u201cscooped up\u201d content from other creators, and admonished companies that \u201chave a ton of our data\u201d when consumers ought to have \u201cmore control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.\u201d Other big spenders on Google and Facebook, such as\u00a0Buttigieg, have their own proposals for the companies. Buttigieg, for example,\u00a0believes it\u2019s too soon to contemplate breaking up any of the companies. Instead, he wants to empower the enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission with more staff, funding or authority. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including\u00a0blocking or reversing merges in cases where there\u2019s anti-competitive behavior by tech companies,\u201d he said during a townhall on CNN in April. Angie Kronenberg, chief advocate and general counsel of INCOMPAS \u2013 a trade association whose members include Facebook, Amazon, Google Fiber, Netflix and Twitter \u2013\u00a0said she was hardly surprised by the money Sanders and Warren were spending on companies they criticize. \u201cIn our experience, Americans have embraced tech innovations and services because it makes their lives easier and better,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to us that the campaigns also would be using these services because they\u2019re convenient and affordable.\u201d Kronenberg encouraged the candidates to \u201cembrace the experience\u201d that their campaign staffers and supporters are having with technology, including its \u201cconvenience,\u201d \u201caffordability,\u201d and positive impact on the economy. \u201cI do think that they need to embrace that experience as they consider potential implications for policy positions they may have in the campaigns and certainly if they\u2019re elected president,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cThe potential threat to the positive consumer experience could be very troubling to voters.\u201d The Federal Election Commission\u00a0only records direct disbursements from candidates\u2019 accounts. However, candidates can also buy Google and Facebook advertisements through third-party consultants or strategists. The two tech giants\u00a0have published transparency reports since May 2018 offering their most up-to-date totals for ad buys, and they show that Sanders and Warren have not withheld their funds. Warren topped the list at Google, per its transparency report, totaling $1.74\u00a0million. Buttigieg was just behind her at $1.7\u00a0million. Sanders' number totaled just over $750,000, which\u00a0placed him midway through the Democratic field, in seventh place, behind other candidates including\u00a0Harris and Vice President Joe Biden. But Sanders topped the list of Facebook ad buy totals since May 2018 on its transparency report, totaling over $2.5\u00a0million for the purchase of 34,000 ads. Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand and Biden spent similarly, at $2.48 million and $2.16\u00a0million respectively. Warren was not too far behind at just over $2\u00a0million. The only candidate spending more than any of the Democrats, according to Google and Facebook, was Trump. The Make America Great Again Committee spent $6 million on Google ads and nearly $11.5 million on Facebook ads since May 2018. Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.,\u00a0spent an additional $2 and $5 million dollars on Google and Facebook, respectively.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Whether you're ready for it or not, it's election season in America. For the next 15 months we'll be hearing political ads and debates, and reading columns concerning which political candidates give our city, county, state, or country the best chance to thrive. But what's particularly interesting about the 2020 elections is that, for the first time ever, there's likely to be a real focus and debate on cannabis reform. As you're probably aware, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug in the United States. That means it's wholly illegal, prone to abuse, and not considered to have any medical benefits, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the very first cannabidiol (CBD)-based oral medicine in June 2018. Yet according to various polls, the American public favors the legalization of recreational cannabis, and overwhelmingly supports patients' access to medical marijuana. This bifurcation between what the public appears to want in surveys, versus a body of lawmakers that has been unable to advance serious discussion on cannabis reform, is likely to come to head in the 2020 election. CBD crazy?\u00a0You\u2019ll be surprised by how many Americans use cannabidiol products Whereas President Donald Trump, the expected Republican nominee for a second term, has wavered on his support for legalizing marijuana at the federal level, nearly all Democratic candidates have come out in support of some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug. But perhaps no candidate has been more vocal about this stance than Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In 2016, when Sanders ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, ultimately losing out to Hillary Clinton, one of his many campaign promises was to reform America's justice system by legalizing marijuana. This made Sanders the first major presidential candidate to support legalizing cannabis, with many of his fellow Democrats also taking that view ahead of the 2020 election. But whereas many of Sanders' fellow Democrats have offered their support for legalization or decriminalization without laying out a specific plan on how to get that done, Sanders has proposed a unique means of bringing the green rush to the United States. As reported by Newsweek, Sanders would use a presidential executive order to make it so. A US veteran, mothers of American kids:Interactive border wall mural honors the deported While speaking with Joe Rogan on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Sanders had this to say: When I ran for president for the Democratic nomination in 2016, I talked about a broken criminal justice system, which ends up having in the United States more people in jail than any other country. And what I call for then, and I call for now, is the legalization of marijuana in America. That [marijuana's Schedule I classification] is insane. Heroin is a killer drug. You can argue the pluses and minuses of marijuana, but marijuana ain't heroin. So we have to end that, and that's what I will do as president of the United States. I believe we can do that through executive order, and I will do that. As you can imagine, any possibility of change at the federal level in the U.S. has cannabis companies excited. More specifically, it has established Canadian growers with deep pockets very intrigued. Let's remember that, even though Canada has legalized adult-use weed, legalization in the U.S. would dwarf Canada's annual pot sales, and any other country around the world, for that matter. This expectation of eventual reform is what enticed Canopy Growth, the largest marijuana stock in the world by market cap, to offer to buy Acreage Holdings\u00a0for $3.4 billion (when announced) on a contingent-rights basis. Shareholders have already approved the combination. The contingency, however, is that the U.S. federal government has to legalize marijuana. If that happens, in addition to Canopy paying Acreage shareholders $300 million upfront, they'll receive 0.5818 shares of Canopy Growth for each Acreage share they own. Sure, this deal gives Acreage access to Canopy's leading brands, but it's far more important for Canopy Growth, which would gain access to 20 U.S. states, as well as Acreage's more than seven dozen retail store licenses. Acreage has the infrastructure needed to make Canopy an instant success in a budding U.S. market, and the timing of this announcement (mid-April) suggests that the two parties see legalization occurring at the federal level sooner than later. Of course, Canopy Growth is far from alone. Around half of Canada's major weed growers have made plans to enter the U.S. hemp and/or cannabidiol (CBD) market in order to build business relationships and get valuable infrastructure in place on U.S. soil before a hopeful change in scheduling at the federal level. Heads up, Ford and Lincoln owners:MyFord Touch users could receive up to a $400 payout after class-action lawsuit While public opinion, and recent investments, would appear to favor the legalization of cannabis happening fairly soon in the U.S., this may not prove to be the case. For instance, only Sanders has suggested that an executive order to legalize marijuana is on the table. That means such a scenario may only work if Sanders becomes the Democratic nomination, and wins the election. There are no certainties, at the moment, who'll win the Democratic presidential nomination or the 2020 presidency. That makes it very difficult to predict whether or not cannabis has a shot at reform anytime in the near future. In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has made it clear through his actions that cannabis-related legislation isn't going to reach the Senate floor for debate. This suggests that the Senate may have to change hands from a Republican majority to a Democratic majority if marijuana reform is to stand a chance at passing on Capitol Hill. There's no doubt that cannabis reform has more potential to occur now in the U.S. than at any point over the past couple of decades. But that also doesn't mean it's a guarantee to happen anytime soon. Invest accordingly. Sean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden told an attendee at a South Carolina town hall Thursday evening, \"You should vote for Trump,\" after being criticized for deportations during the Obama administration. The immigration activist had started off by translating\u00a0questions asked in Spanish by another attendee, who asked if the former vice president would stop all deportations immediately upon taking office if elected. Biden responded, \"No. I will not stop all deportations. I will prioritize deportations, only people who have committed a felony or serious crime.\" The activist, identified by a CNN reporter as Carlos Rojas, later continued by telling Biden he had volunteered for former President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, but was disheartened by the number of deportations during his presidency. More:Undocumented immigrants on edge as Trump immigration policy calls for more deportations \"The fact is that over those eight years, there were 3 million people that were deported and separated from their families,\" Rojas said. Cutting Rojas off, Biden said, \"You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump.\" \"No, no. I'm not going to do that,\" Rojas responded. Biden said that those who commit felonies should be deported. \"No matter what happens, somebody who commits murder should be deported.\" He continued to say that there will be no family separations under his administration, to which some audience members said \"That's a lie.\" Crowd members\u00a0chanted \"Not one more deportation,\" preventing Biden from continuing to speak for several moments. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another 2020 candidate, commented on Twitter Friday: \"Joe Biden may not want the votes of those concerned about immigrant rights, but I do. Join our movement for justice.\" Fact check:Did the Obama administration separate families? The Obama administration is heavily criticized for its high levels of deportations, with the defense that individuals who committed crimes were prioritized for deportation. When asked during a primary debate whether he and Obama had made a mistake, Biden said that comparing their administration to Trump's is \"outrageous.\" \"The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\" Biden said of Obama, also touting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In his campaign, Biden is an advocate for immigration reform in the U.S. In a larger conversation about his stances on various issues, Biden has told USA TODAY that he does not support decriminalizing border crossings, as some other 2020 candidates including Sanders do. \"I don\u2019t believe crossing the border should be decriminalized, but unlike the Trump Administration, I will make sure that U.S. immigration law is enforced humanely,\" Biden said.

      "content": " WASHINGTON -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, sparred with the hosts of \"The View\" on Wednesday as he defended his policies and electability. The 77-year-old independent said he would work with politicians on the other side of the aisle if elected president in 2020. Sanders said he has \"conservative friends that I like and respect\" while expressing his view that President Donald Trump is a danger to the country. Co-host Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, cut Sanders\u00a0off. \"Can I hear, any in Congress or the Senate?\" she said. \"I\u2019m generally curious about bipartisanship. Can you name one?\" Sanders named Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican senator who recently announced his retirement due to health reasons. As Meghan McCain noted Isakson would be vacating his seat, Sanders continued by touting his relationship with John McCain. \"But they're dead,\" McCain started to say. \"Johnny is not dead,\" Sanders shot back. More:Meghan McCain says there will be 'a lot of violence' if assault weapons are banned Isakson's announcement that he will step down at the end of this year came in the middle of his term. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, a degenerative nervous system disorder, in 2013. Meghan McCain pressed Sanders\u00a0to name a Republican\u00a0currently in office that he can work with to achieve bipartisanship. Sanders finally named Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: \"Lamar is not a liar, Lamar is not a sexist, he's not a racist, he's not a homophobe. He's a conservative guy. It's called American politics.\" During Sanders' appearance on the daytime talk show, he was also pressed by co-host Whoopi Goldberg to address how he will deal with income inequality. She asked if he will change that, as she said candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang had pledged to do on a previous episode of the show. Sanders said, \"Of course I'll change it,\" Sanders said. \"Well, how do I know this?\" Goldberg replied. \"Because I've been talking about it for 25 years,\"\u00a0Sanders said, seemingly frustrated. Sanders also talked about his ability to defeat the current president in the 2020 election should he win the Democratic nomination, disagreeing with the idea that only a moderate Democratic candidate could take on Trump. \"I think the agenda that I am bringing forth is the most progressive agenda ever brought forth by any candidate \u2014serious candidate\u2060\u2014running for president of the United States,\" Sanders said.",

With Iowa's caucuses looming in February, a sense of urgency is growing among the candidates as the primary contest turns into a fierce battle for a limited pool of cash. President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee, meanwhile, have a huge cash advantage. They announced Tuesday that they collectively raised $125 million for Trump\u2019s reelection.

      "content": " Bernie Sanders took aim at Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden on Friday, telling a Carson City, Nevada, audience that the former vice president had distorted Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal during Thursday\u2019s nationally televised debate. Sanders, a two-time presidential contender, said he was dispirited by the on-stage exchange at Texas Southern University, where Biden attacked Sanders\u2019 single payer health plan as too costly. Sanders went on to deride what he saw as Biden\u2019s willingness to \u201cparrot\u201d the health insurance industry\u2019s talking points. \u201cApparently the Vice President thinks its just wonderful for people to be paying thousands of dollars per month in premiums and paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d Sanders said in front of a crowd of around 300 supporters gathered for a town hall at the Carson City Community Center. \u201cWell, I think those are problems.\u201d Sanders spent much of the rest of the event listening to audience members who had struggled with the skyrocketing cost of health care, including a recently laid off Trump supporter. Castro-Biden feud:Why Julian Castro's attack on Joe Biden's age fell flat at Democratic debate Bill Herron, 56, told Sanders he lost his insurance along with his job at PepBoys. He wondered what the longtime independent senator from Vermont could do to help him and others facing a lapse in health care coverage. The exchange started combatively, with Sanders and Herron shouting over each other about the state of the health care system. But it ended with the pair locked in a half-hug, as Sanders asked Herron to help him take on entrenched corporate health care interests. \u201cWork with me to tell the drug companies and the insurance companies that the function of health care is to provide quality care to all of these people,\u201d Sanders said, using a free hand to\u00a0gesture to a crowd that was already giving him a standing ovation. Biden and Castro:Biden campaign calls Julian Castro's attack a 'cheap shot' as both campaign off Democratic debate feud The moment stood out as a highlight for many in the audience, including Darren Jenkins, a Sanders supporter from Carson City. \u201cI love Bernie, he\u2019s going to be the next president of the United States,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cLook at the way he had that Trump supporter come up. He put his arm around him and talked to him, with kindness and love.\u201d Sanders adopted a sharper tone for his second stop, a \u201cCollege For All\u201d rally on the campus of the University of Nevada\u2013Reno. The Houston debate:5 things we learned from the 2020 Democratic debate in Houston The 77-year-old self-described Democratic Socialist opened with a typically passionate rebuke aimed at the nation\u2019s top 1% of income earners, quickly revving up a crowd of hundreds of students gathered on the lawn in front of UNR\u2019s Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center. He later won loud applause for his pledges to cancel student debt, make college tuition free and end the war on drugs. His plan to create a universal pre-kindergarten program received a similarly warm welcome, as did each mention of Sanders\u2019 activist-endorsed, $16 trillion climate change prevention plan. Overall, Sanders\u2019 latest appearance at UNR was less eventful than his previous stop on campus, when the progressive firebrand called out a small handful of pro-Trump supporters perched atop a nearby parking garage. The former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, is now polling about six percentage points behind front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden among likely Nevada caucusgoers. Can Democrats win Texas?:Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront Sanders won Washoe County\u2019s contentious 2016 Democratic presidential caucus before dropping the statewide vote to ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who ended up carrying Nevada in the general election. He has a pair of stops scheduled in Las Vegas on Saturday, including another campus appearance to discuss Latinx issues at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The line was a response to Sanders' oft-repeated line that he \"wrote the damn bill\" that would move to a Medicare-for-All health insurance system. Health care, and the fight over whether to make adjustments to Obamacare or to scrap it for additional government coverage, has dominated the opening moments of virtually every Democratic primary debate this year \u2013 and it has widely split the field. Klobuchar has said she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, and does not support the Medicare for All plan.

Bernie Sanders said in an interview with the Des Moines Register. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, was in Ames, Iowa, for the first of three rallies at each of Iowa\u2019s public universities when he first mentioned the incident. Chuckles initially rippled through the crowd, but Sanders didn't linger like it was a punchline. Instead, it's an example of Trump bending nonpolitical entities to his whims, Sanders said. \u201cIt's one thing for a president to draw a line on a map, that's totally absurd,\u201d the Vermont senator\u00a0said in the interview. \u201cBut then to have the appropriate agency\u00a0kind of back him up, that speaks to the authoritarian type of government that Trump is moving us to.\" Trump tweeted on Sept. 1 that\u00a0Hurricane Dorian was set to reach as far as Alabama when it made landfall. Forecasts at that point showed the storm moving sharply north, avoiding Alabama. What happened last week:Trump doubles down on debunked Alabama comments about Dorian's path The tweet spurred an immediate response from the Birmingham, Alabama, office of the National Weather Service saying Alabama wouldn't feel Dorian's effects. It led to a multi-day spat where Trump refused to give ground and presented an altered\u00a0weather service forecast map to bolster his position. On Wednesday,\u00a0Trump showed reporters in the White House a map that projected the storm\u2019s path with white lines. A black marker was reportedly\u00a0used to extend its path into Alabama. Forecasters did not predict the storm would hit Alabama when Trump tweeted his initial warning or when the map was presented. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service, issued an unattributed statement backing up Trump and disavowing the\u00a0tweet from Birmingham, Alabama. The local agency spoke \u201cin absolute terms that were inconsistent\u201d with the probabilities outlined in forecasts, the statement reads. \u201cThis is how much of a pathological liar he is,\u201d Sanders told a crowd of about 500 at Iowa State University on Sunday. \u201cDid you all see his famous black Sharpie?\u201d Chuckles rippled through the crowd, but Sanders did not pause for laughter. \u201cWhat was really scary about that, he got the appropriate agency, the NOAA, to change their views in order to correspond with his,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cAnd that's what authoritarianism is about.\u00a0You do what the guy on top wants, not what the facts are about.\" Sanders went further in an interview with the Register Monday. Regardless of your politics, he said,\u00a0people should not want \u201ca president who is moving this country forward into an authoritarian direction and who\u00a0is, in fact, a pathological liar.\" \u201cThe function of the agency (at)\u00a0hand is to give the American people accurate and important information on weather, storms and hurricanes, and not simply say what the president of the United States said is right,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo both of those factors, concerning what the president did, was ludicrous and outrageous. But it is even more frightening that we have an agency of government whose job is to provide incredibly important information to the American people backing up the president even when he's dead wrong.\" Nick Coltrain is a politics and data reporter for the Register.

Here are four questions answered about Tuesday's democratic debate: This will be the Democratic National Committee's fourth debate. It will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times, airing live at 8 p.m. EST. Viewers can watch the debate on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and it can be streamed through both CNN\u2019s and the New York Times' websites.

These battleground state leaders have some advice. The stage placement represents how candidates are polling.\u00a0It has become a three-way race leading into the October match-up as Biden, Warren, and Sanders are consistently polling in the top three, and they will be center stage for the second debate in a row. Gabbard and Steyer are additions\u00a0to this stage from the September debate, where 10 candidates faced off. Gabbard also said Monday\u00a0that she does plan\u00a0to attend the debate after she had previously\u00a0considered boycotting\u00a0what she claimed was \"a serious threat to our democracy\" by the Democratic National Committee\u00a0and the media. Sanders is also planning on appearing after canceling several campaign events following a heart attack and procedure a few weeks ago. The senator had two stents inserted, but recently said that he's \"going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\" Democratic debate:Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers This will be the first time the top democratic candidates have been together on one stage since the impeachment inquiry\u00a0against President Donald Trump was announced in late September by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that\u00a0subject could dominate some of the discussion as every candidate has now supported the inquiry. This comes at the same time Steyer will be looking to make waves during\u00a0his first appearance on the debate stage, and he has been making the case for impeachment for years. It may also add pressure to Biden, who has been a consistent front-runner for the nomination, as the inquiry puts his family at the center of the investigation into the president's dealings with Ukraine. The candidates may also address\u00a0Trump's decision to pull back U.S. forces from\u00a0northern Syria. This move\u00a0potentially enables\u00a0a resurgence of the Islamic State as\u00a0Turkey prepares a military assault against\u00a0Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. battle\u00a0the Islamic State. The president faces widespread backlash\u00a0for \"abandoning\" a U.S. ally. Other topics that could dominate the night include gun control and safety, immigration, LGBTQ rights\u00a0and health care.

And despite this being the largest primary debate, there are still a few\u00a0candidates who will not\u00a0be gracing the stage. These include: The DNC recently released more difficult requirements\u00a0candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the\u00a0October match-up,\u00a0potentially ending some campaigns.

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie\u00a0Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had\u00a0led each of the Register\u2019s three\u00a0previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide No other candidate reaches double digits. \u201cThis is the first major shakeup\u201d in what had\u00a0been a\u00a0fairly steady\u00a0race,\u00a0said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is\u00a0at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Eight others are polling at 1% or less. But the race is far from settled: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0their minds are\u00a0made up, while 63% say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. \u201cThe data in this poll seem to suggest the field is narrowing, but my sense is there\u2019s still opportunity aplenty,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThe leaders aren\u2019t all that strong. The universe is not locked in.\u201d The poll of 602 likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0was conducted Sept. 14-18, and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Other candidates have seen their Iowa Poll numbers briefly spike\u00a0\u2014\u00a0O\u2019Rourke hit double digits early after running in a competitive U.S. Senate race in Texas, then fell back.\u00a0Buttigieg surged after a well-received CNN town hall performance, then drops\u00a0in the new poll.\u00a0But no one in Iowa so far this cycle\u00a0has\u00a0seen Warren's steady and sustained momentum. The Register\u2019s first 2020 caucus poll, in December\u00a02018, pegged Warren's\u00a0support at 8%. In March, about two months after she first visited the state and formally announced she would run, that rose to 9%. In June, as Iowa Democrats began to marvel at her organizational strength, she rose to 15%\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though that poll\u2019s methodology differed somewhat from the others. Today, the universe of people who say they are considering Warren in some way\u00a0\u2014\u00a071% of likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is larger than it is for any other candidate. That includes 22% who say she is their first choice for president, 20% who say she is their second choice and another 29% who say they are actively considering her. Trailing her are: Biden (60%), Buttigieg (55%), Harris (55%), Sanders (50%), Booker (42%), O\u2019Rourke (38%) and Klobuchar (37%). It\u2019s also higher than where Warren was polling in June. Then, 61% of respondents were considering her in some way. \u201cThat appears to be a powerful leap forward and suggests that she can improve further, because she\u2019s got these people actively considering her and thinking of her as a second choice,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge number there. Those people can be converted.\u201d Warren is the best-liked candidate in the field:\u00a075% of likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0they view her favorably.\u00a0Next-best\u00a0are Buttigieg, who is viewed favorably by 69%, and Biden, at 66%. But Selzer said Warren\u2019s numbers also reveal some vulnerability. Among those who say she is their first choice for president, only 12% say their minds are\u00a0made up, while 88% say they could be persuaded to support another candidate. More Biden\u00a0supporters are\u00a0firm\u00a0in their choice: 26% say their mind is mind up, with 70% saying they could be persuaded. Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who have held first and second place, respectively, since last December\u00a0\u2014 have hit new lows, though they still outshine 16 other candidates. Their numbers aren\u2019t bad, Selzer said, but the downward trend line is troubling. Overall, the former vice president has slipped in each of the four Iowa Polls the Register has conducted this caucus cycle\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in terms of both support and favorability. In December 2018, 32% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0said Biden was their first choice for president. That\u2019s fallen in each poll as Biden reintroduces himself to Iowans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and as his competitors have targeted him as the polling front-runner. Biden\u2019s favorability rating also has fallen\u00a0\u2014\u00a082% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. Even among those who say Biden is their first choice for president, they\u2019re less enthusiastic than are supporters of other candidates. Twenty-eight percent of all poll respondents describe their feelings toward their first-choice candidate as \u201cextremely enthusiastic.\u201d But 32% of Warren supporters say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about their choice, compared with 22% of Biden supporters. Biden supporters are more likely to describe themselves as \u201cmildly enthusiastic\u201d (31%) than are Warren supporters (11%). Biden does best with older\u00a0caucusgoers,\u00a0winning the support of 35% of those 65 and older.\u00a0That demographic makes up about a quarter of likely\u00a0caucusgoers, and Biden is their top choice, with an almost 3-to-1 lead over Warren. But he struggles with young people. Just 9% of those younger than 35 say he is their first choice for president. Warren leads that demographic, at 27%. Sanders, too, has hit a new low among those younger than 35, falling from a high of 25% in March\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just after he announced he would run. He dropped to 16% in June and is at 11% today. Part of Sanders\u2019 problem: Warren has eaten into some of his key constituencies. Among those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. Thirty-two\u00a0percent say they will support Warren instead, and 12% opt for Buttigieg. Katie\u00a0Naset,\u00a0a 37-year-old poll respondent and Clive resident, said she caucused for Sanders in 2016 because he advanced a far-left agenda focused on issues such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d student loan debt relief and affordable child care. \u201cI aligned more closely with him than Hillary Clinton on those issues,\u201d the family law attorney said. \u201cBut at this point, Elizabeth Warren best approximates with where I am on these issues. She has bold, realistic ideas. They\u2019re backed with a lot of research and deliberate thought.\u201d Naset\u00a0is\u00a0among the 20% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0who describe themselves as \u201cvery liberal.\u201d\u00a0Of that group,\u00a048% back Warren and 20% support Sanders. Sanders\u00a0ties Warren among first-time\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0at 22%, and he's second to\u00a0her in generating support among young people. Twenty-two percent of those younger than 35 say Sanders is their first choice for president, trailing Warren by 5 percentage points. Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0say that nominating a candidate who has a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump is more important than nominating someone who shares their positions on major issues. Sixty-three percent say defeating Trump is more\u00a0important, and 31% say it\u2019s more important to find someone who aligns with them on the issues. Six percent are unsure. But what does electability\u00a0look like to likely Democratic caucusgoers? Asked which of two phrases better fits their definition of the more electable candidate, 74% choose\u00a0a candidate who can excite new voters and get them to show up, compared to 16%\u00a0who say it's someone who excites\u00a0the Democratic base. Sixty-three percent say a candidate who takes positions seeking to find common ground with Republicans is more electable than someone who takes positions moving the country to the left (28%). Fifty-seven percent say a candidate who represents a new generation of leadership is more electable than someone who has a long history of serving in government (28%). And when it comes to dealing with Trump, 54% say the candidate who will \u201ctake the high road\u201d is more electable than someone who will \u201cget in the mud as needed\u201d to take him on (35%). \u201cIt\u2019s very hard not to get down in the mud with him. He just kind of brings that out in people,\u201d said\u00a0J\u2019Andrea\u00a0Gibney, an 83-year-old poll respondent and Maynard resident. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to take the high road\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you can\u2019t be on his level or you\u2019re no better than he is.\u201d Gibney is among the 59% of likely\u00a0caucusogers\u00a0who believe\u00a0government will return to the way it was if Trump is removed from office in 2020.\u00a0Majorities of every demographic group agree. But 30% say they believe Trump\u2019s presidency has permanently changed the way American government works. Three candidates are polling at 1%: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former U.S. housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland. Two candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0author and activist Marianne Williamson and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are polling at 0%, when accounting for rounding. Three candidates had not a single person name them as their first choice for president: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended his campaign Friday, after polling had concluded; U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio; and former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania. Not a single person named de Blasio as either their first or second choice for president in three rounds of Register polling. \u201cThis is what lack of traction looks like in absolute terms,\u201d Selzer said of de Blasio\u2019s numbers. Among those candidates polling at 1% or below, Castro has the largest universe of people who are considering him in some capacity: 1% say he is their first choice, another 1% say he is their second choice and 20% say they are actively considering him, for a total of\u00a022%. But as he's become better known (71% can now rate their feelings toward him compared to 47% who could do so in June), Castro's unfavorability rating has nearly tripled. It's risen from 13% in June to 36% today. The data also suggest that Castro's performance in the Democratic debate earlier this month did him no favors with Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. On the Texas debate stage, Castro appeared to attack Biden's age, asking repeatedly whether the vice president had forgotten what he had said minutes earlier. Fifty-four percent of those who say they watched all of that debate view Castro unfavorably. He is viewed unfavorably by 23% of those who watched none of it. Delaney is the only other lower-polling candidate to crack double digits when looking at the full universe of people considering him in some way. However, that number\u00a0has shrunk to 10% from 18% since June. \u201cMost of them have come to Iowa at least once\u00a0\u2014\u00a0some of them many times,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve hired staff. They\u2019ve made an investment. And if you\u2019ve got people who are getting numbers above 50% and you\u2019re not getting 10%, you have to either really up your game or consider the alternative.\u201d But the caucus field typically doesn\u2019t crystallize until very late, and there is still opportunity for momentum, she said. The top three\u00a0candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Warren, Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014 account for just over half of first-choice votes, totaling\u00a053%. There are now 15\u00a0candidates vying for 47% of the remaining electorate. \u201cThose votes could start to coalesce around one of the also-rans and quite easily pop another candidate into double-digits as a contender,\u201d Selzer said.

Follow her on Twitter at @brianneDMR. The Iowa Poll, conducted September 14-18, 2019, for The Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 602 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 3,510 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex\u00a0and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. Questions based on the sample of 602 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses\u00a0have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.

A Drake University student told Sanders, of Vermont, he wanted to smooth political divisiveness with the question. He was part of a\u00a0youth forum sponsored by the Des Moines Register and Des Moines Public Schools. Sanders took a few steps, and, smile across his face, mimed getting punched in the gut. After a moment, Sanders, who long has sported snow white hair, joked\u00a0that he likes the color of the president\u2019s locks. Getting serious, Sanders told the student he\u00a0might not like what he says next. While he has some Republican colleagues in the Senate he respects and likes, the party\u00a0has moved far to the conservative right since the days of\u00a0President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he said. The current Republican president, however, is a racist, a sexist, a bigot and other pejoratives, Sanders said, a common line on his campaign stops. \u201cYou have to speak that out,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cAnd I have to do everything I can to take that kind of behavior on.\u201d Pressed on the question by a moderator, and Sanders took another swing at an answer. \u201cHe gets up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning to tweet,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by people who get up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d Nick Coltrain is a politics and data reporter for the Register.

Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,\u201d senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d Sanders, 78, later wrote on Twitter that he was \"feeling good\" and that his medical episode underscored the need for Medicare for All, his signature policy proposal that would lead to a massive expansion of the government\u00a0backed health-care system while doing away with private insurance. \"I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover,\" Sanders added. \"None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\" The Vermont senator is among the top contenders vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He trails former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the polls. Sanders has kept a breakneck campaign schedule since entering the race in February\u00a0and has been a prolific fundraiser. He announced this week that he had collected $25.3 million from small donors \u2013 the largest quarter for any Democratic candidate this year. The Democratic socialist has boasted that most of his campaign war chest\u00a0comes from small donors. The heart problem led to the postponement of a $1.3\u00a0million television advertising buy in Iowa this week, said the campaign's Midwest spokesman, Bill Neidhardt. Sanders had been scheduled to take part in a gun safety forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday and campaign in California in the coming days. President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and Sanders' Democratic presidential rivals took to social media to wish the Vermont senator a speedy recovery. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communication\u00a0director, said his team sent\u00a0Sanders \"our prayers and wish him a speedy recovery.\" Biden tweeted: \"Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.\" Warren said, \"Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to@BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.\" \"Thinking of @BernieSanders\u00a0today and wishing him a speedy recovery,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, another 2020 Democratic contender,\u00a0tweeted. \"If there's one thing I know about him, he's a fighter and I look forward to seeing him on the campaign trail soon.\" The Vermont senator is one of four septuagenarians battling for the White House in 2020. Does age matter?\u00a0Trump vs. Biden in Iowa: Septuagenarian rivals try to demonstrate vigor in head-to-head stops Trump is 73,\u00a0Biden is 76\u00a0and Warren is 70. The age of the contenders has been mostly a backburner issue\u00a0in the campaign. Forty-six percent of voters planning to attend Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses said it would be a disadvantage for a candidate to be older than 70, and 50% said\u00a0it would make no difference,\u00a0according to a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll\u00a0published in June. Three percent said they were unsure, and 1% said it would be\u00a0an advantage. The stent procedure comes at a moment when Sanders \u2013 despite maintaining a strong fundraising haul \u2013 had found his candidacy in a \u201cslow-moving decline\u201d as fellow progressive candidate Warren has moved up in the polls, said Daniel Schlozman, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. In his unsuccessful 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, Sanders found success in his head-to-head competition consolidating a range of opposition among Democratic primary voters to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and those on the left who questioned the centrist trajectory of the party. But in a crowded field \u2013 there are still 19 major Democratic candidates vying for the nomination \u2013 Sanders has had more difficulty making headway with voters. He stands in third place in\u00a0national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls. Sanders also sits in third place in polling of three of the first four caucus and primary states. \u201cAs of yesterday, Sanders faced strategic challenges in a multi-candidate race, where he faced a closely (ideologically) aligned and fast-rising candidate in Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Schlozman said. \u201cThose challenges haven\u2019t disappeared, and now there is a new concern on top of them. \"How he thinks his way through the issues of age and health is another difficult issue for a campaign that was already facing a ceiling as far as we could see unless something pretty substantial happened to shake the field out.\u201d Contributing: Nick Coltrain in Des Moines",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders canceled several planned Iowa events to recover from a heart attack, but\u00a0his Iowa campaign staff are\u00a0moving forward\u00a0with or without him on the stump. Sanders, who was hospitalized the night of Oct. 1 to have two stents inserted to clear blockages in his heart, has no current plans to return to Iowa. His only public event scheduled now is Tuesday's televised debate in Ohio. Tuesday evening,\u00a0he\u00a0told reporters\u00a0assembled outside of his home in Burlington, Vermont, that he's going to \"change the nature of the campaign a bit, and make sure I have the strength to do what I need to do.\" The Democratic presidential candidate told\u00a0NBC News on Wednesday he plans to \"get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\" albeit one where \"I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\" What that means for Sanders' Iowa campaign strategy wasn't immediately clear. Sanders\u00a0canceled one Iowa swing immediately after he was hospitalized\u00a0and a second appearance at an Iowa labor forum,\u00a0planned for Oct. 13. Sanders is slated to participate in a Des Moines forum on issues important to Latino voters on Oct. 24, but his\u00a0campaign staff couldn't confirm if that would happen. Before his heart attack, when Sanders would campaign\u00a0through Iowa, he'd pack his schedule with town halls, forums and rallies. At the end of September, his most recent visit, he held\u00a011 public events over four days, starting in Des Moines before moving from north-central Iowa down to its southeast corner. During those four days, he also\u00a0included two events in Oklahoma. The heart attack\u00a0led the campaign to delay a $1.3 million ad buy on Iowa TV markets. The two-week buy launched Tuesday, four days after it initially planned to air,\u00a0campaign spokesperson Bill Neidhardt said. The Iowa campaign hasn't stopped, however.\u00a0In early October, the campaign's national co-chair, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California, traveled across Iowa\u00a0as volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and worked phonebanks. \"We began this campaign with the intent to win Iowa, and we continue to intend to win Iowa,\" Neidhardt said. Iowa tends to see fewer presidential candidates in the days\u00a0leading up to televised Democratic debates, so Sanders' absence does not stand out as much as it would during other stretches. The Des Moines Register's candidate event tracker showed a bare schedule\u00a0wrapping up October among all candidates. Sanders, so far, has held the most public events in Iowa among\u00a0the top-polling candidates. Among candidates with more than 1% support in the latest\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, only U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has held 85 events, has had more Iowa stops than Sanders. Sanders has held 76 Iowa events this cycle. But campaigns tend to come to Iowa more frequently in the fall and winter leading up to the February caucuses.\u00a0U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris in particular has said she plans to focus on the first-in-the-nation nominating contest to prove her mettle as a candidate. She was in Iowa the first weekend of October and will be back next weekend. Sam Roecker, a Democratic strategist and consultant, said Sanders' absence from the campaign trail likely won't hurt him as much as it would a lesser-known candidate. But Sanders will need to keep his name in the national conversation and pivot focus\u00a0away from concerns of his health and fitness for the job. \"It's up in the air,\" Roecker said.\u00a0\"We're still at that point where people haven't made up their mind on who they're going to caucus for.\" But Sanders' health scare has not dissuaded his most fervent supporters. Alyssa Rooney, a 25-year-old social worker in Waterloo, has supported Sanders since the 2016 race. She points to his demanding schedule, routine of walks and basketball, and general vigor during campaign stops as evidence of overall physical fitness. \"People have health issues all the time,\" Rooney said in an interview.\u00a0\"Young people have health issues. For me, I read that he had this health scare but he was OK. For me, that was the end of it. It happened, but he can move on from it. \"I still believe he's the best person for the job.\"",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday. Trump \u2013 who has\u00a0a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58%\u00a0\u2013\u00a0trails\u00a0by\u00a0sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%);\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%);\u00a0South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%). Each of those Democratic candidates\u00a0performed\u00a0well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and\u00a0all of them expanded\u00a0those leads in this week's survey. Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is\u00a0not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances. Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that \"the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020\" won't start coming out until after the holiday season. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment \"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states,\" Johnson said. \"But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points.\" MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there\u00a0\"literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national\u00a0more than a year out from the election.\" \"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident,\" he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College. A recent poll\u00a0from\u00a0The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading\u00a0Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona. More:Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds According to the Post-ABC poll,\u00a0most Americans share\u00a0negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say\u00a0they don't think the president is\u00a0\"honest and trustworthy,\" 62% say\u00a0he lacks\u00a0presidential\u00a0temperament, 60% say\u00a0he does\u00a0not understand their problems, 55% say\u00a0he is not good at making political deals and 54% say\u00a0he is\u00a0not a strong leader. Fifty-four percent say the United States is\u00a0less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses\u00a0the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable. Forty-nine percent favor\u00a0impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill\u00a0Clinton's impeachment at 27% to\u00a041% in 1998. Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U.S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did\u00a0something wrong\u00a0\u2013 though 8% say they don't\u00a0think it was a serious matter. Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want\u00a0to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and\u00a030% say\u00a0they would prefer someone else. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and\u00a0Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When asked who has\u00a0the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say\u00a0Biden, 17% say\u00a0Warren and 16% say\u00a0Sanders. The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 using a random sample of 1,003 adults, and it has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

Bernie Sanders' position that billionaires should not exist, fellow employees began to laugh. Facebook CEO and co-founder Zuckerberg also chuckled after a moment's pause. Those in attendance at Thursday's\u00a0live-streamed town hall-style internal meeting\u00a0began supportively to applaud. \"It's a good question ... All right,\" Zuckerberg said. In the answer that followed, Zuckerberg \u2013 who,\u00a0with a net worth of $67 billion,\u00a0is listed by Forbes as the fourth wealthiest American\u00a0\u2013 said he was sympathetic to Sanders' views on income inequality. \"I understand where he's coming from,\" he said, noting he couldn't put a threshold on how much wealth is too much. \"At some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\" He went on to say he sees potential advantages to some\u00a0Americans' ability to accumulate even \"unreasonable\" amounts of wealth, too. Forbes 400:Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US Facebook encryption:Here's why the government doesn't want Facebook to encrypt your messages He cited his own philanthropic pledges as an example:\u00a0Zuckerberg and wife Dr. Priscilla Chan have pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime. Zuckerberg said that while critics might argue billionaires' charitable gifts would benefit the nation more as tax dollars,\u00a0he says his philanthropy is funding scientific research projects that would likely be ignored by the government. \"I think the alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff,\" he commented. \"Part of what makes progress happen is people taking different approaches to different things,\" he went on to say. The exchange happened at a weekly\u00a0\"internal Q&A\" that was publicly\u00a0live-streamed on\u00a0Zuckerberg's Facebook page. Usually the sessions are only for employees but a\u00a0previous Q&A session made headlines this week when Zuckerberg was heard saying in leaked audio\u00a0that he would\u00a0\"go to the mat\" to fight efforts aimed at breaking up the social networking giant. That sparked a response from another Democratic presidential hopeful: Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, who defended her plan to break up big tech companies. Zuckerberg was asked Thursday about Warren's plans and responded: \"Let's try not to antagonize her further.\" On Friday, Warren tweeted a video clip of the question and the start of Zuckerberg's response. \"If Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on,\" Warren tweeted, listing\u00a0protecting consumers' privacy, ensuring Facebook \"isn\u2019t undermining our election security\" and ending \"his company's illegal anticompetitive practices.\" Contributing: Kelly Tyko, Jessica Guynn,\u00a0Brett Molina",

WASHINGTON \u2014 After suffering a heart attack last week, Vermont senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders will no longer be participating in a televised\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0town hall on Thursday, according to CNN. The 2020 presidential hopeful felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas last week and had a blockage in one artery.

CNN and LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign announced at the end of CNN's 7-hour forum\u00a0on climate change that they would be partnering to host the Thursday town hall. The event\u00a0focused on LGBT issues comes after Trump administration policies that have\u00a0banned\u00a0transgender Americans from serving in the military,\u00a0prohibited\u00a0embassies from flying rainbow flags during Pride Month and\u00a0rolled\u00a0back\u00a0certain Obama-era nondiscrimination protections.

He currently stands in third place in national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls. The Vermont senator\u2019s health scare has brought age to the forefront of the 2020 race. Sanders is the oldest person running for President. The other top democratic contenders\u00a0are also the oldest.\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0follows Sanders at 76, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70.
