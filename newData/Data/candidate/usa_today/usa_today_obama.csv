I learned a lot, and the women there were amazing – there were lots of mentors there – like Wendy Goodman was a huge mentor to me – and then Mr. (S.I) Newhouse closed it. A mutual friend recommended me to Anna Wintour, and I went to Vogue. I ended up loving it and staying just shy of a decade, and at the end of the decade she asked me to work on Teen Vogue, this idea she had of a spinoff of Vogue for young people. I founded Teen Vogue and ran it for 13 years. Teen Vogue was editor-in-chief bootcamp: I learned how to run a team, how to hire people and manage them, make a digital product and how to be a mentor to other people and let them shine. It really prepared me for the next step, which was Architectural Digest. I hate to use a cliché like dream job, but I think all the currents of my life were pointing me towards AD. I’m fortunate that that’s what happened. I got to come full-circle back to where I started, back to shelter, after a long career in fashion, beauty and the teen world.
