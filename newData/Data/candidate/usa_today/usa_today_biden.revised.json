      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The two top Democratic contenders are carving out their lead in the sprawling primary field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are in a virtual tie in a\u00a0new Quinnipiac Poll published Wednesday, with Warren numerically ahead of Biden. This is the third poll in the past week that Warren has inched ahead of Biden, but the first poll nationally. Warren is at 27% among Democrat and Democratic-leaning voters nationally, according to the poll. Just last month, she was at 19% and trailing\u00a0Biden by 13 percentage points. Biden is at 25%, according to Wednesday's poll. He's dropped 7 percentage points from 32% last month. Wednesday's poll follows several early state polling where Warren has jumped ahead of Biden after trailing the former Vice President. Warren is numerically ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is closing in on Biden in Nevada. In all of the polls, Warren and Biden are within the margin of error. For Wednesday's poll, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,337 registered voters nationwide between Sept. 19 to 23, with 561 Democratic voters or Democratic leaning voters surveyed. Poll:More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada Sen. Bernie Sanders is the only other candidate to be in the double digits, standing at 16%. That is 1 percentage point up from August where he was at 15%. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 7%, up from 5% in August.\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris has fallen to 3%. She previously was at 7% last month. No other candidate is above 2% in this poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement that Warren and Biden are \"leaving the rest of the pack behind.\" \"After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\" he said. Malloy also points to the excitement Warren is garnering among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters. More:Trump administration releases transcript of call with Ukraine's President Zelensky amid impeachment inquiry According to the poll, 70% would be excited if she became the Democratic nominee, with only 18% saying they would not be excited.\u00a0 That is\u00a0higher than both Biden and Sanders. For Biden, 56% said they would be excited if he was the nominee with 35 percent saying they would not be excited. 55% of voters said the would be excited for Sanders as the nominee while 38% said the would not be. \"Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear,\" Malloy said.\u00a0\"She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee.\"",

      "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas businesses while forcefully calling again for an investigation into\u00a0President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know. Trump should be investigated.\u201d \u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\" Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me ... Ask the right questions.\u201d The comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported\u00a0discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump, and\u00a0Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Explaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story:What to know about the Trump-Congress standoff over a whistleblower complaint Multiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the\u00a0inspector general overseeing that\u00a0community concerning a phone call Trump\u00a0made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether\u00a0Trump pushed for\u00a0Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country. Hunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article\u00a0published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma\u2018s board of directors. Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once. \u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article. The Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation. Before Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a \"fine and routine conversation.\" \"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster,\" Trump tweeted. Biden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up. \u201cBe prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,\u201d Biden said. The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma. But\u00a0Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told\u00a0Bloomberg News Service in May\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko\u00a0told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call\u00a0repeatedly pressured Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Hunter Biden\u00a0and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter. Previously:Joe Biden: Trump's reported effort to get Ukraine president to investigate him 'abhorrent' Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president\u00a0in March 2016 called on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees,\u00a0according to the New York Times.\u00a0Shokin was voted out by parliament, but\u00a0no evidence showing\u00a0Biden\u00a0intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced. Still, Trump in a\u00a0May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government. \u201cLook at Joe Biden \u2026 he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don\u2019t you dare prosecute,'\" Trump said in the interview.\u00a0\"'If you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son \u2014 then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be OK. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\"",

      "content": "A new national opinion poll conducted by Monmouth University shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as the leading Democratic presidential candidates, though the poll also shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection to be unchanged since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry. Among registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Biden as the Democratic nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came in third place at 15%. Shortly before the poll's release, Sanders was hospitalized after suffering chest discomfort at a campaign event in Las Vegas. \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d said campaign adviser Jeff Weaver. The poll shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection among registered voters at 39%, an identical finding to Monmouth's August poll. His approval rating was 43%, and his unfavorable rating was 56%. Both South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., polled at 5%. Author and activist Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang polled at 2%. All other candidates polled at 1% or less. This poll, one of the qualifying polls for the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, does not change the makeup of the debate stage. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and businessman Tom Steyer polled at 1%, and Yang's polled at 2%, all below the 3% debate qualification threshold. More:2020 White House hopeful Bernie Sanders hospitalized after suffering chest pains More:Poll: Only 4 in 10 Republicans think Trump mentioned Biden on Ukraine call even though he acknowledged doing so Monmouth also surveyed voters about the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged pressuring of the Ukranian government to open an investigation into Biden. According to the poll, 43% of registered voters believe Trump's allegation that Biden had interfered in a Ukranian\u00a0government investigation into his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, though belief in that claim breaks along partisan lines. 67% of Republicans believed Trump's claim, in comparison with 19% of Democrats, and 45% of independents. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murra argued this finding could spell trouble for the Biden campaign \"The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,\"\u00a0said Murray. The poll of 434 registered Democratic voters was conducted from Sept. 23-29, with a 4.7\u00a0percentage point sampling margin of error. For the results about Trump's approval and the Ukraine controversy, Monmouth surveyed 1,018 registered voters, with a\u00a03.1 percentage point sampling of error.",

      "content": "CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA \u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused\u00a0President Trump of\u00a0 \"abhorrent\" behavior\u00a0amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country. Biden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the\u00a0inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump\u00a0made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether\u00a0Trump pushed for\u00a0Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country. \"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,\" Biden said in a statement Friday evening. \"This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\" Asked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son. \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa ... wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,\" Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues.\u00a0\"So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president.\u201d Biden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line\u00a0that he found it \"concerning to me that a president would do something like that.\" \u201cIt\u2019s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,\u201d Biden said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it before. I\u2019ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should.\u201d The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that\u00a0Biden, as vice president, had pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group.

Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president\u00a0in March 2016 called on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times.

And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\" Earlier Friday, Trump called reports of\u00a0the whistleblower complaint against him\u00a0a \u201cridiculous story\u201d and said his communications with other leaders were \u201cat the highest level always appropriate.\u201d Asked by reporters Friday if\u00a0he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d He said\u00a0it \"doesn't matter\" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u00a0and that it should be done anyway. Trump again attacked Biden in a Tweet on Saturday morning. He said his conversation with Zelensky was \"perfectly fine and routine.\" He added that, \"nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.\" Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris came to Biden's defense and hammered Trump over reports that he sought foreign help to go after a political rival. \u201cHe has openly invited interference,\" the California senator told reporters prior to a speech in Waterloo, Iowa. \"And now we have information that suggests that, again, he has engaged in that kind of behavior. What he fails to understand is that he is the president of the United States, and that the office of the president of the United States is the people\u2019s office \u2014 not his office. And he may be afraid of a candidate in this election.\" \"Well then win on\u00a0merit, but\u00a0leave Joe Biden alone in terms of being in cahoots and collaborating with a foreign government to attack our democracy,\" Harris said. \"That\u2019s what this is about. It's\u00a0really basic. Donald Trump appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America\u2019s democracy.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president \"sober and serious stuff.\" \"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,\u201d Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter that Congress'\u00a0failure to impeach Trump following the release earlier this year of the Mueller report made it \u201ccomplicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.\u201d \u201cDo your constitutional duty and impeach the president,\u201d Warren added. \u201cA president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won\u2019t either. Today\u2019s news confirmed he thinks he\u2019s above the law. If we do nothing, he\u2019ll be right.\u201d",

He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China. \u201cWhatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump later added.\u00a0His campaign, midway through his remarks, began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Pelosi reiterated during her call with Democrats that though she thought ill of Trump's comments, that's not what the impeachment investigation was about, stating, \u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the Constitution.\u00a0 His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons.\" \"The inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office.\u00a0 We will honor ours,\u201d she continued, according to the aide.

Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it,\u201d Pelosi stated. During a rally\u00a0in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Friday night, Trump\u00a0accused\u00a0Democrats of waging an \u201cunconstitutional and bullshit impeachment,\u201d to roars of the crowd.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 While President Donald Trump rails against the Biden family with a claim at the center of the Ukraine whistleblower controversy, Trump's sons are taking aim at the news media's reaction to Joe Biden's son,\u00a0Hunter Biden. Eric Trump wrote in an op-ed that there is a double standard in the treatment of Hunter Biden when compared to the Trump children. \"If the situation were reversed, I would have been front page news in every newspaper, online publication, and cable news outlet for the rest of my life,\" Eric Trump wrote in The Hill on Thursday. \"Reporters would be camping outside of my door, my family would have been picked apart, my name would have been smeared in the news every single week, and my father arguably would not even be president of the United States today.\" Trump and his political allies have, without credible evidence, pushed the allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas company linked to Hunter Biden. The prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was considered by the United States and other international groups to be ineffective at combating corruption in Ukraine. And Shokin's inquiry into the gas\u00a0company focused on a time period before Hunter Biden joined Burisma Holdings. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases Joe Biden denies that he or his son Hunter engaged in any wrongdoing. He has repeatedly pointed to news reports that have found no evidence of Trump's claims. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal. An impeachment inquiry into the president is focusing on\u00a0a whistleblower's claim that Trump put pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens. Eric Trump criticized the media for its coverage of the Eric Trump Foundation, later renamed Curetivity, which raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over several years. A Forbes report he cites found that Eric Trump had lied about some of his organization's expenses and profited off the charity. \"But can you imagine, if they were willing to try and destroy a 'kid'\u00a0who dedicated his life to pediatric cancer and philanthropy, what the media would say if I had secured a $50,000 a month job on the board of a Ukrainian company, with no discernible duties, in an industry I knew nothing about, in a country where I did not even speak the language?\" Eric Trump wrote. \"What if my father on live camera threatened to cut off military aid to that country unless the prosecutor investigating that company for corruption was fired?,\" he continued. Donald Trump Jr., too, says that the media coverage has been hypocritical. \"If I went to China and I did that... and I came back with $1.50\u2014not $1.5 billion\u2014$1.50, we would solve the media problem because their heads would explode, there'd be no fake news media left,\" Trump Jr. said on Fox News. The Trump brothers are in charge of the Trump Organization\u00a0in a position\u00a0they have held since their father was inaugurated, though Donald Trump still holds an ownership stake\u00a0in\u00a0the company.

The complaint, contained in a\u00a0letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, suggested that Trump's efforts \"constitute a serious and flagrant problem.\" Barr in firestorm:Attorney general thrust into spotlight of Trump Ukraine scandal \"The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,\" the whistleblower said. \"They told me that there was already a discussion ongoing with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood ... that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\" The complaint cites Trump's personal lawyer\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0as a \"central figure in this effort.\" \"Attorney General (William) Barr appears to be involved as well,\" the complaint says. A summary of Trump's call with Zelensky, which was released Wednesday by the White House,\u00a0indicated that the president repeatedly offered to enlist Barr\u00a0to help\u00a0Ukraine investigate Biden. The Justice Department said Wednesday that Barr was unaware until late last month that Trump\u00a0mentioned him in the phone call with Zelensky. Officials said Barr had no communication with Ukrainian officials. The complaint indicates\u00a0that the whistleblower did not know to what extent, \"if at all,\" Giuliani may have coordinated\u00a0his work with Barr. Acting Director of National Intelligence\u00a0Joseph Maguire\u00a0testified\u00a0before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday over his initial decision to block the complaint's transmission to members of Congress. After the complaint was filed Aug. 12, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, found it credible and urgent, the threshold necessary to inform lawmakers. Maguire and the Justice Department blocked Atkinson from immediately passing along its contents to Congress\u00a0as required by law. The standoff was resolved when the White House disclosed a summary of the\u00a0phone call, freeing the complaint to be transmitted to Capitol Hill. Outlined across nine pages, the complaint provides more details about Trump's call and the White House's alleged efforts to manage the political and legal implications if the communication was made public. The whistleblower described efforts to \"lock down\" information about the Zelensky call. \"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the whistleblower said. The complaint states that White House officials were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system where presidential call transcripts are typically stored. The complaint does not identify the White House officials or the lawyers. \u201cInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the whistleblower said. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d White House officials again denied that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine\u00a0and noted that the whistleblower acknowledged throughout the complaint having not personally witnessed many of the events\u00a0described. \u201cNothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2013 all of which show nothing improper,\"\u00a0White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \"The president took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelensky, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself. \u00a0That is because he has nothing to hide.\" The whistleblower describes communication\u00a0with more than a half-dozen U.S. officials that helped form the basis of the complaint. The complaint alleges repeated efforts by Giuliani to carry out Trump's stated goal: to push Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0in connection with the son's association with a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president and working with Ukraine's government. The complaint chronicles Giuliani's efforts,\u00a0beginning in the spring after Zelensky's election, to make Trump's case with the incoming Ukrainian administration. \"Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani's circumvention of the national security decision-making process to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kiev (the Ukrainian capital) and the president,\" the complaint says. Giuliani's actions were so alarming, the whistleblower said, that State Department officials spoke with the former New York mayor \"in an attempt to contain the damage to U.S. national security.\" \"During this same time frame, multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the president and President Zelensky would depend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to play ball,\" the whistleblower said. Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cIf you use your governmental position to get a benefit for yourself, whether political, monetary or otherwise, you can\u2019t do that. \u2026 This is about as serious as it gets,\u201d said Jeffrey Harris, who worked for\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0when Giuliani was the No. 3 Justice Department official during the Reagan administration. Paul Rosenzweig, a former Whitewater prosecutor under independent counsel Kenneth Star, said the case for Trump's impeachment is probably strengthened by a feature that Russia special counsel Robert Mueller did not have: Trump\u2019s own words. The administration's decision to release the summary of the president\u2019s call may have placed Trump in a precarious position in which his words can be used against him. \u201cThis is out of the horse\u2019s mouth. \u2026 Typically, admission by a defendant is the best form of evidence,\u201d said Rosenzweig,\u00a0a senior fellow at the R Street Institute.\u00a0\u201cIt seems to me almost impossible not to think that this is a big problem for the president. Instead of being able to say \u2018No collusion,\u2019 he now has to say, \u2018Yes collusion. Why does it matter?' \u201cIf the Mueller investigation had revealed that President Trump had had personal conversation with (Russia President) Vladimir Putin and promised him something \u2013 assistance in Syria in exchange for dirt about Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea \u2013 everybody would\u2019ve said that\u2019s collusion, that\u2019s conspiracy, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened here.\u201d Former federal prosecutors\u00a0said Giuliani\u2019s involvement indicates the president\u2019s desire to advance his own personal interest and political gain, not that of the United States. That Trump, according to the\u00a0whistleblower\u2019s allegations, used Giuliani to communicate with Ukraine shows a \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor in New York. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t acting as an envoy for the United States. He was acting as an envoy for an individual named Donald Trump. He does not have an official status. \u2026 He was carrying out personal business for Donald Trump.\"",

      "content": "Already under the threat of an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump said Thursday morning that China should investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. In 2013, shortly after traveling to China on an official visit with his father,\u00a0Hunter was issued a\u00a0Chinese business license for his new private equity fund. By\u00a0Lisa Gilbert The Ukraine scandal that unfolded with lightning speed has been stunning, and the ongoing revelations of corruption are even more so. Like a mafia don, President Donald Trump \u2014\u00a0having withheld nearly\u00a0$400\u00a0million in aid to Ukraine \u2014\u00a0put the squeeze on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. The pressure campaign spanned months and implicates Vice President Mike Pence's office, Attorney General William Barr and the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. But he didn\u2019t stop there. Just Thursday, Trump casually referenced to reporters the need for yet another foreign power to look into the Bidens, China. In addition, on Monday, news broke that Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help\u00a0Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Trump surely hopes will discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings. This was followed by the revelation that Barr also sought foreign assistance from British and Italian officials in investigating the Mueller report. And this is likely only just the beginning of the revelations to come. Game over for the NCAA:California law takes paying college athletes out of the NCAA's hands: Today's talker President Trump seems to think that if he keeps committing impeachable offenses, he can somehow normalize them and escape accountability. Yet in some ways, the barrage of news over the past week and a half has felt less shocking than it should have, because morally reprehensible, unethical and corrupt behavior is status quo for the Trump administration, and conflicts of interest, self-dealing and mobster tactics have become the new normal. When caught, Trump simply cranks up the spin machine, attacks his opponents and deflects attention by raising tariffs or rolling out another harsh immigration policy. And the country turns its attention to the next story. Trump\u2019s behavior in this latest scandal shows us how much he depends on the nation taking ethics violations for granted and how important it is that we shake off this desensitization as an impeachment inquiry to hold the president accountable becomes our new reality. The danger, of course, is that we won\u2019t. After all, the Ukraine scandal is right in line with Trump\u2019s pattern of corrupt behavior, and he is relying on the tried-and-true spin tactics that have seen him through his 2 1/2\u00a0years in office despite unceasing scandalous ethics revelations. Consider Trump\u2019s properties, which he still owns even though his family is managing them. Any money spent at those properties goes into Trump\u2019s pocket. Anyone who wants to try to influence Trump \u2014\u00a0including foreign leaders \u2014\u00a0can do so by staying at his hotels or frequenting his golf courses. When foreign leaders do it, it\u2019s a violation of the Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption (emoluments) clause. It happens routinely, mostly without our knowledge. It\u2019s hardly news anymore. Foreign leaders make sure Trump knows that they spend money at his businesses. In the July 25 phone call with Trump, Zelensky noted that on a previous trip to the United States, he stayed at the Trump International Hotel and Tower near Central Park in New York City. Then consider Trump\u2019s family. It\u2019s ironic that Trump was pushing Zelensky to uncover the \u201ccorruption\u201d surrounding Biden's son, given the unsavoriness surrounding the Trump brood. For example, this\u00a0Father\u2019s Day, Ivanka Trump tweeted a photo with her father\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. In doing so, she likely violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their official positions to influence an election. Still worse, she did this just days after the Office of Special Counsel found repeated violations of this law by counselor Kellyanne Conway and recommended that she be fired. This type of behavior has been endemic in this administration, so it\u2019s more than a little rich for Trump to anoint himself a crusader against corruption involving familial ties. While it\u2019s possible that Hunter Biden was selected to do business in Ukraine because he was the vice president\u2019s son (and Joe Biden could have asked him not to take the job), the claims of corruption allegedly committed by the Bidens in Ukraine have been debunked. So when the whistleblower complaint and a call summary showed that the president had solicited a thing\u00a0arguably of monetary value from the president of Ukraine in connection with U.S. elections \u2014\u00a0a violation of federal campaign finance laws \u2014\u00a0it might have felt like just another drop of water in the tidal wave of corruption that has washed over the country since Trump took office. Indeed, the administration is trying to make the situation appear like a just a regular day at the office, with Trump spewing lies to undermine and spin. However, as we all assess this clear story of extortion, we must remember that what Trump himself has admitted doing is a shocking abuse of power that threatens the foundational principles of our constitutional democracy. And that is not normal. Lisa Gilbert is the\u00a0vice president of legislative affairs at\u00a0Public Citizen. Follow her on Twitter\u00a0@Lisa_PubCitizen Sarah Chayes,\u00a0 The Atlantic: \"Biden was one of the most vocal champions of anti-corruption efforts in the Obama administration. So when this same Biden\u00a0takes his son with him to China aboard Air Force Two, and within days Hunter joins the board of an investment advisory firm with stakes in China\u00a0... Joe Biden has enabled this brand of practice, made it bipartisan orthodoxy. And the ethical standard in these cases \u2014 people\u2019s basic understanding of right and wrong \u2014 becomes\u00a0whatever federal law allows. Which is a lot.\" David Axelrod,\u00a0\u00a0Twitter: \"The (Trump) China play today heightened my hunch that he expects bad news out of the closed door (Former Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt) Volker\u00a0hearing and wanted to change the subject. ... Another\u00a0motivation, obviously, if you do publicly with China what you did surreptitiously with Ukraine, it, by his\u00a0thinking, abets your argument that there\u2019s nothing wrong with enlisting other countries to go after your political enemies on your behalf.\" Tom Rogan,\u00a0\u00a0Washington Examiner: \"President Trump's phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine is\u00a0deeply problematic. But Joe Biden's decision to allow his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0to travel with him on a 2013 trip to China is a problem for the former vice president. ...\u00a0When you're dealing with the Chinese, the lines between business and politics aren't just blurred, they are often symbiotic. ... As the child of a vice president, Hunter would have been under Secret Service protection in 2013. Tempered to protective security\u00a0requirements, those records should now be released.\" Trump is at it again. Trying to deflect anything against him onto someone else. He knows that Biden probably has the best chance to beat him, hence Trump trying to get something on him. \u2014 Kay Jones Yeah, China should investigate ... because Trump trusts China, Ukraine\u00a0and Russia more than his FBI and CIA. \u2014\u00a0Tom Kane Trump is still better than\u00a0anyone the Democrats have running. \u2014\u00a0Jonathan Corbett I don't doubt that a whole lot of Democrats\u00a0would like to see Trump impeached; however, his support with his base is strong. \u2014\u00a0Fleetwood Davant",

The latter involved a video Trump posted attacking former Vice President Joe Biden that included an edited clip from the music video for Canadian rock band Nickelback's 2005 hit single \"Photograph,\" as well as a portion of the song. Twitter later removed the video over copyright concerns. \"This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner,\" reads Twitter's message in place of the video beneath Trump's tweet directing viewers to \"LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\" 'Did you hear me?':Furious Donald Trump blasts media over Ukraine, impeachment inquiry Perilous times for Trump:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds The video echoed\u00a0Trump's unsubstantiated allegations that\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden improperly used his influence in office to benefit his son\u00a0Hunter.\u00a0It opened with Biden telling reporters in Iowa, \"I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" before cutting to the clip of Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger holding aloft a framed photograph of\u00a0Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, on an apparent golf outing with two men, one of whom is labeled as a \"Ukraine gas exec\" in a video caption. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases But according to Fox News, that man is actually Devon Archer, Hunter Biden's business partner of several years. Politifact reported that their relationship dates back to at least 2008. Archer served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company\u00a0Burisma Holdings with Hunter Biden.\u00a0According to Fox News, the picture was taken in August 2014, about four months after Hunter Biden joined the board. No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has surfaced, but Trump's efforts to search for such proof is an the center of the impeachment inquiry that has been opened against him. According to a whistleblower complaint, Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and leveraged U.S. military aid to do so. Trump left the tweet up despite the removal of the video and opened a fresh tweet storm Thursday morning, posting more than 20 tweets and retweets before 8:30\u00a0EDT. The tweets included insults for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, whom Trump called a \"lying disaster\" and \"a lowlife who should resign\" and several retweets of conservative commentators' posts. Trump also complimented a Twitter user named \"Kellie\" for a post criticizing 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg that read, \"What an actress! 'I should be in school.'\u00a0She\u2019s getting the best education socialism can steal. I won\u2019t be held hostage by someone who just got a learner\u2019s permit. Sorry kiddo! Tell Al to try again.\" \"Keep up the great work Kellie!\" Trump tweeted in response. He also continued to hurl allegations against Biden, quoting Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who claimed new documents obtained by Fox News show that a Ukrainian prosecutor said he was pulled off of an investigation involving Hunter Biden's firm. Another retweet featured an Associated Press photograph of Biden kissing an unidentified\u00a0usher at a Little League World Series Championship game in August 2009. \"Biden to trump\u00a0\u2013 'I am creepy,'\" read the tweet.

      "content": "The release of a summary of President Donald Trump's controversial phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president has intensified Democrats\u2019 contention that the president committed an impeachable offense\u00a0by asking a foreign leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But even as Democrats express outrage over Trump\u2019s apparent desire for Ukraine officials to dig up dirt on Biden, the impeachment inquiry has created\u00a0a complicated dynamic for the former vice president and top 2020 presidential contender, political analysts, voters and Democratic strategists say. The scandal has also put the spotlight on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s past work for a Ukraine energy company and given Trump the opportunity to raise doubts about Biden with voters, analysts say. No proof has emerged to support Trump's allegations about Biden and Ukraine. But as Trump's interaction with Ukraine percolates\u00a0in the headlines, potentially\u00a0for months to come, will the facts be obscured for voters? \u201cThere is a real concern for Biden that many people aren\u2019t going to take the time to sort out the issues and make a decision about what\u2019s right and wrong,\u201d says Karen Kedrowski, a political scientist at Iowa State University. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s really going to contribute to this general idea Trump\u2019s wants to push that there is something smarmy about Biden. It\u2019s exactly what Trump did to Hillary Clinton.\u201d The situation also comes amidst the release of a pair of polls \u2014\u00a0a national survey and one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa\u00a0\u2014 in recent days that show Biden in a dead heat\u00a0with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the battle for the Democratic nomination. While the nomination race is tightening, multiple polls have shown Biden leading Trump by a wider margin in a head-to-head race than any other Democratic candidate. As details of Trump\u2019s July 25 call in which he urged Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden became public, the former vice president and his campaign aides pushed back against unsubstantiated accusations floated by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy\u00a0Giuliani about the Bidens. Impeachment:What would it take to impeach Donald Trump? Here's how the constitutional process works Lawmakers get first look:'Deeply disturbing': Lawmakers read whistleblower complaint at center of Trump-Ukraine scandal More:'I would like you to do us a favor.' What Trump and Zelensky said in their July 25 phone call Trump and Giuliani contend that Biden, while vice president, forced the firing of Ukraine\u2019s then-top prosecutor Viktor Shokin because Shokin was investigating an oligarch connected to Burisma Group. Burisma is an\u00a0energy company where Hunter Biden previously held a seat on the board of directors that paid him $50,000 per month. But the Obama administration, along with several European nations, said they in fact pressed for the firing of Shokin because he was feckless in rooting out corruption in the Eastern European nation. The attempt by Trump to turn the focus on Biden and his son has enraged the former vice president and some of his surrogates. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t treason, what is?\u201d said South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a top Biden backer in the Palmetto state, which will hold the fourth primary of 2020 election cycle. \u201cThis is clear cut. (Trump) concedes he called a foreign power. He concedes he asked them to investigate the Bidens. He implied that the foreign aid was conditioned on him doing an investigation. If you recruit a foreign power to interfere in our elections, that\u2019s treason.\u201d Following the release of the summary of the Trump-Zelensky call, Biden on Wednesday called it \"a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath.\" Biden added in a statement that he hoped to turn the page as Congress moves forward with its impeachment inquiry and focus on presenting his vision to voters. \"I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families,\" Biden said. Biden, who spent more than 40 years in elected office, is fiercely protective of his family and speaks often of the inspiration of his late son Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general who died in 2015 of brain cancer while the former vice president was still in office. He more rarely speaks publicly of Hunter Biden, 49, a Yale-educated attorney who worked as an\u00a0executive for the Delaware-based banks MBNA, a top campaign contributor to Biden's senate campaigns,\u00a0and also did lucrative work as a lobbyist and was partner in a advisory\u00a0firm. Hunter Biden earlier this year\u00a0spoke to the New Yorker magazine about\u00a0his years-long struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. He was kicked out of the Naval Reserve in 2014 after a failed drug test. The younger Biden,\u00a0who divorced in 2016 after 23 years of marriage, also grabbed headlines after it became public that he was dating his late brother\u2019s widow, Hallie. This past spring, Hunter then\u00a0married a South African\u00a0woman named Melissa Cohen. Biden told supporters at a fundraiser in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles Wednesday\u00a0that he anticipated that Trump would go after his family members. Biden recalled that as he pondered\u00a0whether to make a bid for the White House\u00a0that his grandchildren asked for a family meeting where they told him they were worried\u00a0that he wasn\u2019t going to run. \u201cI was worried because I knew what was going to happen if I ran,\" said Biden recalling conversations he had with his grandchildren. \"And they said, \u2018But we understand Pop\u2019 and then they each gave their own story that they had written out a note as to how mean they knew it was going to be, but why (we)\u00a0had to do it.\u201d Biden's son:Hunter Biden: A brief bio of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Miriam Kenning, 69, a Democrat from Ottumwa, Iowa, stopped Biden as he campaigned last weekend at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines amid reports of Trump pressuring Zelensky to probe the Bidens. She squeezed Biden\u2019s arm, thanked him for his service during the Obama administration, and told him to keep up the fight. In an interview, Kenning expressed outrage that Trump would attempt to encourage a foreign leader to investigate Biden. But Kenning also had a measure of concern that Trump could benefit by sullying Biden\u2019s reputation with swing voters as the impeachment inquiry plays out in Washington. \u201cOf course it impacts me,\u201d said Kenning, who said Biden is among five Democratic White House hopefuls she is weighing caucusing for in February. \u201cI worry about them battering him over his son\u2019s life. I just think when I go and knock on\u00a0doors of the little old ladies \u2014 and how all they get their information from\u00a0the local (conservative) news stations' coverage about all of this. What I fear the old ladies will be saying to me is, \u2018Biden wasn\u2019t right. Something is wrong.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s reality. And that\u2019s what\u2019s sad.\u201d The Trump-aligned Great America\u00a0PAC announced Wednesday plans for a six-figure ad buy in which they\u2019ll highlight Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China while his father served as vice president. The ads, which the PAC dubbed \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d will air on Fox News and online. Biden\u2019s campaign has also expressed frustration with the Trump team\u2019s efforts to try to turn Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal into an issue for Biden. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called on Biden to release transcripts of his calls with Ukraine and China officials during his time as vice president. Biden campaign national press secretary TJ Ducklo slammed McDaniel\u2019s request as nonsensical. \u201cImagine our disbelief\u00a0that Republicans called for Joe Biden to break the law and release classified transcripts he doesn't have access to or permission to release, given their track record for holding politicians who commit\u00a0crimes accountable and their general ethical and moral conduct across the board,\u201d Ducklo said. \u201cWith their newfound sense of transparency, will they also ask President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, something he promised to do nearly 4 years ago?\u201d Sam Johnson, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, said that situation could potentially prove to be a great opportunity for Biden. \u201cHis selling point has been that he could stand up to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt could potentially offer Joe the opportunity to have a unique conversation with Trump where he could say, \u2018Look, my family did nothing wrong and this is not how you act presidential.\u2019 This is an opportunity for him to show voters that he could stand a step above primary candidates and a step above Trump above himself.\u201d For now, it seems unlikely that Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals will raise questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is trailing Biden in the polls, said unequivocally in a CNN interview Tuesday that he would not raise questions about the former vice president\u2019s son to make his case for his own candidacy. \u201cI don't think we should allow this kind of \u2018whataboutism\u2019 that allows what was clearly an egregious pattern of behavior by this president to turn into an excuse to allow them to say, \u2018Look over there. Look at this thing that happened,\u2019\" Buttigieg said. \u201cWe are talking about an extraordinary, perhaps unprecedented breach of the oath of office by the American president, and if they tried to change the subject, we've got to make sure that that can't happen.\u201d Nevertheless, Biden faces a difficult task in having to fight Trump\u2019s efforts to muddy his record as voters begin to tune into the 2020 election, said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist. \u201cThere\u2019s a contamination effect on the Biden campaign,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEven though he isn\u2019t the bearer of the pathogen, he is forced to wear the surgical mask. It\u2019s not becoming in the course of the campaign \u2014 even if you\u2019re completely in the clear \u2014 to have to explain things that your opponent is saying about you even if they aren\u2019t true.\u201d",

      "content": "Let's stipulate up front that there is no proof \u00a0\u2014 despite\u00a0claims by President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0and his defenders \u2014\u00a0that\u00a0Joe Biden's son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0engaged in any legal wrongdoing while serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called\u00a0Burisma Holdings. Nor is there any credence to Trump's\u00a0charge that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed for the firing of the nation's chief prosecutor\u00a0to quash\u00a0an investigation of Burisma and its owner. And it's\u00a0bunk to suggest that the Bidens' action\u00a0are comparable with\u00a0Trump temporarily withholding nearly $400 million in military aid this year as he\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on his Democratic rival, an act that triggered the House impeachment inquiry. All that said, however, two\u00a0questions still stand: What was Hunter Biden thinking when he associated himself, and his family's good name,\u00a0with business dealings in\u00a0a\u00a0country so steeped in corruption?\u00a0And why didn't his dad, then vice president, more forcefully advise\u00a0him against it? It\u2019s untrue, as Trump asserted without evidence on Wednesday, that \u201cBiden and his son are stone-cold crooked.\u201d But the record does suggest poor judgment and imprudence by Hunter, who accepted a position on the Burisma board of directors in 2014, despite having no obvious qualifications for an energy post other than a gold-plated last name. To be sure, past U.S. leaders have struggled with errant or embarrassing\u00a0relatives; examples include President\u00a0Jimmy Carter's brother, Billy, and a son of\u00a0President\u00a0George H.W. Bush,\u00a0Neil, who both tried to cash in on their connections. Relatives of influential politicians often get investment and employment\u00a0opportunities unavailable to other mortals. Hunter Biden appears to have followed in that tradition when, at age 44, he accepted the Burisma director position,\u00a0earning up to\u00a0$50,000 a month. At the time,\u00a0Burisma and its owner\u00a0were under\u00a0intense scrutiny. Great Britain was investigating the company for money laundering. And prosecutors would later launch corruption probes. A\u00a0business associate of Hunter's, Chris Heinz, stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, urged Hunter against joining Burisma out of concern about reports of corruption, a Heinz spokesman\u00a0told The Washington Post.\u00a0Hunter Biden told The Post that he joined the board \"to help reform Burisma's practices.\"\u00a0It's unclear what he achieved. The\u00a0potential for conflicts was\u00a0rife. Prosecutors might avoid probing Burisma dealings out of fear of offending the vice president. Ukrainian oligarch and Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky might\u00a0claim high-level U.S. influence\u00a0 \u2014 even if not\u00a0true \u2014 by virtue of having a Biden on the\u00a0board. Joe Biden said he has never spoken to his son about the\u00a0directorship. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker that his father simply said, \"I hope you know what you are doing.\"\u00a0 Hunter, who has a history of financial problems and substance abuse, also said\u00a0that he now regrets taking the\u00a0board position:\u00a0\"I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against\" Joe Biden. Perhaps not. But he might well have predicted that his father would one day run for president again, and that there would be some explaining to do about Ukraine. The\u00a0day has arrived, and it has provided\u00a0Trump, himself an expert on nepotistic enrichment, a thread on which to hang his smear campaign. Hunter Biden's lawyer and Joe Biden's presidential campaign declined to provide an opposing view to this editorial.\u00a0Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement that the former vice president\u00a0\u201cacted at all times in a manner consistent with well-established executive branch ethics standards. He carried out the Obama-Biden\u00a0administration\u2019s policies without regard to any interests other than the public\u2019s and neither discussed this with his son nor was involved in any way with his son\u2019s private business pursuits.\u201d If you can't see this reader\u00a0poll, please refresh your page.",

Biden polled\u00a0at 48%, and Trump polled\u00a0at 39% in the poll' head-to-head matchups. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also held leads over Trump, though their leads were within the margin of error for the poll. Warren bested Trump 45%-41%, and Sanders led 45%-40%. Trump won Wisconsin by a narrow margin in 2016 \u2013 meaning that early polling could spell trouble for Trump going into the 2020 elections.

Asked about the current controversy surrounding Trump's pressuring of the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into Biden's son Hunter Biden, 62% of voters found it \"extremely,\" \"very,\" or \"somewhat\" concerning, and 30% were not concerned. Forty-two percent of voters said Trump needed to be impeached and removed from office, and 48% said he should not be impeached and removed. Reflecting partisan divisions, though, both the question about Ukraine and the question about impeachment split among party lines. Most Democrats found the Ukraine controversy concerning, whereas a majority of Republicans did not. Eighty-two percent of Democrats thought Trump needed to be impeached and removed from office, in contrast with only 4% of Republicans.

      "content": "When Donald Trump was revealed\u00a0to have urged Ukraine's president\u00a0in a phone call\u00a0to mount a politically motivated investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, Washington gasped.\u00a0Here, after all, was the U.S. president using the power, prestige and leverage of his office to pressure a dependent head of state to do his political dirty work. Even in an era when deviancy has been defined downward, it\u00a0was shocking. And, it turns out, not the whole story. In the ensuing days, it has become clear that the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was no isolated incident\u00a0but rather part of a months-long campaign to trade arms and prestige for political dirt. Trump wanted one\u00a0investigation into the Biden family and another that would lend credence to his conspiracy theories about the 2016 election. In return, he dangled the chance for a much-wanted face-to-face meeting between the two leaders, and he suspended\u00a0$391 million in military aid to Ukraine in an apparent bid to apply further pressure. Text messages provided to Congress by a former U.S. diplomat back up the initial account from an intelligence community whistleblower. Bill Taylor, the U.S. representative in Kyiv, states that a decision to withhold the\u00a0military\u00a0aid\u00a0to Ukraine was driven by Trump\u2019s determination to put the squeeze on Zelensky:\u00a0\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d REP. JIM JORDAN:Democrats trying to impeach President Trump are misusing\u00a0authority On top of all of that, last week Trump publicly asked China to investigate the Bidens as well.\u00a0That\u2019s a bit like being accused of robbing a liquor store and then going out and holding up\u00a0another one in broad daylight, arguing that if you do it all the time it must be OK. The bigger picture coming into focus is an extended campaign to strong-arm Ukraine into validating Trump\u2019s criticism of Biden by launching a well-publicized investigation. That amounts to Trump asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S.\u00a0election to his benefit. Ukraine, moreover, is no ordinary country\u00a0but rather a vital piece of America's national security interests in containing a belligerent Russia.\u00a0In 2014, Russia mounted an invasion from the Black Sea to occupy and annex Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. That same year, it began a proxy war in Ukraine\u2019s east in an effort to wrest even more territory from the fledgling nation, created in 1990 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the 1990s, the United States and other Western powers persuaded Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons and provided security assurances against Russian aggression. Ukraine is far from perfect. A string of inept governments and widespread corruption have\u00a0enabled Russian intervention. But the nation\u00a0needs American help, including military assistance. And it is clearly in America\u2019s\u00a0security interests to provide such help. Trump's effort\u00a0to subordinate these vital U.S. interests to his desire to smear a potential 2020 political rival is by far the most troubling aspect of what appears to be a global campaign to misuse U.S. government resources and lean on foreign powers to do Trump\u2019s political bidding. No less than the U.S. attorney general, William Barr, was dispatched to roam the world trying to convince foreign governments of investigate aspects of the 2016 election. Trump is trying to advance a bogus narrative that Russia\u2019s well-documented meddling in the election was minimal, and that the real story is that U.S. intelligence services were conspiring against Trump. In a matter of a few short weeks, so many\u00a0damning disclosures of malfeasance by Trump and his administration have\u00a0emerged that they are\u00a0hard to keep track of.\u00a0The evidence of the president\u2019s misuse of his powers\u00a0is extensive, well-documented and growing by the day.

All of this and more happened on Tuesday. It all stems from the\u00a0July 25 phone call\u00a0in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden and his son. A\u00a0whistleblower complaint alleges\u00a0Trump pressured Zelensky and also raised concerns about U.S. monetary aid that was delayed to Ukraine. We've rounded up the most important developments from today on impeachment: Trump and the State Department blocked\u00a0European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland from appearing before a trio of congressional committees to answer questions about his role in pushing Ukraine's president to investigate Biden. In response, House Democrats issued a subpoena, demanding he hand over key documents by Oct. 14 and appear before the panels on Oct. 16. Sondland's attorney Robert Luskin\u00a0said the State Department directed him not to cooperate with the probe or appear before lawmakers. \"Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,\" Luskin said. He had originally said Sondland\u00a0agreed to \u201cappear voluntarily\u201d. Trump defended the decision to prevent Sondland's testimony, saying the Democrats' inquiry is illegitimate, claiming he would love\u00a0\"to send Ambassador Sondland\" to testify, but he, unfortunately \"would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court.\" Read more: In a letter released Tuesday, Trump and his team told Pelosi and other Democratic leaders that they will not provide documents or witnesses to House impeachment investigators because they consider the investigation to be unfair and illegitimate. \"You have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process,\" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a blistering eight-page letter to Pelosi and the chairmen of three key House committees. \"President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\" Cipollone added, reiterating the GOP talking point that democrats are just seeking \"to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\" Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's objections\u00a0and indicated they may go to court to try and enforce subpoenas and document requests. House Democratic investigators subpoenaed Sondland minutes after the White House letter. Pelosi released a statement, responding to Trump's letter: \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\" \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law.\u00a0\u00a0You will be held accountable,\u201d she concluded. Read more: Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Giuliani, was invited by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to discuss what he learned during his investigation into\u00a0Ukraine. \"Given the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\" Graham tweeted. \"Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the Committee of his concerns.\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, embraced hearing from Giuliani, saying in a statement\u00a0that she welcomes \u201cthe opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals.\u201d Giuliani told The Washington Post\u00a0he was \"very interested\" in Graham's offer, but \"there are a lot of legal issues to consider.\" Read more: China tells Trump 'no'\u00a0to investigating Biden After Trump publicly said China should also investigate Biden\u00a0and reports swirled that the political prospects of Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0were mentioned in a phone call between Trump and President Xi Jinping, China said no. Last week, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d \u201cWe have no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States. Our position is consistent and clear,\" China foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a report in the South China Morning Post, the main English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. Read more: A\u00a0new report\u00a0released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election has concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Among other controversial issues, Russia attempted to inflame tensions around race and \"targeted African-Americans more than any other group or demographic,\" and according to the committee, the election interference efforts did not end with the 2016 election. The report delivers a call for future action to prevent foreign election interference, saying that \"the Executive Branch should, in the run up to the 2020 election, reinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\" They also recommend the creation of an interagency task force to combat misinformation efforts and a public information campaign against foreign interference. The report comes in the midst of Trump asking Ukraine and China to help him investigate, as well as previous reports that\u00a0Trump asked multiple countries, including Australia, to help\u00a0\u00a0Attorney General William Barr's ongoing inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election investigation.

The networks that received the letter included\u00a0NBC News, CBS News, Fox News\u00a0and CNN,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Daily Beast, which first reported the letter. Giuliani Sunday morning made the rounds on several Sunday morning shows, including Fox News'\u00a0Sunday Morning Futures,\u00a0ABC\u2019s\u00a0This Week\u00a0and CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\u00a0During several of his appearances, Giuliani repeatedly pushed that Biden should be investigated in the ousting of\u00a0Viktor Shokin, the former General Prosecutor of Ukraine.

They\u00a0noted that although networks push back in real-time, it is hard to catch up to Giuliani's \"falsehoods and disinformation.\" \"Your obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues,\" they wrote. \"Rudy Giuliani has made very clear that his only obligation is to protect Donald Trump, and that he will willingly lie to do so.\" \"Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\" the letter concluded. \"We ask that you no longer book him on your air.\"",

      "content": "President Donald Trump has a thing for conspiracy theories. It was bad enough when he was, we all assumed, cynically spreading them in an effort to manipulate people. But his efforts to get Ukraine to dig into an absurd theory about Democratic\u00a0presidential candidate Joe Biden suggest he may actually believe them, which is worse. The\u00a0one about\u00a0Biden isn\u2019t even a proper conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory takes a few well-known facts and tries to create a colorful story by filling in the \u201cgaps\u201d with wild speculations. But Trump's \"theory\u201d couples made-up \u201cfacts\u201d with nonsensical leaps of \u201clogic.\u201d It makes no sense even if you assume the made-up parts are true. To judge by the way it has been presented on TV, it seems mostly to consist of shouting \u201cHunter Biden!\u201d and \u201c$50,000 a month!\u201d over and over again. Apparently, Trump believes that\u00a0Biden, while vice president, used the U.S. government to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, supposedly to benefit his son\u00a0Hunter. The president's allies have called this supposed plot \u201cextortion.\u201d Trying to have a logical discussion of all this is a little like trying to nail jello to the wall with a tennis shoe. Let's\u00a0start with what actually did happen. There is no doubt that Hunter Biden has issues and has struggled with various forms of addiction.\u00a0There is also no doubt that Hunter Biden is Joe Biden\u2019s greatest personal vulnerability. Hunter and Joe are the last survivors of the Biden family that never was. Trump has tried to exploit this vulnerability by throwing out baseless, even ridiculous charges that would have made his mentor, mob lawyer and McCarthy hearings architect Roy Cohn, proud. It should make everyone else slightly nauseous. Nothing to see here:Is Donald Trump's Justice Department part of the Ukraine scandal cover-up? Back in spring\u00a02014, Hunter Biden and a couple of other people, including the ex-president of Poland, were invited to join the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company. For being on the board and, apparently, doing some other work, Hunter Biden earned up to $50,000 a month. He\u00a0left the Burisma board when his five-year term expired this year. In December 2015, Vice President\u00a0Biden delivered a message to Ukraine officials,\u00a0letting them know that the U.S. government would hold up $1\u00a0billion in loan guarantees unless Ukrainian prosecutor general\u00a0Viktor Shokin\u00a0was sacked. In spring\u00a02016, Shokin was forced to resign. At this point, I could describe how Shokin, as a Ukrainian deputy prosecutor, had refused to cooperate with a United Kingdom\u00a0investigation into corruption by Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma Holdings.\u00a0I could discuss how, after Shokin was elevated to the post of prosecutor general, every member of the\u00a0Group of Seven leading industrial nations, including the U.S. government, along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\u00a0began agitating to get rid of him. But perhaps most telling is how\u00a0Shokin was viewed by many Ukrainians. Here\u2019s how a Ukrainian newspaper described his removal:\u00a0\"The reports came shortly after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he\u2019d asked his appointed prosecutor, who has failed to bring a single major criminal case to trial in a year, to leave. ...\u00a0Shokin has been under fire for months by his critics, who accused him of stalling reform in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, and covering up cases of corruption among his subordinates.\" In short, Shokin was doing nothing to combat corruption. If there was something fishy going on at Burisma Holdings, the very worst thing that could have happened, from company owner Zlochevsky\u2019s point of view, was replacing Shokin. This was the compliant prosecutor who had saved him $23 million\u00a0by refusing to cooperate with the U.K.\u00a0corruption investigation.\u00a0The idea that removing Shokin somehow protected Burisma Holdings and Hunter Biden is absurd on its face. Even more\u00a0ridiculous, all this\u00a0assumes Biden actually had the ability to\u00a0get Shokin fired. American vice presidents are both notoriously and constitutionally powerless. Unless there happens to be a tie vote in the Senate, they could spend their entire time in office on the beach and no one would notice, with the possible exception of dead foreign dignitaries whose funerals they are often forced to attend.\u00a0On their best days, they are errand boys for the president. Biden could no more order $1 billion in loan guarantees withheld from Ukraine than he could flap his arms and fly to the moon. In fact, Biden acknowledges that in the very sound bite that contains Trump's false claim in the July 25 phone call to the Ukrainian president that \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution.\"\u00a0Biden was actually bragging about pressuring\u00a0the Ukrainians to fire Shokin. The former vice president recounted last year that the Ukrainians\u00a0told him, \"You have no authority. You're not the president.\" Biden's response: \"Call him.\" Ukraine investigation:Donald Trump's defense only makes him look worse The idea of firing Shokin started in the U.S. Embassy\u00a0in Kyiv in 2015 and had the backing of the Obama administration and many of its allies. It simply wasn\u2019t\u00a0Biden\u2019s decision to make. Finally, and most critically, none of this matters. Trump may have suspected Joe Biden\u00a0of corruption, but when the president pressured a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and political rival, he engaged in actual corruption. Whatever Biden did or didn\u2019t do can\u2019t excuse that. President Trump sees nothing wrong with all this. In fact, he is proud of what he has done. The question now is, are we?

Biden said he knew his family would come under attack, but after a sit-down with his five grandchildren three weeks before announcing he was entering the race, he made the decision. \"They came to me and said, 'Pop, you got to run.'\" When Biden said it would get really mean, his grandchildren responded, \"We know how he is,\" they said about President Donald Trump, \"but, Pop you got to do it.\" Hunter Biden\u00a0has come under scrutiny after Trump asked the Ukrainian president to Biden. Trump claims that Biden tried to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating a company where Hunter Biden served on the board. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine\u00a0say the official,\u00a0Viktor Shokin, was ousted\u00a0for the opposite reason Trump\u00a0and his allies claim. Impeachment pressure:Trump says China should investigate Joe Biden, family On Wednesday, Trump called Biden and his son \"stone cold crooked.\" But Biden fiercely defended his family during the Reno campaign rally. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said. \"I think it's the beginning not the end,\u201d Biden said about what he anticipates will be more attacks against his family. \"I'm also confident the American people know me, and they know my son.\" Biden said his son will be a visible part of the campaign. Ukraine explained:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell.\" Biden's wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972, just weeks after he won his first Senate race. \u00a0In 2015, his oldest son Beau\u00a0Biden, 46, died from a deadly form of brain cancer. Biden said Trump\u2019s attacks are tough but won\u2019t stop him from winning come November. \"Look, we are a family. We have been through a lot worse,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"We know what real pain is.\" Impeachment poll:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Biden talked about the tragedy of losing his son to cancer. When asked about Reno mom Kristin Sumbot, who he met at a hospital in 2016, Biden remembered her. \"I should call her,\" Biden said about Sumbot\u2019 s mother. He then called her twice including during the end of an interview with the RGJ and then later from his car back to the airport.

Sumbot died in 2017 after being diagnosed with the same deadly form of \u00a0brain cancer that killed Beau Biden, but her family credited the clinical trial for giving her an extra six months. \u201cIf I'm elected president it is going to be one of the overwhelming priorities,\u201d Biden said of cancer research and how investments can chance cancer survival rates. \u00a0\"It is one of the missions of my life.\u201d Siobhan McAndrew tells stories about the people of Northern Nevada and covers education in Washoe County.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden had one message for President Donald Trump on Wednesday night: He\u2019s \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d Speaking in\u00a0Nevada, Biden had choice words regarding Trump's\u00a0rhetoric and remarks\u00a0surrounding\u00a0an impeachment inquiry related to a phone call with Ukraine's president where Trump asked him to dig up dirt on Biden and his son Hunter for past business in the country. At the time of the phone call, the White House was holding up a military aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine. During a press conference earlier in the day, Trump slammed the Bidens\u00a0as \u201cstone cold crooked,\u201d and vented on Twitter, saying that Democrats are \"wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy.\" 'Did you hear me?':Furious Donald Trump blasts media over Ukraine, impeachment inquiry \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.

And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name calling. I\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives.\" Trump declined to answer a specific question during Wednesday's press conference about whether he would\u00a0honor subpoenas over the Ukraine call that Democrats promised by week's end. He also did not answer a question about what he wanted Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to do about Biden. Trump continued his defense Wednesday night, accusing Democrats of trying to steal the election, and posted a video about Joe and Hunter Biden, featuring the song \"Photograph\" by Nickelback and a 2014 picture of the duo with\u00a0Devon Archer, who also served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. Biden continued to call Trump \"desperate and defensive,\" pointing out the president's comments\u00a0about the whistleblower being executed, wanting to\u00a0prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for treason,\u00a0and warning of a civil war. \"The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order,\" Biden concluded Wednesday.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Already facing the threat of impeachment for his interactions with Ukraine, President Donald Trump embraced the same tactic Thursday by publicly calling for China to launch an investigation into his leading Democratic rival. The remarks stunned legal observers, quieted many of the president's allies and provided ammunition to Democrats who are hoping to convince voters that Trump's controversial call in July with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky wasn't a fluke but rather part of a larger pattern of conduct unbecoming of the Oval Office. \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens,\" Trump said at the White House minutes after discussing\u00a0his administration's longstanding trade war with Beijing. \"What happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\" Experts pointed to similar open-ended requests Trump or his aides have made to Russia, Ukraine, Australia and, reportedly, the United Kingdom \u2013 either to look into the family of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden or to dig up dirt that might discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller's\u00a0investigation into the 2016 election. China:Trump says Beijing should investigate Joe Biden, family Poll:Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Fact check:The story behind Biden pushing\u00a0out a Ukrainian prosecutor Democratic lawmakers didn't take long Thursday to begin stitching the pieces together. \"Russia. Ukraine. China. How far will Trump really go to sell out America\u2019s sovereignty to stay in office?\" tweeted Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. \"The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere and help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and outspoken Trump critic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to suspend the investigation. In rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he read Trump\u2019s statement as using the leverage of trade threats for personal gain. \u201cLinking trade negotiations to Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging effort to fabricate foreign accusations against political rivals is a complete abuse of the powers of the president,\u201d Wyden said. Democrats say they are alarmed by a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which the president repeatedly\u00a0pressed to investigate Biden\u00a0and his son\u00a0Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine. Trump raised the requests after an extended conversation with Zelensky about U.S. aid to Ukraine the White House had delayed. Trump describes\u00a0the call as \"perfect\" and has denied that the foreign aid was used as leverage to pressure\u00a0Zelensky. Like the Ukraine call, Trump's remarks on China came within minutes of him raising U.S. power to punish its foes.\u00a0Trump has often relied on a carrots-and-sticks approach in his trade policy,but his words Thursday took on new meaning for some critics given the ongoing scandal. \"If they don't do what we want,\"\u00a0 Trump said of China, \"we have tremendous, tremendous power.\" Others pointed to Trump's controversial statement in 2016 when he hinted that Russia could \"find the 30,000 emails that are missing\" from Democrat Hillary Clinton's email server. Trump later explained away the comments as a joke, but Mueller's report noted Russian hackers targeted Clinton\u2019s personal office hours later for the first time. \"If this is another instance in which he is incentivizing, encouraging, calling on another country to perform opposition research to further his own personal political goals, then I do think it\u2019s problematic, and not just for political reasons,\" said Kent\u00a0Greenfield, a law professor at Boston College. \"It's part of a pattern and practice of the president breaching his oath of office, which requires him to be faithful to the Constitution.\" Republican lawmakers were slow to react to the president's latest remarks on China. For the most part, those lawmakers have stood by the White House and have lashed out at Democrats for announcing last week that they would launch an impeachment inquiry. Trump's call to China came hours after a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found growing support for impeachment.\u00a0Americans by a 45%-38% plurality support\u00a0a House vote to impeach Trump, the poll found.\u00a0By a similar margin, 44%-35% of\u00a0those surveyed say the Senate, which would then be charged with holding a trial of the president, should convict him and remove him from office. Vice President Mike Pence defended what he described as Trump's \"legitimate questions\" about Biden's former business dealings in Ukraine and China. \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\" Pence told reporters traveling with him Thursday. \"That's about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.\" Trump and his allies have also reportedly leaned on officials in\u00a0Australia and the United Kingdom to dig up damaging information about the Mueller investigation into the 2016 race. David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst and critic of Trump, described the president's overtures to foreign governments as unprecedented. \"Our policy has therefore become exactly what the founders feared: a\u00a0tool to enrich and empower one man, the president,\"\u00a0Rothkopf said.

The campaign also called on the media to focus on whether Trump abused his authority by allegedly pressuring a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the former vice president and his son. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said\u00a0some in the media \u201chave allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor\" in the aftermath of reports that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden. \u201cQuality reporting on this issue has made it increasingly clear that Trump did indeed attempt to bully a U.S. ally into disingenuously investigating the potential Democratic nominee he fears most,\u201d Bates said in an email to reporters. \u201cThe second narrative that needs to be pointed out is that, unfortunately, not all coverage of this episode has responsibly highlighted the relevant facts that have been widely reported for months.\u201d The Biden campaign raised its concerns\u00a0as Trump insisted on Monday\u00a0that he \u201cput no pressure on them whatsoever\u201d to investigate Hunter Biden. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0has reported that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky eight times in that call to investigate the younger Biden. Trump\u00a0has acknowledged that he brought up Biden in the July phone conversation\u00a0with the newly-elected Zelensky that Trump says served as a mostly congratulatory call. Trump told reporters Monday while at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly\u00a0that \u201cwhat Biden did was wrong\u201d and suggested that he might eventually\u00a0release a transcript of the call \u2014 something that the former vice president and Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding. Trump said a transcript would show that he did nothing wrong, but he also said he is concerned about the precedent of releasing details of a call with a foreign leader. Trump on alleged Ukraine pressure:'I didn't do it.' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden Ukraine scandal explained:What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint? The back-and-forth comes as scrutiny of Trump\u2019s actions during\u00a0the call is mounting amid renewed calls among House Democrats to impeach Trump. The issue came to a head after a multiple news reports about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump\u2019s comments to a foreign leader. The whistleblower complaint remains secret, and Democrats and the Trump administration are in a standoff over demands that the report be turned over to Congress. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani for months have pushed uncorroborated claims that Biden as vice president sought the 2016 ouster of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. Giuliani alleged in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, because\u00a0\u201cBiden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter and he went over there and got [Shokin] fired.\u201d The push by the former vice president, however, came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from both European diplomats and the U.S State Department, because international leaders felt Shokin was doing too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while still serving as vice president , threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma. Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told\u00a0Bloomberg News Service\u00a0in May\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. The Biden campaign says that Trump his allies are trying to muddy the waters about the former vice president's actions in Ukraine because they see Biden as the most potent potential 2020 Democratic rival. \u201cThe president and his lackeys are so terrified of that prospect \u2014 and have abandoned any pretense of having an iota of truth on their side as they flail and try to distract from what may be the greatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate \u2014 that they fell all over themselves lying on the Sunday shows,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Beddingfield said in a memo to interested parties that was titled \u201cCorrecting the Record on Rudy Giuliani's Lies.\u201d Biden told reporters while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday that\u00a0he has never spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, but the younger Biden told the New Yorker magazine in an article published in July that two had one brief exchange about Burisma around December 2015. Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue of Hunter's work with Burisma with the Vice President, according to the article. \u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.

Democrats and other critics denounced Trump for invoking China, saying he wants yet another country to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election just as Russia did in 2016. \"The defining characteristic of Donald Trump's presidency is the ongoing abuse of power,\"\u00a0 said Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. \"The White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he's afraid to look in the eye next November.\" Speaking with reporters en route to Florida for a Medicare speech, Trump also acknowledged that he did indeed want Kiev to investigate Biden and his son, though he denied using foreign aid as leverage. Asked if he had requested President Xi Jinping of China to help investigate the Biden family, Trump said, \"I haven't but it is certainly something we could start thinking about.\" Some critics noted that Trump's call for\u00a0China to investigate Biden came less than a week before American and Chinese negotiators meet to try and revive a proposed bilateral trade agreement. The Trump administration has been engaged in a longstanding trade war with Beijing. \"It is the president saying to a foreign government that\u00a0it will win his favor by investigating the Bidens,\" said David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst and critic of Trump. \"And he is saying it in the middle of a massively important trade negotiation so the stakes could\u00a0not be higher for China.\" In firing back at Trump, Biden's campaign compared the president's remarks to his open-ended call in 2016 for Russia to \"find\" Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails. Trump \"is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\"\u00a0Bedingfield said. Biden, the vice president under Obama, has said that Trump is targeting him because he fears defeat in the next election. \"He is repeatedly smearing me and my family,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"His party fans out to carry the smear. Millions of dollars in dishonest attack ads are blanketing the airwaves \u2013 paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency.\" Current Vice President\u00a0Mike\u00a0Pence, who has kept a low profile in recent days, expressed support for Trump's actions.\u00a0\u201cThe American people have the right to know whether or not the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position,\u201d Pence told reporters during a stop in Scottsdale, Arizona. Pence later tweeted out a wire story about his comments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal., who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to suspend the investigation. In rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that \"I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\" At the heart of Congress'\u00a0probe into the president's actions is his\u00a0claim\u00a0that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.\u00a0But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine\u00a0say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted\u00a0for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim. One of Trump's contentions is that Hunter Biden landed business opportunities in Ukraine and China because of his connection to Joe Biden, and that the senior Biden used his position to protect his son. There is no evidence of any improper activity by either Biden.

Trump also turned to immigration, dismissing a series of\u00a0reports that he has floated ideas of harming migrants to dissuade them from attempting to enter the U.S. Specifically, Trump denied a New York Times report that the president had previously asked about shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down. \"Fake News, just like the snakes and gators in the moat,\" Trump said, referring to another report that he had inquired about using alligators to discourage migrants. \"The Media is deranged, they have lost their minds!\" A USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll released Thursday found that Americans by a 45%-38% plurality support a House vote to impeach Trump.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Allies of President Donald Trump made clear to Ukraine last summer that the release of military aid for the country would be contingent on whether it opened an investigation into an energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter,\u00a0a senior diplomat told lawmakers Tuesday in the House impeachment inquiry. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, said in his opening statement,\u00a0obtained by The Associated Press,\u00a0 that he was \"alarmed\" by the linking of aid to investigations of Trump's Democratic rival\u00a0Joe Biden.\u00a0A source familiar with the statement confirmed its authenticity. Taylor said the demand was relayed to him by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key Trump ally, during a phone call the two had. Sondland discussed Trump's interest in seeing Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky make a public announcement about a probe into Burisma, the energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a member of its board of directors. Sondland also said Trump wanted an investigation of a theory about election interference by Ukraine, according to Taylor. \"During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\" Taylor said. Taylor said it was made clear to him that if Ukraine did not agree to the investigation, there would be a\u00a0\"stalemate\" over the nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine's efforts to fend off Russian military aggression. \"I understood the 'stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\" Taylor said. \"Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\" Democrats on the three\u00a0House committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 called Taylor's opening statement \"explosive\" and \"a direct line\" between Trump's demand for\u00a0an investigation and the withholding of military aid. \"He drew a very direct line in the series of events he described between President Trump\u2019s decision to withhold funds and refuse a meeting with Zelensky unless there was a public pronouncement by him of investigations of Burisma,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. \"I do not know how you would listen to today's testimony by Ambassador Taylor and draw any other conclusion except that the president abused his power.\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and some other members gasped and sighed during Taylor's opening remarks. Lieu said,\u00a0\"In my mind, I kept saying wow, wow, wow.\"\u00a0Rep. Adriano\u00a0Espaillat, D-N.Y., called it \"explosive.\" Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., described it as \"juicy.\" Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., said it was \"a code red.\" \u201cThis is my most disturbing day in Congress so far, very troubling words,\" said Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., who has held the seat for 10 months. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., said the House inquiry may need to \"revisit previous witnesses\" because\u00a0Taylor\u2019s testimony shed new light on them. Taylor also appeared to keep notes on his correspondence. \u201cHe referenced personal notes that he keeps,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cYou know, I don't want to get into this testimony, but he indicated that he kept extensive notes on all of this.\u201d But Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said there was \"nothing new here, I think.\" Rep Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, slammed Democrats as \"going out and leaking everything,\" though he did not comment when asked if the leaks were wrong. Trump has insisted he was justified in urging Ukraine to investigation corruption. His administration has\u00a0denied a \"quid pro quo\" that military aid would be released in exchange for the opening of an investigation. In his statement to the lawmakers, Taylor described two channels of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine, with him in the regular channel and the irregular channel guided by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which sought the investigation. \"But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances,\" Taylor said. The State Department had directed Taylor not to appear as scheduled for the deposition because the White House has declared the inquiry illegitimate. But the Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Taylor and he complied, answering questions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers and staffers. Trump has insisted he was justified in asking Ukraine to investigate corruption. Sondland\u00a0told the House inquiry Thursday that Trump had directed diplomats to consult Giuliani on Ukraine policy. In a July 25 call, Trump\u00a0asked\u00a0Zelensky to open an investigation into Hunter Biden and his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, prompting an unnamed whistleblower to file a complaint alleging Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. Mick Mulvaney:Mick Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up aid to pressure Ukraine, then rows back In text messages released as part of special envoy Kurt Volker's testimony, Taylor questioned whether military aid was being withheld for political reasons. \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH\u00a0meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked in a Sept. 1 text message to Volker and\u00a0Sondland. \"Call me,\"\u00a0Sondland texted back. Taylor raised the issue again in a text Sept. 9. \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said. Sondland said he called Trump before replying and then passed along the president's assurances. Trump had been \"crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind ... I suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\"\u00a0Sondland said. He told Taylor to call \"S,\" presumably referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, if he wanted to discuss the matter further. At an Oct. 17 news briefing, acting White House Chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made statements widely interpreted as saying aid to Ukraine was\u00a0withheld in part because of Trump's\u00a0desire for the country to investigate potential corruption regarding U.S. domestic politics. Impeachment inquiry:Impeachment inquiry: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine policy Mulvaney later issued a statement saying\u00a0his remarks had been misconstrued to \"advance a biased and political witch hunt.\" \"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian\u00a0military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney said in the statement.\u00a0\"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\" Contributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, John Fritze, David Jackson",

      "content": "MINNEAPOLIS\u00a0\u2013 Breaking out a new stump speech amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered an extended attack\u00a0on rival Joe Biden while largely ignoring the rest of the Democratic field. Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president, hometown Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar and congressional Democrats probing his White House. Trump's retooled remarks in a state he lost narrowly to Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as he is facing a widening impeachment inquiry into whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden by withholding foreign aid. Trump, who has denied doing so,\u00a0has sought to shift attention to Biden and his son, Hunter. \"He was never considered a good senator,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" The former vice president, who spoke Thursday at an LGBTQ town hall sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN,\u00a0later responded on Twitter, saying\u00a0\"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have.\" Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases More:A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair The Trump campaign has tried for days to focus voters' attention\u00a0on Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China.\u00a0Trump, without offering evidence, said that\u00a0Hunter Biden was hired by companies in other countries because of his last name, and his father's position as vice president, rather than his business acumen. \"Whatever happened to\u00a0Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump said, as current Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence watched from just off stage. The line was clearly a point officials close to Trump wanted to emphasize.\u00a0Midway through his remarks, Trump's campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Trump's attacks on Biden came during an unusually long address\u00a0\u2013 running over an hour and a half\u00a0\u2013 in which\u00a0he also blasted the city's mayor for forbidding police officers to wear uniforms to his rally and touted efforts to reduce the number of refugees resettled\u00a0in U.S. cities. Before Trump took the stage, the crowd chanted \"lock him up,\" reprising a taunt his supporters often used against Clinton in 2016 but aiming it at Biden. Joe Biden, who called for\u00a0Trump's impeachment earlier in the week, accused the president of \"shooting holes in the Constitution.\" \"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"His lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence as president.\" Andrew Bates, rapid response director for Biden's campaign, tweeted that Trump's \"presidency\u2019s spiraling after he was caught trying to force a foreign country to lie about the candidate who terrifies him, and apparently this is all he\u2019s got left.\" Biden\u2019s lead in national polling has slipped amid the back-and-forth with Trump as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has steadily increased her support. The president also renewed his attacks on Omar, D-Minn., who represents much of Minneapolis. At one point, the president described\u00a0Omar as a \"American-hating socialist.\u201d Trump has previously claimed that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to Hunter Biden. But an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine and others have countered that the official was ousted\u00a0because he wasn't pursuing corruption aggressively enough. Contributing: Jeanine Santucci",

      "content": "KIEV, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Ukraine\u2019s top legal official said Friday that his office would review\u00a0a probe into the owner of a natural-gas company linked to former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. Ruslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor, said during a press conference\u00a0that the review is part of a wider audit of at least 15 high-profile past investigations that were closed or dismissed by his predecessors. The announcement Friday comes as an impeachment inquiry over President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine consumes Washington. But Ryaboshapka said the decision to review the cases was not specifically related to the time Hunter Biden spent on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private natural-gas firm, or allegations from the Trump administration that Joe Biden\u00a0improperly applied pressure on Ukraine to have an investigation into Burisma halted. The allegations from Trump and his lawyer Rudolph Giuliani have played a key role in\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into Trump by Democratic lawmakers. Ukraine:Text messages show U.S. diplomats believed U.S. aid was linked to Trump's demand for Biden probe Ukraine\u2019s previous general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, closed a money-laundering and tax-irregularity probe into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, in 2016. The case did not focus on Hunter Biden. There is also no evidence that Joe\u00a0Biden acted improperly in applying pressure on Ukraine to dismiss Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin was widely and publicly viewed by international organizations such as the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and anti-corruption investigators in Ukraine, as an impediment to reforming the country\u2019s culture of graft. Ryaboshapka said the audit has been planned since he took office one month ago. Friday\u2019s press conference was his first public one since taking up the role. Impeachment testimony:Intelligence watchdog to testify about 'credible' whistleblower complaint before key House committee Vitali Kasko, Ryaboshapha\u2019s deputy, told USA TODAY after the news conference that an affidavit by Shokin highlighted in recent days by Giuliani\u2019s office that claims he was fired in 2016 because he was leading a \u201cwide-ranging corruption investigation\u201d into Burisma had no merit. \u201cShokin is not a reliable figure,\u201d he said. Shokin was not available for comment.",

      "content": "The fourth round of the Democratic primary debates saw a record 12 candidates battling it out over top issues, while\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is underway. The focus shifted from former Vice President Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility. Here are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate: As expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. When asked about his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected. Foreign business deals:Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter)\u00a0made.\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct. Ukraine explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases This debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support\u00a0with varying levels of enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to\u00a0determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him\u00a0how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election\u00a0makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives\u00a0while pursuing impeachment:\u00a0\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\" Sen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d Warren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was\u00a0Warren's turn to take some hits. Warren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer. Costs will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\" \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan. Polls:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls More data:Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio Klobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump. \"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan. \u201cI\u00a0appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan.\u00a0\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d According to CNN's tracker, Warren\u00a0had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes. At the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate. O'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a\u00a0\u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support. More on\u00a0buyback debate:Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d Calling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said,\u00a0\"I\u00a0don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been\u00a0lost to gun violence. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d In a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election. \"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is\u00a0\u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable. Candidates' ages:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like. Sanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage. Biden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said. Warren, 70, said she'd\u00a0\"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. On the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37.\u00a0She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important. After a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate. \"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said. Later in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department\u00a0review before states passed anti-abortion laws. Klobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.

      "content": "Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment:5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary:Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency:Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

      "content": "Elizabeth Lawrence, a school teacher in Alabama, was lynched in 1933 for reprimanding white schoolchildren for throwing rocks at her. In 1893, 17-year-old Henry Smith, suspected of killing a white girl, was burned alive before a mob of 10,000 in Texas.\u00a0His ashes and bones were sold as souvenirs. Emmett Till, 14, was abducted, tortured and murdered in 1955. They are\u00a0just three of the\u00a0at least 4,000 lynchings that took place in the United States from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. And Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that an impeachment inquiry against him is a lynching, a\u00a0metaphor that quickly drew widespread criticism from lawmakers and social justice groups as \"grotesque\" and \"offensive.\" \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\" Trump tweeted. Trump's tweet:Trump slammed by lawmakers after he called impeachment inquiry a 'lynching' Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democratic presidential candidate, responded: \"Lynching is an act of terror used to uphold white supremacy. Try again.\" \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\" Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director of the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union, told USA TODAY that Trump's comment was \"grounded either in ignorance or deliberate stupidity.\" \"Him making this statement and Senator Graham backing it up, I\u00a0think they are slaps in the face to the African American community and to the families who are descendants\u00a0of people who were lynched\u00a0in this country,\"\u00a0Robinson said. \"At the end of this process, (Trump) is going to have his life. At the end of this process, he is not going to be physically tortured,\" he added. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, defended the president's word choice as \"pretty well accurate.\" He told reporters that the impeachment investigation is a \"sham\" and a \"joke.\" \"So yeah,\" Graham said, \"this is a lynching in every sense.\" Trump's impeachment inquiry, a legal process occurring within the confines of the U.S. Constitution, is completely different from the lynchings of black Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries. According to the\u00a0Equal Justice Initiative, lynchings were \"violent and public acts of torture that traumatized black people throughout the country and were largely tolerated by state and federal officials.\" Between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,384 racial terror lynchings\u00a0occurred in the United States, according to the Equal Justice Initiative's count. Racial terror lynchings are\u00a0distinguished from mob killings that followed some form of trial or were committed against white people without the threat of terror, the group says. The NAACP puts the number at\u00a03,446 black people\u00a0lynched from 1882 to 1968. An additional\u00a01,297 white people were lynched, the group says, for helping blacks or being anti-lynching. Bryan Stevenson, the Equal Justice Initiative's executive director, told the Montgomery Advertiser in a 2018 interview\u00a0that lynching was used as \"a tactic of control, of reinforcing white supremacy, of racial hierarchy.\" Lynchings occurred outside of a formal criminal justice system because black Americans were seen as not deserving a trial, Stevenson said. The violence also occurred with the expectation that those who committed the lynching would not be punished for the act, he added. \"The threat, the menace, to African Americans is very different,\" Stevenson said. \"This is terrorism. It is not a crime. It's not murder. It's terrorism. The difference is the act of violence isn't directed\u00a0just at that one person who's hanging from that tree. It's the entire black community.\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denied that Trump considers himself a lynching victim, saying \"he's not comparing himself to those dark times.\" Instead, Gidley said, the president was criticizing his treatment by Democrats and journalists whom he said have called for his impeachment ever since he was elected. \"He is not receiving due process,\" Gidley said. Trump, however, is not alone in calling an impeachment inquiry a lynching. Graham defends Trump:'This is a lynching, in every sense': Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate' Former\u00a0vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night after a 1998 clip surfaced of him saying the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton could be seen as a \"partisan lynching.\" Biden's apology came the same day he said it was \"abhorrent\" and \"despicable\" that Trump used the term to refer to the impeachment inquiry. \"Impeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution,\" he admonished Trump. \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\" Biden's apology:After slamming Trump for 'lynching' tweet, Biden apologizes for using the term about Clinton impeachment But 20 years ago, Biden used that exact word to refer to the impeachment process against fellow Democrat Clinton. \"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Other Democrats also used \"lynching\" when referring to Clinton's impeachment. A Washington Post report found at least five House Democrats, three of whom are black,\u00a0used that word or \"lynch mob\" to refer to the process against Clinton, including\u00a0Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who now chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend?

Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More:Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September.

      "content": "Altoona, IOWA \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden said if he is elected president, no one in his family will hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government. \"No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country. Period. Period. End of story,\" Biden told reporters in Iowa after giving remarks at a labor conference. Biden's remarks to reporters at the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday came hours after his son, Hunter, announced he would step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm and committed to not do any foreign work if his father is elected president. Biden said his son's lawyers had told him they would be issuing a statement but he did not consult with his son about the statement and only saw it when it was released publicly Sunday morning. Biden said no one has asserted he or his son have done anything wrong, except President Donald Trump. Hunter Biden:Will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president The younger Biden has become a target of Trump\u2019s criticism for his work on the boards of companies in Ukraine and China, although there is no evidence that he engaged in unlawful behavior. Trump\u2019s request of the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in that country has become the basis for an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House. Democrats allege the request amounted to using the power of the presidency to improperly ask a foreign power to investigate the family of one of his domestic political rivals. Trump has said he did not do anything wrong. Biden said no news organizations that have investigated his son's business dealings have found that there was any wrongdoing by the Bidens. \"No one, no one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I have done anything wrong, except a lying president,\" Biden told reporters. 'Whatever happened to\u00a0Hunter?':Donald Trump steps up attacks on Joe Biden and his son at Minneapolis rally Biden's appearance at the labor forum was his first visit to Iowa since calling for Trump to be impeached last week. Biden is one of the last Democratic presidential contenders to signal his support for the U.S. House's impeachment inquiry against Trump. Failing to pursue the impeachment inquiry against the president could give future presidents license to engage in unethical behavior, Biden said at the forum. \"If, in fact, the House doesn\u2019t move and let the facts fall where they may, what does the next unethical president, if we elect another one, what does that say they can do?\" Biden said. \"What\u2019s that say? What\u2019s going to happen? They have to know there\u2019s consequences.\" Biden suggested growing public opinion on impeachment will sway more Republicans in Congress to support it. Several public polls in recent days have found that public support for an impeachment inquiry tops 50%. \"What\u2019s going to change Republican minds in the United States Congress is when their constituents start changing their minds,\" Biden told the labor forum. \"And you\u2019re seeing it start to happen: More Republican voters, independent voters are saying, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn\u2019t know this.'\" Follow\u00a0Stephen Gruber-Miller on Twitter: @sgrubermiller",

Speaking in Manchester, N.H., Biden said, \"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed the nation, and committed impeachable acts.\" \"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\" Biden added. \"The United States cannot afford to have a president who will abuse whatever power available to them to get re-elected,\" Biden said, slamming Trump's request to the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump asked the Ukrainian government in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Biden and probe allegations about Ukraine's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Democrats have cited evidence showing that the U.S. government withheld military aid from Ukraine as part of the effort to pressure Ukraine into opening the investigation. Trump has accused Biden's son of \"corruption\" relating to his board seat on a Ukrainian gas company, though Ukrainian prosecutors have said Hunter Biden did not do violate any laws. And on Oct. 3, Trump urged China to investigate Biden,\u00a0though the Chinese government has publicly declined to do so. In his speech today, Biden said there was \"no truth in [Trump's] charges against me and my son. Zero.\" Previously, Biden had hedged his comments about Trump despite the launching of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \"If the president does not comply with such a request of\u00a0the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flaunt the law,\" Biden had said on Sept. 24,\u00a0\"Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.\" Shortly after Biden made his remarks, Trump tweeted in response and posted a campaign ad about Bide. \"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong,\" Trump wrote. Biden later responded on Twitter. \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution,\" Biden wrote, also calling on Trump to release his tax returns.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Vice President Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night after a 1998 clip surfaced of him saying the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton could be seen as a \"partisan lynching.\" Biden's apology came the same day he said it was \"abhorrent\" and \"despicable\" that\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0used the term to refer to the impeachment inquiry being conducted against him. \"Impeachment is not 'lynching,'\u00a0it is part of our Constitution,\" he admonished Trump. \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\" But 20 years ago, Biden used that exact word to refer to the impeachment process against fellow Democrat Clinton. \"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. 'This is a lynching, in every sense':Lindsey Graham says Trump's impeachment description 'accurate' Trump said he was the victim of a lynching in tweet that\u00a0argued the inquiry\u00a0was being done \"without due process or fairness or any legal rights.\" \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here\u00a0\u2013 a lynching,\" he tweeted. Nine hours after condemning Trump's tweet, Biden went on Twitter to say he was sorry for doing the same two decades ago. \"This wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that,\" Biden said in a tweet linking to a CNN story about the 21-year-old interview. But he quickly made a distinction between himself and the president, tweeting\u00a0\"Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\" Biden's assertion that Trump \"deliberately\" used the word was echoed by other Democrats who painted it as a strategy to distract from the negative headlines surrounding the impeachment inquiry in the House. Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said in a statement Tuesday that \"every time his back is up against the wall, he throws out the red meat of racial rhetoric and attacks communities of color.\" Biden was not the only Democrat to refer to Clinton's impeachment as a \"lynching.\" A\u00a0 Washington Post report found at least five House Democrats used that word or \"lynch mob\" to refer to the process against Clinton. One of them,\u00a0Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment.

Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, used a speech in Iowa to criticize several aspects of Trump's foreign policy, including the trade war with China and\u00a0his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump is \"a complete failure\" and \"the most reckless and incompetent commander-in-chief we've ever had,\" Biden said. 2020 Election:5 things we learned from the Democratic debate in Ohio But he saved his harshest words for Trump's decision earlier this month to remove U.S. armed forces from northern Syria. Turkey subsequently invaded the country, including territory held by the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS. \"The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform,\" Biden said, according to prepared remarks. The decision to withdraw troops from Syria, Biden said, created a humanitarian crisis and gave ISIS \"a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants.\" \"These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice,\" Biden said, according to the prepared remarks. \"And then, Trump sold them out.\" Trump has stood by his decision. \"It's not our problem,\" the president\u00a0told reporters Wednesday\u00a0as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared to travel to\u00a0Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire\u00a0and avoid a humanitarian crisis on the Syrian border. \"Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside,\" Biden said. Biden also used the speech to highlight the Obama administration's efforts against ISIS. \"The Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground,\" Biden said. \"Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump\u2019s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing \u2014 until last week.\" Trump has faced bipartisan criticism for the withdrawal of troops, with the U.S. House voting overwhelmingly\u00a0Wednesday afternoon to condemn the move. \"Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible,\" Biden said. \"It's about the only time they've mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump.\"",

Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here. Tell us how you're going to do what you say you're going to do\" More:Elizabeth Warren is a new front-runner in town. Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

      "author": "Candy Woodall",
      "content": "YORK, Pa.\u00a0\u2014 Democrats and President\u00a0Trump agree on at least one thing: Pennsylvania is one of the most important states on the electoral map in 2020. Analysts place it in the top three states to watch, along with Wisconsin and Michigan. Together, these states gave Trump a Rust Belt victory in 2016, thanks to a high turnout of blue collar workers. Pennsylvania hadn't backed a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988, but a wave of first-time, rural voters helped Trump change the reliably blue state to red for a victory over the favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. More:Here's where Pennsylvania, a swing state in the 2020 election, stands on Trump \"Trump won in 2016 because he flipped Michigan, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Wisconsin, all of which Barack Obama carried in the previous election. If 2020 is a repeat of 2016 in the 47 states besides Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, these three would determine the winner,\" said Seth Moskowitz, a political analyst and columnist for the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Other competitive states include Iowa, Main, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Ohio, he said. Moskowitz\u00a0is founder of EverySecondYear.com, a blog that focuses on U.S. House races. He pointed out a potential drawback of having so much attention on the commonwealth. \"A presidential campaign focused on Pennsylvania and a handful of other states might work in the electoral college, but it could hurt a candidate's party in down-ballot Senate and House races,\" he said. One of the top House battlegrounds in the country is in south-central Pennsylvania, where state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, a Democrat, is running to unseat Republican Scott Perry, an early Trump supporter who narrowly defeated Democratic challenger George Scott in 2018. There are no U.S. Senate races in Pennsylvania in 2020, but competitive House races and the presidential election will make the state a frequent stop for candidates. \"Pennsylvania is going to be critical in the next presidential election,\" said Kyle Kopko, a political scientist and professor at Elizabethtown College. \"It's one of the key states.\" Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states considered to be a tossup in 2020, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Along with Arizona and Wisconsin, it's voting patterns can't easily be categorized as \"likely Democrat\" or \"likely Republican.\" New York and California, on the other hand, are almost certain to vote overwhelmingly for a Democrat, while Oklahoma and Alabama are fully expected to vote overwhelmingly for a Republican. Analysts focus less on the red and blue states and more on the so-called purple states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Ohio and Florida, which could elect a Democrat or Republican. Can Trump win Pennsylvania again? \"That depends,\" said Terry Madonna, a veteran pollster and political analyst at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. \"We have to see how the impeachment will go, and we won't really know until we know who the Democratic nominee is.\" Trump would much rather run against a progressive, such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, who are viewed as too far left by the president's supporters, Madonna said. He doesn't want to run against Joe Biden, who has an everyman appeal. \"You can disagree with Joe Biden, but you can't dislike him,\" Madonna said. Before he\u00a0served as\u00a0vice president to President Barack Obama, Biden spent decades as a U.S. senator. Though he represented Delaware, he was constantly covered by Philadelphia media and broadcast throughout the highest population center in Pennsylvania. The story of a widower taking the train home from Washington, D.C., every night to be with his children, who had recently lost their mother, pulled at heart strings. One of Biden's biggest fans often sat\u00a0across the aisle from him in the U.S. Senate and\u00a0 next to him on the train. Sen. Arlen Specter, who represented Pennsylvania for 30 years and died in 2012, became friends with Biden during their Amtrak rides back and forth to the beltway. \"Arlen Specter used to drive Pennsylvania Republicans crazy because he called Biden Pennsylvania's third senator,\" Madonna said. As Biden campaigned with Obama, he reminded the electorate that he was born and raised in Scranton until he was about 10 years old. \"Biden is a popular Democrat and the most known Democratic nominee, and he served as vice president with the most popular Democrat,\" Madonna said. But Biden has struggled to maintain a lead among the crowded field of 17 Democratic candidates who are still in the race. Eight other Democrats have dropped out. \"The Democratic nomination process is a mess,\" Madonna said. \"I have no clue who the nominee will be. Right now, the Democratic race is a two-person contest between Biden and (Sen. Elizabeth) Warren.\" Biden being a Pennsylvania native might not help him much, especially among Trump supporters who have not wavered. The impeachment inquiry has already been more detrimental to Biden's campaign than Trump's presidency. Trump's approval rating dropped one percentage point in the Real Clear Politics average, while Warren took a lead over Biden. As of Thursday\u00a0morning, Biden had regained a five-point lead over Warren. If Biden is the nominee, Democrats hope his \"average Joe\" charm could defeat Trump in the Rust Belt areas. In the last days of Clinton's campaign, she tapped Biden to campaign for her in the heart of his home state. During a stop at a Harrisburg school administration building, Biden said the 2016 presidency would be decided in \"areas like this.\" He was right. Though Trump lost Pennsylvania cities, he won the state because of rural voters and\u00a0small towns, such as the ones that dot south-central Pennsylvania. When he dropped out of the 2008 primary, Biden joined a list of Pennsylvanians who failed in their bids for the White House, such as Specter (R), Milton Shapp (D), William Scranton (R) and Rick Santorum (R). Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, a Union general who led the Battle of Gettysburg, came close in 1880, but ultimately lost to Republican James Garfield. Hancock ultimately went on to become president of the National Rifle Association. More:U.S. presidents like to visit York County More:Who were York County's most influential citizens? The only Pennsylvanian elected president was James Buchanan, who is often regarded by historians as the worst president in U.S. history and presided over the country's spiral into the Civil War. When Trump was elected, some pundits compared the tone of the country to that during the Civil War\u00a0\u2014 the division, not the bloodshed. The battle was an intellectual one between rural and urban voters. \"People ask why politicians in D.C. are so deeply divided. It's because the voters who send them there are deeply divided,\" Madonna said. Moderates are losing elections in this environment, which bodes well for progressives such as Warren and Sanders, but not for Biden. Trump defeated moderate Republicans in the 2016 primary. Liberal Democrats defeated moderate Republicans in\u00a0House races in the 2018 midterms. To win Pennsylvania in 2020, a candidate will need to win the cities and their suburbs, and have a high turnout of their voting base. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 because he had a high turnout, won Erie, almost won Scranton, captured southwestern counties around Pittsburgh, and won 57 of 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Madonna predicts Trump will get impeached in the House, but not convicted in the Senate, which means he would serve out his term. He could potentially be impeached and re-elected. Also, no president has been re-elected with a job approval rating less than 48 percent. Trump's job approval rating was 42 percent as of Tuesday morning, according to Real Clear Politics.\u00a0Trump's job performance on the economy is 49.5 percent. \"No president has been re-elected like that,\" Madonna said. Kopko agrees the economy is key in the election. \"If there's a recession, it's a likely sign Trump will lose,\" he said But the analysts are also watching another important number. Trump's approval rating among Republicans. Some 68 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans gave him a favorable rating in the latest Franklin & Marshall College Poll released Thursday. \"His supporters are still with him,\" Madonna said. \"The question is, will they have the enthusiasm and turnout like they did in 2016.\"",

      "content": "In a statement released through his attorney Sunday morning, Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, said he would resign from the board of a Chinese company and pledged not to serve on boards of foreign companies if Joe Biden were elected president. Hunter Biden had received criticism from President Donald Trump and Republicans for his work on foreign boards as House Democrats escalated an impeachment inquiry into Trump for pressuring the Ukrainian government into opening an investigation into Hunter Biden. Trump has also said China should investigate Hunter Biden, though the Chinese government has said publicly that it would not. USA TODAY has spoken to two dozen leaders and investigators in Ukraine who say\u00a0 Trump's accusations against Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine are baseless. George Mesires, Hunter Biden's attorney, wrote in a statement posted on\u00a0Medium that Hunter Biden had decided to\u00a0resign his seat on the board of the Chinese investment firm BHR. Mesires said Biden had not received any compensation for being on the board, nor did he receive any equity in it while Joe Biden was vice president. \"To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors,\" Mesires wrote. \"He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR\u2019s investments.\" Mesires said Hunter Biden was going to resign from the BHR board by Oct. 31. More:Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust According to Mesires, \"Hunter undertook these business activities independently,\" never discussed them with Joe Biden, and \"When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith.\" Hunter Biden \"never anticipated the barrage of false charges\" from Trump, Mesires wrote. If Joe Biden were elected president in 2020, Hunter Biden pledged \"not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies\" and comply with all ethics and guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\u00a0Mesires concluded. Joe Biden has defended his son on the campaign trail and has said Hunter Biden would serve a visible role on his 2020 campaign. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an Oct. 3 interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.",

      "content": "From\u00a0Delaware \u2014 home state of former Vice President and Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden \u2014 north to New Jersey\u00a0and\u00a0the suburbs of New York\u00a0and on to Vermont and New England, Democrats can count on heavy support in the 2020 election.\u00a0And yet, as veteran USA TODAY NETWORK columnist Mike Kelly and visual journalist Chris\u00a0Pedota\u00a0found, resilient\u00a0pockets of Trump supporters persist\u00a0amid this Democratic landscape. This is the\u00a0first installment in a five-part\u00a0series,\"Red\u00a0Islands in the Blue Sea.\u201d MAGNOLIA, Delaware \u2014 If President Donald Trump is looking for allies to help him beat an impeachment effort, he should come to the flatlands of America's second-smallest state and the home of the candidate who may be challenging him in next fall's election, Joe Biden. Beyond the highway that runs by\u00a0\u201cGod\u2019s Thrift Shop,\u201d beyond\u00a0the steel bleachers of a NASCAR\u00a0raceway, beyond a bar that advertises \u201ccold beer and hot women\u201d and beyond a strip mall that is home to a nail salon, a martial arts studio and a liquor store, Trump can find Dietmar Panzig. Panzig, 75, a retired mortgage banker and son of a World War II German army captain, rarely leaves\u00a0his house in a retirement community on a former peach farm\u00a0without a T-shirt and baseball cap that proclaim\u00a0his unabashed\u00a0loyalty to Trump. At home, he routinely raises a flag promoting Trump\u2019s reelection even when neighbors, he says, call him a \"disgrace.\" Not surprisingly, Panzig, who moved to Delaware\u00a0in 2008 from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, to save on property taxes, thinks little of efforts to impeach Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about impeachment since 2016,\u201d said Panzig, who also lived in Manville, New Jersey, about 30 miles west of Staten Island,\u00a0where he served on the Borough Council. \u201cThey don\u2019t want him in there for any reason at all.\u201d \u201cThey,\u201d said Panzig, not trying to hold back his disdain, are Democrats.\u00a0And\u00a0Delaware, with its\u00a0967,000 residents, is often viewed, for good reason, as a Democratic bastion. It is, after all, the longtime political power base of Biden, who has been a dominant figure in Delaware politics for nearly half a century. Indeed, many Democrats and Republicans here agree that Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for four decades before serving as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years, is beloved in even the most conservative hamlets of the state. What's more, every statewide\u00a0officeholder \u2014 from the governor to the attorney general, the insurance commissioner, Delaware's two U.S. senators and its single member of the House of Representatives \u2014 is a Democrat. In presidential voting, Delaware has\u00a0sided with Democratic candidates for nearly 30 years \u2014 and especially in 2016, when Hillary Clinton scored an 11-point victory over Trump. But often overlooked are Delaware\u2019s hardy Republicans. Like\u00a0Panzig, a former Marine\u00a0with thick forearms and a barrel chest who served in Vietnam and now sports a bushy white beard, they are a minority.\u00a0But they are far from\u00a0quiet. Two of Delaware\u2019s three counties supported Trump in 2016. Clinton won Delaware\u2019s three electoral votes by scoring a 30-point victory in New Castle County, where nearly 60 percent of the state\u2019s residents reside. In Kent County, with its growing population of retirees and military veterans who live near Dover Air Force Base,\u00a0Trump secured a five-point victory.\u00a0In rural\u00a0Sussex County, home to sprawling\u00a0farms, poultry slaughterhouses and Delaware's conservative base, Trump won by nearly 22 points. Now, with the 2020 election approaching and with Trump facing impeachment \u2014\u00a0in part,\u00a0over allegations he held up military aid\u00a0to pressure\u00a0Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky to investigate a Ukrainian gas firm that employed Biden's son, Hunter \u2014\u00a0Delaware Republicans like Panzig are making a fresh\u00a0effort to rally behind the president. Panzig feels that he has little in common with many of the Democratic voters \u2014 and strident Trump critics \u2014 only a short drive away in the nexus\u00a0of Biden's power base in New Castle County. \"I want the Norman Rockwell America\u00a0back,\" said Panzig, who was born in the final months of World War II in a section of Poland that was German East Prussia. He immigrated with his parents to America in 1951. \"I think Donald Trump can do that, financially, socially and religiously.\" MAP BELOW: 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE Click on a district to see the voting breakdown. On a recent evening, when bulbous, gray-black storm clouds blew across Delaware's farms from the Atlantic and let loose a 15-minute torrent of pelting rain, Panzig, wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d Trump baseball cap, joined nearly 90 Republicans in a back room at Grotto\u00a0Pizza on a highway named after the state's onetime chemical giant: DuPont. The group\u2019s goals that night were simple \u2014 raise enough money to pay the rent on the Kent County Republican headquarters, a one-story bungalow just a few miles away on\u00a0South DuPont Highway, and encourage more Republicans to run against Democrats in upcoming state legislative races. Paying the rent was easy.\u00a0Hank McCann, a former two-star general in the Delaware National Guard and now chairman of the Kent County Republicans, already had half the $800 monthly rent from an anonymous donor.\u00a0After he passed a basket around the room, he had $570\u00a0more. Convincing Republicans to run for office was another story. \u201cCandidates.\u00a0I need candidates,\u201d McCann exhorted the group. Standing against the back wall, Terry Dunn, a nurse, smiled and clapped. Dunn said she grew up in a family of Democrats. But she soon tired of their refusal to support a crackdown on illegal immigration and their promises of free health care \u2014\u00a0what many Delaware Republicans disdainfully refer to as \"socialism.\" \u201cI\u2019m a super Trump fan,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing in business. He\u2019s fighting for our country.\u00a0He\u2019s not apologizing for our country like Obama did.\u201d But as McCann\u00a0gave a pep talk in one end of the room, Dunn\u00a0stood in the back, speaking in hushed tones of being afraid of reprisals for being a Trump supporter in a Democratic state. \u201cI would fear putting a Trump flag outside my house,\u201d she said. Pointing to a man sitting at a table who wore a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d Trump hat and a red \u201cTrump in 2020\u201d football jersey, Dunn added: \u201cYou have to fear walking around with that.\" The man in the football jersey, John Gregg, 67, a retired postal clerk, has no such fears \u2014 certainly not the kind that would cause him to leave his Trump hat and jersey\u00a0in the\u00a0closet. \u201cWe need a strong leader like Donald Trump,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cHe stands up for what he believes in.\u201d From his early childhood in the Bergen County, New Jersey, suburb of Ridgewood, Gregg discovered that politics was hardly a genteel sport. Gregg\u2019s father, Charles, a liberal Democrat and vocal critic of America\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War, was trounced by 25 percentage points in the 1968 congressional elections when he challenged then-incumbent Republican Rep. William Widnall for a House seat. In John Gregg\u2019s home, just outside of Dover, he still keeps a framed\u00a0pamphlet with his father\u2019s progressive platform\u00a0on a wall of his den. In an adjoining room, framed photos of President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, flank a crucifix above Gregg\u2019s bed. Gregg, who voted for George McGovern in 1972\u00a0and later worked as a volunteer for Bill Clinton's campaigns in the 1990s, left his Democratic roots for Trump in 2016. Now, as Trump battles an\u00a0impeachment inquiry, Gregg feels enduring loyalty\u00a0to the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything there to have him impeached,\u201d Gregg said from his den a few weeks after the Republican meeting. \u201cI believed in Trump. Every time he spoke about the issues, he was strong.\u00a0He wanted to make America great again.\u201d Such firm support for the embattled Trump seems almost strange when compared with the daily criticism of the president on cable news and from Democrats. But it\u2019s not odd among Trump supporters \u2014 even in decidedly Democratic Delaware. As Congress moves forward with a formal impeachment inquiry, a variety of polls show Americans are still deeply divided on whether Trump should be removed from office. A Washington Post/ABC poll released Nov. 1\u00a0found that 49 percent of Americans favored Trump's impeachment and removal from office while 47 percent opposed such a drastic move.\u00a0The same poll found that 82 percent of Democrats wanted Trump ousted, but 82 percent of Republicans wanted him to stay put. \u201cI think impeachment is atrocious,\u201d said David Anderson, 50, a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force reserve and a Dover councilman. \u201cThe Democrats are so desperate to get President Trump that they are undermining not only the presidency, but basic rules of evidence.\u201d Anderson, who is black, considers himself at the forefront of what he believes to be a surge in support for Trump among African Americans. The reason for what Anderson says will be an increase in black voters for Trump\u00a0is simple: He insists that African Americans are doing better economically, even though statistics offer a mixed portrait. African American\u00a0unemployment has dropped to around 6 percent, down from nearly 17 percent in 2010 at the peak of the economic recession. The poverty rate has also fallen. But the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau reports that median income for African Americans, after gains in 2015 and 2016, experienced a slight drop in 2017, the last year figures were available. Nonetheless, Anderson feels that more black voters will side with Trump in 2020.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he got 20 percent of the African American vote nationwide,\u201d Anderson said. A recently released Hill-HarrisX poll\u00a0found that 85 percent of African Americans would support any Democrat over Trump\u00a0\u2014 with a large number siding with Biden. Anderson, who served in the Delaware National Guard with Biden\u2019s son, Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, says it\u2019s not difficult to understand why the former vice president is still popular among African Americans and other traditional Democrats. The key to Biden\u2019s political success, Anderson says, can be found in Delaware\u2019s unique brand of politics that forces Democrats to gently support some progressive issues while also tilting to more moderate view on others. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful guy,\u201d Anderson said of Biden. \u201cPersonally I like him. Ideologically I disagree with him.\u201d Lee Murphy, a retired Amtrak engineer and conductor, considers Joe Biden to be a friend. Murphy came to know Biden when the former senator rode Amtrak trains regularly from his home in Wilmington to Washington. But Murphy, 68, a Republican, is now running for Congress himself. \"I\u2019ve known Joe for 35 years,\" Murphy said of Biden. \"I call him a friend, but, politically, I could never vote for him.\" That mix of personal and political is what some experts say is part of the \u201cDelaware Way,\"\u00a0especially in trying to appeal to progressive voters in northern\u00a0Delaware communities around Wilmington while also drawing in moderates and conservatives in the southern portions of the state. \u201cThings are handled in an almost Southern gentlemanly way,\u201d said Nancy Karibjanian, a former TV and radio journalist who now runs the University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a state where party lines get really blurred when they like the politician,\u201d Karibjanian said. \u201cThat would be how Joe Biden was elected so many times.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a small world in Delaware politically,\u201d said M. Jane Brady, a former judge and attorney general who now serves as state Republican chairwoman. Brady challenged Biden in the 1990 Senate race \u2014 and lost \u2014 in a hard-fought campaign.\u00a0But four years later, when Brady was elected state attorney general, Biden invited her to lunch, in part to smooth over their differences. And in 2002, she said, Biden made a point of supporting Brady to become a state judge. Biden seemed to have other reasons for encouraging the increasingly popular Brady to leave her attorney general position to become a judge.\u00a0Biden\u2019s son, Beau, wanted to run for attorney general. \u201cThat\u2019s Delaware,\u201d said Brady. \u201cThat\u2019s how politics used to be.\u201d Whether that style will change in the age of Trump \u2014 and among Trump supporters in Delaware \u2014 remains to be seen. Robin Hayes, 53, a nutrition counselor who is running for a House seat in the state Legislature, finds that Delaware mirrors the rest of the nation in how voters feel about Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s city folk versus country folk,\u201d Hayes said. The urbane, progressive \u201ccity folk,\u201d she explains, find Trump uncouth, embarrassing and corrupt. But \u201ccountry folk,\u201d whom Hayes considers more grounded in conservative values, find Trump to be a breath of political fresh air. \u201cWhat I find fascinating about Trump is you kind of know where he stands,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not always comfortable\u00a0with how he goes about communicating. He\u2019s kind of like a mean dog with a bone. When you have the problems this country has, that\u2019s what you need.\u201d Rob Arlett, a former U.S. Navy officer who ran Trump\u2019s campaign in Delaware in 2016, said he is \u201cnot overly concerned with Trump\u2019s personality\u201d and the controversies from the president\u2019s Twitter messages and other off-the-cuff statements. \u201cYou may not like his personality, but let\u2019s focus on his policy,\u201d Arlett said, citing Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigration and the improving economy.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s where we make headway.\u201d The question now, as Arlett and other Republicans concede, is how he will weather the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. On a recent morning at his office at the Kent County Republican headquarters, Hank McCann settled into his desk, on which a small bust of Abraham Lincoln sat next to a photograph of Trump. The news of that morning predicted that Trump would likely be impeached by the Democratically controlled House of Representatives but probably acquitted and kept in office by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. McCann chuckled as he thought about the prospect of impeaching Trump. He handed a treat to Lucy,\u00a0a yellow Labrador retriever who sat by his feet, then reached for the photo of Trump. \u201cIf they do impeach him,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019ll be the shortest trial in history.\u201d Mike Kelly is a columnist for the USA TODAY NETWORK.

Trump \u2013 who has\u00a0a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58%\u00a0\u2013\u00a0trails\u00a0by\u00a0sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%);\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%);\u00a0South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%). Each of those Democratic candidates\u00a0performed\u00a0well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and\u00a0all of them expanded\u00a0those leads in this week's survey. Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is\u00a0not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances. Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that \"the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020\" won't start coming out until after the holiday season. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment \"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states,\" Johnson said. \"But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points.\" MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there\u00a0\"literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national\u00a0more than a year out from the election.\" \"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident,\" he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College. A recent poll\u00a0from\u00a0The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading\u00a0Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona. More:Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds According to the Post-ABC poll,\u00a0most Americans share\u00a0negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say\u00a0they don't think the president is\u00a0\"honest and trustworthy,\" 62% say\u00a0he lacks\u00a0presidential\u00a0temperament, 60% say\u00a0he does\u00a0not understand their problems, 55% say\u00a0he is not good at making political deals and 54% say\u00a0he is\u00a0not a strong leader. Fifty-four percent say the United States is\u00a0less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses\u00a0the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable. Forty-nine percent favor\u00a0impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill\u00a0Clinton's impeachment at 27% to\u00a041% in 1998. Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U.S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did\u00a0something wrong\u00a0\u2013 though 8% say they don't\u00a0think it was a serious matter. Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want\u00a0to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and\u00a030% say\u00a0they would prefer someone else. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and\u00a0Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When asked who has\u00a0the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say\u00a0Biden, 17% say\u00a0Warren and 16% say\u00a0Sanders.

The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan. Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the\u00a0Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election. The Times said the results of the poll \"suggest that the president\u2019s\u00a0advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole\u00a0remains intact or has even grown\u00a0since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could \u2013 for the third time in the past six elections \u2013 win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\" And The Times\u00a0said the results showed \"little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward\u00a0winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016.\" Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42%\u00a0\u2013 his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018\u00a0\u2013 and his disapproval at 57%. And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%.

But few young Iowans share his enthusiasm for Biden. In September, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found Biden's support at 9%\u00a0among likely caucusgoers ages 35 and under. That's worse than rivals like U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has 27% support among the age group, and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has 22%. Biden's support from that age group is tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 37-year-old who is running a campaign based on generational change. When taking into account all those under 35 who are considering supporting Biden in some way, his support falls to sixth among the candidates. Other polls have found similar results. A polling average published by The Economist shows Biden takes an average of 12% support from voters under 30,\u00a0third behind Sanders and Warren.\u00a0Sanders is 78, Biden is 76 and Warren is 70. While Iowa caucus crowds skew older in general, the audiences Biden attracts are noticeably more gray-haired. He\u00a0often points out old friends in the crowd\u00a0at events, including supporters of his 2008 and 1988 runs for president. Biden campaign officials say\u00a0they'd like to improve Biden's\u00a0standing among younger voters. \"We want to increase our vote share there, with full acknowledgment that there are a lot of candidates that are attracting a lot of attention. And so no one\u2019s going to win that vote,\"\u00a0Greg Schultz, Biden's national campaign manager, told the Register earlier this month. \"We would love to be gaining some points from where we are, and we think we can.\" Campaign officials see climate change and gun control as areas where Biden has a long history of action on issues that are motivating for young people. \"When you look at the younger voters, one of the top issues \u2014 climate\u2019s big, but almost even with more passion\u00a0is guns,\" Schultz said. Part of the campaign's strategy with younger voters\u00a0will be to lean into Biden's leadership on those issues, like emphasizing his record of championing the passage of an assault weapons ban in the 1990s. \"He\u2019s taken on the NRA and won,\" said Jesse Harris, a senior adviser with Biden's Iowa campaign. On climate,\u00a0Biden's campaign has emphasized his long record going back to when he introduced the Global Climate Protection Act in the Senate in 1986. He has introduced a climate plan that sets a goal of net-zero U.S. emissions by 2050 at the latest, but some activist groups say his climate plan does not go far enough to address the issue. Kit Iyer, a senior at Linn Mar High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and an activist with the Sunrise Movement, asked Biden at\u00a0a climate-focused town hall in Cedar Rapids in September\u00a0how young climate activists like herself have affected his campaign. \"Well I hope I\u2019ve affected young climate activists over the years. And they\u2019ve affected my campaign because so many have joined it,\" Biden said. He continued with a winding answer that included the story of his own political awakening in the 1960s and ended by saying that Trump's election has mobilized young people to get involved in politics. Iyer, who is undecided in the presidential race,\u00a0said afterward that she appreciated Biden's answer to her question. \"Sunrise Movement is very encouraging,\" she said. \"I\u2019m glad that he is also that way and that he wants the youth to be active.\" Iowa campaign officials for Biden said the campaign is organizing on every college campus in the state\u00a0\u2014 regent\u00a0universities, community colleges and private schools\u00a0\u2014 with a structure akin to a precinct operation with a student volunteer acting as a sort of organizer on and around campus. But they're talking to young people in other places, as well. \"There\u2019s a lot of young people in rural parts of this state, in the blue-collar parts of this state and so on and so forth that have nothing to do with colleges and we\u2019re talking to all those people,\" said Jake Braun, Biden's Iowa state director. Campaign officials like Harris also expect Biden to perform strongly with other groups, like\u00a0veterans, Catholics, organized labor, African Americans, Hispanics and older Iowans. The September Iowa Poll found 29% of Iowans 55 and older support Biden, a 12-point lead over Warren. He also leads among rural voters, with 29%, and with those who describe themselves as \"moderate,\" with 31%, more than 20 percentage points ahead of Warren, who has 10% support from that group. Biden also leads voters ages 45-64 in The Economist polling average with 28% and has a stronger advantage with voters 65 and over, taking 39%. On Iowa campuses, Biden's campaign is powered by people like Addie Cosgrove, a 19-year-old freshman at Drake University in Des Moines who joined the campaign as a fellow in June and recently started a \"Bulldogs for Biden\" student group. She said she's known since the 2016 election that she wanted to work for Biden's campaign. \"I was waiting for Joe,\" she said. \"I wanted to work for him.\" She was inspired after reading\u00a0his\u00a0book, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" about his son Beau's death from brain cancer in 2015. Cosgrove said her father died of cancer when she was 4. Braun said the Biden campaign also benefits from their candidate's\u00a0high name identification\u00a0\u2014 and not just from his time as vice president. Braun said the years of parody articles about Biden published in The Onion, a satirical news site, and memes depicting Biden and Obama as a dynamic duo have also raised his profile with young people who otherwise wouldn't know him. \"So, oddly enough, who knew that we\u2019d be able to thank The Onion,\" he said.",

      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vaulted to a 7-point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary race, according to a poll from Quinnipiac University released\u00a0Thursday. When asked whom they would vote for if the primary election were today, 28% of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democrat named the senator from Massachusetts, compared with 21% who selected Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was third at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg finished fourth at 10%. It was the fourth consecutive Quinnipiac poll in which Warren came out ahead of Biden. Before September, Biden consistently led Warren in Quinnipiac's surveys, usually by more than 10 percentage points. But the poll appears to be an outlier compared with other recent surveys on the race. Warren surged in late September and early October to drop Biden from the lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average for the first time since the race began. Since then, however, Biden has roared back, coming out\u00a0ahead in every major national poll released after\u00a0Oct. 15 except for Thursday's\u00a0from Quinnipiac. One poll from CNN on Wednesday\u00a0had the former vice president leading Warren by 15 percentage points. Warren:Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan When asked who had the best policy ideas, Warren was the pick of 30% of likely Democratic voters, compared with Sanders at 20% and Biden at 15%, according to the Quinnipiac poll. But 28% felt Biden would make the best leader\u00a0\u2013 24% said Warren and 13% said Sanders\u00a0\u2013 and he continued to lead in the all-important question of who is most likely to beat President Donald Trump. Democratic voters have made it clear that the ability to defeat Trump is one of the most important factors in their 2020 primary decision. Biden has consistently been seen as the best positioned to unseat the president, but the percentage of Democratic voters saying that has slipped from a high of 56% in April to 42% now. The share of voters saying Warren is the one to beat Trump has\u00a0gone from 3% in April to 20%. There's a new front-runner in town:Elizabeth Warren. Just ask her Democratic rivals Warren came under fire from her rivals this month at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, getting hit particularly hard on the question of how she would pay for her health care plan. But 26% said she did the best job at the debate, compared with 17% who said Buttigieg was the winner, 12% who said it was Biden and 11% who said Sanders. When asked who performed worst at the debate, Biden was the top pick at 15%. Eleven percent said\u00a0Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, performed the worst. \"Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden, who saw his numbers slip to where they were in early July following the first Democratic debate. Then, like now, he ranked among candidates doing the worst job in the debate. Later in July, his numbers rebounded. The question remains whether this is a blip or a trend,\" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow.",

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was denied Holy Communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina on Sunday morning because of his views on abortion, a priest said in a statement. The Rev. Robert Morey said Monday that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0attended Mass at Saint Anthony Catholic Church in Florence and was refused the sacrament because any \"public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\" \"Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to Former Vice President Joe Biden,\" Morey said. \"Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\" Morey added that as \"a priest, it is my responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to my care, and I must do so even in the most difficult situations. I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers.\" When asked about the incident Tuesday during an interview on MSNBC, Biden declined to comment, saying it was his \"personal life.\" \"I'm a practising Catholic, I practice my faith,\" Biden said, adding that he does not \"impose\" his belief on others. At Catholic Masses, Communion is when congregants eat bread and drink wine, which Catholics believe become the\u00a0body and blood of Jesus Christ. Poll:Who's sticking with President Trump, through trouble and tweets? His base The Catholic Church has debated giving Communion to politicians who support abortion rights for decades, and some church leaders have argued that such lawmakers should be excommunicated entirely. In 2004, some bishops threatened to deny Communion to then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee, because of\u00a0his stance on abortion rights. When former President Barack Obama named Biden his running mate in 2008, several bishops, including Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput,\u00a0said they would\u00a0refuse Biden if he sought Communion in their diocese, according to the Catholic News Agency. Biden's stance on abortion has shifted over time. In 1974, during his first term in the Senate, Biden said the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision \"went too far\" and he didn't \"think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.\" \"I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy,\"\u00a0Biden said in a 2006 interview. He added that abortions should be \"rare and safe\" and that the focus should be on limiting the number of abortions performed. In his 2007 book, \"Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics,\" Biden said he had \"stuck to my middle-of-the-road position on abortion for more than thirty years.\" He wrote that he personally opposes abortion, \"but I don't think I have the right to impose my view\u00a0\u2013 on something I accept as a matter of faith\u00a0\u2013 on the rest of society.\" Hero dog:Hero military dog injured in al-Baghdadi raid returns to duty after treatment. Trump praises 'talented dog' This year, Biden has said that Roe v. Wade is the \"law of the land\" and that abortion is a matter to be decided on by a \"woman and her doctor.\" In June, Biden dropped his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment, which\u00a0blocks\u00a0federal\u00a0funding for abortion in most cases, amid criticism from his rivals in the Democratic primary.",

      "content": "MAQUOKETA, Ia.\u00a0\u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday referred to his health care plan as \"Medicare for All Who Want It,\" employing the phrase used by Pete Buttigieg, one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden used the phrase while answering a question from\u00a0voter Susan Reighard about high health care costs at a town hall in eastern Iowa. \"My proposal is straightforward. It is Medicare for all who want it and it significantly increases the subsidies to be able to get class A coverage,\" Biden said. He went on to say the plan would limit people's annual co-pays to $1,000 per year, reduce drug prices and allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has been describing his own health care plan as \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" for months. Previously, Biden has often described his health care plan as building on the Affordable Care Act, which he helped pass as vice president. On Wednesday, he also said he wants to \"finish the job\" that the ACA began. There are differences between the Buttigieg and Biden proposals, but both plans essentially would allow Americans a choice of buying into a government-run health care program or keeping private insurance plans. Later in his answer, Biden referred to his plan as \"Medicare, if you want it,\" emphasizing that people would be able to keep private health care if they choose to. Biden also took a swipe at rivals like U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who support \"Medicare for All.\" Warren has faced questions about how she would pay for the program, which would place all Americans on a government-run health care plan, and Biden campaign officials recently criticized Sanders for not saying which taxes he would raise to fund the plan. \"By the way, unlike a lot of people, I tell you how much my plans cost. OK?\" Biden told the crowd. He said his health care plan would cost about $720 billion. Some estimates predict Medicare for All could cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years, although proponents argue Americans would save on costs overall. Reighard, 58, of DeWitt, said she liked Biden's answer to her question and she plans to caucus for him. \"I like the idea of doing the Medicare buy-in for people like me that fall through the gaps, rather than Medicare for All,\" she said. \"I think Medicare for All is going to be a hard sell. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to pass through the Legislature. I just don\u2019t see that happening.\"",

      "content": "As Congress moves into the public phase of its Ukraine investigation, the scandal has become more clear rather than more complex. Every witness confirms a straightforward storyline\u00a0with remarkable consistency: President Donald Trump placed America\u2019s national security at risk by abusing the power of his office for personal gain. The good news so far for American democracy is that America\u2019s public servants are protecting the rule of law and the national interest. The bad news is that their chief opponent is the Republican Party. It is heartening to realize that so many government officials, all sworn servants of the Constitution, raised objections to Trump\u2019s schemes. The president\u2019s sycophants, proceeding from a warped theory of executive branch omnipotence, believe that these subordinates should have saluted smartly and moved out when the commander in chief made a decision. Instead, those officials asked whether\u00a0what they were being told to do was even legal. (Deputy Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, for example, questioned whether the Office of Management and Budget had the authority to hold up the aid.) In a system of government by the rule of law, in which government employees take an oath to defend the Constitution rather than any one political leader, this is the correct response. The question of \u201cwhat the president wants\u201d should always be subordinate to the more important question of what the law allows. Even former national security adviser John Bolton visibly reacted\u00a0on hearing of\u00a0Trump\u2019s attempt to squeeze the Ukrainians, because whatever one might think about Bolton\u2019s views, he has\u00a0also been around Washington a long time and he likely knows trouble when he hears it. Trump\u2019s defenders angrily reply that it is the president, not his bureaucrats, who defines the \u201cnational interest\u201d in foreign affairs. But Trump\u2019s apologists never explain when or why he\u00a0changed America\u2019s policy on Ukraine. As far as anyone can tell, the United States is still a friend to Ukraine and an opponent of Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. Cooper at Defense, Fiona Hill and Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman at the National Security Council, George Kent at the State Department, and others were acting not only on what they thought were legal barriers to Trump\u2019s orders\u00a0but also in accordance \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 with U.S. policy. So which is it? Were the bureaucrats running rogue ops, or was Trump incoherently countermanding his own administration\u2019s policy? One could make the cowardly argument that Trump wasn\u2019t really involved at all, and instead\u00a0argue that the whole business was cooked up by Trump lawyer\u00a0Rudy Giuliani who,\u00a0in cahoots with millionaire doofus-turned-Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Acting Director of Everything Mick Mulvaney,\u00a0supposedly launched some sort of plot to help Trump by proving that the Ukrainians framed the Russians for interfering in the 2016 election. This is a theory getting a test drive in Washington, and it\u2019s so stupid that it almost works. The Ukraine arms-for-smearing-Joe Biden\u00a0plan is both so utterly needless and yet astonishingly risky at the same time,\u00a0one can only imagine it coming from three guys in a booth at the Hay-Adams Hotel after too many Old Fashioneds. Yet it makes no sense to hang out three designated sin-eaters for the administration, not least because\u00a0Trump himself has admitted, proudly, to shaking down the Ukrainians, repeatedly and in writing. Going public:Impeachment hearings are Democrats' last, best chance to show how Trump endangers America The excuses and alternate theories of the case have mostly fallen by the wayside. The president wanted a foreign country \u2014 a friend and ally in the fight against Russian aggression \u2014 to smear an American citizen for personal political gain. It\u2019s that simple. These facts have proved\u00a0no detriment to the Republican Party in its efforts to define impeachability down. Not a single Republican voted to investigate the Ukraine mess, not even some of the retiring members who have had enough and have already blown the canopy to eject from the burning GOP. There might be some defections in the Senate at the last minute, if Democrats craft the articles of impeachment deftly enough, but it would be\u00a0unwise to invest too much hope in Republican rectitude at this late date. Even Republicans who could have stayed quiet have decided to see whether\u00a0they can harvest some political capital by defending Trump. Most notable here is a former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, who dramatically equated impeachment to the death penalty and excused Trump from political execution because the military aid, in the end, was finally delivered. Trump impeachment tools:President intimidates with weaponized Twitter feed and\u00a0die-hard fans who get the 'code' Almost certainly as part of her future campaign to be Trump\u2019s political heir, Haley\u00a0also revealed that she wanted no part of a cabal with former chief of staff John Kelly and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to keep Trump from doing the kinds of things he\u2019s about to be impeached for doing. It is a mystery why Haley thinks this makes her look anything but awful, since she is admitting both to being silent about a plot within the White House to restrain Trump (which will, and should, infuriate Trump loyalists) while also admitting that for\u00a0two years, she concealed the concerns of two administration \"adults\"\u00a0that the president of the United States was dangerous (which can, and should, infuriate any patriotic American). This, then, is the lay of the land as we move into\u00a0the public phase of\u00a0the fourth impeachment process in American history. The president is manifestly guilty of multiple offenses against the Constitution, up to and including a betrayal of his oath as commander in chief to keep the country safe. The Republican Party does not care one whit either about the Constitution or national security. And Haley would very much like you to know that she will say and do whatever it takes to be elected to national office. Our constitutional crisis continues. We will know in a matter of months whether we can overcome this moment \u2014 and the opportunists who have brought us to it.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0A new revelation in public testimony from\u00a0Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, was that\u00a0one of his aides overheard a phone call July 26 between President Donald Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about \"the investigations.\" Trump had requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u00a0investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been\u00a0under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in\u00a0the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence has found no evidence of Ukrainian meddling in 2016. Taylor testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that his staffer asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine after the phone call, which came a day after Trump's conversation with Zelensky, which\u00a0is the focus of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0Sondland said,\u00a0\"President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden,\" than U.S. policies on Ukraine, according to Taylor. In a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump denied that he had a phone conversation with Sondland in which he asked the ambassador about whether Ukraine would proceed with investigations. \"I know nothing about that,\" Trump said. \"First time I've\u00a0heard it. ... I don\u2019t recall. Not at all. Not even a little bit.\" White House:Trump is not watching impeachment inquiry hearing Taylor delivered an opening statement that largely echoed his closed-door testimony at hearings Oct. 22. He said he arrived in Kyiv on July 17 and discovered two diplomatic tracks that provided \u201ca weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances.\u201d The channels of the official State Department and a back channel guided by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani quickly began diverging, he said. Public impeachment testimony is set to begin. Here are the lawmakers to watch The ambassador shed more light on the Trump administration's decision to freeze $400 million in security aid for Ukraine over the summer, including attempts by senior administration officials to convince Trump to release the military assistance. Taylor said\u00a0CIA Director Gina Haspel was among senior administration officials who tried to persuade Trump to lift the hold on Ukraine's military aid. \"My understanding was that the secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director, and the national security adviser sought a joint meeting with the president to convince him to release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to schedule, and the hold lasted well into September,\" Taylor said. Also Wednesday, House Democrats scheduled two closed-door depositions\u00a0in the impeachment inquiry for Friday and Saturday,including from the Taylor aide who overheard Sondland's call with Trump. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., confirmed after the hearing that the aide is\u00a0David Holmes, counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, who is\u00a0scheduled to appear Nov. 15. \u00a0Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget who failed to show up for a closed-door deposition last week, is scheduled for Nov. 16.

      "content": "WASHINGTON-- Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to President Donald Trump, claimed that many of his efforts since he started his role at the White House have been focused on \"cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.\" Speaking during an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 13 News published by Axios, Kushner was responding to comments Biden made on \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0where he said it was improper for Kushner, and Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, to have senior-level positions in the White House. \u201cLook, he\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but a lot of the work that the president's\u00a0had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind,\u201d Kushner said. \"I think President Trump\u2019s entitled to pick his team, and we\u2019ve worked with him for a long time, and I think we\u2019ve done a good job of trying to help him be successful.\" Kushner continued to slam the Trans-Pacific Partnership that\u00a0Trump withdrew from, and claimed that other reforms enacted by the current administration, \"rolled back a lot of the very harsh laws that were created and partially written by Vice President Biden over 20 years ago, which put a lot of African Americans in prison and really destroyed a generation and did a lot of harm to our country.\" Ivanka and Jared have worked within the Trump administration for some time now and have\u00a0accompanied\u00a0the President on foreign trips where they've\u00a0acted\u00a0as unofficial diplomats. \u201cIf I get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings,\u201d Biden said on \"60 Minutes.\" \u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them. And the idea that you\u2019re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.\u201d Host Norah O\u2019Donnell pressed, \u201cYou don\u2019t think that Jared Kushner should be negotiating a Middle East peace solution?\u201d \"No, I don't,\" Biden answered, laughing.\u00a0\"I don't. What-- what credentials does he bring to that?\" In a response to the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, the White House said, \u201cJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are serving the American people every day, with no salary, helping deliver on the promises President Trump made to the American people.\u201d During the same interview,\u00a0Kusher said Trump's \"record of accomplishments is unimpeachable.\" The President is currently facing an impeachment inquiry\u00a0over whether he withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure them to investigate Biden.",

      "content": "Hallelujah. In Michael Bloomberg, Democrats have just what they need: another presidential candidate who was alive when Harry Truman occupied the White House. The former New York mayor and billionaire business tycoon is 77. Until Donald Trump's victory in 2016, Americans had never elected a president who was 70 upon entering office. The age of the world's most powerful person is critically important, and most voters acknowledge it. Yet in the 2020 campaign, the issue is largely ignored. Why? Back on Oct. 1, when 78-year-old Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack, it set off a flurry of worry about aging politicians. But just a couple of weeks\u00a0later, with the Vermont senator looking robust and his usual frisky self in a three-hour debate, opinion flipped. Sanders, many said, was living proof that age doesn't matter. In truth, neither Sanders' heart incident nor his declaration soon after that \"I am back!\" changed anything about the physical and mental odds facing older candidates. We tend to evaluate politicians' fitness to serve based on the image they present in public. By that measure, Sanders looks vigorous now that he's back on the trail; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70,\u00a0bounds around the stage with pep in her steps; Trump, 73,\u00a0seems tireless delivering lengthy speeches at campaign rallies;\u00a0and former Vice President Joe Biden, 76,\u00a0appears lean and fit. Then again, just a few days before being stricken in Las Vegas, Sanders seemed as healthy as ever. Trump's tan from a bottle might help project an image of physical well-being, but his actions in office have prompted many to question his mental health. Biden has fumbled badly in campaign appearances, placing his cognitive faculties in doubt. Only Warren, youngest of the leading septuagenarians, shows no outward signs of aging, but even she is at a point in life when the odds turn against you. It\u2019s not surprising that Trump supporters aren\u2019t focusing on the president\u2019s age. With impeachment proceedings dominating the news and the White House staff unraveling, age becomes the kind of thing the late George Carlin spoke of in his comedy weather forecast when he said: The radar is picking up Russian ICBMs, so I wouldn't sweat the thundershowers. On the Democratic side, the goal of defeating Trump is so dominant that little else seems to matter. When Pew researchers asked Democratic voters about age, 97% said it would be better to have a presidential candidate younger than 70. Yet, the Real Clear Politics polling average\u00a0shows about two-thirds of Democratic primary voters supporting candidates 70 or older\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Biden, Sanders and\u00a0Warren. This disconnect might be due to voters\u2019 understanding that people do age differently. They see vibrant public servants like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 79,\u00a0and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86,\u00a0and dismiss concerns about the age of presidential contenders. Uneasy feeling:Joe Biden isn't the boringly reassuring candidate Democrats were hoping for Yet, the science of aging is clear-cut regarding factors that affect a president\u2019s ability to serve. As people grow older, their ability to multitask diminishes, as does their recall of new or recently learned information. Here is one particularly pointed observation from a paper on aging by the noted author Dr. Diane Howieson: \u201cOlder adults tend to be slower in conceptualizing problems and less ready to change strategies when circumstances shift.\u201d How would that work in the White House Situation Room? Former President Jimmy Carter, a marvel of clear-headedness at 95, said recently that by the time he reached 80, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president. For one thing you had to be very flexible\u00a0with your mind. You had\u00a0to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then\u00a0put them all together in a comprehensive way.\u201d Among the things that do improve with age is experience, which is often quantified as \u201cwisdom.\u201d Biden spoke of it in the October debate: \u201cLook, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom.\u201d When Sanders was asked about his health and age, he said: \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d Same question to Warren and a similar answer: \u201cI will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone.\u201d Three predictable responses, none of which addressed the reality about aging that concerns Carter. How older candidates look and sound today might be a good indicator of how well they would function tomorrow or next month. But the\u00a0candidates are seeking a term that would end half a decade from now. Maximum age:I'm the same age as Elizabeth Warren. We 70-somethings have no business being president. Some Democrats would like Biden and Sanders to pledge to only serve one term. A related\u00a0suggestion is\u00a0they'd\u00a0be wise to select a significantly younger running mate, who could step in if needed\u00a0or move to the top of the ticket after four years. How awful. The process of replacing a president is traumatic for the nation and on the world stage, no matter what the circumstances. And betting that a vice president could move up and win the next election is no sure thing. Carter believes there should be an age limit for presidents, which sounds like a good idea that comes from wisdom gained by experience. Of course, it\u2019s too late for that sort of thing in the 2020 campaign. But there is time, when the primary-season voting begins in February, to thank the older candidates for their service and turn to someone younger.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Ahead of the first scheduled public impeachment hearings Wednesday, House Republicans have\u00a0requested\u00a0Hunter Biden and the whistleblower whose report sparked the investigation\u00a0give open testimony in the inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Saturday was the deadline for House Republicans to submit their proposed list of witnesses to Democrats. In addition to \"all individuals relied upon by the anonymous whistleblower in drafting his or her secondhand complaint,\" Republicans asked for eight witnesses: The whistleblower:\u00a0The still-unnamed official who filed a whistleblower complaint after Trump's July 25 call with Ukranian president\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. Hunter Biden:\u00a0The son of former Vice President Joe Biden and former board member of Burisma Holdings, Ukraine's largest gas company. David Hale:\u00a0The undersecretary of state for political affairs who testified behind closed doors on Nov. 6. Tim Morrison:\u00a0National Security Council aide who testified behind closed doors on Oct. 31. Kurt Volker:\u00a0Special envoy to Ukraine who testified behind closed doors on Oct. 3. Nellie Ohr:\u00a0A contractor for research firm Fusion GPS who worked on the Steele dossier,\u00a0an unverified 2016 document compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele alleging ties between Trump and the Kremlin. Devon Archer:\u00a0Burisma board member Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden. Alexandra Chalupa:\u00a0Democratic National Committee staffer who Republicans say was part of Ukrainian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. \"We expect you will call each of the witnesses listed above to ensure that the Democrats' 'impeachment inquiry' treats the President with fairness, as promised by Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi,\" top Intelligence Committee Republican Devin Nunes wrote in a letter Saturday to Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee's Democratic chairman. Schiff responded to the Republicans in a statement released later Saturday, saying they were \"evaluating\" Republicans' requests and would give \"due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry.\" \"This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President\u2019s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,\" Schiff added. More:Lobbyist says he wasn't lobbying when he tried to oust Ukrainian ambassador. Experts disagree. More:5 takeaways from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's impeachment inquiry testimony Andrew Bakaj, one of the whistleblower's attorneys, told USA TODAY his client was willing to answer questions from Republican lawmakers in writing but not in person. \"My client's complaint has been largely corroborated. Nonetheless, I have offered to have my client respond in writing, under oath, and under penalty of perjury to Republican questions,\" Bakaj told USA TODAY in a statement. Bakaj added that he feared the request to testify publicly \"was\u00a0part of a larger effort to unmask my client's identity.\" \"The call to have my client's identity disclosed will fundamentally harm a process that took decades to build. By extension, it will adversely impact Congressional oversight. These consequences, I fear, will be long-lasting,\" he added. In a letter sent Thursday to Republicans outlining the parameters for witnesses,\u00a0Schiff wrote that witnesses had to be directly related to the Trump administration's pressuring of Ukraine to open investigations into a political rival and any potential attempts to obstruct or cover up an investigation. Trump weighed in on the proposed list of witnesses as well, tweeting later Saturday that he wanted\u00a0Pelosi, Schiff and\u00a0Joe Biden to appear, among others. The whistleblower, who has been described as a person in the intelligence community, issued a complaint in August alleging Trump pushed a foreign power\u00a0\u2013 Ukraine\u00a0\u2013 to interfere in the 2020 election by asking the country\u00a0to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Democrats say\u00a0 Trump used his power to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation.\u00a0Trump has defended his interactions with Ukraine and has\u00a0dismissed the inquiry as a \"hoax\" and \"witch hunt.\" Trump and Republicans accuse Biden of strong-arming\u00a0the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, an accusation that lacks credible evidence. USA TODAY has spoken to two dozen leaders and investigators in Ukraine who say\u00a0Trump's accusations against\u00a0Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine are baseless. The impeachment inquiry was launched by Pelosi on Sept. 24. What followed were weeks of closed-door witness testimony, including that of three people\u00a0who are now on House Republicans' witness list: Volker, Morrison and Hale. On Oct. 31, in a near-party-line vote, the House approved a resolution setting the parameters for the public portion of the impeachment inquiry, which begins Wednesday.",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "Former Vice President Joseph Biden was denied Holy Communion at a parish in South Carolina last week due to his public support for abortion. This is apparently the policy of the bishop in South Carolina. The incident offers an opportunity to clarify what is required for a person to receive Holy Communion at a Catholic Mass. For Catholics, Holy Communion is, among other things, a sign of communion in Jesus Christ as well as a cause of strengthening that communion. We believe Jesus Christ himself is present in this sacrament. Therefore, with only a few exceptions, the Catholic Church\u00a0does not permit other Christians who are not in full communion\u00a0to receive the sacrament. To do otherwise would be to lie about what we believe. Catholics can present themselves to receive Holy Communion at Mass when they are not conscious of a grave and mortal sin they\u2019ve committed and when they have normally fasted for at least an hour in preparation for this holy act of receiving Christ. We believe committing a mortal sin separates us from the life of God and communion with Jesus Christ. To receive Holy Communion in such a condition runs the risk, in the words of St. Paul, of eating and drinking judgment on oneself. When conscious of mortal sin, Catholics have another sacrament available to them: confession. Confessing our sins to a priest with the firm intention of amending our lives and receiving Christ\u2019s forgiveness through the priest\u2019s absolution restores us to grace and makes us worthy once again, despite our weakness, to receive Holy Communion. Don't make priests choose between faithfulness and imprisonment:California bill targets Catholic priests first, but rights of all religions are at risk This is the normal way of things for typical Catholics committing sins, as we sinners generally do. Sometimes Catholics get embroiled in sinful choices and a sinful lifestyle. Trapped in a cycle of vice and addiction, they can still frequent confession, receive absolution, make slow progress, and all the while they receive Holy Communion regularly. But some Catholics can become callous to concerns of family, friends, or pastors. This is always distressing to everyone involved. The situation is worsened in the Church\u2019s view when a person is publicly obstinate in grave sin and insists that there\u2019s nothing immoral about what they do. Canon 915 of the Church\u2019s Code of Canon Law requires those \"obstinately persevering\u00a0in manifest grave sin\u00a0are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.\u201d The reason the Church might bar such persons from Holy Communion is precisely because their sin is not only grave but it\u2019s also public (i.e., \u201cmanifest\u201d) and they\u2019re obstinate in holding it. Such a person is no longer living in communion with the Church, so allowing this person to receive Holy Communion would also be a lie. A comfortable church can't satisfy:A Ramadan fast taught me my American Christianity is too comfortable to sustain real faith Abortion is a grave evil. This is not an issue of religion but of the fundamental human right to life. Those who publicly support abortion or enable it (whether by legislation or by cooperation) are complicit in this evil whether they are politicians or a typical parishioner in the pew. Such persons not only need to go to confession before receiving Holy Communion, but they need to show that they are not obstinate in their agenda. This usually means some assertion disavowing their previous waywardness. While abortion is one of the gravest evils of our day, it\u2019s not the only reason someone might be denied Holy Communion. A person explicitly and obstinately promoting racism would be denied Holy Communion, as happened in New Orleans in 1962. The pastoral difficulty of this aspect of Church teaching is that it requires pastors to speak to and to convince those who are advocating policies and actions contrary to the Gospel in order to determine if they are, in fact, obstinate. This is normally left to the pastor of a parish, but since the reach of politicians transcends parishes many bishops have taken on this responsibility for themselves. However, the U.S. bishops are not united in their pastoral approach. A few bishops make it policy to deny communion to publicly obstinate politicians, but many more insist Holy Communion should not be denied lest the sacrament be reduced to a political football. What is rarely said is whether bishops are actually approaching politicians pastorally (or even if they\u2019re attempting to do so) in order to persuade them of the gravity of their position. It would be a rare event indeed for a bishop to say publicly, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the senator and he\u2019s obstinate in his pro-abortion stance.\u201d Closing faith-based services hurts kids:Philadelphia's Catholic adoption agency gave me a loving home, but the city wants them out This has left most priests without any guidance from their bishop on these matters and has left the faithful to wonder whether the Church is merely a political institution after all. Nobody likes to say \u201cno\u201d or to exclude, but the Church teaches that sometimes it\u2019s necessary not only for the good of the person but also to be consistent with our teachings about communion. This will be a difficult\u00a0tightrope we walk for the foreseeable future.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A\u00a0whistleblower complaint centering on\u00a0President Donald Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president has spurred a number of allegations and counterallegations as Republicans and Democrats jockey for position amid an\u00a0impeachment inquiry. At the heart of Congress'\u00a0probe into the president's actions is his\u00a0claim\u00a0that\u00a0former\u00a0Vice President and 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine\u00a0say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted\u00a0for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim. It wasn't because Shokin was investigating a natural gas company tied to Biden's son; it was\u00a0because Shokin wasn't pursuing corruption among the country's politicians, according to a\u00a0Ukrainian official and\u00a0four former American officials who specialized in Ukraine and Europe. Shokin's inaction\u00a0prompted international calls for his ouster and ultimately resulted in his removal by Ukraine's parliament. Without pressure from Joe Biden, European diplomats, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0and other international organizations, Shokin would not have been fired, said\u00a0Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder and executive director of the Anti Corruption Action Centre in Kiev. \"Civil society organizations in Ukraine were pressing for his resignation,\" Kaleniuk said, \"but no one would have cared if there had not been voices from outside this country calling on him to go.\" In a July phone call, Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden's actions. That\u00a0prompted\u00a0a\u00a0whistleblower to\u00a0accuse\u00a0Trump of asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, which is\u00a0now the subject of an impeachment inquiry. The actions at the center of Trump's allegation occurred in late 2015 and early 2016, when U.S. aid was critical to Ukraine. Russia had seized control of Ukraine's\u00a0Crimean Peninsula and was supporting separatists who were fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country. Biden took an interest in Ukraine, said Steven Pifer, a William J. Perry fellow at Stanford University and former ambassador to Ukraine under President\u00a0Bill Clinton. \"You saw the vice president begin to emerge as really sort of the senior policy lead on Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"It's good to have attention at that level.\" At one point, Biden withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to pressure the government\u00a0to remove Shokin from the Prosecutor General's Office. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani\u00a0claim\u00a0Biden did this to quash\u00a0Shokin's investigation into\u00a0Ukraine's largest\u00a0gas company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner,\u00a0oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. They say this\u00a0benefited Biden's son,\u00a0Hunter Biden, who served on\u00a0Burisma's board of directors \u2013 for which he was paid $50,000 a month. Their assertion is contradicted by former diplomatic officials who were following\u00a0the issue at the time. Burisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden\u00a0called for Shokin's ouster, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency set up in 2014 that has worked closely with the FBI. Shokin's office\u00a0had\u00a0investigated Burisma, but the probe\u00a0focused on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to the anti-corruption bureau. The investigation dealt with the Ministry of Ecology, which allegedly granted special permits to Burisma between 2010 and 2012, the agency said.\u00a0Hunter Biden did not join the company until\u00a02014. Read it yourself: The full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint Critics of Hunter Biden have questioned\u00a0how he landed such a lucrative role with no experience in Ukraine or the gas industry. But it's not unusual for Ukrainian companies to bring on high-profile people from the West\u00a0in an effort to burnish their image and gain influence, Pifer said. Cofer Black, who served as Bush's CIA counterterrorism chief, joined Burisma's board in 2017. There is no evidence Hunter Biden\u00a0did anything wrong, said\u00a0Yuri Lutsenko, the prosecutor general who succeeded Shokin. However, Lutsenko, who's also faced criticism for his actions as\u00a0prosecutor, supported Trump's claim before changing his story. He resigned as prosecutor in August. The Burisma investigation ended with a\u00a0settlement and a fine paid by one of the firm's accountants, according to Sergii Leshchenko, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who spearheaded anti-corruption efforts under former President Petro Poroshenko. In the wake of the 2014\u00a0ouster\u00a0of pro-Russian\u00a0president Viktor Yanukovych, European and U.S. officials stepped up their efforts to deal with corruption in Ukraine. \"A big part of our diplomacy was pushing the Ukrainian government to clean up the corruption, partly because it was that corruption that allowed Russia to manipulate the country politically and economically,\" said\u00a0Charlie Kupchan, who served as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and a senior director for European Affairs on the National Security Council. Biden used U.S. aid as \"a stick to move Ukraine forward,\" Kupchan said.\u00a0\"He was acting alongside\u00a0our European allies. Everybody was of a single mind that this prosecutor was not the right guy for the job.\" Biden has boasted about his role in getting Shokin fired. During a 2018 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, he said he withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine in order to force the government to address the problem with its top prosecutor. \"I\u00a0looked at them and said: 'I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u00a0Well, son of a bitch.\u00a0He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\" he said. Pifer, who also\u00a0oversaw diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine\u00a0under President George W. Bush,\u00a0said it was appropriate for Biden to use U.S. aid as leverage. He said\u00a0he used similar methods to pressure Ukraine. Even without any credible evidence that Joe Biden sought to benefit his son, Pifer said Hunter Biden showed poor judgment in getting involved with Ukraine. \"At that point, it was pretty clear that his father was already the lead American policy person on Ukraine,\" he said. \"And even if there's no conflict of interest, I think that he should have been more mindful of how that appears.\" The international effort to remove Shokin, who became prosecutor general in February 2015,\u00a0began months before Biden stepped into the spotlight, said\u00a0Mike Carpenter, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Biden and a deputy assistant secretary of defense,\u00a0with a focus on Ukraine, Russia,\u00a0Eurasia, the Balkans, and conventional arms control. As European and U.S. officials pressed Ukraine\u00a0to clean up Ukraine's corruption, they focused on Shokin's leadership of the Prosecutor General's Office. \"Shokin played the role of protecting the vested interest in the Ukrainian system,\" said Carpenter, who traveled with Biden to Ukraine in 2015.\u00a0\"He never went after any corrupt individuals at all, never prosecuted any high-profile cases of corruption.\" That demonstrated that Poroshenko's administration was not sincere about\u00a0tackling\u00a0corruption and building strong, independent law enforcement agencies, said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank. In July 2015, Shokin's office became mired in scandal after authorities raided homes belonging to\u00a0two high-ranking prosecutors. Police\u00a0seized millions of dollars worth of diamonds and cash, suggesting the pair had been taking bribes. It became known as the \"diamond prosecutors\" case. Deputy General Prosecutor Vitaliy Kasko, who said he tried to investigate it,\u00a0resigned months later, calling the prosecutor's office a \"hotbed of corruption\" and an \"instrument of political pressure.\" Shokin's office also stepped in to help Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma. British authorities had frozen $23 million\u00a0in a money-laundering probe, but Shokin's office failed to send documents British authorities needed to prosecute Zlochevsky. The case eventually unraveled and the assets were unfrozen. In October 2015,\u00a0Ukrainians\u00a0staged a protest outside Poroshenko's home calling for Shokin's removal. In late 2015, U.S. officials stepped up the pressure. During a September 2015 speech at a financial forum in Odessa, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt decried the inability of Shokin's office to root out corruption. Biden and Ukraine: Will Trump's efforts to discredit the former VP hurt him? \"Rather than supporting Ukraine's reforms and working to root out corruption,\" Pyatt said, \"corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.\" In October 2015, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations committee\u00a0the Prosecutor General's Office must lock up \"dirty personnel\" in its own office. In\u00a0December 2015, Biden railed against\u00a0the \"cancer of corruption\" in a speech\u00a0before the country's parliament and\u00a0called\u00a0out Shokin's office. Besides Biden's threat over the $1 billion in aid,\u00a0the\u00a0International Monetary Fund threatened to delay $40 billion in aid\u00a0for similar reasons. Shokin was eventually removed from his position in the spring of 2016. The decision to remove Shokin \"creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the Prosecutor General's Office,\" said\u00a0Jan Tombinski, the EU's ambassador to Ukraine, in a written statement. \"I hope,\" Tombinski said, \"that the new Prosecutor General will ensure that the Office of the Prosecutor General becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.\" Contributing: Kim Hjelmgaard",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00a0\u2014 Allies of former Vice President Joe Biden formed an outside group this week that would allow wealthy individuals and corporations to spend massive amounts boosting his 2020 Democratic presidential bid. Leaders of the super PAC called Unite the Country filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission on Monday indicating that it plans to raise and spend unlimited amounts. The group can legally do so as long as it does not coordinate directly with Biden's campaign. The Democratic primary has been animated by a rejection of the big money in politics that super PACs represent and Biden had joined other top contenders in swearing off such groups. \"I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing,\" he tweeted in April. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field But recently he reversed himself after struggling to raise as much money\u00a0as other leading contenders in the race. His most recent campaign finance disclosures showed that he spent more than he took in during the quarter that ended in September, leaving him with considerably less cash to spend than his leading competitors \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2014 and a fourth contender looking to general into the top tier, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana. While discussions on the formation of such a group have percolated for months, last week top aide Kate Bedingfield gave Biden's allies a greenlight to move forward. \"In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating (President) Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump,\" she said. The super PAC filing from Monday lists longtime Biden adviser Larry Rasky as the treasurer of the group. Rasky, who is the head of the lobbying firm Rasky Partners, is a longtime Biden supporter who previously served as a spokesman for Biden's 2007 presidential campaign. Rasky did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",

      "author": "William Cummings",
      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday that more study is needed to determine whether marijuana is \"a gateway drug,\" making him the only one of the leading Democratic presidential primary candidates to oppose legalization on the federal level. Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who said in 2010, \"I still believe it's a gateway drug,\" and\u00a0\"legalization is a mistake\"\u00a0\u2013 was asked at a town hall in Las Vegas if his position had changed. \"No, it hasn't changed,\" Biden said. He explained that although he supports allowing states to determine their own marijuana policies, \"the truth of the matter is, there has not been nearly enough evidence acquired as to whether or not it's a gateway drug.\" Though Biden opposes\u00a0legalization on the federal level, he said anyone incarcerated for marijuana should be released and\u00a0criminal records should be expunged of any marijuana charges. He supports removing marijuana from the list of Schedule 1\u00a0drugs, which says it has no medical use, to Schedule III, which would make it easier to research. The gateway drug theory says marijuana use can lead to the use of harder drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, because it fuels an appetite to experiment with other substances\u00a0and enters the user in\u00a0a social circle where they are available. Critics of the theory say myriad factors contribute to addiction and no evidence has been found that pot's effects lead to hard drugs. \"It's a debate. Before I legalize it nationally, I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it,\" Biden\u00a0said. He said it \"is not irrational to do more scientific investigation to determine, which we have not done significantly enough, whether or not there are any things that relate to whether it's a gateway drug or not.\" The National Institute on Drug Abuse agrees with Biden that more study is needed. It said research shows that most users of hard drugs\u00a0tried marijuana first, but the majority of people who use marijuana don't go on to more dangerous substances. It said another explanation could be that\u00a0\"people who are more vulnerable to drug-taking are simply more likely to start with readily available substances such as marijuana, tobacco\u00a0or alcohol.\" Biden's stance contrasts with most other Democratic candidates who seek the nomination from voters who heavily favor legalization. According to a poll from the Pew Research Center that was released Thursday, 78% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say marijuana should be legal. Presidential pot:Why 2020 Democrats are ready to legalize marijuana More:Where the 2020 Democratic candidates for president stand on marijuana legalization Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed to legalize marijuana by executive order in his first 100 days if he is elected president. Sanders is a co-sponsor of a bill, along with\u00a0fellow 2020 candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet, that would make marijuana legal and expunge criminal records. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who acknowledged last month that he used pot a \"handful of times a long time ago,\" favors total legalization and\u00a0the expungement of records. He opposes incarceration for the possession of any drug. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have approved the use of recreational marijuana,\u00a0and 33 states allow the use of medical marijuana. Fifteen states have decriminalized marijuana possession. Contributing: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0 A new Quinnipiac poll out of New Hampshire shows the crowded Democratic field\u00a0is still pretty fluid in the early voting state but\u00a0displays a consistent top tier of Democratic candidates\u00a0led by former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden received\u00a020% of support from New Hampshire's likely Democratic primary voters. Following behind were\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 16%, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg bringing in 15%, and Sen. Bernie Sanders received 14%. Those numbers reflect the same\u00a0top tier of candidates that are also shown in several recent Iowa polls, including a USA TODAY/ Suffolk University\u00a0poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said, \"New Hampshire has mountains. Iowa has plains. They couldn't be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier. Although Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it's far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs.\" The poll reflected there\u00a0could be some fluctuation within the state as 61% of voters said they could change their mind before the primary, and 14%\u00a0said they\u2019re completely undecided at the moment. Sanders' base reflected as the most enthusiastic and loyal within the state with 57%\u00a0of backers claiming their minds are made up. Biden followed\u00a0at 43%, and Warren at 29%. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0received 6% in the poll. She is now one poll away from the December Democratic debate\u00a0but needs to improve fundraising to qualify.\u00a0Most of her support in the poll comes from voters who describe themselves as conservative or independent. More:Still a chance? 2020 longshots insist race is up for grabs Businessman Andrew Yang has received\u00a0the fundraising needed for December\u2019s match-up and is now halfway through the polling threshold from making it to the December debate stage following this New Hampshire poll. All other candidates received 1% or less of support, including Sen. Kamala Harris, who\u00a0pulled staff out of the state last week to focus her campaign efforts in Iowa. About one-third of Democrats polled listed \"someone who can win the general election\" against President Donald Trump as the most important quality in\u00a0a candidate. Biden excelled in this area, receiving\u00a031%\u00a0of the vote among those who say that electability is a necessity for their candidate. Warren followed\u00a0at 20%, Buttigieg at 19%, and while Sanders only received 6%. Additionally, pollsters\u00a0asked\u00a0New Hampshirans about their probability of voting for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg after\u00a0he\u00a0recently opened the door to join the crowded primary field. Only 2% said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg, 37% said they would consider voting, while a whopping 54% say they definitely would not vote for him. Opinion:\u00a0Bloomberg + Sanders + Biden + Trump + Warren = 374. What's wrong with this 2020 picture? Healthcare came in as the most important issue to voters at 28%. Following closely behind was climate change at 25%, and then the economy at 12%. The poll\u00a0was conducted from November 6th to the 10th, and\u00a0surveyed 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of\u00a03.8 percentage points,according to Quinnipiac.

      "content": "We asked presidential candidates questions about a variety of issues facing the country. This is what Democratic candidate Joe Biden had to say about climate change, gun control, health care\u00a0and other issues. Do you believe the earth\u2019s climate is changing? If yes, do you believe it is caused by humans? This shouldn\u2019t be a question. The science is clear that our climate is changing, and humans\u2019 contributions to it are indisputable. Climate change poses an existential threat to our environment, our health, and our communities. That\u2019s why I have introduced a bold plan \u2014 a Clean Energy Revolution \u2014 to address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. If you could unilaterally make one change, or enact one policy, that would affect the climate, what would that be? And why? On Day 1, I will kickstart a Clean Energy Revolution that ensures the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. That includes demanding that Congress enacts legislation that establishes an enforcement mechanism, makes a historic investment in climate research and innovation, and incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations and technology across the economy. I will also sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track to tackle the climate emergency head on. How would you engage foreign leaders to work with the United States on issues related to climate? The United States represents just 15% of global carbon emissions, so we will not be able to address climate change without bold action from every country. That\u2019s why I will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on Day 1\u00a0as president, and one of my first priorities will be calling a global summit to rally the world to step up our efforts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to get countries to ramp up the ambition of their own domestic climate targets \u2014 and to push us to move faster. Should the U.S. explore additional use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source? Why or why not? To address the climate emergency threatening our communities, economy, and national security, we must look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies. That includes identifying the future of nuclear energy. I will support a research agenda by establishing ARPA-C, a new, cross-agency Advanced Research Projects Agency focused on climate, to look at issues, ranging from cost to safety to waste disposal systems, that remain an ongoing challenge with nuclear power today. Should the U.S. government offer subsidies for renewable energy, such as wind energy or ethanol? Why or why not? I will make significant investments in clean energy technology and ensure we are curbing carbon emissions. I will allocate tax credits and subsidies to help businesses upgrade equipment, invest in expanded or new factories, and deploy low-carbon technologies \u2014 making sure there is bottom-line win for jobs, workers, clean energy, and long-term community investment. In addition, I\u2019ll invest $400 billion in clean energy research, innovation, and deployment \u2014 more than twice what America spent to put a man on the moon. As part of this effort, developing the next generation of biofuels will be a top priority. How would you address gun violence in America? Every day, there are shootings in America that don\u2019t make the national headlines. This nation faces a gun violence epidemic and we have to take action I have taken on the NRA and won \u2014 twice \u2014 and I will do it again. As president, I will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require background checks on all gun sales, close other loopholes in the background check system like the \u201cboyfriend loophole,\u201d accelerate smart gun technology, and more. How do you propose making schools safer from acts of violence? No kid should fear violence in the classrooms they learn and no parent should have to worry about whether their kids will come from school. We cannot let the gun violence epidemic become an acceptable part of American life. I will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and I will require background checks for all gun sales and close other loopholes in the federal background\u00a0check system, including the \u201cboyfriend loophole\u201d and the \u201cCharleston loophole.\u201d I will hold gun manufacturers accountable by repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. I\u2019ve defeated the NRA before and will do it again. What role, if any, should the government have in regulating large technology companies? We haven\u2019t spent enough time focusing on antitrust measures, and it\u2019s no secret that we need to take a hard look at how we can rein in some of the abuses of power from big tech companies. These companies\u2019 actions have significant consequences on our society \u2014 from our economic prosperity to the integrity of our elections to the privacy of our citizens to the wellbeing of our children \u2014 and I will take forceful action to hold them accountable. If you are elected, how would you interact with North Korea? What relationship would the U.S. and North Korea have? Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea has failed at every turn because it lacks strategy, process, and competent leadership. He has prioritized creating made-for-TV summits but not delivered any real commitments from North Korea to curb their nuclear program. I will pursue smart diplomacy and work with our allies towards denuclearization in North Korea, using the historic Iran Nuclear Deal that blocked Iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a blueprint for an effective negotiation. I will empower our negotiators and jumpstart a sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others \u2014 including China \u2014 to advance our shared objective of a denuclearized North Korea. Would you re-enter the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran? Why or why not? The Iran Nuclear Deal was working \u2014 it blocked every one of Iran\u2019s paths to nuclear weapons, as repeatedly verified by international inspectors \u2014 but Trump abandoned it, isolating the U.S. on the world stage, with no plan for anything better. Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon; if Iran moves back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, I would re-enter the JCPOA as a starting point to work alongside our allies and other partners to extend the deal\u2019s nuclear constraints. I would leverage renewed international consensus around America\u2019s Iran policy \u2014 and a redoubled commitment to diplomacy \u2014 to push back against Tehran\u2019s other malign behavior in the region. How do you plan to address the threat of extremism in the U.S.? We as a nation have to make the same commitment to rooting out domestic terrorism that we have to stopping international terrorism. We must condemn this hate in all its forms, including white supremacy, and not embolden it like Trump. I will ensure federal, state and local law enforcement have the resources needed to counter white supremacist terrorists. I will build on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration to support our communities in this fight, restoring funding for initiatives to counter violent extremism at home. I will close the \u201chate crime loophole\u201d and enact a federal domestic terrorism law without infringing on people\u2019s free speech or trampling civil liberties. Do you believe there is equal access to voting in the U.S.? If not, how would you go about expanding access to voting? I do not believe that there is equal access to voting. We\u2019ve got to make it easier \u2014 not harder \u2014 for Americans to exercise their right to vote, regardless of their zip code or the color of their skin. I\u2019ll restore the Voting Rights Act and ensure the Justice Department challenges state laws suppressing the right to vote. We need automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, and so many more steps to make exercising one\u2019s right to vote easier. Do you believe voter fraud is a problem in the U.S.? If yes, how do you plan to you address it? We don\u2019t have a widespread voter fraud problem. There is a widespread voter suppression problem. Donald Trump grows more scared everyday that he is going to lose this election \u2014 which is why he undermines the integrity of our elections by creating and perpetuating false and baseless claims about wide scale voter fraud. The real fraud is Donald Trump. He is attacking the fundamental rights of all Americans to vote \u2014 making it harder for communities of color, working families, and more to make their voices heard. Should it be a crime to enter the U.S. illegally? I don\u2019t believe crossing the border should be decriminalized, but unlike the Trump Administration, I will make sure that U.S. immigration law is enforced humanely. I will not separate children from families and I will use alternatives to detention and family management systems that are cheaper and more effective. If people do not have credible asylum claims or qualify for other relief under the law, then I will work with regional foreign governments to ensure migrants are repatriated humanely. Should the U.S. expand or limit legal immigration? The U.S. needs comprehensive immigration reform. Period. That includes changes that would expand access to legal immigration. As president, I will legalize DREAMers, create a roadmap to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already strengthening our communities, and reform our asylum system. In many areas of the country, there is a critical shortage of affordable housing. What would your administration do to address it? We need to provide more federal funding for housing and require that housing be inclusive. My housing infrastructure initiatives include grants for remediation of homes in lower-income neighborhoods to make them more energy efficient. I will also set a national goal of ensuring 100% of formerly incarcerated individuals have housing upon reentry into society, and use housing policy as a tool to battle climate change and expand the middle class. What is your plan to address the growing national debt? Staying vigilant on controlling our growing national debt is not only critical to our nation's economic health, but is also critical to ensuring that future generations won't be saddled with massive interest payments that will crowd-out other critical needs \u2014\u00a0like spending on health care and education. I will work with Congress to ensure we are addressing our national debt in a fair and effective way, reverse Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations, eliminate special tax breaks that reward special interests, close the capital gains loophole for multi-millionaires, and pare back on ineffective tax expenditures for the wealthiest Americans. Do you think our national debt is a national security issue? Why or why not? Economic security is national security. That is why, as president, I will pursue a foreign policy for the middle class. That includes significant investments in workers, families, communities, and the core sources of our national strength, including innovation, education, and infrastructure. It also includes putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal path to make our country less vulnerable to economic threats from foreign powers and to strengthen our ability to respond to future crises. Is capitalism the best economic structure for the United States? If yes, why? If no, what is better and how do you believe it will benefit Americans? Yes, a well-regulated capitalism is the best economic structure for the United States. The American middle class built this country. Yet today, CEOs and Wall Street are putting profits over workers, plain and simple. It\u2019s wrong. There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It\u2019s time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they\u2019re worth. I will increase the federal minimum wage to $15, reverse Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations, and encourage collective bargaining and unions. In many parts of the country, there is a skilled worker gap. How would you close that gap to get more people employed in the industries that need them? In today\u2019s increasingly globalized and technology-driven economy, 12 years of education is no longer enough for American workers to remain competitive and earn a middle class income. I will make significant investments in workforce training, including $50 billion for community college business partnerships and apprenticeships. These funds will create and support partnerships between schools, governments, unions, and businesses, to identify in-demand knowledge and skills in a community and develop or modernize training programs that lead to a relevant, high-demand industry-recognized credential. Should the government forgive student loans? If yes, why and for whom? If no, why not? Our country faces a student debt crisis. Even years after graduating, Americans are drowning in debt, and people of color are disproportionately affected. My plan will halve the payments on undergraduate federal student loans by simplifying and increasing the generosity of today\u2019s income-based repayment program, and not require payments or accrual of interest on undergraduate federal loans for those making less than $25,000 a year. I will also create a new, simple loan forgiveness program that offers $10,000 of student debt relief for every year of national or community service for up to five years. Should community college be free to anyone who wants to attend? Should other colleges and universities be free to attend? As my wife Dr. Jill Biden, a community college professor, says, community colleges are America\u2019s best kept secret. As president, I will provide two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt to every hard-working individual,. I will create a new grant program to assist community colleges in improving their students\u2019 success by implementing evidence-based practices and innovative solutions to increase their students\u2019 retention and completion of credentials. And I will tackle barriers, such as child care, transportation costs, or unexpected financial challenges, that prevent students from completing their community college degree or training credential. Is more funding needed for mental health care in America? If yes, what amount and how should it be allocated? Where should that money come from? Yes. Mental health care is health care. As president, I will ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services. I will also double the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. I will pay for my health care plan, which includes mental health care, by getting rid of capital gains tax loopholes for the super wealthy. The Biden plan will assure those making over $1 million will pay the top rate on capital gains, doubling the capital gains tax rate on the super wealthy. Read what all the candidates have to say about health care here. How would you address rising prescription drug costs, specifically for medications that are necessary for people to live, such as insulin and mental health medications? Too many Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, and drug corporations profiteer off sick individuals. It has to stop. I will repeal the law allowing drug companies to avoid negotiating with Medicare, limit the launch prices of their drugs with no competition, allow consumers to buy prescription drugs from other countries, and terminate big pharmas\u2019 tax breaks for egregious advertising spending. As a condition of participation in the Medicare program and the public option, I will prohibit all brand, biotech, and abusively priced generic drugs from increasing their prices more than the general inflation rate. What do you believe is the biggest health care issue facing Americans? How would you solve it? Making health care more affordable and accessible for every American, which is why I will protect and build on Obamacare. Every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care. Whether you\u2019re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, my plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. It will reduce costs for patients by negotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers, and won\u2019t force approximately 157 million people out of their existing coverage. How would you address the opioid crisis? So many lives, families, and communities throughout the United States have been destroyed by opioid addiction. The best way to tackle the opioid crisis is make sure people have access to affordable, quality health care, including insurance that covers addiction and mental health services. Obamacare provided coverage and lower premiums to millions of people with pre-existing conditions, including mental health issues, which is why I will protect and build on it to redouble efforts to ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services to support those with mental health issues and addiction so people can get the care they need. Should marijuana be legalized federally for medicinal use? Should it be legalized for recreational use? I support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes. I will leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts. No one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, I will decriminalize recreational cannabis use at the federal level and automatically expunge all prior convictions. Do you support a public health insurance option for all Americans? If yes, do you support the elimination of private health care in favor of a government-run plan, or do you support an option where Americans can choose a public or private plan? If no, why? Yes, I support a public health insurance option for all Americans. Instead of eliminating private health insurance, my plan will protect and build on the Affordable Care Act. Whether you\u2019re covered through your employer, buying insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, my plan will make sure that everybody can purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. My plan is the fastest way to achieve universal coverage at 1/30th the cost. Health care is personal to me. If I am elected president, I guarantee you I will protect your family\u2019s health care as if it were my own. Should the federal government re-institute the death penalty? If yes, for what crimes? No. We must eliminate the death penalty because we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time. I will work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example. These individuals should instead serve life sentences without probation or parole.",

He added that Biden is \"actually somewhat better than that.\" Last week, North Korean state media hurled a series of insults at Biden and\u00a0said, \"Rabid dogs like Biden can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run out of control.\" The statement said that\u00a0such dogs\u00a0\"must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late.\" The regime's attack on Biden was apparently in response to a Biden campaign ad that referred to Kim as a \"tyrant.\" After defending Biden, the president then referred to the efforts to negotiate an agreement\u00a0aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear weapons program, telling Kim \"I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!\" Trump and Kim do not have another summit scheduled at the moment. Nuclear talks between the U.S. and Noth Korea broke down last month in Sweden. But the North Koreans said Thursday that the U.S. had offered to restart the stalled negotiations in December.

Then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump and Kim \"agree in their assessment\" of Biden but that the president was not siding with Kim. Trump is currently facing an impeachment inquiry sparked by allegations that he pressured Ukraine into conducting an investigation into Biden for political purposes.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A new Quinnipiac University poll out of South Carolina has former Vice President Joe Biden leading the pack of 2020 Democratic contenders\u00a0by\u00a020 points. Biden commanded the field at 33%, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren earning 13% and Bernie Sanders holding at 11%. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg received 6%, with businessmen Tom Steyer following at 5% and Andrew Yang at 4%. Sens. Kamala Harris received 3% and Cory Booker earned 2%. No one else in the crowded primary field topped 1%. More:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide South Carolina is the first southern state to hold a presidential primary, and currently, 55% of likely voters said they might change their minds before the primary, with another 18% still undecided. \"Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear frontrunner in the Democratic primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad-based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters,\u201d Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Mary Snow stated. \u201cWhere South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.\" Among black voters, Biden dominated at 44%, followed by Sanders at 10%, Warren at 8%\u00a0and Buttigieg receiving less than 1%. Buttigieg\u2019s low polling number in South Carolina among black voters comes amid\u00a0The Intercept's reporting\u00a0that three South Carolina politicians - who\u00a0were included in a list promoted by the campaign of more than 400 South Carolinians supporting Buttigieg\u2019s \"The Douglass Plan\"\u00a0- felt\u00a0they had been mischaracterized as endorsing Buttigieg. Johnnie Cordero, chair of the state party\u2019s Black Caucus, said he never backed the plan,\u00a0which he called \"entirely presumptuous.\" Despite surging in polling in Iowa, the Buttigieg campaign has struggled to attract the support of African-American voters. More:Buttigieg campaign criticized for using stock photo of Kenyan woman to promote plan to address US racism Biden also was viewed as the most favorable of all the candidates at 71% and had name recognition at 89%. The candidate with the least name recognition was Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, who jumped in the race last week. Snow added that\u00a0Patrick \"has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him. More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough - but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably.\" This poll counts for the December Democratic primary debate. Steyer has now hit the polling threshold to make it to the debate stage, but still needs donors. Yang needs just one more poll to qualify, following hitting 4% with this one. Quinnipiac University surveyed 768 likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina from November 13 - 17,\u00a0with a margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.",

      "content": "Cory Booker goes after Biden on race record and marijuana stance Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) smoked former Vice President Joe Biden over marijuana legalization during Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, and that was great. Booker called out the former vice president for his\u00a0recent eye-opening\u00a0opposition to legalizing weed, jokingly saying he thought Biden \u201cmight have been high.\u201d But this is no joke and Booker quickly and succinctly reminded Biden \u2014\u00a0and America \u2014\u00a0of the failed drug policy that's reigned for too long. \u201cMarijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people \u2026 and the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.\u201d Biden snapped back at Booker to stake his progressive credentials, saying he\u2019s OK letting out of jail anyone with a marijuana conviction\u00a0and expunging their criminal records. \u201cI think we should decriminalize marijuana, period,\u201d Biden said. Biden, nonetheless, appears to be the only one or among the few Democratic presidential contenders opposed to legalizing marijuana at the federal level. He argues that more study is needed to determine\u00a0if weed is a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d Biden isn\u2019t just old-fashioned. He\u2019s a stubborn prohibitionist averse\u00a0to catching up to reality \u2014\u00a0the inevitability of marijuana\u00a0legalization. He\u2019s blind and intransigent to the pain and suffering of so many people caught in America\u2019s tough-on-crime penchant. A handful of states have already legalized pot for recreational purposes but Uncle Sam still considers it an illegal substance. Marijuana arrests account for more than half of all drugs arrests in the United States, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for marijuana possession, the group states. And guess what? Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana despite roughly equal usage, the ACLU says. Give it up for Booker for calling out Biden, one of the frontrunners in the Democratic race for the White House. Are Democrats really going to pick a marijuana prohibitionist as their 2020 standard bearer?

      "content": "In one of the early episodes of \"Wolf Hall,\" a PBS Masterpiece Theatre presentation, one of the characters laments that England in 1531 is in \u201cdisorder.\" That comment struck home for me as I began to make a decision about whom I would support in the Iowa caucus. The choice was for me\u00a0\u2014 and I suspect for others\u00a0\u2014 a difficult one, made so by the number and quality of candidates from which to choose. My wife Christie and I made the decision that we would try initially to help anyone who asked. As a result, we traveled to events for individual candidates, invited them to our home\u00a0and provided policy advice on a variety of rural centric topics. I am particularly proud of all the candidates who put out extensive, comprehensive and thoughtful plans to improve life and economic opportunity in rural places. Their efforts will ensure that our nominee will have much to say during the general election about a rebuilt rural economy. I share the concern deeply held by many Americans of all political persuasions that our country is in a state of \u201cdisorder.\" President Trump and his administration continually abuse power, disrupt key foreign alliances\u00a0and undermine democratic norms. The stakes for the nation in the upcoming election have not been this high in my lifetime. This places a serious responsibility on all of us who will participate in the caucus and who will vote in the general election. My experiences as a governor and cabinet secretary shaped my decision process. At this point in time, I think the next president must have the unique combination of the\u00a0experience and the personal relationships with leaders of both parties to begin the hard work of bringing us together again as one nation. The candidate I support must have a progressive vision for the country that builds upon past policy successes while addressing in a real and practical way our major domestic challenges: millions of Americans without access to affordable healthcare, a shrinking middle class, our broken immigration system\u00a0and an unfair justice system. Our next president will also be confronted with a world in need of American involvement and leadership to secure our country and others against the threats posed by terrorism, nuclear weapons proliferation, pandemics, cyber\u00a0attacks\u00a0and climate change. I believe my party\u2019s nominee should have the necessary foreign policy experience and personal relationships with global leaders to start from day one of the new administration repairing the significant damage done to America\u2019s global standing by the current administration. The most obvious point to make in selecting a nominee is electability. No leader can change the direction of a country or improve people\u2019s lives if he or she can\u2019t win the election.\u00a0Given the highest possible stakes in this election, electability has an enhanced role in deciding who the nominee should be. More on Campaign 2020:Democratic debate in Atlanta: From A to F, Mastio & Lawrence grade the 2020 candidates As I thought about the candidate who has the ability to bring us together as one nation, the progressive but practical vision for progress at home, the experience and personal relationships to repair America\u2019s image abroad, and the best chance at winning the states we have to win to govern, I concluded that Joe Biden is the person for the job. I have known Joe Biden for over 30 years. I ran my first race for mayor, because Joe reminded me that the penalty for not getting involved is that people less qualified than you get elected.\u00a0I learned from him how to work with others across the aisle as a state senator and governor. I remain privileged and honored to have worked with him for 8 years during the Obama administration. As a result of those experiences I am confident he can help heal our nation and return a sense of normalcy and decency to the White House. I know he can build on the success of the Affordable Care Act to again expand affordable health care coverage to the more than a million\u00a0Americans who have lost coverage during the current administration. He remains committed to rebuilding the middle class in all parts of our country including rural, small town America. He understands the complex and often dangerous world we live in and no candidate in the race has the experience and the relationships to keep us as safe and secure as Joe Biden. While some may argue that Joe Biden\u2019s lifetime of public service is a draw-back, I see it as a strength.\u00a0I see a well-defined candidate, who has withstood the test of time. I see a candidate who will best stand up to the character assassination attempts that we know are coming. I know Joe Biden to be a good and decent man. I believe a majority of Americans will find that Joe Biden is the person best prepared and best positioned to heal the divisions within our country and to end the \u201cdisorder\u201d of the last 3 years. For all of these reasons I will proudly caucus on February 3, 2020 for Joe Biden. Tom Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa, was the secretary of Agriculture under Barack Obama.",

      "content": "Killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terrorist organization, is an important win for America\u2019s national security. But almost every detail of the raid that has emerged in the days since points to a truth we already knew: Donald Trump is the most reckless and incompetent commander in chief we\u2019ve ever had. His impulsive decision to withdraw our troops from northeast Syria was not just a gift to our adversaries and a betrayal of our Kurdish partners. It reportedly also imperiled a priority counterterrorism mission that had been months in the planning. Trump is quick to claim the credit, but he made the job harder and more dangerous for our forces. And his abandonment of the Kurds is all the more galling knowing they provided critical information that enabled us to track al-Baghdadi. Ultimately, the U.S. military and our intelligence professionals are so good that they succeeded in getting their man \u2014 in spite of Trump. Every day that Donald Trump is in charge of our national security is a dangerous day for the American people. He has abandoned our allies while embracing dictators. He has abdicated American global leadership, ceding ground to Russia and China. He started an irresponsible trade war that has delivered next to nothing, except more pain for farmers, manufacturers\u00a0and workers. He has walked away from our democratic values, turned his back on human rights\u00a0and ignored massive humanitarian suffering. He made the decision to rip children away from their parents. He has withdrawn from international agreements that made us safer, like the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. And he has repeatedly failed or refused to lead on critical issues that require global cooperation \u2014 from confronting the climate emergency to preventing the spread of disease to curbing nuclear threats. After almost three years, he still has no idea what he\u2019s doing on foreign policy, and there\u2019s no indication that he cares. He continually puts his personal interest ahead of the national interest, and he still has more than a year in office. Imagine the damage he could inflict in that time. The next president will face the enormous responsibility of picking up the pieces of America\u2019s foreign policy and restoring respect for the United States around the world. That person\u00a0will have to address the world as it is in January 2021 \u2014 in whatever state of disarray Trump leaves it \u2014 and there won\u2019t be time to lose building relationships with world leaders from scratch, or learning what it means to run the government and command the greatest military force in history. We need a leader who can, on Day One, pick up the phone to call our NATO allies and leave no doubt of whether the United States will meet its obligations or stand up for democracy and freedom. I hope to be that leader. And I won\u2019t need any on-the-job training. More:Warren is a friend to capitalists, at least those who see revolution coming If I am elected, my administration will place America back at the head of the table. I\u2019ll rally our allies, mobilize global action to meet global threats\u00a0and once more ensure that the United States is the leader of the free world. I will reaffirm the longstanding American commitment to leading with our values. As president, I will remind the world that the United States of America does not coddle dictators. I\u2019ll restore the value of America\u2019s word on the international stage. I\u2019ll ensure we are once more a beacon of liberty, a bulwark of democracy and self-determination\u00a0and a champion of human rights. The United States of America is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of\u00a0the power of our example. That\u2019s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that\u2019s something Donald Trump will never understand.

That\u2019s understandable, and even praiseworthy, but if you won\u2019t do it, you won\u2019t win. And it isn\u2019t just important for your own campaign, but for our whole country, that you clear up any honest confusion out there about your involvement in Ukraine. Because as your apparently former Senate friend\u00a0Lindsey Graham\u00a0has now made clear, Trump\u2019s impeachment defense in the Republican-controlled Senate is going to be to put you on trial. I\u2019ve written before that I was tired of watching you be Al Gored in the media, but this is more like John Kerry\u2019s failure to see the urgency of defending himself against the swift boat lies that mortally wounded his \u201804 presidential bid. Like Kerry, you seem to think that saying that you have done nothing wrong is all you have to say. It\u2019s not. Total deflection:Donald Trump's baseless Joe Biden conspiracy fantasy should make Americans feel sick The facts are pretty simple, so why not say, \u201cLook, I wish my son hadn\u2019t taken that job with exactly the kind of corrupt oligarch I was working to make sure would be held accountable. But has anybody out there ever had (or been) a grown child who made a misguided decision and insisted he knew what he was doing?\u201d Every parent in the world would get that, and non-parents, too. Say what\u2019s true, which is that the troubled son you love more than life should never have accepted a spot on the Burisma board of a Ukrainian oligarch, but he did. Repeat, as often as necessary, that as the record shows and as everyone who has looked into it knows, you went to Ukraine to push out a prosecutor for being too soft on corruption, and for slow-walking or deep-sixing altogether the investigations of many corrupt companies, Burisma included. Remind us that the reason you bragged about all this on tape, at a not at all obscure event, is that you were rightly proud of getting Viktor Shokin fired, and you still are. President Barack Obama and the European Union and Ukrainian reformers were all glad, and you should be, too, America. As Norah O\u2019Donnell, of CBS, recently told Biden in an interview, the president is \u201cattacking your integrity.\u201d A first choice at risk:Joe Biden is my Harvard, not my 'safety school.' He really is my favorite 2020 Democrat. \u201cSure he is,\u201d the former vice president answered, \u201cbut it\u2019s coming from a man with no integrity, so it helps.\u201d If you believe that, you\u2019re too foolish to be president, and if you don\u2019t believe it, stop saying it, since authenticity is normally your best event. An American president, he told O\u2019Donnell, should always \u201cmake it clear to the American people that everything you\u2019re doing is for them.\u201d So should a presidential candidate.

      "content": "WINTERSET, Iowa\u00a0\u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday night identified several prominent Democratic women who he said could serve as his vice president if he is elected president. At a town hall, Biden was asked who his vice presidential pick would be if he wins the Democratic nomination. \"You. Are you available?\" Biden joked to the questioner, before giving a serious answer. Biden didn't name anyone specifically but said there are a number of people who are qualified. \"I could start naming people but the press will think that\u2019s who I picked,\" he said, before obliquely referring to several potential candidates. His list included \"the former assistant attorney general who got fired,\" referring to Sally Yates; \"the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia,\" referring to Stacey Abrams; and \"the two senators from the state of New Hampshire,\" referring to U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Yates garnered national attention in 2017 when President Donald Trump fired her from the U.S. Justice Department for refusing to defend his administration's travel ban. She was acting U.S. attorney general at the time. Abrams, a former state lawmaker in Georgia, came close to winning that state's gubernatorial election last year and said in Iowa this month that she would be \"happy\" to run as a vice presidential nominee. Biden also expounded on his own relationship with President Barack Obama, for whom he served as vice president. He said the most important thing is to pick a running mate who aligns with you philosophically and who you can trust with big assignments. He said he would express his disagreements with Obama privately, but then was dedicated to carrying out the president's agenda. \"We were philosophically in agreement and we strategically agreed on everything. We disagreed on tactics sometimes. And a vice president cannot be in a position even in a cabinet meeting where he or she is taking on the president,\" Biden said. \"We\u2019ve had arguments, we\u2019ve shouted at each other in private, but we always completely trusted each other,\" he said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden has rebounded to take the lead of the crowded field of Democratic contenders in a new national\u00a0Quinnipiac University poll\u00a0released Tuesday. The new numbers come just one month after an October 24 poll put Biden\u00a07-points behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 21%. The November poll has Biden now leading the pack at\u00a024%, with\u00a0South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg receiving 16%, up 6 points from October.\u00a0Warren polled at 14%, dropping from 28% in October, and Sen. Bernie Sanders came in at 13%. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in the press release,\u00a0\"Biden is back on top of the pack but now there is a 3-way race for second. Buttigieg has broken into the top tier, apparently at the expense of Warren, who has taken a dive after being hammered for being too far left on health care and other issues.\" Notably,\u00a0former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who recently announced he was entering the 2020 primary after much speculation, gained 3% in the Quinnipiac University poll, tying with\u00a0Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, who have been in the race for months. More:Elizabeth Warren blasts Michael Bloomberg, says he's trying to 'buy a nomination' Businessman Andrew Yang, Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker,\u00a0former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen.\u00a0Michael Bennet received 2% each. 11% of likely Democratic voters were undecided, and no other candidate topped\u00a01%. Biden again dominated on electability with 46%\u00a0viewing him as the candidate who has the best chance against President\u00a0Donald Trump. This was also the most important\u00a0quality for a candidate to have, according to 35% of voters. Warren and Sanders' drop in this poll coincides\u00a0with their \"Medicare for All\" idea\u00a0receiving only a 36% positive review from voters surveyed, while 52% say it is a bad idea. More:Number of Americans supporting Trump's impeachment and removal unchanged by hearings, poll finds On impeachment, Malloy said,\u00a0\"The televised impeachment hearings haven't had much of an effect on the president's approval rating, or how voters feel about impeachment. The numbers still don't look good for Trump, but they definitely haven't gotten worse.\" This echoes a similar result found in a poll CNN released Tuesday. According to Quinnipiac University, 45%\u00a0of\u00a0voters think\u00a0Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 48%\u00a0disagree. Half of voters polled agreed that the impeachment inquiry is a legitimate investigation, while 43% think it is a political witch hunt. However, 76%\u00a0think that the Trump administration should fully cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, while only 18%\u00a0don't think so. More:House Judiciary Committee sets first impeachment inquiry hearing Dec. 4 According to Quinnipiac University, 1,355 self-identified registered voters nationwide were surveyed with a margin of error of\u00a03.2 percentage points from November 21 - 25. The survey included\u00a0574 Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points..",

      "content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is defending his decision to ask the State Department for documents related to the Bidens and Ukraine, after former Vice President Joe Biden said he was \"embarrassed\" by\u00a0the senator's move\u00a0last week. Speaking on Fox News Radio on Monday, Graham pushed back against the 2020 Democrat, saying that the issue has \"nothing to do with friendship\" between the two politicians. Biden had said that he was \"angered\" because Graham \"knows me, he knows my son.\" \"My friendship with Joe Biden, if he can't withstand me doing my job, it's\u00a0not the friendship I thought we had,\" Graham said. Graham sent a letter to the State Department last week requesting records of Biden's interactions with Ukrainian officials. House Democrats are pursuing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u00a0for an alleged pressure campaign to get the Ukrainian president to open\u00a0investigations that would benefit him politically. Meanwhile,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his political allies have pushed the allegation, without evidence, that Biden called for the firing of a top\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0prosecutor to protect his son, who once sat on the board of\u00a0energy company Burisma in Ukraine. Biden pushed for the prosecutor's ouster for failing to pursue corruption cases, the consensus among international groups at the time, according to officials. A Biden spokesperson said in a statement, \"Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress for most of the last five years and said or did nothing to indicate they thought that this warranted attention.\" Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases Of the accusations against Trump, Graham said, \"I don't see that. I don't see that being proven.\" Graham said that he would not give Democrats \"a pass,\" while they continue to investigate Trump, and accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of conducting an \"un-American\" impeachment process. \"I'm not going to create a country where only Republicans get investigated,\" Graham said. \"... And we're going to ask questions of Hunter Biden's role, and getting the prosecutor fired.\" In response to Biden's accusation that Trump has power over him, Graham said, \"I'm doing this because somebody needs to do it.\" \"Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"I say, Lindsey, I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing, for you.\" \"Don't feel bad about me. Don't worry about me. I am fine, Joe. You're a good man,\" Graham said Monday. 'I'm embarrassed by what you're doing':Joe Biden says Lindsey Graham will regret backing Trump amid Ukraine controversy Graham said that he hopes his friendship with Biden will continue, but that somebody needs to look into the questions about Hunter Biden. \"I admire him as a person, I think he's always trying to do right by the country. I think he's made a lot of bad policy choices, but as a person, I like him,\" Graham said. \"But we're not going to allow a system in America where only one side gets looked at. These are legitimate questions.\"",
