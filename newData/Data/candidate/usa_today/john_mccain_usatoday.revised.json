      "content": "It's President Donald\u00a0Trump's birthday. On Friday, June 14, in honor of the Republican president's special day, thousands of people\u00a0used a hashtag to troll him, and it\u00a0quickly went\u00a0viral. It all started when an executive producer of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" called on his followers to help Trump celebrate\u00a0by making the hashtag #JohnMcCainDay a trending topic. \"Let\u2019s celebrate @realDonaldTrump\u2019s birthday today by having #JohnMcCainDay trend,\" Lassner tweeted. \"I\u2019m sure this would mean a lot to patriot like Donald Trump. #JohnMcCainDay\" Early Friday morning, the topic celebrating the late Arizona senator\u00a0took off in the U.S. with more than\u00a051,000 tweets using the hashtag. 'What the heck' is that?\u00a0Security camera captures odd creature, and viewers have theories Crop tops for men?\u00a0Twitter users express mixed feelings about the new trend Responses to Lassner's tweet varied. Some criticized him for \"playing childish games on social media,\" while others shared photos of McCain giving a thumbs up. Canadian-American singer Kaya Jones writes: \"You are a producer who makes a good living and has a mega job yet you spend your time playing childish games on social media with a sitting President.\" Jones' tweet received 600 likes. Some people used the hashtag to reflect on\u00a0the Navy veteran's contributions to American history, sharing quotes and experts from\u00a0books McCain wrote. Twitter user Molly McKew shared a quote from McCain's memoir, \"The Restless Wave.\" \"We were born to love, and we were born to have the courage for it. So be brave \u2013 the rest is easy,\" McKew tweeted.\u00a0Twitter user Claude Call shared a quote from McCain that reads: \"Our great power does not mean we can do whatever we want whenever we want, nor should we assume we have all the wisdom and knowledge necessary to succeed.\" There's also a petition on Change.org to recognize June 14th as John McCain Day. The petition has over 500 signatures so far. Trump hasn't shied away from criticizing the late senator, even after death. In 2015, Trump\u00a0explicitly argued that McCain was not a war hero because he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years. McCain died\u00a0in August 2018 following a battle with brain cancer. In March 2019, Trump said he\u00a0never liked the Arizona senator over differences that included Russia and health care. \"I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Russian government denied visas to two U.S. senators who planned to visit the country\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an unusual rebuke that has forced the lawmakers\u00a0to nix their trip to Moscow. The senators\u00a0\u2013 Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut\u00a0\u2013 condemned the Kremlin's decision as counterproductive and petty. \"The Russian government is further isolating their country by blocking our visit,\" Murphy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This is potentially a perilous moment for our two nations\u2019 fragile relationship, and it\u2019s a shame that Russia isn\u2019t interested in dialogue.\" Johnson called the move a \"petty affront\" and said he had hoped \"direct dialogue with Russian parliamentarians\"\u00a0could help improve U.S.-Russia relations. Instead, he said, Putin's government \"decided to to play diplomatic games with this sincere effort and have denied me entrance to Russia.\" Russia:Donald Trump re-ups desire for Russia to join G7, says Putin 'outsmarted' Barack Obama A third senator scheduled to go on the official congressional trip, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, was granted a visa and still plans to go, his spokesman, Conn Carroll, said in an email. The Russian embassy in Washington posted a statement blasting Johnson as \"russophobic\" and saying he never applied for a visa through its facility. \"Senator Ron Johnson's groundless accusations against Russia leave no doubts\u00a0\u2013 he is ready not for a\u00a0dialogue but for a confrontation,\" the statement said. The same comments applied to questions about Murphy's visa denial, the embassy said. In a tweet, the embassy implied it was retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Russian legislators. Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said it was rare for U.S. lawmakers to be denied visas. \"It\u2019s just extremely unusual, and I would say regrettable,\" McFaul said. He pointed to one other similar incident:\u00a0In 2017, Russia barred Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, from visiting the country. The Kremlin blocked her visit after Congress passed a tough Russia sanctions bill that\u00a0Shaheen had vocally backed. In 2015, Russia sanctioned then-Sen. John McCain, a fierce Putin critic, and several other top American officials, apparently in retaliation for sanctions the Obama administration had imposed on Russian\u00a0officials. McCain joked that the move ruined his plans for a holiday in Siberia and said he was proud of standing up \"against Putin\u2019s deadly aggression in Ukraine.\" McFaul said it's not clear what Murphy and Johnson did to provoke Russia's ire, but it suggests President Donald Trump's efforts to repair relations with Russia are misplaced. \"I think it underscores something that is often missing in the debate about Trump and all his happy talk about Putin,\" McFaul said. \"Why does he assume that Putin wants a good relationship with the United States?\" Abby Finkenauer:She made history with AOC but Congress' second-youngest woman, Abby Finkenauer, is her own Democrat Putin has not done anything to improve relations, and this incident is a \"clear example that hes' not interested\" in a thaw, McFaul said. Johnson, Murphy and Lee all sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Johnson chairs\u00a0the subcommittee on Europe & Regional Security Cooperation. All three voted in favor of the Russia sanctions bill. The lawmakers had intended\u00a0to meet with Russian government officials and civil society activists, although their itinerary had not been finalized.\u00a0Jamie Geller, a spokeswoman for Murphy, said her boss would now travel to Berlin and then join Johnson in visiting Serbia, Kosovo and Ukraine. Lee's spokesman said his only confirmed meeting so far is with America's ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman Jr. AMERIND Risk",

Thousands\u00a0have been fleeing the\u00a0Bahamas since\u00a0Dorian slammed into the island chain a week ago\u00a0as a Category 5 monster. Entire communities were leveled, leaving thousands homeless and food and water\u00a0scarce.\u00a0The official death toll stands at 44. On Monday, President Trump suggested that some of the\u00a0Bahamians seeking refuge in the U.S. are \"very bad people,\" including\u00a0\"gang members\" and \"drug dealers.\" \"Everybody needs totally proper documentation,\" Trump told reporters.\u00a0\"I don't want to allow people that weren't supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very, very bad drug dealers.\" On\u00a0Tuesday's episode of \"The View,\" Goldberg questioned: \"How do you not look at this man and say this is a racial problem?\" More:\u00a0Hundreds of Bahamian refugees kicked off US-bound ferry over visa confusion The EGOT winner noted that although people criticize her for frequently bringing up race, \"this is a race card \u2013 the card can't get any bigger than this,\" she said.

      "subtitle": "Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens dead at age 99",
      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 John Paul Stevens, the second oldest and third longest-serving Supreme Court justice in history and a Republican president's nominee who went on to lead the court's liberal wing, died Tuesday. He was\u00a099. Stevens died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,\u00a0from complications of a stroke he suffered on Monday. His death was confirmed by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said Stevens \"brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom\u00a0and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation.\" In a statement late Tuesday night, the White House said President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump offered \"their\u00a0deepest\u00a0condolences to the family\u00a0and\u00a0friends\" of the retired justice and noted his military service, legal acumen and \"affection\u00a0for his beloved\u00a0Chicago Cubs.\" More:In 35 years of opinions and dissents, John Paul Stevens left his mark on the Supreme Court and American life \"His work over the course of nearly 35 years on the Supreme Court\u00a0will continue to shape the\u00a0legal\u00a0framework\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0Nation for\u00a0years\u00a0to come.\u00a0His\u00a0passion\u00a0for the law\u00a0and for our country\u00a0will\u00a0not soon be forgotten,\" the statement said. For 35 years, Stevens\u2019 trademark bow tie and gentle mien belied a competitive edge that turned up in his opinions and dissents, most often defending the rights of individuals against the government. More:John Paul Stevens will be buried among several other Supreme Court justices in Arlington National Cemetery Stevens\u2019 brand of conservatism \u2013 a term he insisted still applied until his retirement in 2010 \u2013 all but disappeared during his long and distinguished career. He was a proud veteran of World War II and\u00a0a code-breaker who went on to become a corruption-buster in his native Chicago. President Gerald Ford not only nominated him in 1975 but proudly defended him 30 years later in a letter to USA TODAY. \u201cI am prepared to allow history\u2019s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination thirty years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Ford wrote a year before his death. In lengthy interviews with The New Yorker and The New York Times near the end of his career, Stevens insisted that he had not changed his stripes but had simply withstood the court\u2019s transformation from liberal to conservative. During that time, he came to align more with the court\u2019s liberals than its new brand of conservatives, eventually becoming the senior justice on that side with the power to assign opinions and dissents. Those dissents often went to himself and were perhaps his greatest contribution. In his last term, he penned a 90-page dissent to the court\u2019s decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which gave corporations the right to spend freely on elections. \u201cWhile American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics,\u201d he wrote. And a decade earlier, he led the opponents of the high court's ruling in Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount and handed the 2000 election to George W. Bush. \u201cAlthough we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year\u2019s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear,\" he wrote. \"It is the nation\u2019s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\u201d That concern over impartiality led Stevens to oppose Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation in October 2018, following Kavanaugh's intemperate performance at the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct during his youth. On other issues, Stevens appeared to be a true liberal.\u00a0He fiercely opposed Associate Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s opinion in 2008 that said the Second Amendment gave Americans the right to keep guns at home for self-defense, later calling for its repeal. And he stood firmly behind women's right to choose their reproductive future. \"The societal costs of overruling (Roe v. Wade) at this late date would be enormous,\" he wrote in a 1992 case. \"Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.\u201d Stevens enjoyed his share of victories on the closely-divided court, including on a series of cases during Bush\u2019s administration that gave prisoners at Guantanamo Bay the right to challenge their incarceration in U.S. courts, rather than military tribunals. And in his last decade, the court also upheld the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law and banned the use of the death penalty against juveniles and those with intellectual disabilities, with Stevens leading the liberal wing against\u00a0the court\u2019s conservatives. His greatest regret, he would later say, was his vote in 1976 to reinstate the death penalty after a four-year hiatus.\u00a0By the end of his time on the high court, he had decided capital punishment was unconstitutional. \u201cMy views on the death penalty have changed as the years have gone by,\" he told USA TODAY in 2014. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, \"From my first year at the court, Justice Stevens was my model for all a collegial judge should be....\u00a0Quick as his bright mind was, Justice Stevens remained a genuinely gentle and modest man.\" Born in 1920, Stevens enlisted in the Navy just hours before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and later served out his time there as a cryptographer. His fierce patriotism led him to oppose the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that burning the American flag was a protected form of speech \u2013 a decision even Scalia supported. Stevens had plans to become an English teacher until he was convinced he should attend Northwestern University School of Law, where he graduated at the top of his class in two years. Content as a lawyer in Chicago, he was entering his sixth decade when President Richard Nixon named him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 1970. Five years later, Ford named him to succeed Justice William O. Douglas, whose record 36 years on the high court Stevens nearly matched. He was succeeded by Justice Elena Kagan in 2010. Over the years, Stevens survived both prostate cancer and heart bypass surgery and was the picture of good health. He would spend nearly half the time the court was in session at his condominium in Fort Lauderdale, reading briefs on the beach between tennis and golf matches. He swam in the Atlantic Ocean regularly until recent years, when he decided he\u00a0was no longer safe without someone nearby to help him get out. A devoted Chicago Cubs fan, Stevens was at Wrigley Field in 1932 when the New York Yankees\u2019 Babe Ruth called his famous shot to center field. He threw out the first pitch at age 85, and attended Game 4 of the 2016 World Series\u00a0in a red bowtie and Cubs jacket. Since retiring from the court, Stevens maintained an active schedule of public speaking and wrote three\u00a0books: \u201cFive Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir,\u201d \u201cSix Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution,\u201d\u00a0and \"The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years.\" \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not easy to get the Constitution amended, and perhaps that\u2019s one flaw in the Constitution that I don\u2019t mention in the book,\u201d he said during a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY in 2014. While the book called for six new amendments, he mused, \u201cMaybe I should have had seven.\u201d During the interview, Stevens correctly predicted the court would soon address same-sex marriage and government surveillance programs, and he said the court\u2019s 2008 decision on guns wouldn\u2019t be the final word. As for bringing cameras into the court, Stevens was a traditionalist. \u201cIf you leave it up to members of the court, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe downside is that whenever you bring television into a new arena, you\u2019re never sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d And as for retirement, Stevens reveled in the time for golf, tennis and reading \u2013 lots of reading, particularly history. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many interesting things there are to learn about the world,\u201d he said. \"You\u2019ve got a lot to learn, no matter how much you\u2019ve studied.\u201d",

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden defended the late Sen. John McCain Thursday following a report that White House officials wanted a warship named after McCain \"out of sight\" ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to Japan over Memorial Day weekend. \"John McCain was a war hero, should be treated as a war hero,\" Biden told reporters during a stop in Delaware.\u00a0\"Anything less than that is beneath anyone who doesn't treat him that way.\" Tensions between Trump and Biden have been high over the past several weeks, since Biden jumped into the 2020 presidential race, becoming the front-runner in a crowded Democratic field seeking to oust Trump from the Oval Office. The former vice president's comments are a seeming\u00a0dig at\u00a0Trump, who has continued to criticize McCain\u00a0even after his death\u00a0last year. Trump on Thursday morning said that\u00a0\"well-meaning\" aides tried to shield him from the USS John S. McCain \u2014 named for the late GOP senator, as well as his father and grandfather\u00a0\u2014 but that he did not issue the directive. More:Donald Trump on shielding USS McCain from view: 'Somebody did it,' but he denies involvement More:Meghan McCain calls out Trump on warship controversy, says troops 'afraid' to show her father's name \"Somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK?\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"And they were well-meaning, I will say ... I didn't know anything about it; I would never have done that.\" He added that\u00a0aides \"thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of John McCain.\" Officials reportedly wanted the warship to be kept \"out of sight\" during Trump's visit to Japan, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The president gave a speech on Memorial Day on a nearby ship. Biden wasn't the only elder Democratic statesman to take issue with the reported directive. Leon Panetta, former Defense secretary under President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, said he was dumbfounded by the reported effort by the White House to shield Trump from the name McCain. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of grownups in the White House -- from the top down,\u201d Panetta told USA TODAY\u00a0with a laugh. \u201cTo let an issue like this even get any attention is just something I can\u2019t imagine in any other administration. A chief of staff would at least say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019\u201d Earlier Thursday the acting defense secretary said he had asked his chief of staff to look into the reported directive to obscure the ship. Trump and McCain\u00a0clashed on an array of issues, including health care and\u00a0the president's approach to foreign policy. Biden and McCain, by contrast, were longtime friends. But, Thursday\u00a0Biden said while he and McCain were friends, the two didn't always see eye to eye. \"We loved each other but we argued like the devil,\" he said. The relationship between the Arizona Republican and the Delaware Democrat began in the 1970s. When Biden was a freshman senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, McCain was the Navy Senate liaison. The two ended up traveling across the globe together as a result of their positions. The two lawmakers' bond continued throughout their time in the Senate together. Biden continued to stand with McCain following his brain cancer diagnosis, the same type of cancer that claimed Biden's eldest son, Beau. In late 2017, Biden consoled Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, on ABC's \"The View.\" \"I think about Beau a lot,\" McCain, a host on the program, told Biden at the time. \"This doesn't get easier but you cultivate the tools to work with this and live with this. I know you and your\u00a0family have been through tragedy I couldn't conceive of. What would you tell people?\" Biden recalled his friendship with Sen. McCain, who would lose his battle with brain cancer in 2018, and noted that the Arizona maverick was always willing to help Biden in whatever bind he was in. On the program, Biden told Meghan McCain:\u00a0\"There is hope and if anybody can make it,\u00a0 your dad can.\u201d Sen. McCain died on August 25, 2018. Biden was one of the few lawmakers to give a eulogy at the late senator's funeral. \u201cMy name is Joe Biden. I\u2019m a Democrat. And I loved John McCain,\" Biden began his eulogy during services for McCain in Phoenix, Arizona. Biden went on to talk about how McCain put country above all else, and conducted himself with\u00a0integrity, becoming a part of the American narrative. \"I know John said he hoped he played a small part in that story,\" Biden concluded his eulogy.\u00a0\"John, you did much more than that, my friend. To paraphrase Shakespeare, 'we shall not see his like again.'\" Contributing: Tom Vanden Brook Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": "Meghan McCain,\u00a0daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, took issue Monday with recent comments by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., after the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said\u00a0the Arizona senator had recited names of dictators to her during President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cOn behalf of the entire McCain family - @amyklobuchar please be respectful to all of us and leave my fathers legacy and memory out of presidential politics,\u201d tweeted Meghan McCain, who is a host on ABC's \u201cThe View.\u201d Klobuchar offered an anecdote about\u00a0the late Sen. McCain\u00a0during a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. She noted that while sitting between John McCain and Sen. Bernie Sanders, McCain\u00a0began naming dictators at Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cJohn McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation, he understood it,\u201d she said of the Arizona Republican known for his independent streak \u201cHe knew because he knew this man more than any of us did,\u201d she added. o\u00a0Amy For America Communications Director Tim Hogan: Tim Hogan, communications director for Klobuchar\u2019s campaign, in a statement, said the Minnesota Senator \u201chad a long-time friendship with Senator McCain\u201d and\u00a0has \u201cdeep respect for his family.\u201d \u201cWhile she was simply sharing a memory, she continues to believe that the best stories about Senator McCain are not about the views he had about President Trump: they are about McCain\u2019s own valor and heroism,\u201d Hogan said in the statement. Sen. McCain and Trump had a strained relationship prior to the senator's death in August 2018 after battling brain cancer. A month before he passed away, McCain issued a statement damning Trump\u2019s meeting with Russia President Vladimir Putin in July 2018. An interactive guide:Who is running for president in 2020? Trump's Japan trip:President blasts Biden, Democrats, Mueller while bringing politics to world stage During a press conference with Putin during a summit in Helsinki, Trump essentially said he believed Putin's when the Russian leader claimed the Kremlin had not interfered in the 2016 presidential election\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0view on the part of the American president\u00a0that put him at odds with the U.S. intelligence community, which had concluded Russia engaged in election interference. McCain called the press conference \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d \u201cThe damage inflicted by President Trump's naivet\u00e9, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,\u201d McCain said in the statement. \u201cBut it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.\u201d Trump has continued to blast McCain since the late senator\u2019s death. Trump has repeatedly criticized McCain for voting against GOP legislation that would have repealed\u00a0Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of Trump's predecessor and McCain's 2008 rival for the Oval Office.

A two-decade-long feud between the two centers on McCain's war record and lingering bitterness over McCain's vote to preserve the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. As recently as in April 2019, Trump railed against McCain during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, saying that McCain \"did the nation a tremendous disservice\" by not voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Steve Levy went online to renew his Global Entry membership\u00a0the second he found out his favorite airport fast pass had expired. That was in early May.\u00a0Four months later, the Seattle nonprofit director is\u00a0still waiting. The\u00a0$100\u00a0fee\u00a0for the five-year membership showed up on his American Express bill several statements ago, but his Global Entry account still says \"pending review.'' \"I'm stuck in the 'waiting for confirmation'\u00a0black hole,'' Levy said. And stuck in the regular\u00a0airport\u00a0security lanes on every flight he's taken since May. Global Entry, a trusted traveler program from U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0that provides travelers with a speedier trip through customs when returning from international flights, also includes TSA PreCheck, a sister trusted traveler program.\u00a0PreCheck allows passengers to go through a dedicated, usually quicker, security lane where they can keep shoes and coats on and leave laptops and approved liquids in their carry-on bags. \"Now I have to use three bins,'' Levy said. \"It's such a hassle. It's just ridiculous.'' Levy's situation is not unique. Between 30% and 35% of Global Entry applications and renewals\u00a0are taking 90 days or more to complete, a CBP spokesman told USA TODAY.\u00a0The rest, he said,\u00a0are completed within 15 days. (Full disclosure: My renewal took less than two weeks in late\u00a0May.) In a hard-to-find\u00a0statement on its\u00a0website, the agency warns applicants to expect \"significant delays'' in processing times \u2013 up to 100 days\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and limited appointment times at enrollment centers.\u00a0Travelers applying for Global Entry for\u00a0the first time\u00a0are required to do an in-person interview\u00a0as are some\u00a0travelers renewing their memberships. The cited reasons on the website for the backlog: the 35-day government shutdown that ended in late January and the \"ongoing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.'' To offset the loss of some airport\u00a0employees to the southwest border, the spokesman said, the agency has moved some workers from its Global Entry enrollment centers to frontline airport operations. CBP officers screen visitors and residents\u00a0flying into the\u00a0United States from abroad. Another factor extending processing\u00a0times: a spike in renewals due to a high volume of expirations. Global Entry memberships began to spike in late 2013 when PreCheck expanded to the general public and travelers weighed which security fast pass to buy. Global Entry, which also includes expedited customs processing upon arrival from international flights,\u00a0is $100 for five years; PreCheck is\u00a0$85. Given the delays, CBP has extended the amount of time Global Entry members will retain their benefits, including PreCheck, past the expiration date as they await renewal. It is now a year instead of six months. The only caveat: You have to renew your membership before it expires. An explainer:\u00a0What's the difference between Global Entry, TSA Precheck and Clear? Love TSA PreCheck and Global Entry? Check your expiration date Levy jokes that he should get a prize since his wait time is now over the \"up to 100 days'' estimate on the agency's website. But he's not laughing at the situation.\u00a0Levy was so frustrated he appealed to his congresswoman, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.) in early August.\u00a0Her office looked into it and was simply reminded about the extended processing times posted on the agency's website. The office was also asked by CBP officials to\u00a0\"discontinue inquiries based on extended (Global Entry) processing times,'' according to an email sent to Levy. Levy wants to know why he simply can't keep his coveted TSA PreCheck benefits while his\u00a0renewal application \"flounders in bureaucracy.'' (He would have had he started his renewal before it expired.) Political connections might not help. Cindy McCain, wife of late Sen. John McCain of Arizona\u00a0was caught up in the delays earlier this year. In a post on Twitter, she said she put in her renewal online in late March and was still waiting two months later. \"Why is this taking so long?'' she said. Scott McGrew, an NBC anchor in San Francisco, submitted his Global Entry renewal application and $100 fee\u00a0in April and hadn't heard anything by late July. He asked CBP about the delay on Twitter and got no response. McGrew was worried about losing his precious PreCheck benefits when his membership expires in September,\u00a0so he forked over another $85 to apply for PreCheck in August. \"It's God's gift to flying,'' he said. \"PreCheck and early boarding are the two things that keep me in the air.'' McGrew said he was approved for PreCheck in a week. TSA processing time\u00a0is running five to seven days, spokeswoman Jenny Burke said. A few days later, of course,\u00a0his Global Entry renewal finally went through. But McGrew\u00a0was only conditionally approved, meaning he has to set up an interview. The next available date\u00a0in his area: Dec. 15. Travelers who have been conditionally approved and\u00a0don't want to wait that long for an interview have an option if they have an upcoming international flight: the CBP's Enrollment on Arrival program. Interviews are available without an appointment at 52\u00a0airports in the program. Don't wait until your membership expires to renew: Travelers like Levy who didn't start the renewal process until their memberships expired are out of luck. Their only option is to pay for a TSA PreCheck membership if that's the main benefit they're missing while their Global Entry renewal is held up. (Levy ended up applying for PreCheck separately\u00a0given his lengthy wait.) Start the renewal process now if your membership is coming due within a year: Travelers with a renewal application on file can continue to use their benefits until the renewal is finalized\u00a0or up to one year past the expiration date, whichever comes first. The previous grace period was six months, but the agency changed it in April given the backlog. (McGrew wasn't aware of the\u00a0grace period.) No. The application fees for Global Entry and TSA PreCheck, which cover background checks and other processing costs, are nonrefundable. It depends on the benefits you're after. The answer is yes if you don't do much international travel and mainly want a speedier trip through airport security. The answer is no if you're looking for quicker entry into the United States after an international flight in addition to the PreCheck benefits.",

And then there\u2019s President Donald Trump, who has continuously stoked divisions within the group. Last year, he refused to sign a joint communique and left the summit early. To avoid another display of division, the group will not even attempt to sign a communique this year \u2014 the first time in its 44-year history. There's also the question of whether Russia should be invited back into the G-7, as per Trump's request earlier this week. The group's members kicked Russia out of the elite club in 2014 after it invaded and\u00a0annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.\u00a0New\u00a0British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will also be making his debut, injecting the possibility of more drama and unpredictability into the sessions.

Fires continue to rage in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest, at an alarming rate. So far this year, there have been roughly 74,000 fires \u2014 up 84 percent from the same period last year.Why is this happening? People are illegally clearing land in the Amazon for business prospects, such as growing agriculture or raising cattle. What's feeding the fire? The trees, plants and animals in the Amazon are not adaptive to fire and are easily killed, which makes putting out a wildfire in the Amazon \"basically impossible.\" So, what can be done about this? For starters, stop sharing outdated photos.\u00a0While well-intentioned celebrities have been drawing attention to the wildfires, the photos they are posting range anywhere from one to 30 years old. Some don't even show the Amazon rainforest at all.\u00a0Here are the real\u00a0photos\u00a0you need to see. It's back!

The Gators and Hurricanes have only met six times since 1987, but there will be much at stake for both programs\u00a0when they meet\u00a0on neutral ground in Orlando (ESPN, 7 p.m. ET). The other significant game Saturday sees Hawaii hosting Arizona (CBSSN, 10:30 p.m. ET). The two games serve as an appetizer for the first full weekend of action during the Labor Day holiday. Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of John McCain's death, the political maverick known for forging a record of bipartisanship throughout his career. The six-term U.S. senator disclosed in July 2017 that he had been diagnosed with a deadly form of brain cancer called glioblastoma. He died four days before his 82nd birthday. Earlier this week, his wife Cindy McCain criticized the current state of politics, emphasizing that she doesn't see anyone carrying on the bipartisan\u00a0way that her husband had for years in Washington. And in\u00a0an op-ed published\u00a0Wednesday by the Washington Post, Cindy\u00a0McCain called for civility in government: \"John was a passionate partisan. But he was a statesman, too, and statesmen accept the necessity of cooperation and compromise to make some progress on the challenges our country faces.\" Contributing: Associated Press",

John McCain, and said reports that the administration hid a Navy ship bearing McCain's name sent a \"horrific\" message. \"It\u2019s impossible to go through the grief process when my father, who\u2019s been dead for 10 months, is constantly in the news cycle because the president is so obsessed with the fact that he\u2019s never going to be a great man like he was,\u201d McCain said on\u00a0ABC's The View. Trump said Thursday that \"well meaning\" aides tried to shield him from view of\u00a0a Navy battleship named for McCain\u00a0during a recent visit to Japan, but said he had nothing to do with the effort. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported officials wanted the\u00a0USS John S. McCain, a warship named for the late Arizona Republican, to be kept \"out of sight\" during Trump's visit.

I don\u2019t blame the people in the military. I have nothing but respect for the people who serve.\u201d The animosity between Trump and McCain dates back decades, but it exploded into public view when the senator joined other Republicans in voting against a last-ditch effort in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. The president frequently slammed McCain for the vote in rallies across the country, a criticism that continued even after McCain died of brain cancer last year. Trump drew fire from veterans groups and others for raising the U.S. flag at the White House last summer two days after it had been lowered in honor of McCain. Trump created a firestorm in March when he said he never received a \"thank you\"\u00a0from the McCain family for giving \u201chim the kind of funeral that he wanted.\u201d Trump did not approve McCain\u2019s funeral and did not attend the service at the family's request.

In exchange, the diplomats believed,\u00a0Trump would reward Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky with a highly sought-after meeting with Trump at the White House\u00a0and the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid that Trump had put on hold. Text messages between Kurt Volker,\u00a0then-Trump's\u00a0special envoy for Ukraine, and other U.S. diplomats\u00a0\u2013 released late Thursday by House Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry\u00a0\u2013 paint\u00a0a picture of American foreign policy decisions being driven by Trump's domestic political concerns and an ad-hoc agenda crafted by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's private attorney. \"Heard from the White House,\" Volker wrote in a text to a top Zelensky adviser on July 25, just before Trump and Zelensky were scheduled to speak by phone in a call that helped spark\u00a0the impeachment inquiry. \"Assuming President Z (Zelensky) convinces trump he will investigate/\"get to the bottom of what happened\"\u00a0in 2016, we will nail down a date for visit to Washington. Good luck!,\" Volker told his Ukrainian counterpart. House Democrats released the text messages\u00a0after\u00a0Volker,\u00a0who resigned from the Ukraine envoy post last week, spent more than nine hours Thursday testifying behind closed-doors as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. \"These text messages reflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting between President Trump and the Ukrainian President,\" the chairmen of the three House committees leading the impeachment probe said in a statement released Thursday night. The three chairmen\u00a0are: Intelligence Committee Chair\u00a0Adam B. Schiff, Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Elijah E. Cummings, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot L. Engel. The Democrats said the messages show that State Department employees were deeply concerned that U.S. military assistance and a Trump-Zelensky meeting \"were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the President\u2019s demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations.\" Republicans characterized the proceedings as a sham that did little to provide Democrats any ammunition to impeach Trump. Speaking to reporters outside the hearing\u00a0room as Volker was still testifying, Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, slammed Schiff, D-Calif., for not allowing State Department lawyers to participate in the session. He also said the testimony he heard from Volker did not support Democrats'\u00a0impeachment narrative. \"Ambassador Volker has been very impressive and has said nothing that coincides with what the Democrats are seeing with their whole impeachment narrative,\"\u00a0said Jordan,\u00a0the\u00a0top Republican on the\u00a0House Committee on Oversight and Reform. But the text messages demonstrate a high level of apprehension\u00a0among State Department officials that Trump had linked\u00a0U.S. assistance to Ukraine with his demands that Zelensky investigate the 2016 election and\u00a0Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that employed Biden's son, Hunter. Bursima's owner had come under scrutiny by Ukraine's top prosecutor, but there were no charges brought and Ukrainian officials have said there's no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or his father. \"Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help with investigation,\" Volker wrote in a July 17\u00a0message to two other U.S. diplomats with purview over Ukraine policy:\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat stationed in Ukraine. After Trump and Zelensky spoke on July 25, Zelensky's top aide, Andriy Yermak texted Volker to say the call \"went well.\" He added: \"Please remind\u00a0Mr. Mayor to share the Madrid dates.\" That was\u00a0a reference to Giuliani's plans to meet with Zelensky's advisers, in Madrid in August, to follow up on the Trump-Zelensky phone call. For months, Giuliani\u00a0had\u00a0been pressing\u00a0the Ukrainians for damaging information on the Bidens. The Ukrainians seemed to understand the linkage Giuliani and others were making. Zelensky, a political neophyte elected in April, was eager to a public demonstration of U.S. support, particularly as his country faced sustained Russian aggression. Zelensky's aide, Yermak, seemed to agree in August that the new president would publicly announce an investigation into Bursima, once the White House had set a date for a Zelensky-Trump meeting in\u00a0Washington. \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d Yermak texted Volker on Aug. 10. But the Trump administration continued to delay a meeting announcement. And Taylor, the lead diplomat in Kiev, seemed alarmed by the apparent connection between Trump's freeze on U.S. aid to Ukraine and the president's demands for probes into Biden and the 2016 presidential election. \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH\u00a0meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked in a Sept. 1 text message to Volker and\u00a0Sondland.\u00a0\"Call me,\"\u00a0Sondland texted back. Taylor later raised a \"nightmare\" scenario, in which Zelensky would promise\u00a0to order\u00a0the investigations\u00a0that Trump wanted, but the U.S. would still not release the military assistance, which Ukraine needed\u00a0to counter Russian aggression. \"The Russians love it,\" Taylor texted on Sept. 8. The next day, he texted again that the U.S. had already \"shaken (Ukraine's) faith in us\" and warned Sondland: \"Counting on you to be right about this.\" Sondland suggested he wasn't sure what would happen. \"Let's hope it works,\" he texted to Taylor on Sept. 9. Taylor responded: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland pushed back, saying Trump had been \"crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\" He told Taylor to call \"S,\" presumably referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, if he wanted to discuss the matter further. Zelensky never made a public commitment to launch any U.S.-related investigations. Trump eventually released the military aid after a bipartisan backlash\u00a0from Congress. Trump ordered the hold on the aid to Ukraine in mid-July, shortly before he spoke with Zelensky. He has given contradictory explanations for that decision, initially saying he wanted to be sure Ukraine would crack down on corruption and later suggesting he wanted European allies to contribute more to Ukraine's defense. Democrats emerged from Thursday's session convinced the aid was used as part of an attempted\u00a0quid-pro-quo. \"It was further evidence of the underlying fact that has now spurred this formal impeachment inquiry,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., told USA TODAY Thursday evening. The president \"used military aid and other leverage to attempt to extort (the Ukrainian leader) for a narrow partisan domestic political reason: getting dirt\u00a0on his prospective political opponent.\" A second Democrat,\u00a0Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, said\u00a0Volker's testimony demonstrated that Trump held out the prospect of a White House meeting with Zelensky on the condition that Ukraine\u00a0investigate Biden \u2013 as well as Ukraine\u2019s alleged involvement in interference\u00a0with the 2016 U.S. election. The American intelligence community has\u00a0concluded that Russia tried to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor, a fact that has clouded Trump\u2019s presidency. \"For Zelensky to get a meeting with Trump, Zelensky had to, one, investigate the 2016 election, essentially go back and exonerate the Russians\u2019 role,\" Swalwell told reporters after Volker's deposition ended. \"And two, that Zelensky would have to investigate Biden. That was an understood predicate for the meeting.\" Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican, suggested that Democrats had cherry-picked from Volker's texts to provide a misleading account of his testimony. \"Instead of House Dems releasing Ambassador Volker's texts drip by drip, just release all of his texts in Congress' possession right now as well as today's transcribed interview,\" Zeldin tweeted\u00a0Thursday night. \"Just give the media & public EVERYTHING so Americans can form their own independent conclusions.\" More:Here are 5 questions about the Trump-Ukraine controversy we still don't have answers to Volker, a\u00a0former foreign service officer and longtime\u00a0Europe\u00a0expert, is\u00a0the first\u00a0official interviewed\u00a0by House Democrats\u00a0as they investigate potentially impeachable\u00a0allegations that Trump used the power of his office to\u00a0seek foreign interference\u00a0in the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0Thursday's\u00a0deposition, led by staff lawyers with the House\u00a0Intelligence Committee,\u00a0was attended by a handful of lawmakers from both sides.

And he was named in the explosive\u00a0whistleblower complaint\u00a0that sparked the impeachment proceedings. Volker\u00a0resigned less than 24 hours after Giuliani posted a private text message from the special envoy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in which Volker offered to set up a meeting with a top adviser to Zelensky. Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, the former vice president who is seeking to unseat Trump in 2020. According to the whistleblower complaint, Volker and Sondland\u00a0had met with Giuliani to try to \"contain the damage\" his efforts were having on U.S. national security. The whistleblower said Volker and Sondland also met with Ukrainian officials to help them navigate the \"differing messages\" they were getting through official U.S. government channels and Giuliani's private outreach. Volker agreed to Thursday's deposition, even as Secretary of State\u00a0Mike Pompeo has delayed\u00a0other State Department officials from testifying. The complaint:Read the full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint Volker\u00a0was named as Trump's special envoy in July 2017, by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He came to the post with a stellar resume: a former U.S. ambassador to NATO in the George W. Bush administration and former adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a longtime Russia critic. He took the envoy job on a volunteer basis, while continuing to\u00a0serve\u00a0as executive director of the McCain Institute\u00a0for International Leadership at Arizona State University.

      "content": "Days after an activist group projected a large image of a USS John S. McCain baseball hat onto the side of a London building -- according to the Wall Street Journal and other news sources \u2013- the hat is sold out on Amazon and other online stores. An Amazon search for USS John S. McCain hat shows the red hat is sold out and they do not know when there will be more in stock. The hat was also sold out in black\u00a0\u00a0and navy blue. A \u201chip-hop\u201d style hat featuring the USS John S. McCain in blue and black was available on Amazon for $12.22 with $5 shipping and was set to arrive within 4-5 days. The Amazon red McCain hat shows one review giving the item five stars. The reviewer, calling themselves Kim Jong Un, said he ordered the hat Monday and claims a group of \u201cmilitary men\u201d threw a tarp over his head when he went to the airport. Online shops that personalize items do offer similar hats for between $10-30, but can take up to six weeks for the order to arrive. The hat projection covered the side of the famous Madame Tussaud\u2019s Wax Museum was a supposed reaction to a perceived feud between President Donald Trump and the late Sen. John\u00a0McCain, R-Ariz. An activist group called Led By Donkeys claimed credit for the act Monday in tweets saying: Hey\u00a0@realDonaldTrump, we read the story about the sailors on a US warship being ordered to hide from you because you\u2019re triggered by the name on their hats. So we turned Madame Tussaud's into a giant USS John McCain baseball cap. Welcome to London! The Wall Street Journal had reported last week that the White House had requested that the U.S. Navy make sure the USS John S. McCain ship was \u201cout of sight\u201d while Trump visited American troops stationed in Japan. Trump claimed he did not know anything about the decision to keep the ship out of sight, but said the move was \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d The president's disdain for the late senator, who died of brain cancer in August 2018, perhaps became more evident during the 2016 presidential campaign when Trump criticized McCain's time spent as a Vietnam prisoner of war. \"He's a war hero because he was captured,\" Trump as a candidate said in Iowa in 2015. \"I like people that weren't captured, OK?\" The president did not attend McCain's funeral, held at the National Cathdral in Washington, D.C. Media has reported there are up to 250,000 people expected to show up for protests during Trump\u2019s visit to London this week. Along with the McCain hat, Led By Donkeys group also projected the United Kingdom\u2019s approval ratings for both Trump and former President Barack Obama on the Tower of London. Banners reading \u201cResist Trump\u201d were hung in other areas of the city. Trump claimed there were \u201ctremendous crowds of well-wishers\u201d that turned out for his arrival for a three-day visit to the country. He blamed the \u201cfake news\u201d media for attempting to search for and conflate any protests against him. He claimed he had not seen any protests yet.",

      "content": "Sponsored by SearchNow WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump said Thursday that \"well meaning\" aides tried to shield him from view of a warship named for political foe John McCain during a recent visit to Japan, but that he had nothing to do with the effort. \"Somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK?\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"And they were well-meaning, I will say ... I didn't know anything about it; I would never have done that.\" Trump said aides\u00a0\"thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of John McCain.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that officials wanted the\u00a0USS John S. McCain, a warship named for the late Arizona Republican who was often at odds with the president, to be kept \"out of sight\" during Trump's visit to Japan. That trip included a Trump speech at a nearby ship. The president spoke while leaving the White House en route to Colorado to deliver the commencement address at the Air Force Academy. Trump and McCain, who died last year, frequently clashed on issues ranging from health care to Trump's abrasive political style. During his presidential campaign, Trump mocked McCain for having been \"captured\" during the Vietnam War. During a political forum in 2015, Trump said the\u00a0man who spent\u00a0more than five years as a\u00a0prisoner of war was \"not a war hero,\" and was called that only \"because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Even after McCain's death from cancer in August, Trump has continued to speak of his dislike for his frequent critic. In his remarks Thursday,\u00a0Trump said he was not a \u201cbig fan\u201d of McCain \u201cin any way, shape, or form,\u201d but added, \u201cI would never do a thing like\" avoid sight of the ship bearing his name. In a tweet responding to the Journal story, the late senator's daughter Meghan McCain described Trump as \"a child who will\u00a0always be deeply threatened\" by her father's greatness. \"There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP,\" Meghan McCain tweeted. \"So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.\" Speaking on ABC's \"The View,\" Meghan McCain said Thursday that she was concerned about the message the episode sends to the sailors aboard\u00a0the McCain and other members of the military. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to go through the grief process when my father, who\u2019s been dead for 10 months, is constantly in the news cycle because the president is so obsessed with the fact that he\u2019s never going to be a great man like he was,\u201d she said. Launched in 1994, the USS John McCain was initially named for the senator's father and grandfather, both highly decorated admirals in the Navy. In July, a month before the younger McCain's death,\u00a0the Pentagon added him as a namesake of the ship. Referring to the war ship,\u00a0Trump\u00a0at one point Thursday said, \"I couldn't care less whether or not there's a boat named after his father.\" Acting Defense Secretary Patrick\u00a0Shanahan told reporters that he has asked his chief of staff to look into efforts to shield the ship from the president's view. Shanahan said he would not have\u00a0supported such a request. \"I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain,\" he told reporters while on a trip to Singapore. \"I would never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship.\u201c The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment late Wednesday when the story first broke in the Wall Street Journal. But the president posted a tweet minutes later saying he was \u201cnot informed\u201d about orders regarding the McCain. Trump said he did not know who authorized efforts to hide the ship from his view, but told reporters \"they thought they were doing me a favor because they know I am not a fan of John McCain.\" Trump addressed about 800 men and women aboard the USS Wasp while traveling in Japan over the weekend Memorial Day weekend. The president applauded the sailors in remarks that aired late Monday in the United States. The Wasp is an amphibious assault ship is part of the U.S. 7th Fleet. The USS John McCain is an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.

      "content": "Editor's note: This story was updated Friday to include the withdrawal of DNI pick John Ratcliffe WASHINGTON \u2013 On his first day in office, President Donald Trump formally nominated Andrew Puzder as his labor secretary, handing a key position in his administration to a fast-food magnate who\u00a0he\u2019d boasted would save businesses from \u201cthe crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations.\u201d But Puzder couldn\u2019t even save himself. Puzder, who ridiculed his own restaurant employees as \u201cthe best of the worst\u201d and said he\u2019d like to replace them with robots, withdrew his nomination less than a month later amid devastating revelations he had once employed an undocumented housekeeper and failed to promptly pay taxes on her. Puzder was one of the first, but not the last, of Trump\u2019s nominees to fall. The pattern has been repeated again and again\u00a0as more than five dozen of Trump\u2019s picks for various jobs either withdrew\u00a0or saw\u00a0their nominations pulled before they were put through the confirmation process in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re way over two years into this administration, and there are very large blocks of the government where you simply don\u2019t have confirmed leadership,\u201d said Max Stier, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that has been tracking the nominations process. Sixty-three\u00a0of Trump\u2019s nominees have taken themselves out of consideration or saw their nominations pulled\u00a0\u2013 nearly twice the casualty rate under President Barack Obama, who had withdrawn\u00a032 nominations at the same point in his presidency, according to data collected by Stier\u2019s group. In Trump\u2019s case, the number is actually higher. The Partnership for Public Service data includes only job candidates who were formally nominated. It doesn\u2019t count nominees for federal judgeships or candidates whom Trump said he intended to nominate but who took themselves out of the running before their official paperwork was sent to the Senate. The latest Trump pick to withdraw is Rep. John Ratcliffe, who said Friday he is withdrawing his bid to become\u00a0Director of National Intelligence, days after the president put forth his name. The announcement comes after Democrats and some Republicans\u00a0have raised questions about whether the Republican congressman from Texas\u00a0exaggerated\u00a0his work as federal prosecutor of terrorism cases. Other\u00a0chosen-but-not-formally-nominated dropouts\u00a0include Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, whom Trump announced last spring that he would appoint to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. Both quit before Trump ever made their nominations official: Cain withdrew in April after his selection for a position overseeing the central bank touched off a considerable backlash among Democrats and some Republicans in Congress. Moore dropped out less than two weeks later after an uproar over his controversial writings about women and other issues. Critics, including some Republicans in Congress, have suggested Trump\u2019s high withdrawal rate is caused by the administration\u2019s failure to properly vet the backgrounds of potential nominees. Some blame the president himself. Trump has complained that the vetting process is \u201ctoo ugly and too disgusting\u201d and, at times, has chosen to follow his gut instincts instead of the counsel of his advisers \u2013 with occasionally disastrous results. \"The president who promised to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 has chosen so many conflict-of-interest-ridden lackeys to run our nation\u2019s government, precipitating a parade of ethics scandals, resignations and withdrawals,\" said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer said the Trump administration seems to have a two-part test for vetting nominees: \"Views that are far out of the mainstream and a willingness to enable the president\u2019s constantly changing positions no matter what.\" \"This approach is failing the American people,\" he said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Here\u2019s a closer look at 14\u00a0of Trump's high-profile nominees or picks who never made it through the confirmation process: Position: secretary of labor Formally nominated: Jan. 20, 2017 Withdrew: Feb. 15, 2017 Puzder, who was chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of the Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr. fast-food chains, faced a torrent of criticism over workplace conditions at his restaurants, his opposition to raising the minimum wage and expanding overtime eligibility for workers, and his derogatory comments about some of his employees. The final blow to his nomination was his admission that he had employed an undocumented housekeeper and failed to promptly pay taxes on her. Puzder withdrew before he even received a confirmation hearing in the Senate. Position: Army secretary Formally nominated: Jan. 20, 2017 Withdrew: Feb. 3, 2017 Viola, the billionaire owner of the Florida Panthers and a West Point graduate, received plaudits from Trump for \u201cdistinguished military service\u201d and a \u201chighly impressive\u201d track record in business. Viola quickly pulled his nomination after citing difficulties in divesting himself from his businesses. Position: Army secretary Nomination announced: April 7, 2017 Withdrew: May 5, 2017 Green, a physician and Iraq War veteran, was Trump\u2019s second pick for Army secretary after Viola withdrew his nomination for the post. Green quickly came under fire from advocacy organizations for gays and lesbians that\u00a0denounced him as \u201ca social issues warrior\u201d and from other minority groups over comments that some considered derogatory toward the Islamic faith and its followers. Green called the attacks \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d but nevertheless took himself out of consideration before he was formally nominated for the job. A Republican aligned with the tea party, he was elected to Congress\u00a0last November as a representative from Tennessee. More:Sen. John McCain: Army secretary nominee's past comments 'very concerning' Position: director, Office of National Drug Control Policy Formally nominated: Sept. 5, 2017 Withdrew: Oct. 17, 2017 Marino, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, withdrew from consideration for the drug czar\u2019s job less than two days after reports he backed legislation that restricted the enforcement of opioid laws. The Washington Post and \"60 Minutes\" reported that Marino was the key lawmaker behind legislation that made it virtually impossible for the Drug Enforcement Administration to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments from drug companies. More:Trump's drug czar nominee withdraws after his role backing opioid industry exposed Position: U.S. district court judge, District of Columbia Formally nominated: Sept. 11, 2017 Withdrew: Dec. 18, 2017 Petersen, a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, served on the Federal Election Commission with White House counsel Don McGahn but had no trial experience when Trump chose him for a lifetime federal judgeship in the District of Columbia. At his confirmation hearing, Petersen was unable to answer basic questions about legal procedure while being grilled by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. Days after a video of the exchange went viral on social media, Petersen withdrew, saying his nomination had become a distraction for the administration.

Trump first picked her for the job in May 2017, but the nomination stalled in Congress as she came under scrutiny by investigators looking into contacts between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian operatives. Trump announced the following January that he would resubmit McFarland\u2019s nomination, but she withdrew from consideration less than a month later. More:K.T. McFarland to leave White House amid NSC shakeup Position: director, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Formally nominated: Jan. 8, 2018 Withdrew: Sept. 6, 2018 Gardner, a Kentucky mining consultant who questioned whether humans play a role in climate change, won praise from coal groups but criticism from environmentalists when he was chosen to lead the Interior Department\u2019s mining agency. Gardner pulled his nomination before he ever got a confirmation hearing. He blamed his departure on his inability to reach a consensus on the terms of an ethics agreement despite a year of negotiations with the Office of Government Ethics. Position: Veterans Affairs secretary Formally nominated: April 16, 2018 Withdrew: April 26, 2018 Jackson, a Navy rear admiral, served as physician to the president and received glowing reviews from Obama and\u00a0Trump before Trump picked him to become secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump disclosed in February that Jackson was his choice for the job and formally nominated him a few weeks later. By then, Jackson had come under withering criticism for a lack of management experience and for accusations by colleagues that he improperly dished out opioids, drank on the job and fostered a hostile work environment at the White House medical office. He withdrew his nomination after a few weeks. Position: director, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Formally nominated: Aug. 16, 2018 Withdrew: April 4, 2019 Vitiello served\u00a0as acting director of the agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws within the nation when Trump nominated him to become the permanent director. Trump withdrew the nomination in April as the agency dealt\u00a0with a surge in illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexican border. Trump said he wanted ICE to go \u201cin a tougher direction.\u201d Vitiello resigned from the agency six days later. Position: U.N. ambassador Nomination announced: Dec. 7, 2018 Withdrew: Feb. 16, 2019 Nauert, a former Fox News host who served as the State Department's spokesperson, withdrew her name from consideration amid concerns about her qualifications for the high-profile ambassadorship. Though Trump announced that she was his choice for the job, she was never formally nominated. Position: Federal Reserve Board of Governors Nomination announced: March 22, 2019 Withdrew: May 2, 2019 Moore, an economics writer and critic of the Fed, was chosen for a seat on the seven-member board as part of Trump\u2019s plan to change the central bank\u2019s direction. Critics questioned his qualifications for the position,\u00a0and his controversial writings on women and other topics touched off an uproar. (Moore wrote that he wasn\u2019t a big believer in democracy and called the use of female referees at sporting events \u201can obscenity.\u201d) Citing \u201cunrelenting attacks on my character,\u201d Moore pulled his name from consideration before he was formally nominated. More:Why Donald Trump's Fed picks Stephen Moore and Herman Cain have caused such a ruckus Position: Federal Reserve Board of Governors Nomination announced: April 4, 2019 Withdrew: April 22, 2019 Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, pushed the \u201c9-9-9\u201d tax plan to replace the tax code with an overall 9% tax\u00a0during his 2012 bid for the GOP presidential nomination. Like Moore, Trump chose him for a seat on the seven-member Federal Reserve board as part of his plan to change the central bank\u2019s direction. Cain\u2019s possible nomination was met with a backlash among Democrats and some Republicans in Congress who cited sexual misconduct allegations against him that surfaced during his failed presidential campaign. As his chances of confirmation were virtually doomed, Cain pulled his name from consideration before he was formally nominated. Position: secretary of defense Nomination announced: May 9, 2019 Withdrew: June 18, 2019 Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, helped lead the company's commercial aircraft program before joining the Defense Department as deputy defense secretary in 2017. He\u00a0took over as acting defense secretary\u00a0Jan. 1, 2019,\u00a0after Jim Mattis resigned over differences with Trump. His ascendance to the chief position at the Defense Department ended when Trump announced June 18 that Shanahan decided to withdraw from the confirmation process. The president said he would replace Shanahan with Mark Esper, the secretary of the Army. Trump's announcement came about an hour after USA TODAY published a story that detailed an FBI examination of a violent domestic dispute\u00a0in 2010 between Shanahan and his then-wife. Position: Director of National Intelligence: Nomination announced: July 29, 2019 Withdrew: Aug. 2, 2019 Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman from Texas, was picked by Trump for the position after Dan Coats, a former Indiana senator who has held the job since early 2017, announced plans to step down. But Ratcliffe took his name out of consideration after Democrats and some Republicans\u00a0raised questions about whether he\u00a0 exaggerated his work as federal prosecutor of terrorism cases.\u00a0Others questioned Ratcliffe's experience and whether he could give the president unvarnished advice on Russia given his strong partisan views.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The U.S,\u00a0Navy acknowledged Saturday it had received a request to shield a U.S. warship bearing the name of former political rival John McCain from President Donald Trump's view during the commander-in-chief's visit to Japan last week\u00a0\u2013 but did not comply. \u201cA request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President\u2019s visit,\" according to a statement from Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Navy Information, that the Pentagon released. The one-paragraph\u00a0statement did not mention who made the request and a Pentagon spokesperson did not respond to a request for further information. In his statement, Brown also said there were \"no intentional efforts\" to exclude sailors on the McCain from attending the president's address on Memorial day aboard the\u00a0USS Wasp at Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo. The McCain is docked there for repairs. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that White House officials wanted the guided-missile destroyer\u00a0to be kept \"out of sight\" during Trump's visit to Japan, apparently fearful that the president would be upset at having to see the name of the late Arizona senator, a frequent target of the president's anger. The ship was named after McCain's father and grandfather, both decorated admirals. The Navy added the name of Sen. McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam who emerged from captivity a war hero, to the ship in 2018, according to the Journal. Trump on Thursday said he had no knowledge of the request to keep the ship from view, saying,\u00a0\"I would never do a thing like that.\" He\u00a0described\u00a0the aides that made the request as \"well meaning.\" McCain's daughter weighs in:Meghan McCain calls out Trump on warship controversy, says troops 'afraid' to show her father's name 'Tremendous disservice':President Donald Trump on the late Sen. John McCain: 'He did the nation a tremendous disservice' Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced Thursday that he asked his chief of staff to investigate what was behind\u00a0obscuring the name\u00a0of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan. \"The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense,\" Brown said in the statement released by the Pentagon.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON -- In a party that overwhelmingly supports President Donald Trump, a few naysayers are popping up, raising the prospect that Trump could face more opposition from within his own party as he seeks re-election to a second term in 2020. However, unseating Trump will be no easy feat. The president has the power of incumbency, with nearly 8 in 10 Republicans approving\u00a0of Trump\u2019s overall job performance in a recent poll, and Trump has brought in $57 million\u00a0in the second\u00a0quarter of this year alone, excluding money donated to the Republican National Committee. But, there are a few Republicans who don't seem to be passengers\u00a0on the Trump train. Trump is already facing one official challenger in the GOP primary. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld\u00a0announced his White House bid in April. Weld ran as Gary Johnson\u2019s running mate on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016. Joe Walsh, a one-term tea party-backed GOP\u00a0congressman from Illinois turned conservative radio host, said\u00a0Thursday during an interview\u00a0on CNN that he is considering a 2020 primary challenge to Trump. \u201cI\u2019m strongly, strongly considering it. That\u2019s \u2014 again, I\u2019m not trying to be cute or coy,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before \u2014 if somebody\u2019s going to get in there and go after him \u2026 it\u2019s got to be done soon.\u201d In a New York Times\u00a0op-ed\u00a0last week, Walsh wrote, \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 because I liked him. I voted for him because he wasn\u2019t Hillary Clinton.\u201d William Kristol, a\u00a0prominent conservative\u00a0and \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, is encouraging Walsh to run. Kristol is the former editor of the now-defunct conservative magazine\u00a0The Weekly Standard. Walsh has been publicly critical of Trump, including the president's\u00a0fiscal decision-making\u00a0and racial\u00a0rhetoric. Walsh\u00a0also called the 2018 Russia\u2013United States summit\u00a0in Helsinki \u201cun-American\u201d after Trump publicly seemed to side\u00a0with Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community\u00a0regarding Russia's interference in the 2016 election. \"In Mr. Trump, I see the worst and ugliest iteration of views I expressed for the better part of a decade. To be sure, I\u2019ve had my share of controversy.\" Walsh wrote in the op-ed.\u00a0\"On more than one occasion, I questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s truthfulness about his religion. At times, I expressed hate for my political opponents. We now see where this can lead. There\u2019s no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them. \"The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects,\" he also wrote. Additionally, George Conway, a vocal Trump\u00a0critic and husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, tweeted his support for a possible Walsh run. Walsh\u2019s public talk about a possible White House run\u00a0comes after former Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.,\u00a0appeared\u00a0on Meet the Press\u00a0on Sunday and said\u00a0he is considering a primary challenge to Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s been a drumbeat over the last year of people who I admire, who are not crazy, who are very thoughtful saying we need to have this conversation,\u201d Sanford, who is also a former governor of South Carolina,\u00a0said. More:Former South Carolina governor says Trump doesn't deserve re-election, is considering GOP primary challenge Both Walsh and Sanford have said they intend to make a decision about challenging Trump\u00a0by Labor Day. Additionally, the Washington Post reports that Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator and another \"never-Trumper,\" said he has taken numerous recruitment calls in recent days from GOP donors rattled by looming signs of economic turbulence and who are eager for an alternative to Trump. Flake has also said that it is better for a Democrat to win in 2020 that Trump, declaring, \"Four years is difficult enough to unravel some of the damage\" caused by the Trump\u00a0administration, Flake said\u00a0in March. \"Yes ... and this notion, this narrative that's been built up, that Donald Trump is the only one that can cobble together the Electoral College and win is just a fallacy,\" Flake also said in March. More:Cindy McCain says there is no 'voice of reason' in GOP, nearly a year after John McCain's death And the prospect for a fifth GOP primary challenger to Trump has cropped\u00a0up. Former Ohio governor John Kasich will head to New Hampshire next month to \u201ctake a look at things\u201d after experiencing \u201can increase\u201d in overtures this summer, an adviser said. The Washington Post\u00a0first reported Kasich's upcoming trip. Speculation\u00a0about the prospect of one or more new GOP primary challengers to Trump\u00a0comes after weeks of very public criticism of the president by\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director who recently withdrew his support for Trump. Instead, Scaramucci has declared\u00a0Trump \u201cunstable\u201d and unfit for office. He revealed he is in the process of forming a super PAC to run advertisements against his former boss. More:Scaramucci says he will start and fund a super PAC to 'dismantle' Trump Scaramucci called his past support for Trump\u00a0a mistake\u00a0and is seeking to take action in the political arena against the president. He also ridiculed against Trump\u00a0on Twitter, comparing the president\u00a0to the Game of Throne's Night King and calling Trump a \"bully.\" The view that Trump is a bully who must be removed from the political scene by someone on the conservative side of the political spectrum is one shared by Walsh ho wrote as much in his New York Times op-ed. \u201cWe need someone who could stand up, look the president in the eye and say: 'Enough, sir,'\" Walsh penned.\u00a0\u00a0\"'We\u2019ve had enough of your indecency. We\u2019ve had enough of your lies, your bullying, your cruelty, enough of your insults, your daily drama, your incitement, enough of the danger you place this country in every single day. We don\u2019t want any of this anymore, and the country certainly can\u2019t stand four more years of it.'\u201d",

Ilhan Omar,\u00a0D-Minn. The chant echoed a series of tweets Trump posted on Sunday in which he said Omar and three other congresswomen of color should \"go back\u00a0and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Distracter in chief:Donald Trump draws on familiar playbook with attacks on women lawmakers of color 'Disgusted':How Republicans are reacting to 'send her back' chants at Trump's rally Omar, who was born in Somalia,\u00a0is a naturalized U.S. citizen who arrived in the country as a refugee at age 12.

Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 are all U.S. citizens. All three were born in the United States. Pressed further on the crowd's chant at the rally, Trump suggested reporters return to North Carolina to ask why supporters began the chant during Wednesday's rally. \"I didn't say that,\" Trump said, referring to the chant. \"They did.\" Asked why he did not stop the chant, Trump said: \u201cI think I did \u2013 I started speaking very quickly.\" The first time the chant broke out during the North Carolina rally, Trump continued his speech\u00a0and did not tell the audience to stop. The second time supporters began chanting, Trump stood back from the lectern, paused in his remarks and listened\u00a0as the crowd repeated the words nearly a dozen times. Trump's remarks came after several Republican lawmakers distanced themselves Thursday from\u00a0chants\u00a0even as many defended Trump himself from charges of racism. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., posted on Twitter that he woke up \"disgusted\" by the chant, which he described as \u201cugly.\u201d The raucous\u00a0scene that played out on stage hearkened to Trump's 2016 rallies, when supporters would often taunt Democrat Hillary Clinton with chants of \"lock her up.\" Then, Trump basked in the chant and occasionally\u00a0clapped along. Poll:Most Americans call Trump's tweets targeting 4 congresswomen 'un-American' Other politicians have confronted audience members to avoid the blowback\u00a0from their controversial statements. The most notable example came in 2008, when then Republican presidential nominee John McCain corrected a woman during a Minnesota town hall meeting who claimed that Barack Obama was \"an Arab.\" Squad:Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad' Vote:House votes to condemn Trump's tweets with support from 4 Republicans AMERIND Risk provides peace of mind with our comprehensive suite of coverage products.

      "content": "Jaguars star cornerback Jalen Ramsey is inactive for the first time in his four-year NFL career. Ramsey, who asked for a trade two weeks ago, flew with the Jaguars to Denver after missing practice all week because of illness, a back injury and the birth of his second child back in Nashville. Ramsey will be replaced at left cornerback second-year pro Tre Herndon. The Broncos are without three of their big free agent signings with cornerback DB Kareem Jackson (hamstring) joining sidelined cornerback Bryce Callahan, who underwent a procedure on his left foot last week and will be out for at least a month, and right tackle Ju'Waun James, who hurt his left knee in the opener. Defensive end Derek Wolfe (ankle) and inside linebacker Josey Jewell (hamstring) are active for Denver. In Chicago, the Bears will be without five starters against the Minnesota Vikings, including linebacker Roquan Smith and defensive end Akiem Hicks. Smith is missing the game for personal reasons, according to Bears officials. Hicks was questionable on the injury report after suffering a knee injury against Washington last Monday night. He went through some light pregame work on the field but was unable to go. Another surprise absence is guard Kyle Long, who was questionable for the game with a hip injury. Long had the injury earlier in the week but practiced. He then was unable to practice Friday and coach Matt Nagy said Long had a \"setback.\" Starting wide receiver Taylor Gabriel (concussion) and defensive end Bilal Nichols (broken hand) had already been ruled out for the game. In Los Angeles, Tampa Bay receiver Chris Godwin is active against the Rams after missing practice time this week with a hip injury. Rookie linebacker Demone Harris is still out after spraining his knee two weeks ago. Tampa Bay also has its starting offensive line intact, with right tackle Demar Dotson (calf) and center Ryan Jensen (back) both suiting up despite injuries. In Glendale, Arizona, the Cardinals will be without punter Andy Lee, who hurt his hip in last week's game against Carolina. Arizona signed Ryan Winslow and put him on the active roster on Saturday.

      "content": "PHOENIX - Kelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, said in a fundraising email sent to supporters Thursday evening\u00a0that together, \"we'll stop gun-grabber Mark Kelly dead in his tracks.\" Kelly, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, is the husband of former Rep.\u00a0Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who survived a\u00a0Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting\u00a0at one of her\u00a0constituent events near Tucson.\u00a0Six people were killed; another 12 were wounded. Giffords is paralyzed on the right side of her body, suffers from a speaking disorder\u00a0and has partial vision loss.\u00a0After that mass-shooting tragedy and others that have followed, Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut,\u00a0raised his voice in support of what he calls common-sense gun controls. Both Kelly and Giffords are gun owners. Gun control:Gabby Giffords' activism is symbolic of the Democratic Party's shift on guns \"This dangerous rhetoric has absolutely no place in Arizona and is what\u2019s wrong with our politics,\" said Jacob Peters, a spokesman for Kelly's campaign. \"Mark Kelly is running for Senate to overcome this type of nasty divisiveness that does nothing for Arizonans.\" Kelly faces no competitive challenger for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 Senate seat. He is expected\u00a0to face Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz. Ward's message raises the issue of gun rights, historically a winner with conservatives, but a move that polling suggests could play badly with independents and suburban voters in 2020. The state Republican Party's fundraising email also\u00a0took aim at\u00a0Giffords' PAC, the\u00a0political action committee formed by the couple to help candidates who advocate for gun control. The PAC spent\u00a0nearly $7 million in the last election cycle. Ward defended the fundraising email on Twitter\u00a0and slammed media coverage as \"Utterly ridiculous!\" She wrote Friday morning, \"I don't wish harm on Mr. Kelly. We disagree politically on the Constitution and the #2a, and I'm\u00a0well aware of the harm his policies would cause should he ever be elected.\" Ward,\u00a0a two-time unsuccessful candidate for the Senate, has faced harsh criticism for her public statements before. Last year, for example, she implied via social media posts that the family of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,\u00a0timed the announcement about his ending treatment for brain cancer to harm her Senate campaign. The senator died Aug. 25, 2018, just a few days before Arizona's Aug. 28 primary election. Mark Kelly 2020 Senate run:Retired astronaut Mark Kelly to run as Democrat for John McCain's Senate seat in 2020 Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., called Ward's remarks \"disgusting\"\u00a0in a Twitter post. He said McSally should call on Ward to resign. McSally was not immediately available for comment. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.,\u00a0defended Ward on Twitter\u00a0and accused the media of overblowing her choice of words. \"Differentiating between idioms, slang, analogies and metaphors from statement of facts is learned in child hood. For supposed adults to feign ignorance\" about Ward's use of the phrase \"is a demonstration of ignorance. Ignore #FakeNews and it\u2019s handmaidens of stupid outrage.\" Follow Yvonne Wingett Sanchez on Twitter:\u00a0@yvonnewingett",

      "subtitle": "'Hostile questions' on tap for Kurt Volker, Trump's former special envoy for Ukraine",
      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 When Kurt Volker took an unpaid, part-time position in the Trump administration as a special envoy for Ukraine, he probably didn't imagine\u00a0it would land him in the witness chair of an impeachment inquiry. But Volker \u2013 a former foreign service officer and long-time\u00a0Europe\u00a0expert \u2013\u00a0will now be the first\u00a0official interviewed by House Democrats, as they investigate\u00a0allegations that President\u00a0Trump,\u00a0during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky, used the power of his office to seek foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election. Volker, who resigned Friday from his special envoy post, is scheduled to be deposed Thursday during a closed hearing on Capitol Hill. He\u00a0played a central role in\u00a0connecting\u00a0Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, with Ukrainian officials \u2013 a step critics say is highly inappropriate. And he was named in the explosive whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment proceedings. Volker\u00a0resigned less than 24 hours after Giuliani posted a private text message from the special envoy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in which Volker offered to set up a meeting with a top adviser to Zelensky. Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden,a political rival who is seeking to unseat Trump in 2020. \u201cAs discussed, connecting you here with Andrey\u00a0Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky,\u201d the July 19 text message reads. \u201cI suggest we schedule a call together on Monday \u2013 maybe 10 am or 11 am Washington time?\u201d Democrats slammed Volker's text message as evidence of \"highly illegal coordination\" between the Trump campaign and the State Department. On Thursday, they will get their first opportunity to grill Volker over his dealings with Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. \"He\u2019ll get some hostile questions,\"\u00a0said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\u00a0But Herbst, who has known Volker for over a decade, says he will be able to offer lawmakers a persuasive defense for his actions. \"He\u2019s a smart guy and a cool guy, and I think he\u2019ll have reasonable answers,\" Herbst\u00a0said. Herbst said Volker was focused on furthering U.S. foreign policy goals\u00a0\u2013 namely helping Ukraine secure the military assistance it needs to counter Russian aggression. Trump temporarily froze U.S. aid\u00a0to Ukraine in mid-July, a move that prompted bipartisan outrage as the eastern European country struggled to fight Moscow's attacks on its fledgling democracy. \"He had a job to pursue American interests in Ukraine, to help Ukraine deal with the Kremlin aggression,\" Herbst said of Volker. He tried to do that by reaching out to Giuliani, while also trying to maintain bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine. Complaint valid:IG rebuts claims by Trump and his backers that rules were changed to allow whistleblower complaint Volker is a \"very smart, balanced, creative professional\" who is willing to take risks if he believes it will help achieve America's interests abroad,\u00a0he said. \"Unfortunately this did not turn out well, but it was not an unreasonable thing for him to attempt.\" According to the whistleblower complaint, Volker and another U.S. ambassador, Gordon Sondland, had met with Giuliani to try to \"contain the damage\" his efforts were having on U.S. national security. The whistleblower said Volker and Sondland also met with Ukrainian officials to help them navigate the \"differing messages\" they were getting through official U.S. government channels and Giuliani's private outreach. Kelly Magsamen, a former national security and defense official in the Obama administration, said Volker \u201chas a record of being a very serious guy\u201d and is seen as part of the GOP establishment\u2019s foreign policy crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s not necessarily what I would consider a Trumpian person,\u201d said Magsamen, now a national security and international policy expert at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cThat said, I do think he has a lot of things to answer for possibly tomorrow.\u201d Magsamen said Volker will likely be asked a raft of sensitive questions: What did he know about the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call, was he asked to assist Giuliani\u2019s campaign to get damaging information on the Bidens, were Giuliani\u2019s efforts considered part of U.S. foreign policy or a \u201crogue\u201d operation, and did Trump withhold U.S. security assistance to Ukraine as leverage over Zelensky. \u201cI think Ambassador Volker is probably eager to clarify his role in these issues with the Hill,\u201d she said, adding that he has a \u201cstrong interest in salvaging his reputation.\u201d It's not yet\u00a0clear if Volker will be questioned by lawmakers or by staff lawyers on the House committees\u00a0leading the probe, or both. Volker is moving ahead with Thursday's deposition, even as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has delayed other State Department officials from testifying. Volker has not responded to multiple emails seeking comment. But because he resigned from his government post, he may have more freedom to talk to House Democrats than others who still work for the Trump administration. Giuliani has for months tried to push Zelensky's government to dig up damaging information on Biden and his son, Hunter\u00a0Biden, who served on the board of directors of a Ukrainian energy company. That company had come under scrutiny by Ukraine's former chief\u00a0prosecutor for possible corruption. But Ukrainian officials have said there's\u00a0no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son. Volker\u00a0was named as Trump's special envoy in July 2017, by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He came to the post with a stellar resume: a former U.S. ambassador to NATO in the George W. Bush administration and former adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a longtime Russia critic. He took the envoy job on a volunteer basis, while continuing to\u00a0serve\u00a0as executive director of the McCain Institute\u00a0for International Leadership at Arizona State University. Listening in:Pompeo confirms he was on Trump Ukraine call Volker's mission as special envoy was to help enforce a political settlement to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia annexed the\u00a0Crimean peninsula\u00a0in 2014, and Ukraine continues to fight\u00a0Russian separatist attacks in the eastern part of the country.\u00a0Experts say it's vital for the U.S. to help Ukraine stave off Russian aggression, particularly as Vladimir Putin looks to rebuild the Soviet empire. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last week tweeted out praise for Volker as having \"a well deserved reputation for fairness, toughness and integrity, which is why I was so disappointed to see him caught up in this mess.\" Volker's appearance is the first of what Democrats hope will be a parade of officials who have knowledge either of the administration's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian\u00a0government for help going after the Bidens or attempts by the White House to \"lock down\" information related to Trump's July 25 call to Zelensky as the whistleblower complaint alleges. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,\u00a0told\u00a0reporters Wednesday that\u00a0Volker's deposition before the committee will\u00a0be followed Friday by an appearance from Michael K. Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, whose office handled the whistleblower complaint. \"The last time that the inspector general testified, we did not have the complaint. We now do. And we certainly intend to ask (him)\u00a0about the efforts that were made to corroborate that compliant which we now know that the inspector general found credible and urgent,\" Schiff said. Next week, the committee has scheduled a deposition of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly recalled from her post in May. And Schiff said the committee is \"in discussion\" with other State Department witnesses to secure their depositions. \"We are proceeding deliberately but at the same time\u00a0we feel a sense of urgency here that this work needs to\u00a0get done and it needs to get done in a responsible period of time,\" he said.",

Shanahan also confirmed that the White House's military liaison office had emailed a directive to the 7th Fleet to hide the ship\u00a0from Trump, but that the Navy had ignored the directive.\u00a0The ship is named after Sen.

Shanahan told reporters that he would not ask the Pentagon's Inspector General to conduct a review of the controversy surrounding the ship. The Wall Street Journal had first reported that the White House had asked the Navy to keep the ship \"out of sight\" during Trump's visit over Memorial Day weekend. On Thursday last week, President Donald Trump weighed in on the controversy, saying that he had not been involved, but that he was sure that whoever attempted to shield the ship from his view was\u00a0\"well meaning.\" Contributing: Ledyard King",

      "author": "",
      "content": "A man caught on camera vandalizing the altar of Sedona's treasured Chapel of the Holy Cross may have ties to\u00a0the QAnon conspiracy as well as a series of stolen property crimes across Arizona. On Sept. 25, as tourists took pictures and video of the Catholic chapel nested in the red rocks above Sedona, a man entered the building and started swinging a crowbar at the altar. He also sprayed the word \"Evil\" in spray paint outside on the sidewalk. Sedona police arrested Timothy Larson, 41, of Las Vegas and charged him with\u00a0 aggravated criminal damage, disorderly conduct and a hate crime. After serving a search warrant for Larson's car and the room he was renting in Sedona, police\u00a0became aware of Larson's possible connection to a burglary in Sedona as well as some other thefts in Arizona. Larson is in the Coconino County Detention Facility in Flagstaff\u00a0on $50,000 bond. Police made the connection to QAnon\u00a0based on Larson's social media posts as well as flyers he reportedly handed to a store\u00a0clerk who reported him to police. Many of his social media posts include the hashtags #Qanon and #MAGA. \"He referred to the incident at the chapel as a mission,\" Sedona Chief of Police Charles Husted said about Larson's social media posts following the incident. The QAnon conspiracy theory is said to have originated on the anonymous internet message\u00a0board 4chan,\u00a0where a user going by the name \"Q\" claimed\u00a0to be a\u00a0government insider with a security clearance and posts\u00a0vague messages. QAnon believers try to decipher these messages, which they believe are about the\u00a0 involvement of\u00a0Democrats and the Catholic Church in a global child sex-trafficking ring. The conspiracy belief involves allegations that Hillary Clinton and John McCain were under arrest and wearing ankle bracelets and that the Mueller report\u00a0was a smokescreen for a real government investigation that would reveal the pedophile ring as well as lead to the arrest of many of President Donald Trump's critics. Though possibly influenced by the theory, Husted believes Larson was acting on his own. \"It was his role or his mission to go there and do something about it,\" Husted said. Though the dark edges of the internet may have provided the space for the conspiracy theory\u00a0to grow, the internet\u00a0may have helped police as well. \"The reason we were able to capture this guy so quickly was because of social media and our ability to connect with our community through nextdoor.com,\" Husted said. Nextdoor is a\u00a0social media platform for neighborhoods where community members can share information. A number of tourists were taking pictures when the chapel vandalism happened. \"I took a screenshot of one of those images and I sent it out on Next Door via an urgent alert,\" Husted said. His message alerted hundreds of phones in Sedona. People shared the message with friends, neighbors and on their own social media. The\u00a0message eventually made its way to a store clerk in Sedona. A few minutes later, a\u00a0man who looked like the one in the picture\u00a0walked into her store. He reportedly handed her one of his QAnon cards and said he was investigating human trafficking. She called 911 and officers searching the area took him into custody without incident, less than two hours after Husted posted that initial alert. \"It's all because of our community stepping up to help us,\" Husted said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The bruising campaign for the White House between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger will take center\u00a0stage in 2020 but it's the contest for control of the Senate that will determine the presidential winner's ability to pass legislation, appoint judges and fund priorities. Democrats, who effectively control 47 seats, need to flip at least four Republican Senate seats to recapture the upper chamber\u00a0\u2013 or three if they win back the White House since the vice president breaks ties. Republicans hold 23 of the\u00a035 seats up for grabs next year, giving Democrats nearly twice as many pick-up opportunities. Adding to the Democrats' optimism is that many of the races are in states where the president's approval rating sits well under 50%. Republicans counter that all but two (Colorado and Maine) of the GOP seats up for election are in states Trump won in 2016. And the two most vulnerable Democrats are in states (Alabama\u00a0and Michigan) that Trump won. Thirteen months out from Election Day, there remains plenty of questions: Will primary voters nominate moderates or party reactionaries that would have a tougher time winning a general election? How will the the Democratic presidential nominee influence\u00a0down-ballot Senate races? What kind of effect will congressional Democrats' pursuit of Trump's impeachment have on voters? \u201cSo many things we don\u2019t know,\" said Jennifer Duffy, a long-time Senate analyst\u00a0with the non-partisan\u00a0Cook Political Report. Duffy and others watching 2020 elections give Democrats less than a 50-50 chance of recapturing the Senate considering there are only a handful of states in play right now. The debates:Schedule set for 2020 general election presidential and vice presidential debates Already the attack ads have been launched by both parties. Republicans are painting Democratic candidates as socialists who back far-left policies such as \"Medicare\u00a0for All,\" free college tuition and radical climate change remedies like the Green\u00a0New Deal. They've begun airing ads in some states that feature Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman New York Democrat and social media star who embodies the party's left-wing ideology. Democrats are portraying Republicans as climate deniers and anti-immigration zealots who blindly back Trump. They've started\u00a0airing ads with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican whom opponents accuse of protecting Trump and obstructing important legislation from even getting a floor vote. There is a soundness to each side's partisan strategy: In\u00a02016, every Senate seat up for election was won by the party whose presidential nominee also captured that state. Here's a look at the states in play and the chances the Senate could flip back to Democrats: The two Republicans who represent states that Hillary Clinton captured in 2016\u00a0\u2013 Cory Gardner in Colorado and Susan Collins in Maine\u00a0\u2013 are top targets for Democrats next year. As a freshman senator who squeaked in five years ago, Gardner is considered more vulnerable than Collins, who won her fourth term in 2014 with 68% of the vote. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's entry into the race gives Democrats a formidable challenger with\u00a0high name recognition in a state where Democrats will try to capitalize on\u00a0issues such as climate change and health care. But Republicans say Hickenlooper's shaky performance during a short stint as a 2020\u00a0presidential candidate and an expected primary challenge\u00a0from former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff may wound him\u00a0in the\u00a0general election. Susan Collins:For Sen. Susan Collins, a tough reelection got a lot tougher with Trump impeachment inquiry Collins' long-held image as a moderate voice on Capitol Hill took on water last year with her pivotal vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Progressives fumed over\u00a0her vote, promising to raise money and turn out Mainers to keep her from winning a fifth term. Collins was leading\u00a0her likely Democratic opponent, state House Speaker Sara Gideon, by double digits in a Gravis Marketing poll released in June. But there was a\u00a0potential warning sign for the incumbent: the same poll found 48% approved of Collins' performance \u2013\u00a0the same percentage that disapproved. Few GOP incumbents have a bigger bullseye than Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. The former Air Force fighter pilot has a stellar resume but she is running in an increasingly purple state against a well-funded and high-profile challenger: former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former congresswoman and gun-control advocate Gabby\u00a0Giffords. Kelly is a\u00a0first-time candidate and Republican strategists said they hope to exploit that lack of experience on the campaign trail. McSally has never won statewide (she lost a Senate race in 2018 and was appointed to fill the vacancy created by John McCain's death last year). But she wields the power of incumbency and Trump's endorsement could turn out\u00a0conservative Arizonans wary of McSally. Democrats are optimistic they can flip the seats of two other Republican incumbents\u00a0\u2013 Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa. Of the two,\u00a0Tillis is in deeper peril, according to political experts, partly because there are signs the state might not be as red as it was in 2016. A\u00a0Charlotte-area congressional seat that Trump won by 12 points in 2016 barely went for a Trump-endorsed Republican in a special election earlier this year. Tom Steyer:Tom Steyer has been pushing impeachment for years. Now it's center stage for his first debate Just as Republicans Gardner and Collins must find cross-over appeal in states that voted in 2016 for Clinton, Democrats Doug Jones (Alabama) and Gary Peters (Michigan) face a similar challenge because they're running for reelection in states that Trump won. Jones is considered the most vulnerable incumbent running in 2020 \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 chiefly because he represents a state that Trump carried by nearly 28 percentage points. Jones, the only Senate Democrat in the Deep South,\u00a0came to the Senate after winning a closely contested special election in 2017 over Republican Roy Moore,\u00a0who was tainted by allegations he had romantically pursued and sexually assaulted teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is running again but so are other Republicans, including Congressman Bradley Byrne and former Auburn Football Coach\u00a0Tommy Tuberville, neither of whom\u00a0carry the political baggage that helped Jones win his seat. Republicans also believe that Peters is very beatable, largely because many Michiganders don't know him or aren't sure what to make of him. Polls show more than a third of state voters don't have a firm opinion of him despite nearly five years in office. Peters is \"weak\" Duffy said. \"It\u2019s not that he has angered voters. It\u2019s that they have no idea who he is.\u201d Republicans are also optimistic because\u00a0GOP businessman and Army veteran John James, who outperformed expectations in a 2018 loss to Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabinow,\u00a0has entered the race. Nita Lowey:Longtime Rep. Nita Lowey won't seek reelection in 2020 A senator's decision not to seek reelection presents a rare opportunity\u00a0for opposing parties because it traditionally provides a better chance to flip a seat when there's no incumbent touting years of constituent achievement or legislative accomplishment. But none of the four open seats \u2013 three GOP states (Georgia, Kansas\u00a0and Tennessee) and one Democratic (New Mexico)\u00a0\u2013 are in much danger of changing party control, according to political analysts. Traditionally red Kansas could be the exception if Republican Kris Kobach wins the primary. The immigration hard-liner who lost a gubernatorial contest to\u00a0Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018 is seen by analysts and political operatives on both sides as a\u00a0weak candidate who would likely put the state in play if he wins the GOP nomination next year. Georgia's open seat (created by the early retirement\u00a0of Republican Johnny Isakson) will be paired with Republican David Perdue's reelection bid. That would give Democrats two chances to pick up a seat in\u00a0a Deep South state that's been trending more purple recently. But chances of winning one of those were hurt when rising Democratic star Stacy Abrams opted not to run.",

      "content": "Naturally, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's Tuesday announcement that the House of Representatives would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into\u00a0whether President Donald Trump\u00a0encouraged a foreign government\u00a0to investigate his political rival, caught the attention of celebrities with some celebrating and others standing by him. And\u00a0famous names are beginning to respond to the\u00a0a\u00a0five-page transcript released Wednesday, from a July phone chat between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call lasting half an hour,\u00a0Trump repeatedly pressed the president of Ukraine to re-open an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company to focus on any involvement by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to the transcript. \"Republicans should put their hand on their heart, remember their Oath to defend the Constitution, and ask themselves one question: 'If Obama asked a foreign leader to work w/his AG & personal lawyer to investigate a political opponent, what would I do?' \" tweeted\u00a0political commentator Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas. Some stars were in favor of the\u00a0formal impeachment\u00a0inquiry\u00a0while others seem to roll their eyes at the move. Kathy Griffin, who created a stir when she posed with a mock severed Trump head in 2017,\u00a0celebrated with a GIF of her dancing and the hashtag \"#ImpeachTrump\". Bette Midler, posted a photo in a fancy gown. \"IT\u2019S A FORMAL #IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY! THAT\u2019S WHY I\u2019M WEARING MY FANCIEST DRESS!!\" Alyssa Milano tweeted \"WOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!\" in response to Pelosi's news. She also responded to a 2014 inquiry from Trump asking, \"Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?\" \"Yup,\" she replied Tuesday. Stephen Colbert\u00a0thinks Chrissy Teigen's NSFW Twitter lashing for Trump is perfection Meghan McCain defends\u00a0Chrissy Teigen after President Trump targets Teigen, John Legend \"View\" co-host Meghan McCain shared her opinion on \"What What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\" \"If President Trump did in fact try and bribe the Ukraine and the President of the Ukraine to get information on Joe Biden and his son, this is something that obviously should\u00a0\u2013 I don't know impeachment level\u00a0\u2013 but it should definitely be investigated,\" she said. Author Stephen King, an outspoken critic\u00a0of Trump's, tweeted: \"Like Rep. Pelosi, I haven't seen the point of a House impeachment proceeding when the McConnell-led Senate won't convict. But with this Ukraine business, Trump has gone too far and must be brought to heel. For the good of America, impeach now.\" Chelsea Handler took pleasure in the timing of the news on the social media site. \"It\u2019s a truly beautiful thing that #ImpeachTrump and #NationalVoterRegistrationDay are both happening on the same day,\" she shared. \"Mazel.\" Actor\u00a0George Takei also feels consequences are necessary. \"People ask what the point of impeachment is if the senate will never remove Trump from office,\" he posted\u00a0to Twitter.\u00a0\"I say, the point is to enforce the constitutional consequences of Trump\u2019s abuse of office. If the House had not moved to impeach after this, then our constitution would mean nothing.\" Anthony Scaramucci, who very briefly served as the\u00a0White House communications director in 2017, thanked Pelosi and shared a quote attributed to philosopher\u00a0Jean-Jacques Rousseau. \"Patience is bitter, but it\u2019s fruit is sweet.\" Jon Voight attacks 'radical left,'\u00a0hails Trump as 'the greatest president of this century' There were\u00a0also those in Trump's corner. Singer/songwriter Charlie Daniels voiced his support for thepresident Wednesday morning. \"Donald Trump is the first president I ever remember standing in front of the United Nations and proclaiming the greatness of America and his intentions to keep it that way,\" the\u00a0\"Devil Went Down to Georgia,\" artist tweeted.\u00a0\"He chops the log and lets the chips fly wherever they need to fall.\" He also condemned Democrats for what he interpreted as animosity. \"The amount of unabated hate that exists in the current democrat party is uncontrollable and has the power to destroy those who blindly pursue its boundaries,\" posted Daniels.\u00a0\"A busted container of garbage splashes in all directions Even on the ones who dropped it.\" Fox News' \"The Ingaham Angle\" host Laura Ingraham shared her thoughts. \"Dems know they can\u2019t remove Trump from office. But they figure they can hurt the economy, and distract everyone from the probs with their own candidates, so they figure impeachment will work out for them anyway,\" she wrote.

      "content": "President Donald Trump may not be watching the Democratic presidential debate, but his people are. While Trump wraps up his trip to speak\u00a0at a House Republicans retreat in Baltimore, the Trump campaign\u2019s rapid response team is firing off emails to reporters in defense of his record as Democrats go after him from the stage. \u201cPresident Trump is addressing gun safety while defending the 2nd Amendment,\u201d read one message sent just minutes after Democrats slammed Trump failing to take on the issue of gun violence. California Sen. Kamala Harris came after Trump hard, saying the president is culpable for recent mass shootings. \"Obviously he did't pull the trigger, but he certainly tweeted the ammunition,\" Harris said on the debate stage. Trump has been accused by Democrats of stoking racial tensions that have led to shootings motivated by racism. Presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke said on stage that Trump's rhetoric about immigrants played a role in the El Paso shooting last month. The shooter, he said, was \"inspired to kill by our president.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called Trump's policies on immigration racist as well. \"Anyone who supports this is supporting racism,\" he said. \u201cThanks to President Trump, black Americans are making historic progress and enjoying growing opportunities,\u201d read another rebuttal when Democrats accused him of promoting racism. More:'Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?': Biden and Castro debate health care \u201cPresident Trump is fighting to bring down prescription drug prices for working families,\u201d said another message when Democrats blasted Trump for trying to undo the Affordable Care Act. Harris brought Trump into the health care conversation: \"At least five people have talked... and not once have we talked about Donald Trump. So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\" She gave a nod to the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose 2017 vote not to overturn Obamacare was a break from the Republican Party. \u201cWe all fought against that, and then the late, great John McCain at about 2 in the morning killed his attempt to kill health care for millions of people in this country,\" Harris said.",

      "subtitle": "Lobbyist says he wasn't lobbying when he tried to oust Ukrainian ambassador. Experts disagree.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "An allegation that Bob Livingston, a\u00a0congressman-turned-lobbyist, sought to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine raises\u00a0questions about whether he violated a federal law that requires\u00a0lobbyists to disclose their work for foreign\u00a0clients. Livingston, a former high-ranking House member who heads an influential Washington lobbying firm, repeatedly called Foreign Service Officer Catherine Croft and pressed for the ouster of the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, Croft told impeachment investigators last week. In Croft's written\u00a0statement, she said\u00a0Livingston told her that Yovanovitch\u00a0\u2013 now a key figure in impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump \u2013 was an \u201cObama holdover\u201d associated with George Soros, the billionaire investor, philanthropist, Democratic donor, and Trump critic. \"It was not clear to me at the time \u2013\u00a0or now \u2013\u00a0at whose direction or\u00a0at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\" said Croft, who said\u00a0she documented the calls and told her superiors about them. Livingston probably\u00a0should have disclosed whether he was paid by two Ukraine-linked clients or any other foreigner to seek\u00a0Yovanovitch's removal,\u00a0two legal experts\u00a0on\u00a0the Foreign Agents Registration Act\u00a0told USA TODAY. But Livingston said he made the calls\u00a0as a \"concerned American citizen,\" not as a lobbyist. His clients included\u00a0a coalition of Ukrainian steel companies and an obscure company created to support Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister of Ukraine. If Livingston was working for Ukrainian clients he disclosed, \"he should have reported those contacts ... no question about that,\" said Joseph Sandler, an expert on the law that governs U.S. lobbying for\u00a0foreign clients. Sandler is a\u00a0partner at the Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock law firm in Washington, D.C., and a former general counsel for\u00a0the Democratic National Committee. \"If it was for another foreign entity, then he needed to register for them\" and disclose the lobbying, Sandler said. Matthew Sanderson, another expert on lobbying for foreign clients\u00a0and a\u00a0member of the Caplin & Drysdale law firm in Washington, D.C., said Livingston's calls about Yovanovitch \"should be disclosed in some fashion.\" Livingston, in telephone interviews with USA TODAY, acknowledged making two calls to Croft in which he urged that Yovanovitch be fired. He said he\u00a0conveyed similar messages to the\u00a0White House and the National Security Council. However, Livingston said he didn't make those calls as a paid lobbyist.\u00a0\"I made direct calls as a concerned American citizen ... to tell them they had a problem,\"\u00a0he said. That means he didn't\u00a0have to file any disclosures, he said. Livingston said he spoke up\u00a0after he heard complaints about Yovanovitch from \"Ukrainian citizens and ex-pats.\" He declined to identify those people or\u00a0disclose whether they were present or former Ukrainian government officials. He also declined to discuss the substance of their complaints. Sanderson said it doesn't seem plausible that Livingston had acted\u00a0on his own and not on behalf of a client. \"I think it strains credulity to say he did it on his own behalf as an American citizen,\"\u00a0 said Sanderson. He advises corporations, political committees and other clients about complex laws that regulate political activity. He has also served as a counsel for several well-known Republicans, including\u00a0Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mitt Romney of Utah, outgoing Energy Secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. \"Lobbyists\u00a0and whoever interacts with the government only have so many 'asks' that you can particularly makeand so many issues you can press for at one time,\" said Sanderson. Livingston's explanation would not be credible if he had any business relationships with those he said had complained to him about Yovanovitch, Sanderson added. While insisting he complied with the law,\u00a0Livingston said\u00a0his company, The Livingston Group, is known as one of the best in Washington\u00a0for complying\u00a0with\u00a0regulations on lobbying for foreign clients. The Foreign Agents Registration Act, enacted in 1938, was designed\u00a0to shine a light on U.S. lobbyists pressing federal officials and agencies for causes on behalf of foreign clients or governments. The law requires lobbyists who represent foreign clients and their causes in the U.S. to\u00a0file disclosures describing\u00a0the issues and any emails, phone calls and meetings with U.S. officials. The filings are often specific, describing\u00a0who attended a meeting and the topics that were discussed. That\u00a0law played a key role in\u00a0the criminal conviction of Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign manager.\u00a0Among other things, he was convicted of failing to register as an agent of the Ukrainian government and its former president. Livingston's efforts to oust\u00a0Yovanovitch occurred amid similar efforts\u00a0by\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and ex-federal prosecutor who's now Trump's\u00a0personal lawyer. The U.S. Department of\u00a0State recalled Yovanovitch\u00a0from her post\u00a0in May\u00a0after pressure from Trump. Her removal, though legally within the authority of any U.S. president,\u00a0has become a central thread\u00a0in the presidential impeachment inquiry. The proceedings focus\u00a0on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine unless officials there investigated\u00a0business dealings of the family of former Vice President Joe Biden,a potential presidential challenger to Trump in 2020. Trump also sought an investigation into\u00a0a theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. No definitive\u00a0evidence has emerged to support either allegation. Both Giuliani and Livingston have done business\u00a0in Ukraine or with firms and people\u00a0tied to the country. Some of their clients and business relationships came from similar circles. However, there are key\u00a0differences. Giuliani has said he performed some of his work related to Ukraine\u00a0as an attorney representing Trump. He said the foreign-agent law doesn't apply to his legal activity for the President. \"The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges,\" Giuliani tweeted on Wednesday, announcing that he has\u00a0hired three attorneys to represent him in a\u00a0federal investigation. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that federal\u00a0prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are examining Giuliani's business in Ukraine and pursuing information about his\u00a0dealings with two Soviet-born associates who helped him seek\u00a0damaging information\u00a0in Ukraine on Biden's family. The associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been indicted in a U.S. campaign finance conspiracy case, charged\u00a0with funneling foreign money to U.S. politicians and campaign committees.\u00a0They and two co-defendants have pleaded not guilty. USA TODAY reported in October that U.S. counterintelligence agents have been\u00a0investigating Giuliani's dealings with Parnas and Fruman since\u00a0at least early 2019. Giuliani said in an interview with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0last month that\u00a0he viewed\u00a0Yovanovitch as an obstacle to U.S. efforts to press Ukraine for an investigation into\u00a0Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter, a former board member of a Ukrainian gas company\u00a0called Burisma Holdings. Livingston said he acted alone in passing on complaints\u00a0about Yovanovitch, not in coordination with Giuliani \u2014 whom he said he has\u00a0not seen in about three years. According to FARA disclosures, Livingston's company lobbied in Washington on\u00a0behalf of two Ukrainian clientsin 2017 and 2018. One was the\u00a0Association of Enterprises Ukrmetalurgprom,a coalition of Ukrainian companies that sought\u00a0exemptions from Trump administration tariffs on imported steel.\u00a0The firms\u00a0included Metinvest Group, controlled by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov;\u00a0Interpipe, the firm of the billionaire Victor Pinchuk;\u00a0and Ferrexpo, controlled by\u00a0Kostyantyn Zhevag, according to a report by the Kyiv Post. The English-language\u00a0newspaper\u00a0that first reported some details of Livingston's lobbying. Croft, the Foreign Service officer,\u00a0was among the Washington officials Livingston's firm contacted on behalf of the Ukrainian group.\u00a0According to a\u00a0FARA filing, the\u00a0firm\u00a0contacted her in May 2018\u00a0by phone and in a followup email\u00a0regarding\u00a0Trump's proposed\u00a0tariffs on steel imports. Livingston's company also sought meetings with Washington officials for Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine, under a contract with\u00a0a recently-formed\u00a0Maryland firm\u00a0with opaque funding sources, the filings also show. Tymoshenko campaigned for Ukraine's presidency earlier this year but lost. On\u00a0July\u00a06, 2018, Livingston wrote to Washington officials and others and described\u00a0Tymoshenko as \"best suited to lead Ukraine in its ongoing battle with Russian military\u00a0and economic aggression.\" That same day, Livingston's company reported a yearlong, $50,000-per-month agreement to represent Innovative Technology & Business Consulting LLC. However, the disclosure contained no references to Tymoshenko. Public records show the company, also known as ITBC, was founded in Maryland in May 2018. Its\u00a0registered agent was a man\u00a0named Sergei Krasnitski, who\u00a0came from the same part of Ukraine as Tymoshenko, according to the Kyiv Post. When the paper contacted Krasnitski, he said in Russian,\u00a0\"I don't know what I can tell you,\"\u00a0and hung up, the news organization reported. Livingston told the newspaper ITBC\u00a0was\u00a0\"an American company comprised of a number of people concerned about the future of Ukraine, especially in these days of accelerating Russian aggression.\" The lobbyist said his firm would facilitate visits to the U.S. \"by various current and/or potential Ukrainian officials.\" That happened in December 2018, when Livingston's company arranged meetings in Washington\u00a0between Tymoshenko and U.S. officials. The sessions included a\u00a0meeting between Tymoshenko and Giuliani, FARA disclosures show. That meeting was coordinated by Bob McEwen, a former Republican House member from Ohio who worked as a paid consultant for Livingston's firm, a FARA filing\u00a0shows. A statement at the time by Tymoshenko's Fatherland political party said the meeting was focused on Ukraine's war with Russia and the sale of U.S.\u00a0weapons\u00a0\"to counter Russian aggression,\u201d BuzzFeed News reported earlier this week. However, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko asserted in that report\u00a0that the meeting\u00a0concluded with Giuliani inviting\u00a0Tymoshenko to discuss Hunter Biden's work for Burisma Holdings. BuzzFeed reported that former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko\u00a0asserted that it\u00a0concluded with Giuliani inviting\u00a0Tymoshenko to discuss Hunter Biden's work for Burisma Holdings. The Livingston Group and McEwen have continued to boost Tymoshenko this year as she campaigned for another term\u00a0as Ukraine's prime minister.\u00a0A few days before the parliamentary election in\u00a0July, the Western Journal, a conservative media outlet,\u00a0published an op-ed with McEwen's byline arguing she would be the best person to become Ukraine's prime minister. \"Put simply,\" McEwen wrote, \"there is no one in Ukraine who can match Yulia Tymoshenko in both experience and global connections.\" McEwen did not respond to a phone message seeking comment. Giuliani\u2019s business ties\u00a0to Ukraine stretch\u00a0back to at least 2008, when he\u00a0announced one of his companies would\u00a0advise a former boxing champion who was running to be mayor of the capital city of Kyiv. In 2017,\u00a0about a year\u00a0before Trump tapped Giuliani as his personal attorney, Giuliani Safety & Security\u00a0began working\u00a0for the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine. Press releases at the time described\u00a0the firm as a consultant for\u00a0Kharkiv's emergency response and security issues. Pavel Fuks, the wealthy Russian-Ukrainian developer who hired Giuliani's firm,\u00a0described him\u00a0as a \u201clobbyist\u201d for the city and for Ukraine. That\u00a0year Giuliani\u00a0gave a speech in Kyiv for the foundation of Victor Pinchuk, the billionaire behind the Ukrainian metal company Interpipe \u2013\u00a0one of the companies that is\u00a0part of the business coalition Livingston represented. Pinchuk was a major contributor to Trump's charitable foundation. Giuliani a foreign agent?:Trump-Ukraine scandal puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani's business ties. Is he a 'foreign agent'? Capital Hill Democrats have pushed for investigations into why Giuliani did not file\u00a0FARA disclosures of his efforts for Trump and his business in Ukraine. One\u00a0expert in foreign lobbying laws\u00a0told USA TODAY in October\u00a0that a government review\u00a0would make sense. \"This would seem to be a case that would be ripe for the DOJ to at least ask questions,\" said Josh Rosenstein, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who advises clients on FARA. Saying he has\u00a0nothing to hide, Livingston said he had not been contacted by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York about the Giuliani investigation. \"What Giuliani has done is his business,\" Livingston said. \"All of this is about nothing. I\u2019m not going to be indicted. There is nothing there. I don\u2019t have anything to be worried about. OK? \"If the Southern District of New York has any questions,\" he said, \"I\u2019m happy to talk to them.\" Contributing: Kevin Johnson, Kristine Phillips",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Two military veterans groups are planning to hand out T-shirts \"to honor the military service and sacrifice\" of the family of the late Sen. John McCain at the upcoming Fourth of July celebration on the National Mall where President Donald Trump plans to deliver an address. VoteVets\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a liberal political action committee that almost exclusively backs Democratic candidates, according to OpenSecrets\u00a0\u2013 is teaming up with Rags of Honor\u00a0\u2013 a screen printing shop that employs homeless veterans\u00a0\u2013 to give out the \"Big Bad John\" shirts depicting the USS John S. McCain. That ship was at the center of a recent controversy after it was revealed that the Navy was asked to move the destroyer bearing the\u00a0Arizona Republican's name when Trump visited Japan last month. Then-acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the White House military liaison had asked that the 7th fleet hide the ship from Trump \u2013 who was outspoken in his criticism of McCain\u00a0even after the veteran of the Vietnam War was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but the Navy ignored the request. Donald Trump:'I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be' 'I can\u2019t understand why':Mitt Romney criticizes Trump for attacks on the late John McCain \"Somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK?\" Trump told reporters when asked about the request. \"And they were well-meaning.\" \"I didn't know anything about it.\u00a0I would never have done that.\" Launched in 1994, the USS John S.\u00a0McCain was initially named for the senator's father and grandfather, both highly decorated admirals in the Navy. A month before the younger McCain's death last year,\u00a0the Pentagon added him as a namesake of the ship. Navy confirms:We were asked to keep USS John S. McCain out of sight during President Trump's visit USS John McCain controversy:Shanahan reached out to Cindy McCain The two veterans\u00a0groups behind the campaign said in a statement that the shirts will be given out by veterans to people taking part in the festivities on the National Mall.

When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place. The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, \"What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered.\" That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.

      "author": "",
      "content": "It's been a busy\u00a0week for those watching for updates on a\u00a0House Democrat impeachment investigation into Donald Trump, who has reportedly pressured a foreign leader to investigate 2020 opponent Joe Biden. And it's only Tuesday. Today the list of Democrats who have publicly supported an impeachment investigation into Trump has grown considerably, with tweets and statements of support pouring in. The president has had to defend himself against a whistleblower complaint alleging that he made an improper promise to Ukraine's leader and pressured the official to look into Biden and his son's involvement in Ukraine during the Obama administration. Here are five perspectives on impeachment from both sides of the aisle: Pelosi's stance on impeachment has evolved from cautious over the past several months as Democrats have pushed for formal impeachment proceedings. Pelosi said previously\u00a0in a statement that if the Trump administration continued to stonewall the whistleblower complaint investigation,\u00a0\u201cthey will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d Even as investigations into Trump's business dealings and relationships with foreign powers have been pursued, Pelosi has hesitated\u00a0in the past. More:Nancy Pelosi announces formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump over Ukraine scandal \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,\" Pelosi said to The Washington Post in March.\u00a0\"And he\u2019s just not worth it.\" But Pelosi announced\u00a0Tuesday evening that Democrats will\u00a0begin an\u00a0impeachment inquiry, after meeting with her caucus. \"The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\" Pelosi said. For Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman in Congress, the time to act is now. Building on her long-held stance that Trump needs to be removed from office, Ocasio-Cortez said on Tuesday \"In addition to impeachment, we must also pursue long-term changes to keep this from happening again.\" Biden also said that Congress will have \"no choice\" but to proceed with impeachment if the administration does not cooperate with investigations. Impeachment would be \"a tragedy of his own making,\" Biden said of Trump. More:Biden calls for Trump to face impeachment if he doesn't comply with Congressional inquiries Georgia Rep. John Lewis\u00a0announced a stance in favor of impeachment on Tuesday. \"I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\" Lewis said. One Democratic presidential candidate, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, is not with many of her opponents. She said on Fox and Friends Tuesday morning that impeachment would be \"terribly divisive for the country.\" \"Hyperpartisanship is one of the main things that is driving our country apart,\" Gabbard said. \"I think it's important to defeat Donald Trump, that's why I'm running for president, but I think it's the American people who need to make their voices heard in making that decision.\" James Comey, who was fired by Trump as the director of the FBI in 2017,\u00a0reiterated\u00a0similar feelings in an interview with\u00a0KCRA. \"I think the American people would be let off the hook if Donald Trump were impeached and removed from office, and a lot of his supporters would think some sort of coup had taken place,\" Comey said. He said rather than an impeachment, Americans need to \"show what we stand for.\" \"We need to take responsibility for this and vote next November and show that we have a certain set of values,\" Comey said. Even Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC's \"The View,\" has said Democrats should proceed out of sheer exhaustion from the conversation. \"Unleash the Kraken,\" McCain said on the show Tuesday. She said that if Democrats don't listen to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has cautioned against impeachment in the past, they will see political consequences for it. \"See what happens politically, because what happened with Clinton in the 90s really ended up hurting Republicans, I think, and many historians of politics believe that hit helped get Clinton re-elected,\" McCain said. In fact, Clinton's impeachment proceedings happened after he had already been elected for a second term. \"Just impeach him then, because quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing everybody bitch about it,\" McCain said. Though McCain is an outspoken critic of Trump, she denounced the spectacle that the Democratic Party has made of the relationship with Ukraine. \"I'm sick of hearing the infighting with\u00a0Democrats,\" McCain said. Trump and his political allies claim the impeachment conversation among Democrats is a ploy to get him out of office because they are worried about losing the 2020 election. \u201cIt's a witch hunt,\u201d Trump said Tuesday while at the UN General Assembly. \u201cThey have no idea how they stop me. The only way they can try is through impeachment.\u201d He later added, \u201cThey\u2019re going to lose the election.\u201d \u201cThey say it\u2019s a positive for me,\" Trump said. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican, tweeted Tuesday, \"Reminder: this is how Washington Democrats view impeachment. 'I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get re-elected.'\" Trump announced Tuesday he will release a transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian president tomorrow.",

      "content": "\"Purple Rain\" has no place at \u00a0President Donald Trump's\u00a0rally, a Prince spokesperson says. Trump came under fire from deceased musician Prince Rogers Nelson's estate when one of the singer's\u00a0most iconic tunes,\u00a0\"Purple Rain,\" was played\u00a0during the president's campaign rally in Minneapolis Thursday. According to Prince's official Twitter account, the president went back on a promise not to use the\u00a0musician's work. \"President Trump played Prince\u2019s 'Purple Rain'\u00a0tonight at a campaign event in Minneapolis despite confirming a year ago that the campaign would not use Prince\u2019s music,\" the tweet said. \"The Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs.\" The tweet included an image of a letter from Oct. 15, 2018, from lawyer Megan Newton regarding the estate's first request that\u00a0 Trump \"refrain from using Prince's 'Purple Rain,' or any other Prince music, in connection with Campaign rallies, or other Campaign events.\" \"Without admitting liability, and to avoid any future dispute, we write to confirm that the Campaign will not use Prince's music in connection with its activities going forward,\" Newton wrote. More:Prince died from 'exceedingly high' amount of fentanyl, experts say Prince isn't the only musician the Trump campaign has crossed. Pharrell Williams sent a cease-and-desist letter to Trump after the president played\u00a0Williams' 2014 smash hit \"Happy\" at a political event in the Midwest, just hours after nearly a dozen people\u00a0were\u00a0gunned down in a\u00a0Pittsburgh synagogue in October 2018. Aerosmith,\u00a0R.E.M. and Queen are among the other artists who have objected to the president's use of their music. Trump isn't\u00a0the only politician turned down by musicians with catchy songs. Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was co-opted by politicians like President Ronald Reagan and former GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole after it came out in 1984, forcing Springsteen to push back. And ABBA, Van Halen, Cyndi Lauper, Al Green, Eminem, Katrina and the Waves and more have all had to stop the music.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's former special envoy for Ukraine,\u00a0Kurt Volker,\u00a0testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Thursday, becoming the first official witness interviewed in the House's impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. Volker resigned last week after it revelations\u00a0 that he helped Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani make contact with Ukrainian officials, including top advisers to\u00a0President\u00a0Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky. Giuliani spent months in search of evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden used his office to steer a Ukrainian prosecutor away from a energy firm that had Biden's son, Hunter Biden, on its board. No evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son has been uncovered, but a\u00a0whistleblower's complaint alleged Trump still \"used the power of his office\" to pressure\u00a0Zelensky into digging up damaging information on Biden. Democrats say the summary of a July 25 call between Trump and\u00a0Zelensky corroborates the whistleblower's claims and shows that Trump used U.S. military aid\u00a0to Ukraine as leverage. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases More:'Hostile questions' on tap for Kurt Volker, Trump's former special envoy for Ukraine Here is what we know about Volker: According to his biography on the lobbying group BGR's website, Volker was a career member of the Senior Foreign Service with more than 20 years experience working on European policy. He served from 2008-2009 as the U.S. ambassador to NATO and, prior to that, he spent three years as the principal deputy assistant secretary\u00a0for European and Eurasian affairs at the State Department. He also spent four years working for the National Security Council on NATO and Western European affairs and two years working as a foreign policy adviser to former Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Early in his career he also worked as an intelligence analyst for the CIA. He currently serves as the executive director of Arizona State University's\u00a0McCain Institute for International Leadership, a role he's held since the institute opened in 2012. 'I was on the phone call':Pompeo acknowledges he was listening to Trump's phone call with Ukraine president Kelly Magsamen, a former national security and defense official in the Obama administration, told USA TODAY that Volker \"has a record of being a very serious guy\" and is \"not\u00a0necessarily what I would consider a Trumpian person.\" Magsamen said Volker is \"probably eager to clarify his role\" in the Ukraine affair and that he has a \"strong interest in salvaging his reputation.\" John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and has known Volker for over a decade, said Volker should be able to provide \"reasonable answers\" during his testimony on Capitol Hill. Perilous times for Trump:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Volker\u00a0was named as Trump's special envoy in July 2017\u00a0by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He volunteered for the post, working without pay. His\u00a0mission as special envoy was to help enforce a political settlement to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Herbst said Volker was focused on furthering U.S. foreign policy goals\u00a0\u2013 namely helping Ukraine secure the military assistance it needs to counter Russian aggression. According to the whistleblower's complaint, Volker also advised Ukrainian officials on \"how to 'navigate' the demands that the President had made of Zelensky.\" The whistleblower said Volker and other State Department officials spoke to Giuliani \"in an attempt to 'contain the damage'\" caused by \"Giuliani's\u00a0circumvention of national security decision making processes.\" More:Democrats threaten to subpoena White House for documents in impeachment inquiry Volker has not explained his decision to resign as Trump's envoy to Ukraine, which was first reported by ASU's State Press. He stepped down less than 24 hours after Giuliani shared a text message from Volker offering to set up a meeting with a top adviser to Zelensky. \"As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey\u00a0Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky,\"\u00a0the July 19 text message reads. \u201cI suggest we schedule a call together on Monday \u2013 maybe 10 am or 11 am Washington time?\" Giuliani shared his communications with Volker to show that he was not a rogue operative and that the State Department knew about his conversations with Ukrainian officials. \"The whistleblower falsely alleges that I was operating on my own.\u00a0Well, I wasn't operating on my own.\u00a0I went to meet Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aide at the request of the State Department,\" Giuliani told Fox News. \"I got a call from Volker.\u00a0Volker said, Would you meet with him?\u00a0It would be helpful to us.\u00a0We really want you to do it,'\" Giuliani said. \"Congress has asked me to appear on October 3 to provide testimony, and I will be complying with that request,\" Volker wrote a day after his resignation in an email to the McCain Institute's board of trustees, a portion of which was obtained by The Arizona Republic. \"Despite this news, after two years of great team work and dedication, Ukraine is stronger and closer to seeing its sovereignty and territorial integrity restored than before, and that's what's important!\" More:In note to McCain Institute board, Kurt Volker optimistic on Ukraine after quitting special envoy post Volker is expected to be asked a wide range of questions about his role in Ukraine and his contacts with Giuliani.

      "content": "'Thank you for the final time' George Collins, 58, said he took the train from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., on\u00a0Thursday morning to say thank you to Rep. Elijah Cummings one last time. Cummings,\u00a0who died Oct. 17, was lying\u00a0in state inside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday. Collins, a life-long Baltimore resident, would visit the congressman's office often. He said he last visited two weeks ago regarding legislation Cummings\u00a0signed on to co-sponsor that would help firefighters. Collins is a retired firefighter. \"I'm here for the last time to visit him at the office to say thank you for the final time,\" Collins said, adding that Cummings, who represented parts of Baltimore,\u00a0was always \"accessible, accountable and responsible.\" \"We're going to have a big hole in Baltimore, not only from politics and being a representative, but an individual who was a moral compass,\" Collins added. 'He has such big shoes to fill' Nancy Chavannes-Battle of Prince George's County, Maryland, said that she stood in line for nearly an hour and a half to say her last goodbyes to Cummings. The 52-year-old said that she \"had to make it a point to come down.\" \"He's done so much for us, so much for the state, so much for the country and it was really touching,\" she said, adding that she whispered a short prayer for the congressman to rest in piece. Wendy Bourque, of Howard County, Maryland, said she was a constituent of Cummings' and that she cried when she heard he died because she hadn't known\u00a0he was in poor health. \"I felt like he really represented us well,\" she said of Cummings. \"I hope that the future person that comes into his position does as well as or if not a better job than he did, which is probably going to be impossible. \"He has such big shoes to fill.\" 'He fought for all people' Anthony Jaby, 64, said he wanted to come pay his respects and honor the late congressman. Jaby, who is from Washington, D.C., and an Air Force veteran, said that Cummings stood \"up against anybody for the truth and to help people.\" \"He didn't just fight for black people, he fought for all people,\" Jaby said of Cummings, who was outspoken on civil rights. 'Enough is enough':The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings 'He is a legend' Denise Harper, who is also from D.C., said that one of her biggest regrets is\u00a0that she never got to meet\u00a0Cummings. She said that after seeing him on TV and listening to his remarks, she felt like she knew him. \"He is a legend, he was a humble man,\" she said, \"more politicians on both sides of the aisle should take a cue from him. \"He knew how to bring people together, he never forgot who he was in Congress for, who he was there to serve,\" she continued. \"He remained true to his roots.\" Elijah Cummings' funeral:Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton to attend Elijah Cummings' Baltimore funeral 'Take a page from his playbook' Pat Brew of King George, Va., said that she appreciates all the congressman did in regards to civil rights. \"We were in a very different place, 30, 40 years ago,\" Brew said. \"He remembers that\u00a0place and he did all that\u00a0he could to make sure that we didn't regress as a nation back to that place. I hope that the young representatives and senators\u00a0and everyone would take a page from his playbook and to continue to do the same and fight for civil rights.\" The closing ceremony before public viewing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,\u00a0stood in front of\u00a0Cummings\u2019 casket as the\u00a0Senate wreath was presented. Both men then went and each shook hands with the Maryland Democrat's widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings. Each gave her a hug before returning to their seats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then stood in front of Cummings\u2019 casket as the House wreath was presented. They also embraced Rockeymoore. After the service was done, Rockeymoore walked up to Cummings\u2019 casket and prayed with her hands in the air. She then walked away, holding back tears. 'Everybody's crushed':Baltimore mourns the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings Hoyer: Cummings'\u00a0mission was to stop abuse of public trust House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Cummings saw his work in Congress as a \"trust from providence\" and that it was his mission to\u00a0\"ensure that everyone who serves in public office is held to account for the abuse of that trust.\" \"The public trust for him was a\u00a0sacred thing. Like the biblical prophet Elijah, he saw wrongdoing and spent his life working to banish it from our land,\" he said. Hoyer was one of the first speakers to go hug Rockeymoore after his remarks. Clyburn: 'A passion for justice' To honor Cummings, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., quoted from the biblical Book of Micah, which says, \"The Lord requires us to do justly, act mercifully and walk humbly.\" \"Elijah E. Cummings personified this directive in his service and in the core of his living,\" Clyburn said.\u00a0\"Elijah had a passion for justice:\u00a0justice for those who are underserved;\u00a0justice for those who are undercut; and justice for those who are underestimated.\" Bass: Cummings was seen as a 'quiet giant' \"The Congressional Black Caucus is a close-knit family. Thursday, Oct. 17, the CBC lost a member of our family,\" said Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., the CBC chairwoman. \"Elijah Cummings was respected, revered and viewed as a quiet giant within the caucus,\" Bass said. \"We watched him lead the Oversight and Reform Committee. We watched his heartfelt passion as he fought for the rights of children separated from their families, as he fought for everyone to have health care and medications that are affordable, and as he fought for everyone to have the right, and access to vote.\" Meadows discusses\u00a0'unexpected friendship' with Cummings Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., passionately talked about his friendship with Cummings, his eyes glistening as he held back tears. He said he was \"privileged enough\"\u00a0to be able to call Cummings \"a dear friend.\" \"Some had classified it as an unexpected friendship,\"\u00a0Meadows said of their bipartisan relationship in a highly partisan era. \"But for those of that know Elijah, it\u2019s not unexpected.\" Meadows said \"perhaps this place and this country would be better served with a few more unexpected friendships. I know I\u2019ve been blessed by one.\" Photos:Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings dies at 68 Schumer: A 'kind, caring and honorable man' Schumer said\u00a0Cummings \u201cwas strong, very strong, when necessary.\u201d But he was \u201calso kind, and caring, and honorable,\u201d Schumer, the Senate minority leader,\u00a0added. \u201cUniversally respected and admired, in a divided time. His voice could shake mountains, stir the most cynical hearts, inspiring us all to be better.\" \"A sharecropper\u2019s son, born and raised in Baltimore, Elijah Cummings never forgot where he came from and never lost sight of where he wanted his country to go,\" he said. McConnell:\u00a0Cummings 'truly has gone home' \"Elijah Cummings did not just represent Baltimore, he embodied it,\u201d said McConnell, the Senate majority leader. McConnell said Cummings\u2019 commitment to Baltimore\u00a0\u2013\u00a0much of which lies in\u00a0his congressional district \u2013 was clearly on display in 2015 during the riots that followed the death of a black man in police custody. \u201cBy day, the congressman was here in the Capitol, working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night, he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace,\" McConnell recalled. \"Here's what he said: 'Let's go home. Let's all go home,'\" he said. \"Now, our distinguished colleague truly has gone home.\" Pelosi calls Cummings 'master of the House' \"Elijah Cummings: son of sharecroppers, master of the House,\" said\u00a0Pelosi, a Baltimore native, referencing Cummings'\u00a0rise from humble beginnings to the halls of Congress. \"It is my official, and personal, and sad honor to welcome Chairman Elijah and all who loved him to this celebration of his life.\" Pelosi spoke of Cummings' commitment to, and love for, the House of Representatives in which he served. She cited his desire to mentor freshman lawmakers because, he told her, \"I love their potential and I want to help them realize it.\" She said Cummings understood that members of Congress would \"have to face the judgment of history and that we are part of a long and honorable heritage of our democracy.\" Original story: WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Elijah Cummings\u00a0laid\u00a0in state on Thursday within the U.S. Capitol where he served for 23 years as a congressman, becoming one of the few African-Americans\u00a0to be so honored. Current and former members of Congress assembled before Cummings' flag-draped coffin was brought into the\u00a0National Statuary Hall\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a large, domed room that once served as the House chamber\u00a0\u2013 followed by his widow,\u00a0Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party. Other family members dressed in gray and black entered next, some staring straight ahead and others clutching each other's arms. Cummings, a Democrat whose district included\u00a0large sections of Baltimore, died last week\u00a0at age 68 from complications related to longstanding health issues. A day after his death, Pelosi announced\u00a0that Cummings would lie in state in Statuary Hall. An hour ahead of the service, guests began slowly coming in, such as journalists April Ryan, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young, wearing a dark blue suit, was also among the first few to arrive. Members of the House then entered, followed by senators. Several 2020 presidential candidates were among them. And joining the lawmakers was former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. A low buzz of whispers and chatting filled Statuary Hall ahead of the memorial service. But as Pelosi led in both parties\u2019 leadership and designated speakers, the room fell quiet. Small huddles among different lawmakers began to form, as they waited for Cummings\u2019 casket to come into the hall. At one point, Pelosi and Schumer walked away from their colleagues for a quick chat. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus entered Statuary Hall Thursday in single file and wearing kente cloth scarves as they prepared to honor Cummings, a former caucus chairman who\u00a0was\u00a0outspoken on issues of civil rights and voter access. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif, led the processions followed by civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis. A solemn silence fell over the hall as Cummings\u2019 casket was brought in around 11:15 a.m. EDT. Elijah Cummings' Baltimore:'Everybody's crushed': Baltimore mourns the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings Cummings was the first black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, according to the CBC. Two African-Americans who were not elected officials have lain in honor in the Capitol rotunda\u00a0\u2013 civil rights icon Rosa Parks and Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut Lying in state in the Capitol is a rare\u00a0honor reserved for the nation's \"most eminent citizens,\" according to the Architect of the Capitol. Just 31 people have been granted that honor, including 12 former presidents. Last year, preacher Billy Graham was laid in honor, and former President George H.W. Bush and Sen. John McCain were laid in state. Those three were the first to be so honored since Sen. Daniel Inouye in 2012. Normally, the remains are placed in the Capitol rotunda, which the Architect of the Capitol says\u00a0\"has been considered the most suitable place for the nation to pay final tribute,\" and members of the public wait in long lines that extend outside the\u00a0Capitol to pay their respects. It is unclear if National Statuary Hall has been used previously for those lying in state within the Capitol. Statuary Hall is located just south of the rotunda, and it is also a large space with a domed roof. The room served as the chamber where the House of Representatives gathered from 1819 to 1857.\u00a0It contains 35 of the 100 statues submitted by the states for display in the Capitol. Cummings' funeral will be held Friday at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where he worshipped for nearly 40 years. On Wednesday, mourners paid respects to Cummings as his body lay in repose at Morgan State University, a historically black college in Cummings' district. Cummings served on the school's Board of Regents for 19 years. Enough is enough':The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings Before his death, the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman had been leading several investigations into President Donald Trump and his administration. Cummings\u00a0drew Trump's ire as his committee prepared to subpoena the communications of the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. He also sparred with Trump after Cummings\u00a0sharply criticized the administration's handling of detained migrants. In response,\u00a0Trump called the congressman a \"brutal bully\" and denounced\u00a0Baltimore as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\" At a National Press Club luncheon in August, Cummings said he wished Trump would visit\u00a0Baltimore and\u00a0denounced the president's use of inflammatory rhetoric. \"Those in the highest levels of government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\" he said. \"It only creates more division among us and severely limits our ability to work together for the common good. As a country, we finally must say that enough is enough.\" Contributing: The Associated Press and Deborah Barfield Berry More:How Elijah Cummings' unexpected death could affect the impeachment inquiry",

The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the dates and locations of the debates on Friday, and will release further details including the moderators and format next year. The first presidential debate will be Sept. 29, 2020, at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Ind. The only scheduled vice presidential debate will be hosted by the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on\u00a0Oct. 7, 2020. A second presidential debate is set for Oct. 15, 2020, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The third and final presidential debate will\u00a0be hosted by Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 22, 2020, which is less than two weeks before\u00a0Election Day. Election 2020:An interactive guide of who is running for president All four scheduled debates will be hosted in states\u00a0won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. The first debate of the season will also be the first presidential debate ever hosted at Notre Dame, school officials said. The university is located in one of just four counties in Indiana that voted\u00a0Democratic in 2016. That county also contains South Bend, the city where 2020 Democratic\u00a0presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is mayor. Salt Lake City, where the only vice presidential debate will take place, is\u00a0likewise a region in the vastly Republican state of Utah that voted Democratic in 2016. A 2016 Republican primary debate in Salt Lake was canceled after Trump said he would not participate. Ann Arbor, Mich., voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, as did Nashville. Belmont University also hosted a 2008 debate between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain. Re-election campaign:\u00a0Trump lashes out at Democrats over impeachment inquiry at Minneapolis rally Each 90-minute debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET and run without commercials, the commission said. The commission sets criteria for appearing in a general election debate, which includes that candidates must qualify to appear on enough state ballots to have a mathematical chance of securing the\u00a0electoral college votes needed to win the election (at least 270),\u00a0and that they must receive an average of at least 15% in five selected national polls. The criteria allow\u00a0for qualifying candidates outside the two major parties to participate in debates, though no third-party candidate has qualified in recent years. Democratic and Republican nominees will be announced in July and August of 2020, respectively.\u00a0Election Day is Nov. 3, 2020. In the meantime, the Democratic National Committee's\u00a0criteria continue to narrow the field for the party's primary debate stage, and the president has said he will not debate GOP primary opponents.

The service for Atatiana Jefferson is planned for 11 a.m. at Concord Church in Dallas. Jefferson, 28, was killed in the early morning of Oct. 12 when a Fort Worth police officer shot her through the window of her house, where she was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew. The officer, Aaron Dean, resigned from the force and was charged with murder. Amid power outages affecting 450,000 by Pacific Gas & Electric in northern California Wednesday to avoid the risk of sparking wildfires, two additional utility companies alerted their subscribers of possible outages. Southern California Edison said it could cut power Thursday to more than 308,000 customers and San Diego Gas & Electric warned of power shutoffs to about 42,000 customers. About 875,000 people could be affected.\u00a0Pacific Gas & Electric,\u00a0the state's largest utility,\u00a0was blamed for igniting some of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in California history.\u00a0PG&E said\u00a0the\u00a0shutoffs will last about 48 hours. Former NFL star Kellen Winslow II will head back to court Thursday after his first rape trial ended in a mistrial on\u00a0eight of the 12 charges against him.\u00a0Back in June,\u00a0a jury convicted Winslow, 36, of three charges,\u00a0including felony rape of a 58-year-old homeless woman on the side of the road in May 2018.\u00a0But after the jury\u00a0deadlocked on six felony and two misdemeanor\u00a0charges, San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan's office\u00a0faced a choice \u2014 either try those eight charges again with a different jury or drop some or all of them.\u00a0\u00a0Additional felony convictions could keep Winslow, who has separated\u00a0from wife, behind bars for the rest of his life.\u00a0He remains defiant\u00a0about his innocence. Like the strange smile on the \"Mona Lisa,\" much about Leonardo Da Vinci remains an enigma. A new exhibit at the Louvre,\u00a0opening Thursday and marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master's death, tries to fill in the picture of the incomparable artist and thinker. More than 10 years in the making, the exhibit brings together 160 Da Vinci masterpieces, studies, sketches and other works to pay homage to a man curator Vincent Delieuvin called \"a universal genius.\" The exhibit runs through Feb. 24, 2020.

      "content": "DES MOINES \u2013 It was the beginning of an outdoor town hall for Pete Buttigieg in mid-October, and the\u00a0shivering crowd watched Matt McCoy jump\u00a0on stage to help introduce the Democratic presidential candidate. McCoy, a Polk County supervisor who has endorsed the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, was on the elevated platform for mere moments before he compared\u00a0Buttigieg to President Barack Obama. The crowd cheered\u00a0so loudly in response\u00a0they appeared to temporarily forget the 30-degree temperature. \"He was going to launch his campaign from Iowa,\" McCoy said in recalling Obama's 2007 effort\u00a0in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\u00a0\"And here we are again tonight with that feeling in the air. That opportunity for change.\" As the field of 2020 presidential hopefuls descends on Iowa this weekend for several cattle call events,\u00a0many are\u00a0seeking to stand out at Friday's Liberty and Justice Celebration.\u00a0Buttigieg, in particular, is looking to break out at the\u00a0Iowa Democratic Party fundraiser, once known as the \"Jefferson-Jackson Dinner,\" by drawing parallels to Obama's historic Iowa campaign. The dinner is credited with propelling Obama toward his first-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in early 2008, a point that Buttigieg's campaign reminded his supporters. \"It was the moment that changed everything for the Obama campaign and, ultimately, for the country,\" read a Buttigieig fundraising email this week from\u00a0Larry Grisolano, a former adviser for Obama in 2007 who now works for the Buttigieg campaign. \"That same moment for Pete, and for America, is this Friday night.\" Buttigieg himself has\u00a0nodded to Obama's first Iowa campaign for months. \"I'm asking you to spread something that I know went out of style a little bit in American politics: And it's hope,\" Buttigieg said at the Oct. 12 town hall where McCoy spoke. \"Hope\" became synonymous with the former president's 2008 race to the White House. \"Because running for office is an act of hope. Organizing for somebody running for office is an act of hope. Voting is an act of hope,\" Buttigieg said in October. People who show up to Buttigieg's events in Iowa often draw Obama comparisons. According to those potential caucusgoers, Buttigieg is uniquely suited to bring people together following\u00a0the presidency of Donald Trump. \"We were for Obama, and we're for Pete,\"\u00a0said Connie Bergman, a 76-year-old retiree from Ames who went to a Buttigieg town hall on the Iowa State University campus on Oct. 16 with her husband, Al. Buttigieg told the Des Moines Register in an interview that he's heard the\u00a0Obama comparison on the trail and it's \"flattering\" because he believes Obama \"was a great president.\" \"I think there's some overlap, certainly, between the style that he brought, and what I'm trying to offer,\" said Buttigieg, who\u00a0campaigned for Obama in Iowa in 2007. Buttigieg said there are obvious similarities with what he needs to do in Iowa and what Obama accomplished back then. Buttigieg, who has had to overcome a lack of name recognition at the start of the election cycle, has climbed the polls and become a top fundraiser. Buttigieg now has one of the largest operations in Iowa, with\u00a0more than 100 staffers in the state\u00a0and more than 20 field offices. \"Another thing I have in common with him,\" Buttigieg said in referencing Obama.\u00a0\"As somebody who's not been on the national political scene for a very long time ...\u00a0the best way that my campaign can demonstrate that we're ready to win, and ultimately win the presidency, is to start with a very good showing here in Iowa.\" George\u00a0Rankin, 55, who traveled to Iowa from Washington State in September with his\u00a0wife, Emilie, for the Polk County Steak Fry, ended up following Buttigieg that weekend for the candidate's\u00a0multi-day bus tour. The couple traveled to Iowa in 2007 to see\u00a0Obama. \"He's got that 'it' factor that Obama had,\" said the 65-year-old Emilie\u00a0Rankin. \"... an ability to describe issues in a way that people can understand, but in depth.\" The Rankins think Buttigieg can win Iowa like Obama, and they highlighted that no one back then knew who Obama was, either. \u201cWe had an Obama sticker ...,\" George Rankin recalled about their appreciation for Obama in 2007.\u00a0\u201cAnd someone came up and said, \u2018What\u2019s an Obama?\u2019\u00a0So\u00a0we\u2019ve been through this process.\u201d Barbara Rodriguez covers health care and politics for the Register.

The \"Late Show\" host detailed the heated exchange in a NSFW portion of\u00a0Monday's monologue, where he\u00a0sarcastically declared\u00a0the married couple to be \"America's true enemies.\" Trump's Twitter fingers began firing after Legend was featured in\u00a0MSNBC's final installment of\u00a0Lester Holt's \"Justice For All\" series, a report about the criminal justice system. Legend discussed Free America, a campaign he founded which hopes to \"transform America\u2019s criminal justice system\" according to its website.

      "author": "",
      "content": "PHOENIX \u2013 Hours before President Donald Trump announced the death of the leader of ISIS, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party said in public remarks that Trump had aligned himself with the terrorist organization. The Arizona Republican Party hit Felecia Rotellini on Tuesday for her ill-timed remark at Saturday's \"We the Voters Conference\" hosted by\u00a0the Citizens Clean Elections Commission in downtown\u00a0Phoenix. During a panel discussion, Rotellini explained why she thought people will show up to vote in 2020. \"Another reason why\u00a0people are going to vote (is)\u00a0because Donald Trump is manipulating the\u00a0White House and has aligned himself with ISIS and Saudi Arabia,\" Rotellini said. State Republican Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who was part of the same panel, immediately interjected. \"I have to say that is not true. That is not true,\" Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue. Who is Alexander Vindman:The White House expert who testified about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call? The remarks came as American forces began a raid in Syria that trapped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist, who\u00a0blew himself up in a tunnel, along with three children,\u00a0according to Trump's telling of al-Baghdadi's final moments. \"It was a poor choice of words,\" Matt Grodsky, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, said in an email to The Arizona Republic on Tuesday. Grodsky said the comments stemmed from\u00a0\"President Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia, and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region.\" Ward, who has had more than a few\u00a0cringe-inducing remarks of her own, hit back at Rotellini for what she viewed as slanderous comments. \"It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world\u2019s most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States,\"\u00a0she said. \"While fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they\u2019re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality.\" Jeffrey Epstein:Private pathologist questions whether Epstein died by suicide Rotellini's comment came as people across the political spectrum wrestled with\u00a0Trump's decision to withdraw at least some troops\u00a0from northern Syria after the Turkish offensive into the\u00a0territory previously held by Kurds aligned with the U.S. Democrats and Republicans alike said the move empowered ISIS and sent a bad message to U.S. allies. Trump gained a measure of redemption with the announcement Sunday that al-Baghdadi was dead. The credit has proven fleeting for the administration, amid reports that Trump's withdrawal orders forced the Pentagon to speed up the long-planned raid on al-Baghdadi's location. The New York Times reported that U.S. officials determined his whereabouts with\u00a0a tip and collaboration with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials. Follow Ronald J.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, stood by comparing President Donald Trump's recent North Carolina rally to a \"Nuremberg rally\" -- under questioning from Meghan McCain on The View -- adding that those who partook in the \"send her back\" chants should be held responsible. O'Rourke criticized the president for his racist comments calling on four congresswomen of color to \"go back\" to their countries. The four progressive Democrats, Reps., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, have condemned Trump's language as racist. All four congresswomen, who are colloquially known as the \"Squad,\" are U.S. citizens and three were born in the U.S.\u00a0Omar immigrated to the United States from Somalia over 20 years ago and is a naturalized citizen. \"Asking four women of color to 'go back' to their own country, and then connect it with everything else that he's doing --\u00a0the press as the enemy of the people. There is only one\u00a0path that that will take us down,\" O'Rourke said during an appearance on The View\u00a0Tuesday. Poll:Many Americans have never heard of 'the Squad' and many don't see them favorably More:Trump employs familiar tactic in attacks on 'Squad': Distract and shift spotlight using racial rhetoric Trump has continued to bash the four congresswomen and repeatedly denied that\u00a0his comments are racist. During a North Carolina rally last Wednesday, chants of \"send her back\" broke out while Trump was criticizing Omar. Trump initially denounced the chant, but has since called those at his rally \"patriots.\" On Monday, O'Rourke said he believes Trump is a racist and that the North Carolina rally was an \"impromptu Nuremberg rally,\" which was an annual rally for the Nazi Party. \"What we saw in North Carolina last week was almost an impromptu Nuremberg rally, inciting hatred and, ultimately, I think implicit in that, is violence against people based on the color of their skin, based on their religion, based on their difference from the majority of Americans,\" he told ABC News. However, View co-host Meghan McCain challenged O'Rourke on his comments comparing Trump's rally to a\u00a0Nazi rally. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Trump supporters, comparing them to Nazis in Nuremberg, that sounds extreme to me as well,\" she said.\u00a0\"When Democrats come on here and wax poetic about extremism\u2014I\u2019m not saying Trump isn\u2019t doing it, but you\u2019re calling everybody who was in that North Carolina rally a Nazi.\" \"From my standpoint, it seems like the left is pretty extreme as well,\" she added. McCain, a conservative\u00a0and daughter of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, is a frequent and longtime critic of the president. Although O'Rourke said he did not call \"everyone\" who was at Trump's rally a Nazi, he did say those who chanted should take responsibility for their actions. \u201cWe all have accountability for our actions and everyone who shouted to send them back is responsible for that as well,\" he said to cheers from the studio audience at The View. McCain quickly responded asking about the people in the rally that didn't chant. More:NAACP calls for Trump's impeachment saying he's 'unfit to serve as the president' More:Trump says he'll win Minnesota in 2020 because of Rep. Ilhan Omar \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to win over some of these people that voted for Obama and then voted for Trump again,\" she said.\u00a0\u201cYou have to understand how it looks for people in the middle, thinking that maybe I don\u2019t agree with everything that the left is saying so automatically you\u2019re Nazis?\u201d \u201cI don't care who you voted for last time,\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded to McCain. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Trump supporter or a Republican. You\u2019re an American first before you are anything else and I call you to this country\u2019s greatness.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the 2016 election, labeled half of Trump's supporters as \"deplorable\"\u00a0during the last presidential cycle. Trump's campaign seized on Clinton's characterization of his supporters and repeatedly criticized her for it. In her 2017 book \"What Happened,\" Clinton said\u00a0that the incident was one of the factors behind\u00a0her loss to Trump. On Twitter, Trump's 2020 campaign criticized O'Rourke's Nuremberg comparison, saying that it's a ploy to align himself with the \"Squad\" of\u00a0the four progressive Democratic\u00a0congresswomen Trump has been feuding with for more than a week. \"Beto O\u2019Rourke campaigned for president in Mexico, dissed the American flag as a damaging symbol, and now smears thousands of patriotic Americans as Nazis,\" Trump War Room, which is managed by the president's reelection campaign, wrote in a tweet. \"He wants to be part of The Squad so badly, but they will never let him in!\" O'Rourke replied, saying that he still believes that Trump is a racist and chanting \"send them back\" is also racist. \"I will not apologize for saying so,\" he wrote in a tweet. \"But I believe Americans\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014are ready to rise above Trump's bigotry. And I believe, together, we will.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "author": "",
      "content": "PHOENIX \u2013 A festival in Gilroy, California.\u00a0A Walmart in El Paso, Texas. A bustling night spot in Dayton, Ohio. The shootings followed much of the tragic, familiar pattern: Outpouring of grief for the victims, a search for a reason. Investigators have said the motive in each case remains unclear, but the recent shootings raise new questions about whether victims were targeted\u00a0\u2014 not for random violence or as the object of some\u00a0perceived grudge\u00a0\u2014 but because of their race or ethnicity. While\u00a0police in Gilroy say they still have yet to establish a definitive motive, the shooter is believed to have posted a reference to an 1890 novel that espouses racist ideology. Three people died in the attack, and more than 16 were wounded. In El Paso, police say they believe the shooter, a white man, posted a hate-filled racist missive online and traveled to largely Hispanic El Paso to target\u00a0his victims. In Dayton, most of the victims were black. While the shootings would not be the first to target people for their race, they arrive at a time when the nation grapples with the idea of white nationalism, and with political tensions that have emerged from racist remarks and anti-immigrant rhetoric from\u00a0the president and others. El Paso County Sheriff Richard Wiles, in a post online, summed up the fear succinctly:\u00a0\"This Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics.\" Those conclusions add a layer of shock to the national reaction, as some wonder whether more people will find themselves amid a shooting not just because of where they are, but who they are. \"As a brown person, a Latino in a mixed-race marriage, you do feel you have a target on your back,\" said Jaime Casap, a Phoenix resident and a nationally recognized education consultant in the tech industry. Similar\u00a0fears were\u00a0echoed in El Paso. \"The people who want to build a wall, the militia, recent visits from Steve Bannon and Donald Trump Jr. are attracting white supremacists to El Paso who might want to do us harm,\" said Cemelli de Aztlan. Terror motive:FBI investigating Gilroy festival shooting as domestic terrorism attack Who is the El Paso shooter?:Investigators search for links, motive in anti-immigrant screed That America is becoming more diverse is well documented. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that racial and ethnic minorities will outnumber white people\u00a0in 25 years. That the tide of white nationalism is on the rise\u00a0is also well documented. In 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 892 hate groups across the nation. In 2018, there were 1,015, a 14%\u00a0increase in just three years. Systemic violence against minority groups is ingrained in American history. Black people\u00a0both during and after slavery were subject to mob justice and widespread violence.\u00a0In the mostly forgotten\u00a01919\u00a0\"Red Summer\" , historians believe,\u00a0more than 250 African Americans were killed in at least 25 riots across the U.S. by white mobs that were never punished. Fears of violence take on a new significance\u00a0in an era of mass shooters with military-style weapons. Casap said he is particularly concerned that the levels of rhetoric coming from the White House are emboldening racists. But that could\u00a0ultimately have a positive side to it. \"We've never taken on race in this country,\"\u00a0Casap said. \"If I told you in 2012 I was discriminated against, you'd say, 'Come on, we have a black president. We're past race.' Today, you'd believe me. It's out there, and now we need to deal with it.\" He said one way of dealing with it is to call it what it is. \"The best news I heard all day is\u00a0the FBI calling this (El Paso) domestic terrorism, because now you have to investigate where that came from and find its root causes.\" Briana Valencia, a 22-year-old political science student at Glendale Community College,\u00a0is part of the generation that has grown up with mass shootings as\u00a0their reality. Seemingly random shootings in movie theaters, schools and churches have taught her to look for escape routes whenever ever she goes out. She said she began avoiding large gatherings after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded 422 more at a music festival in Las Vegas two years ago. After Saturday's massacre in El Paso, she feels even more vulnerable. \"Now, I'm even more on edge because I'm a Latina,\" she said. \"I have a bigger target on my back.\" \"I can't really understand how someone can target someone just because they were born,\" she said. \"I'm really scared something is going to happen here.\" Nationally, the rhetoric turned against the shooter's apparent motivations but not always clearly. At the White House Monday,\u00a0President Donald Trump said,\u00a0\"Our nation must condemn racism,\u00a0bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated.\" But the same day,\u00a0Trump tweeted\u00a0that the shootings could help lead to \"desperately needed immigration reform.\" Blanca Chavira, an El Paso mom and Girl Scout leader, worries about the city going through another shooting incident. \"As they say, this does not define El Paso but we thought that this could never happen in El Paso and look how it happened in an instant,\" she said. \"It is extremely scary.\" She added, \"We should not have to feel this way.\" Rep. Daniel Hernandez, a Democrat who represents southern Arizona, said it was incumbent upon Republicans, particularly Gov. Doug Ducey and Republican U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, to take an active role in countering racist rhetoric. \"They need to do what John McCain and Jeff Flake did and say this is not acceptable. \u2026 We have good people. We need to stand up for our values,\" he said. Administration response:Donald Trump suggests linking gun control legislation to immigration laws However, Arizona state Rep. Jennifer Longdon, a Phoenix Democrat who is paralyzed from a gun violence incident 15 years ago, was unsure whether it's too late to find those better angels. \"I\u2019m afraid we've crossed a Rubicon, and I don't think we can come back,\" she said by phone from Nashville, where she was attending a National Conference of State Legislators conference that included a workshop on gun violence. \"There was a time when this would happen and everything would stop. No one was willing to accept it. We've had two shootings in 18 hours, and the world hasn't stopped. Is this now part of our American fabric? Is this now who we are?\" Follow John D'Anna on Twitter: @azgreenday. Contributing:\u00a0Maria Cortes Gonzalez,\u00a0El Paso Times.",

      "content": "Meghan McCain is opening up about a \"horrendous\" miscarriage she recently suffered. \"The View\" co-host, 34,\u00a0revealed in an op-ed for the\u00a0New York Times Friday that she lost a pregnancy weeks ago, writing, \"To the end of my days I will remember this child.\" \"My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone,\" she writes. \"I loved my baby, and I always will.\" McCain, who married\u00a0conservative pundit Ben Domenech in November 2017, said she could sense her pregnancy\u00a0before visiting the doctors, the same way she knew she was miscarrying. She got confirmation she was losing her child \"at the worst possible time,\" she writes, ahead of a glossy photo shoot for her\u00a0ABC talk show.

But inside, I am dying. Inside, my baby is dying.\" The TV personality says she spent a lot of time\u00a0blaming herself for not being able to carry her pregnancy to full term. \"I blamed my age, I blamed my personality. I blamed everything and anything a person could think of,\" McCain says, including her \"high-pressure, high-visibility, high-stress\" job on the daytime talk show.\u00a0\"This, I told myself, is the reason my body is a rock-strewn wasteland in which no child may live.\" To make matters worse,\u00a0McCain says her brief absence from \"The View\" sparked speculation about her whereabouts, taking away from her time to privately mourn. \"This was not supposed to be public knowledge. I have had my share of public grief and public joy,\" McCain writes. \"I wish this grief \u2013 the grief of a little life begun and then lost \u2013 could remain private.\" She continues: \"What followed was a deep opening of shame.\" More:ABC responds after Meghan McCain reportedly considers quitting 'The View' McCain credits her faith with reminding her that \"life and death are beyond our power.\" \"I am not hiding anymore\u2026Women need to be able to speak about this publicly, without the stigma and the lack of knowledge that pervades the issue,\" she says.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 When asked about the difference between former Sen. John McCain and President Donald Trump criticism of their political opponents,\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham angrily told reporters, \"I don't remember John McCain having to go through this crap every day.\" Graham made the remark when CNN's Manu Raju asked him\u00a0how much the Republican Party had changed in light of the \"send her back\" chant that Trump supporters leveled at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., at a North Carolina rally on Wednesday. Raju contrasted that with how\u00a0McCain famously defended his Democratic opponent in the 2008 presidential race, then-Sen. Barack Obama, from a woman at a rally\u00a0who said she did not trust Obama because he was \"an Arab.\" \"No ma'am,\" McCain said at that Oct. 2008 rally\u00a0before\u00a0taking the microphone from the audience member. \"He's a decent, family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\" Earlier at that\u00a0rally in Lakeville, Minnesota, another man told McCain, \"We're scared of an Obama presidency.\" \"I want to be president of the United States and obviously I do not want Sen. Obama to be,\" McCain responded. \"But I have to tell you, he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared as president of the United States.\" That response drew boos from some members of\u00a0the audience. \"I was proud of John,\" Graham said Thursday. \"My differences with President Obama were real but I never doubt that he loved the country.\" The South Carolina Republican was a close friend of McCain, who died in August 2018. \"President Trump would never do that,\" Raju said. \"He took a different tack. He's fighting back,\" Graham said. But he said he didn't remember \"anybody treating John McCain the way they're treating Trump. I don't remember John McCain having to go through this crap every day, all the time.\" \"Something I have learned: If you are a Republican nominee for President \u2013\u00a0or President \u2013 you will be accused of being a racist.,\" Graham tweeted later on Thursday. \"John Lewis compared John McCain\u2019s campaign to being like that of George Wallace. It comes with the territory unfortunately.\" The day after McCain's 2008 rally in Minnesota, Rep. John Lewis. D-Ga., said he was \"deeply disturbed by the negative tone of the McCain-Palin campaign\" and accused them \"sowing the seeds of hate and division,\" comparing it to the \"atmosphere of hate\" created by segregationist Gov. George Wallace. Later the same night. Lewis issued a clarification, which said it was\u00a0not his intention to \"compare Sen. John McCain or Gov. Sarah Palin to George Wallace.\" \"I am glad that Sen. McCain has taken some steps to correct divisive speech at his rallies,\" Lewis said, apparently in light of McCain's comments the day before. Trump has faced heavy criticism this week following tweets that told four progressive congresswomen of color to \"go back\" to their\u00a0countries of origin and fix the problems there before\u00a0\"telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.\" At his rally Wednesday, Trump said Omar, along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, \"hate our country\" and, \"If they don't like it, let them leave.\" All four women are U.S. citizens. When Trump went after Omar\u00a0\u2013 who was born in Somalia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the crowd began to chant, \"send her back. Though Trump did not object to the chanting at the time, on Thursday he told reporters, \"I wasn't happy with that message.\" \"Let me be clear, my beef is with policy, not personality,\" Graham said Thursday when asked about the chants. \"All of these congressmen won their elections. They're American citizens. This is their home as much as mine. \"I believe their policies will change America for the worse, and that's the debate for me.\" Graham also told reporters he did not believe Trump was being racist with his comments, which he compared to the 1960s refrain of \"love it or leave it\" that was often leveled against protesters opposed to the Vietnam War. \"A\u00a0Somali refugee embracing Trump would not have been asked to go back,\" Graham said. \"If you're a racist you want everybody from Somalia to go back because they're black or they're Muslim.\" Somalia was one of the nations in each version of Trump's controversial travel ban. Before his death, McCain was one Trump's fiercest Republicans critics. In 2016 he told The New Yorker that Trump had \"fired up the crazies.\" \"We have a very extreme element within our Republican Party,\"\u00a0McCain said. \"Now he galvanized them\" and \"really got them activated.\"",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne Terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who the president said was killed during a special forces raid in Syria, had reportedly been the captor and tormentor of Arizona's Kayla Mueller, who was taken hostage in 2013. \u201cWhat this man did to Kayla \u2013 he kidnapped her,\u201d her father Carl Mueller, his voice choking, told The Arizona Republic on Sunday morning, shortly after President Donald Trump announced al-Baghdadi had died. \u201cShe was held in many prisons,\" Carl Mueller said. \"She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\" \"He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder,\" Carl Mueller said.\u00a0\"I\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel.\u201d The Muellers, in Prescott, said they had mixed emotions.They suspect had al-Baghdadi been caught\u00a0alive rather than dead, he would not have been cooperative in sharing information. \u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told,\u201d\u00a0Marsha Mueller said. \u201cSomeone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers.\u201d Mueller\u00a0grew up in Prescott\u00a0and went to Northern Arizona University before traveling the world as an aid worker. While working in Turkey, she crossed into northern Syria with a companion to visit a hospital. Mueller became one of four Americans held hostage\u00a0by ISIS, though\u00a0her family kept her captivity secret\u00a0\u2013 complying, they said, with the demands they received from her captors and the urging of U.S. authorities who worked on her case. She was kidnapped and held for 18 months before her death was announced in early 2015.\u00a0Her parents,\u00a0Carl and Marsha Mueller, eventually confirmed her death, but her body has never been recovered. On Sunday, the Muellers praised President Donald Trump and the soldiers who pulled off the mission. \"We are\u00a0so grateful for them ... we are so grateful,\" Marsha Mueller said. They were glad there was no loss of life on our side. They are grateful their daughter and the others who were tortured and killed by ISIS have not been forgotten. \"I\u00a0still say Kayla\u00a0should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\" Marsha Mueller said. \"For me what matters most I'm hoping now we will finally get the answers we have been asking for all along,\" Marsha Mueller said.\u00a0\"I think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened.\" MORE:\u00a0For Kayla Mueller's family, dark details of the past Carl Mueller said Trump mentioned his daughter twice in his morning press conference. \"He\u00a0knows her story. He's been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me,\" Carl Mueller said. \"I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy.\" After Kayla's death, the Muellers became outspoken critics of the American government's handling of its foreign hostages. They had been encouraged to keep her captivity secret, and discouraged from attempting to free her or pay a ransom. Carl Mueller also became a vocal supporter of\u00a0Trump's candidacy for president, speaking at his rallies on the campaign trail. Months after the Muellers confirmed their daughter's death\u00a02015, U.S. special forces killed ISIS leader Abu Sayyaf and apprehended his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf. Soon, reports emerged that Umm Sayyaf had been responsible for holding\u00a0Mueller captive so that al-Baghdadi could\u00a0rape\u00a0the American repeatedly. The U.S. Justice Department later issued a criminal complaint against\u00a0Umm Sayyaf, alleging she conspired to support ISIS and was responsible for Mueller's death, as well as the captivity of others. \"The captives were at various times handcuffed, held in locked rooms, and Mueller was sexually abused by Baghdadi,\" Justice officials charged. Umm Sayyaf was handed over to the justice system of the Kurdish government in northern Iraq. Then-Sen. John McCain, at the time, questioned the decision not to extradite the woman. \u201cSayyaf was clearly involved at the top levels of a foreign terrorist organization with which the United States is in a state of hostilities,\u201d McCain wrote in a letter\u00a0to the heads of the Pentagon and the Justice Department. For years, Al-Baghdadi remained one of the most-hunted terrorists in the fight against ISIS. On Sunday, Trump announced\u00a0he had died after running from a house\u00a0into a dead-end\u00a0tunnel while being chased by United States Special Operations commandos in Northwest Syria. \"He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone,\" Trump said.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Gordon Sondland, the ambassador who delivered\u00a0bombshell testimony Wednesday in the impeachment inquiry into\u00a0President Donald Trump, was grilled on Capitol Hill about his memory by Republican counsel Steve Castor, who\u00a0sought to paint him as an unreliable witness. Castor waved a two-page list of instances in which Sondland, during prior closed-door testimony,\u00a0had trouble recalling phone\u00a0calls, meetings and other details. \u201cYou don\u2019t have records. You don't have your notes because\u00a0you didn't take notes. You don\u2019t have a\u00a0lot of\u00a0recollections,\u201d Castor said. If the ambassador was at all rattled by the comments, he didn't show it. \u201cIs that all?\" Sondland asked the GOP lawyer, before letting out a laugh and adding that it's \"situational things\" that trigger his memory. Takeaways\u00a0from Sondland's testimony:\u00a0'Rudy was the guy' driving Trump's Ukraine aims The U.S. ambassador to the European Union exuded self-assurance as he parried with lawmakers\u00a0during his six-hour testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Sondland has emerged as the star witness in the House impeachment inquiry, testifying that Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani sought a \"quid pro quo\" in which the administration would release military aid for Ukraine if its top officials announced an investigation into the president's political rival, Joe Biden. It's an unlikely role for a Republican donor-turned-ambassador who was known for flaunting his access to Trump. But Sondland, who had a first-hand view of top-level discussions on Ukraine,\u00a0provided damaging testimony to the president in his description of a pressure campaign on Kyiv that he said Giuliani pursued at Trump's direction. Sondland's demeanor differed starkly from that of the seven witnesses whose testimony preceded his. Other witnesses \u2013\u00a0including Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine \u2013\u00a0spoke in measured tones, in keeping with their decades of experience as civil servants. Several mentioned the exhaustive records they maintained. Taylor, for example, told lawmakers\u00a0he always carries a small notebook to record important conversations. Donors:How well does Trump know $1 million donors like Sondland? Some now work for him New to diplomacy, Sondland, 62,\u00a0is a wealthy businessman who\u00a0founded Provenance, a chain of boutique hotels based in Portland, Oregon, in 1985. He was confirmed to his role as\u00a0ambassador to the European Union last year. Trump handed Ukraine to him as part of\u00a0his portfolio even though it's not part of the EU. As TV cameras rolled, Sondland glided into the hearing room and shared a laugh with his lawyer after taking his seat at the witness table. He gave punchy\u00a0answers. He focused on the big picture. He conceded recollection of details was\u00a0not his strong\u00a0suit. And he joked about that. In response to the grilling from Castor, Sondland said he couldn't remember all the conversations he had with world leaders \u2013\u00a0even some with Trump \u2013 since there were so many to recall. \"There's a lot of stuff to juggle,\" the ambassador\u00a0said, as he ticked off the list of countries in his portfolio. \"A\u00a0phone call\u00a0for me with the president of the United States or the president of fill-in-the-blank country, while people who get a call like that maybe once in a lifetime, a call like that might be very memorable. They might remember everything about it. I'm doing it all day long.\" Sondland has donated to other\u00a0Republicans, including President\u00a0George W. Bush and White House candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney. Latest news:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage During the 2016 campaign, Sondland criticized Trump for disparaging Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who spoke at the Democratic convention. Sondland pivoted after Trump's win, donating $1 million to the president-elect's inauguration. Sondland embraces the jet-setting lifestyle of a diplomat and all the trappings that come with it. He's hosted lavish parties at his official residence in Brussels, including a soiree in June attended by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, comedian Jay Leno and world leaders\u00a0including\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"There were a lot of celebrities, guests, and it was a very sort of light-hearted evening,\" Sondland told lawmakers during closed-door testimony last month. \"It was not a business dinner.\" The ambassador raised eyebrows months after his Senate confirmation for overseeing more than half a million dollars in taxpayer-funded renovations to the Brussels residence. Since September 2018, the State Department has approved $13,301 for a pool and Jacuzzi heating system, $33,625 on household furniture, $208,683 on a kitchen remodel and $95,109 for a pergola. A State Department spokesman told The Washington Post that the renovations were part of a \"regular 17-year cycle of reviewing and refreshing furnishings and interior decor in representational residences.\" There are echoes of Trump in Sondland, a well-to-do business executive who, like his boss,\u00a0joined government\u00a0late in life and seems\u00a0to enjoy rubbing elbows with the powerful. It was Sondland's July 26 phone call to Trump, made from a trendy Kyiv restaurant over a bottle of wine and overheard by those around him, that has become a key moment in the impeachment inquiry. Sondland told lawmakers Wednesday that he doesn't remember key details of the call, but he did recall colorful language used by the president. \"He loves your a--,\" Sondland said of Zelensky during that conversation, according to a State Department official who heard the call. \"Yeah, it sounds like something I would say,\" Sondland told lawmakers Wednesday with a chuckle. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate. Lots of four-letter words ... In this case, three letters.\" Despite his\u00a0bombshell revelation about Trump's knowledge of the quid pro quo, Democrats were frustrated at times with what they viewed as Sondland's\u00a0evasiveness. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.,\u00a0thanked him for being forthright, but said it took three tries to get there. Before testifying Wednesday, Sondland gave a closed-door deposition and then modified it before the transcript was released. \u201cWe appreciate your candor,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be really clear about what it took to get it out of you.\u201d After Sondland commanded the spotlight from the moment he entered the hearing room, even his departure carried a hint of drama. Sondland's attorney, Robert Luksin, had to nudge committee members to cut short a planned recess so the ambassador could \"fly back\u00a0to\u00a0Brussels to resume his\u00a0duties.\" \"I\u00a0appreciate\u00a0that, counsel,\" Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Luskin. \"We all\u00a0have a busy\u00a0schedule these\u00a0days.\" Sondland made his flight, arriving\u00a0at Dulles Airport with TV cameras shadowing him.

      "content": "FRANKLIN, N.H. \u2013 Pete Buttigieg was talking about climate change to about a dozen reporters on his campaign bus Saturday when the presidential candidate\u00a0leaped out of his captain\u2019s chair to look out the picture window at a burning building. \u201cOh!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat is a very large fire.\u201d Then his attention was drawn to a boy who had been watching the Franklin firefighters\u2019 controlled burn turn away from the fire to point at Buttigieg\u2019s passing blue and gold bus. \u201cI thought, if this bus is enough of an attraction to pry the eyes of a 10-year-old off of a burning structure surrounded by firefighters, we know that we\u2019ve generated a little bit of excitement,\u201d Buttigieg later told a gathering of about 50 supporters at a home in Madison. After the TV cameras and notepad-toting reporters had squeezed into the living room, Buttigieg explained he was crisscrossing New Hampshire with the news media in tow to \u201creally show, versus tell, the importance of transparency as a value at a time when we\u2019ve got a White House that doesn\u2019t even do press briefings anymore.\u201d His bus had rolled into New Hampshire after two trips through Iowa, where he has\u00a0climbed into the top tier of polls. A Quinnipiac University Poll of New Hampshire Democrats released Monday likewise showed Buttigieg among the top four candidates in the crowded field On board for much of the tour through all of the state\u2019s 10 counties were a rotating batch of local, national and international reporters taking advantage of what Buttigieg referred to as the \u201cradical access\u201d to his campaign. More than one reporter said they had gone through all the questions in their notebook during the trip. The Indiana mayor\u2019s availability to the media \u2013\u00a0a strategy initially born out of necessity for the largely unknown politician \u2013 is one reason he has\u00a0vaulted over more established candidates\u00a0in the Democratic field. In fact, a New York Times article\u00a0on how Buttigieg is \"annoying\" his rivals with his success\u00a0was one of the first topics reporters raised on the second day of the four-day trip. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the inside-baseball stuff,\u201d Buttigieg responded, adding: \u201cI get that I\u2019m coming from a nontraditional place.\u201d But was he surprised by the comments from some of the other campaigns? \u201cIt\u2019s a competition,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cBut it\u2019s\u00a0just not where my focus is.\u201d Buttigieg had been pressed the day before on why he doesn\u2019t allow the media into his fundraisers, as former Vice President Joe Biden does. That\u2019s a question for staff, he demurred. In fact, during the New Hampshire trip, Buttigieg made a detour without the media entourage to a fundraiser in Providence, Rhode Island. On other topics, Buttigieg fielded dozens of questions over many hours in between ducking into his back office on the bus for private calls or to work on a Veterans Day speech. What did he think when Biden started calling his own health care plan, Medicare for All Who Want It, a term Buttigieg coined? \u201cWell, it\u2019s a very effective way to describe my plan,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that my plan and his plan are exactly the same.\u201d Is his approach to issues like health care more palatable to voters than the calls for structural change coming from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders? \u201cWhat I see is an attempt to address these problems that could be addressed with less cost and less upheaval,\u201d he said. What\u2019s his favorite hymn? The Welsh hymn \"Bryn Calfaria,\" or Calvary Hill, which he says is best\u00a0in the original Welsh. What kind of stress dreams does he have? It\u2019s the last day of a school semester and he doesn\u2019t even know what classes he was supposed to have been attending. (Turns out most reporters on the bus have that dream, too.) Buttigieg got multiple versions of recurring questions that have been asked about his campaign: Why isn\u2019t he attracting more support from African Americans? Has he shifted his positions since entering the race to sound more moderate? Why doesn\u2019t he talk more about his time at the consulting firm McKinsey? What mistakes did he make in handling problems within the South Bend Police Department? How can he beat President Donald Trump\u00a0when the only elections he has\u00a0won have been two mayoral races in a not-large\u00a0Democratic city? In between, Buttigieg hopped on and off the bus for well-attended town halls, campaign organizing meetings, walking tours of downtowns he said reminded him of the revitalization efforts in his own South Bend, and a stop at a solar-powered brewery where he sampled a Mai Tai-inspired beer. \u201cIt was good,\u201d he told reporters when he had resettled into his swivel seat on the bus, right ankle resting on the left knee. \u201cIt had, like, a beginning, middle and an end.\u201d A stuffed dog he picked up at a shop in Franklin that sells locally made products found a home on the bus, as did a basket of fudge and other treats personally delivered by Pat Provencher, a superfan from New Hampton. When she\u2019s not baking for Buttigieg or attending a barn party for him, the senior citizen keeps an eye on Facebook so she can respond to any negative comment she sees about her favorite candidate. The bus is modeled after the \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d that Arizona Sen. John McCain first rode in his unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in 2000. But in the age of social media, it\u2019s more of a high-wire act \u2013 both for the candidate and for the news media. When a reporter incorrectly quoted Buttigieg as criticizing the \u201cfailures of the Obama era\u201d instead of the \u201cfailures of the old normal,\u201d the comment went viral before it was\u00a0fixed. Buttigieg then tweeted that he appreciated the reporter\u2019s \u201cswift and honest correction.\u201d Buttigieg also took in stride the blowback he received on social media for \u201ccutting up his cinnamon roll into small pieces and eating it like a CHICKEN WING.\u201d \u201cTwitter will hate anything I get,\u201d Chasten Buttigieg, Pete\u2019s husband, said when perusing what is\u00a0billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s longest candy counter\u201d during a stop at Chutters in Littleton. (Twitter, in fact, loves Chasten.) In addition to the omnipresence of social media, Buttigieg\u2019s bus is also very different from the original Straight Talk Express\u00a0in tone and temperament. McCain reveled in his rebel persona, enjoyed ribbing\u00a0reporters and didn\u2019t hide his quick temper. Buttigieg, the erudite son of university professors, is contemplative and careful. He said the biggest misconception about him is \u201cI guess the idea that I don\u2019t get angry.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been an idea that because I don\u2019t emote in the same way as some others that I\u2019m not passionate,\" he said.\u00a0\u201cJust because it\u2019s a slower burn doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a kind of passion.\u201d But he gave the nonpersonal answer of \u201cinjustice\u201d when pressed to describe what makes him angry. He did submit to a deep dive into his personal history: How old he was when he started to feel different?\u00a0What was the\u00a0path of his religious journey?\u00a0And\u00a0has he revisited the \u201cjust in case\u201d letter he wrote to his parents before he deployed to Afghanistan as a\u00a0lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2014 \u2013 an experience that he has said made him realize he needed to come out as gay when he returned so he could live a full life. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to think that I wrote that trying to project a sense that I didn\u2019t have any resentment over missing out on things when what I was missing out on then was now the most important thing in my life,\u201d he said of his marriage to Chasten. Does he regret not having included in the letter that he was gay? \u201cNo,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIt\u2019d be weird to have something that I was only willing to have people know if I was dead.\u201d One question related to his sexuality that Buttigieg didn\u2019t want to address was whether he expects to see at Thanksgiving a brother-in-law who has been public about his opposition to same-sex marriage. \u201cI think that part of my Thanksgiving will stay off the record,\u201d he said politely but definitively. One of the only times he showed discomfort with a line of questioning was when pressed on his ambition and whether achievement is important to him. \u201cUm\u2026yeah,\u201d he said, before elaborating\u00a0\u2013\u00a0after a prompting \u2013 that everyone gets only one turn in life so it\u2019s important to make it count. \u201cWatching you write is a little unnerving,\u201d he said with a nervous laugh as the reporter scribbled the\u00a0answer into her notepad. \u201cYou are, like, literally on the couch right now,\u201d interjected Lis Smith, his senior adviser who devised the media access strategy. Acknowledging his unease, Buttigieg explained that\u00a0\u201cI never really, like, dug into that on a bus full of reporters before.\u201d \u201cBut, by all means,\u201d he added, \u201cgo on.\u201d Mayor record:Pete Buttigieg casts himself as tech-oriented pragmatist",

      "content": "AUSTIN \u2014 Under pressure to take concrete steps to address the recent spike in deadly mass shootings in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday issued eight executive orders seeking to keep firearms out the hands of people who pose a threat to public safety. \"Texas must achieve several objectives to better protect our communities and our residents from mass shootings\" Abbott said in a news release. \"One of those objectives is to marshal law enforcement resources to stop violent criminals before they commit mass murders. But more must be done.\" The orders include greater emphasis on bringing suspicious activity reports to the attention of appropriate law enforcement agencies and\u00a0better informing students, school staffs\u00a0and families of potential threats.\u00a0They also come one day after Democrats in the state Legislature made high-profile pleas\u00a0for the governor to call an emergency session on gun violence. Abbott, a Republican, has resisted such calls at least until a bipartisan consensus can be reached, even while promising decisive action in the aftermath of the recent mass killings in El Paso and Odessa. Since taking office in January 2015, Abbott has been called on to console communities and survivors of\u00a0at least five\u00a0deadly\u00a0mass shootings that have happened in Texas. Nothing in the mandates laid out by the governor would limit access to firearms or affect how many rounds a rifle's magazine could hold. More:Beto O'Rourke takes on Meghan McCain over gun rights Abbott said the finding from his newly appointed Texas Safety Commission will likely be released next week. Democrats, who on Wednesday were urging action to address issues like magazine capacity and\u00a0tougher laws that would allow authorities to act on \"red flags\" for gun owners who exhibit dangerous behavior\u00a0appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the orders. But state Sen. Jose Rodriguez of El Paso, leader of the state Senate Democrats, sent Abbott a letter urging him to call lawmakers back to the state Capitol in Austin. \"We implore you to call a special session solely to reduce gun violence and combat the menacing rise of white supremacy,\" Rodriguez said in his letter. \"A special session affords all members an opportunity to discuss potential legislation and hear from Texans.\" Gun control:Sen. Ted Cruz agrees to meet with actress Alyssa Milano, spars with Chicago mayor Republican state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, who with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick this week appointed special legislative panels to examine deadly violence, called Abbott's orders \"a roadmap\" for making Texas safer. \"The state of Texas is taking swift action to put a stop to this epidemic of violence, and I thank Governor Abbott for his leadership on the matter,\" Bonnen said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Ten Democrats running for president slugged their way through a three-hour debate Thursday that featured sharp\u00a0jabs and underscored deep divisions among the candidates hoping to take on President Donald Trump next fall. In a debate that put all of the leading candidates on the same stage for the first time, the top tier candidates in polling \u2013 namely, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 largely fended off early and sometimes fiery attacks from the lesser-known Democrats. Ultimately, there were\u00a0few breakout moments to shake up the status of the race. \"It's no longer time to postpone,\" Biden said in Houston. \"We should get moving.\" Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro and Beto O'Rourke were among the candidates seeking to target Biden, who has held a steady lead in polls for months. But there were few fireworks among the front runners, and the long-expected sparks between Biden and Warren, who has been climbing in polls, never fully materialized. The debate highlighted deep chasms within the Democratic Party, including on health care. Some of those differences were framed by Barack Obama's presidency, though most of the candidates praised the direction he took the country over eight years. Sanders and Warren continued their push for a Medicare-for-All health care system while others, such as Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, questioned the cost. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar fired at Sanders, arguing his plan would force millions of Americans off their health plans. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d Though the candidates were quick to criticize Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d decision on trade, they were less willing to denounce tariffs he has imposed on China. Throughout the debate, Biden tied himself closely to Obama, whose approach to healthcare, immigration and foreign policy were dissected by the candidates almost as much as Trump\u2019s. But when Biden was pressed to answer for the high level of deportations under Obama, he demurred by noting that he was only the vice president. That answer drew a sharp rebuke from Julian Castro. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro said. Biden shot back that he stood by Obama\u2019s decisions \u201cgood, bad and indifferent.\u201d While the Democrats were hashing out how to defeat Trump, the president was on a stage in Baltimore mocking front runners with his trademark scathing nicknames. \"I hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said of Warren as he spoke with GOP lawmakers meeting for their annual retreat. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe.\u201d With less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses, the knock-down battle for the nomination has remained remarkably steady. Biden has held a consistent lead in polling \u2013 both nationwide and in Iowa \u2013 for months. Warren has gained on Sanders, who remains in second place in most national polls. The candidates \u2013 at least some of them \u2013 will do it all over again next month. The fourth Democratic presidential debate will take place in Ohio on Oct. 15. After plenty of Trump-bashing, Vice President Mike Pence got a reference when the candidates were asked at the end of the debate to talk about a significant setback and how they dealt with it. Buttigieg talked about his struggles with coming out as gay as he was facing re-election in Indiana when Pence was governor. The Pence reference got a brief rise out of the audience, which quickly quieted as Buttigieg talked about coming back from serving in Afghanistan. His deployment had made him realize that you only get one life. \u201cI was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just came out.\u201d The fact that he was re-elected to a second term as mayor with 80% of the vote taught Buttigieg that \u201cpart of how you can win, and deserve to win, is to know what\u2019s worth more to you than winning.\u201d --Maureen Groppe Joe Biden was briefly shouted down by audience members during a question about his professional setbacks. Biden began saying that he didn\u2019t believe any of his professional setbacks were significant when members of the audience began shouting. It was not immediately clear what issues the protesters, who shouted over each other, \u00a0were raising. Biden appeared to turn to Warren to ask if she knew what the audience members were yelling about. Biden continued his remarks a few minutes later. \u201cYou deal with it by finding purpose,\u201d Biden said of setbacks. And his purpose, he said, was to stay engaged in politics. -- John Fritze Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a big Democratic boogeyman, became an applause line for Buttigieg. The first step in improving education, he said, is appointing a secretary of education \"who actually believes in public education.\u201d DeVos is a major advocate of charter schools. Buttigieg, whose husband is a teacher, also said that the country needs to respect teachers \u201cthe way \u00a0we do soldiers and pay them the way we do doctors.\u201d Warren, calling herself the only one on stage who has been a teacher, said her secretary of education would be a public school teacher. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t really comment on the debate,\u201d tweeted Chasten Buttigieg, \u201cbut I am SO GLAD we are *finally* talking about education and teachers.\u201d --Maureen Groppe Beto O\u2019Rourke promised to spend $5 trillion over the next decade on technology and incentives to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Amy Klobuchar vowed to keep the United States in the Paris Climate Accord, restore Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. And Elizabeth Warren said she\u2019s embracing a plan proposed by former presidential candidate Jay Inslee to eliminate carbon emissions from new buildings by 2028, carbon emissions from new cars by 2030, and carbon emissions from power production by 2035. \u201cWe are running out of time,\u201d she said. It took two hours before the candidates were asked about climate change, an issue Klobuchar called \u201cthe existential crisis of our time.\u201d And it was a dud. Everyone who chimed in agreed with the need for dramatic, immediate action. --Ledyard King Kamala Harris compared Donald Trump\u2019s trade strategy to the Wizard of Oz. And not in a good way. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a guy in the White House who\u2019s been erratic on trade policy,\u201d the California senator said about the president\u2019s trade policy with China. \u201cHe conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly borne out of his fragile ego.\u201d She called for a more consistent trade policy and made a reference to the iconic 1939 movie that starred Judy Garland. More:Republicans air ad about the dangers of 'socialism' and AOC during the Democratic debate \u201cThe bottom line is this: Donald Trump in office on trade policy \u2026 reminds me of that guy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d That drew a chuckle from ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos, a diminutive man whose height is listed as 5 feet and five inches. \u201cOK,\u201d Stephanopoulos dead-panned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to even take the bait, Sen. Harris.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about you,\u201d she said laughing as well. -- Ledyard King Booker referenced his bald pate in attacking Trump for using a national security waiver to impose tariffs on Canada, a country led by a prime minister with a healthy head of hair. \u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage that finds (Justin) Trudeau\u2019s hair very menacing,\u201d Booker said, \u201cbut they are not a national security threat.\u201d Booker\u2019s larger point was that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy has turned into an \u201cAmerica alone\u201d policy in which he is pulling away from allies, making it harder to take on competitors like China. --Maureen Groppe One by one, the Democratic candidates slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy, which they described as \u201cerratic.\u201d \u201cThe president clearly has no strategy,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said. More:Trump may not be watching the debate, but his team is. Campaign defends record in emails Buttigieg recalled that when he entered the race, Trump derisively said he\u2019d like to see Buttigieg make a deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201cI\u2019d like to see HIM making a deal with Xi Jinping,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIs it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April?\u201d Buttigieg said that Trump\u2019s inability to follow through on what he promises is being taken note of by both competitors and allies with serious consequences. \u201cWe can use trade to help build a stronger economy,\u201d Elizabeth Warren said. Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican first\u201d policy is actually an \u201cAmerican alone\u201d policy, Corey Booker said. What they didn\u2019t say: Whether they would be willing to eliminate the tariffs that Trump has slapped on Chinese imports as leverage designed to force China to agree to a new trade pact. Amy Klobuchar came the closest. She said she would not have imposed the tariffs in the first place. --Michael Collins, Maureen Groppe During a busy night of Republican response to debating Democrats, President Donald Trump first took a low-key approach by saying he respected his opponents \u2013 but later mocked frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren with scathing nicknames. \"I hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said, referring to Warren while speaking to a group of House Republicans in Baltimore. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden) ... He has no idea what\u2019s going on.\" Trump also threw in a jab at South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: \u201cHe\u2019s doing a rotten job running his own city.\u201d As the president spoke in Baltimore, Democrats who debated in Houston accused Trump of fomenting racism by attacking people of color and denouncing immigrants as invaders. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke described Trump as a \"white supremacist\" who poses a \"mortal threat\" to the country, particularly minorities. -- David Jackson Dissecting President Barack Obama and his administration\u2019s record has become a central theme of the Democratic presidential debate. It started, during the first hour, with health care, as the candidates sought to chart a direction on what to do with Obamacare. It continued during a discussion on immigration, when Joe Biden was pressed directly on the administration\u2019s record on deportations. Obama adopted many progressive policies on immigration, including allowing young people brought to the country illegally as children to avoid deportation. But his administration also deported immigrants in the country illegally at a rate that surprised fellow Democrats. Biden was pressed directly on whether he stood by those deportations. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have served with him.\u201d But when questioned again specifically about deportations, Biden noted that he was only the vice president at that time. That drew a fiery response from Julian Castro. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro said. Biden dismissed that criticism, arguing that he \u201cstood with\u201d Obama\u2019s decisions for eight years, \u201cgood, bad and indifferent.\u201d \u201cI did not say I did not stand with him,\u201d Biden said. -- John Fritze President Donald Trump may not be watching the Democratic presidential debate, but his people are. The Trump campaign\u2019s rapid response team is firing off emails to reporters in defense of his record as Democrats go after him from the stage. \u201cPresident Trump is addressing gun safety while defending the 2nd Amendment,\u201d read one message sent just minutes after Democrats slammed Trump failing to take on the issue of gun violence. \u201cThanks to President Trump, black Americans are making historic progress and enjoying growing opportunities,\u201d read another rebuttal when Democrats accused him of promoting racism. \u201cPresident Trump is fighting to bring down prescription drug prices for working families,\u201d said another message when Democrats blasted Trump for trying to undo the Affordable Care Act. --Michael Collins Sanders, rather than attacking the candidate with whom he is competing for the most liberal voters, grabbed at the chance to reiterate their joint call that the system is broken. On the issue of gun control, Warren has said it can\u2019t be addressed \u201cuntil we attack the systematic problems.\u201d Asked a question about the Senate filibuster, Sanders said he wanted to get back to Warren\u2019s point. \u201cWhat we are looking at is a corrupt political system,\u201d he said, accusing drug companies, insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry for \u201cdetermining what is happening in Washington.\u201d --Maureen Groppe When it came to gun violence, Kamala Harris talked about how difficult it is to see school children drill for mass shooters. \u201cIt is traumatizing our children,\u201d she said. Then she brought up the president\u2019s words as a contributing factor, bringing up the Walmart shooting in El Paso last month that left 22 dead and dozens more wounded. Before the shooting, the gunman penned a racist, anti-immigrant manifesto that the president\u2019s critics have said echo the president\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cPeople asked me in El Paso, \u2018Well do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?\u2019, she said. \u201cI said \u2018Well, look, he obviously didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition\u2019.\u201d -- Ledyard King After several of his competitors praised O\u2019Rourke for his advocacy of gun control after a mass shooting in his home town, one of the moderators pressed him about his proposal to buy back military-style assault weapons. Critics call that confiscation. O\u2019Rourke said the weapons have to go when they\u2019re being used against children. He described meeting a mother who watched her daughter bleed to death in Odessa after being shot with an AR-15. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. --Maureen Groppe One key theme to emerge from the third Democratic presidential debate, so far: The gloves are off. The ten candidates on stage have engaged in some of the sharpest exchanges Americans have witnessed so far in the race to replace President Donald Trump. Much of that tension in the first hour has been wrapped around the fight over how the nation should proceed on health care. Candidates had zingers ready, but their fire was not directed in all directions \u2013 and not necessarily just at front runner Joe Biden. Many observers were watching for fireworks between Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who has been steadily gaining grounds in polling. But, so far, most of the debate has played out between the three front runners \u2013 Biden, Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 and the rest of the field. It was Julian Castro who claimed Biden was \u201cforgetting what you said two minutes ago,\u201d a not-so-subtle knock on Biden\u2019s propensity for gaffes. It was Amy Klobuchar who was among the most forceful critics of Sanders\u2019 plan to expand government health care. -- John Fritze First Kamala Harris thanked Barack Obama for passing the Affordable Care Act that expanded health care for millions. Then the California senator thanked Bernie Sanders for proposing Medicare for All. Finally, she brought up the ghost of Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who died last year, when talking about how he stopped Donald Trump\u2019s plan to kill Obamacare. \u201cDonald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his office trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all fought against that, and then the late, great John McCain at about 2 in the morning killed his attempt to kill health care for millions of people in this country.\u201d As she spoke she pointed her right thumb down, mimicking McCain\u2019s famous gesture when he broke from his party and became the deciding vote in 2017 against Trump\u2019s plan to repeal Obamacare. -- Ledyard King More than 30 minutes into the debate, Cory Booker had not had a chance to speak since his opening statement. During a spirited debate over health care, Booker was mainly silent while other candidates had a chance to jump in multiple times. Booker got the last word on the debate over health care. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency right now in this nation, everybody feels it,\u201d Booker said when the camera turned to him. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity.\u201d -- John Fritze Amy Klobuchar came out swinging against the progressive plan to prove government health insurance for all Americans \u2013 and what has become a Bernie Sanders campaign mantra. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar fired at Sanders, arguing that the plan would drop millions of Americans off their private health insurance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d The line was a response to Sanders' oft-repeated line that he \"wrote the damn bill\" to move to a Medicare-for-All health insurance system. Health care, and the fight over whether to make adjustments to Obamacare or to scrap it for additional government coverage, has dominated the opening moments of virtually every Democratic debate this year \u2013 and it has widely split the field. -- John Fritze Bernie Sanders, in an extended defense of his Medicare for All plan, argued the proposal would be cost-effective. Then he added, \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d It was a recycled line that he first used in a presidential debate in July, when he claimed the plan would provide union members with better health care coverage than they have now. Tim Ryan interjected, \"You don't know that, Bernie. \"I do know that \u2014 I wrote the damn bill,\" Sanders fired back. --Michael Collins Moderator George Stephanopoulos immediately tried to get the top three candidates engaged in a debate over how far left the party should go. He asked Biden whether Sanders and Warren are pushing too far beyond where most Democrats are on health care, climate change and college costs. \u201cThat\u2019s for voters to decide,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLet me tell you what I think.\u201d After saying Obamacare worked, Biden went after the cost of Medicare for All, saying Sanders and Warren haven\u2019t explained how it will be paid for. Warren responded that the question is how to improve on Obamacare. \u201cAnd I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure everybody gets covered with health care at the lowest possible cost,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd middle-class families are going to pay less.\u201d -- Maureen Groppe Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun control a centerpiece of his campaign, went hard on the issue in his opening statement. O\u2019Rourke used his first words to note the El Paso shooting on Aug. 3 that left 22 people dead. The former Texas congressman also went after President\u00a0Donald Trump, arguing that the shooter was \u201cinspired to kill by our president.\u201d -- John Fritze It didn\u2019t take long for someone to use the most famous line associated with the city hosting the debate. \u201cHouston we have a problem,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. a reference to the message from Apollo 13 astronauts to Mission Control in Houston. The NASA mission in 1970 returned to Earth after technical problems prevented it from reaching the moon. -- Ledyard King The third Democratic presidential debate is underway in Houston. Appearing on stage from left to right; Amy Klobuchar; Pete Buttigieg; Bernie Sanders; Joe Biden; Elizabeth Warren; Kamala Harris; Andrew Yang, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro. Buckle up: The debate, which is airing on ABC and Univision, is expected to last three hours. Follow along here for the latest. -- John Fritze In July, it was the season finale of The Bachelorette. This time, football fans who are following the Democratic presidential race will face a choice: NFL Thursday Night Football will feature a match-up between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers. Politics observers \u2013 including President Donald Trump \u2013 have often paid close attention to the ratings captured by networks hosting the debates. Are Americans still tuning in? Is interest in the race already waning, less than five months from the Iowa caucuses? Are Americans, as the president claimed after ratings were released for one of two debates in July, just \u201cdesperate for Trump\u201d? In July, both the debate and\u00a0the Bachelorette finale\u00a0were slated to run from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET, forcing millions of Americans to choose between national politics and reality-TV politics. Some 8.7 million viewers watched the first night\u2019s debate live on CNN. Another 2.8 million watched on CNN\u2019s live stream. That bested The Bachelorette, which drew 7.4 million viewers. This time, the debate is almost certain to have a major advantage in the ratings battle. The candidates will scrimmage on the ABC broadcast network; the game is on the cable-only NFL Network. The game is also being played in Charlotte, N.C., the site of next year's Republican nominating convention. -- David Jackson and John Fritze Andrew Yang promised this week to do something unusual at tonight\u2019s debate. It turns out, he will deliver on that promise. Buzzfeed News reported Thursday that Yang is planning to announce a contest in which he will award 10 families with $1,000 a month for one year. Yang has pulled out the marketing move before (though not at a debate). The effort is intended to highlight his plan for a universal basic income \u2013 a central part of his economic message \u2013 in which every American citizen over the age of 18 would be guaranteed $1,000 a month. The idea has gained prominence among some economists who argue a universal income would offset job loss caused by advances in technology. -- John Fritze The candidates have been warned. Or maybe begged. ABC, which is hosting tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, would really appreciate it if the Democrats can keep from swearing during the three-hour event. It\u2019s not that the network doesn\u2019t appreciate passion and authenticity. But the network is governed by Federal Communication Commission indecency rules. And because there will be no delay on broadcasting the live event, ABC will not be able to edit out foul language, the network told the candidates. They may be particularly concerned about former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has been dropping the F-bomb to express his anger about gun violence. His campaign is even selling T-shirts with the expression he\u2019s used. Asked Saturday if he would swear on the debate stage, O\u2019Rourke had a five-letter response: Maybe. During the first debates in June, entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the Russians are laughing their (behinds) off at the United States as they try to manipulate the elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker used the S-word during the last debates. But he was repeating President Donald Trump\u2019s reported description of countries from which he did not want to accept immigrants. Booker has also sworn on social media, such as when he tweeted in June a defense of fellow competitor Kamala Harris\u2019 heritage, saying she doesn\u2019t have \u201csh\u2014t\u201d to prove. When a follower questioned whether someone else had taken over Booker\u2019s account, he responded: \u201cOh, this is definitely me.\u201d -Maureen Groppe Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to prove himself against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who has been rising in the polls. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is still competing with Warren for support from the most progressive wing of the party. And California Sen. Kamala Harris will try to reignite the spark she lit from the first debate that has since faded. How to watch:Warren, Biden face off in tonight's debate. Here's how to watch What to watch:\u00a0Five questions the Democratic debate may answer Relive the highlights:Top moments from the last debate The six other candidates on stage still have to show that they belong in the top tier. Democrats who didn\u2019t meet the party\u2019s qualifying rules for tonight\u2019s debate \u2013 including Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and\u00a0Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 will have a harder time qualifying for next month\u2019s debate without tonight\u2019s exposure.\u00a0Billionaire Tom Steyer didn't make this debate but has met the conditions for the next one, in October. After opening statements, tonight\u2019s contenders will have one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions. They\u2019ll get an additional 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Airing on ABC and Univision, the three-hour event will be moderated by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and by Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos. The candidates are debating at Texas Southern University, a historically black university in Houston. Texas is also home to two of the competitors, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro who will be standing next to each other on one end of the stage. The order was determined by polling averages. Here\u2019s the full list from left to right: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sanders; Biden; Warren; Harris; entrepreneur Andrew Yang, O\u2019Rourke; Castro. \u2013 Maureen Groppe President Donald Trump will miss the Democratic debate on Thursday because he\u2019s speaking to Republican lawmakers holding their annual retreat in Baltimore. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the president doesn\u2019t have thoughts. Trump predicted that Joe Biden will prevail so long as \u201che doesn\u2019t make any major mistakes.\u201d Like many Americans, the president also seems eager to view the Democratic field as being much smaller than it is on paper. \u201cYou have three people leading,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be one of those three.\u201d --\u00a0David Jackson and John\u00a0 Fritze If tonight\u2019s candidates took the stage based on how often they\u2019ve been Googled this past week instead of by their polling averages, the center stage would look a little different. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would still be there. But Andrew Yang, not Elizabeth Warren, would be in the top three, according to Google. Warren ranked fourth. The search engine also looked at the top questions people had about the candidates this week. Googlers wanted to know if Beto O\u2019Rourke, Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar are still running. Searchers were curious about whether Cory Booker is dating or married. The top question people had about the three oldest candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 was how old they are. And one of the top five questions for nearly every candidate was how tall they are. But despite a common belief that the tallest candidate usually wins, the shorter person won three of the last five presidential elections. --Maureen Groppe What are the candidates who didn\u2019t qualify for tonight\u2019s debate doing instead? Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is speaking at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of law, his alma mater. Billionaire Tom Steyer and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock campaigned in Iowa Thursday. \u201cSee you in Iowa today, and over the next 143 days!\u201d Bullock tweeted. After her watch party at the Writers Guild of America in California, author Marianne Williamson planned to talk about what she would have said had she been on stage. Her take, moderated by a writer with The Hollywood Reporter, will be livestreamed. Supporters of Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are gathering at Veggie Street Restaurant where they will \u201cblast searches and inundate social media with our support for Tulsi.\u201d --Maureen Groppe President Donald Trump will, of course, be center stage at the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday without having ever stepped into Houston. But the Trump campaign apparently also wanted to own the skies. Trump\u2019s campaign hired a plane to fly a banner over the debate\u2019s host city. The message drew from the president\u2019s leading reelection mantra: That Democrats running to replace him 2020 have veered too far to the left. \u201cSocialism will kill Houston's economy,\u201d the banner read. \u201cVote Trump 2020.\u201d -- John Fritze",

      "content": "John Legend disagrees with the sentence fellow celebrity Felicity Huffman received Friday from being a part of the college admissions scandal. In a Boston courtroom, the \"Desperate Housewives\" alum was sentenced to 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, supervised release for one year and 250 hours of community service for paying $15,000 to have someone correct answers on the SAT exam of her and William H. Macy's oldest daughter, Sophia. \"I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one,\" read a Saturday tweet from Legend, founder of FreeAmerica, \"a campaign to transform America\u2019s criminal justice system,\" according to its website.\u00a0\"The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up.\" \"Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up,\" he shared in another post. \"Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill.\" Felicity Huffman sentenced:2 weeks in prison, $30,000 fine for college admissions scandal Though he did not address Huffman by name, he did reference her 2-week sentencing, describing it as ultimately meaningless. \"And no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions,\" he wrote. \"We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff.\" Legend explained that he preferred other alternatives to prison when a Twitter user opposed his view. \"Yeah let's not have any consequences to crime... that'll work well,\" the critic remarked. \"When you think no prison = no consequences,\" Legend replied. \"There are other ways to hold people accountable than the state paying 10s of thousands a year to hold them in a secure facility\" Read Felicity Huffman's\u00a0full, emotional statement about her 14-day prison sentence That's not the only Twitter opponent Legend has had to face of late. The artist's Sept. 8,\u00a0appearance on MSNBC's final installment of\u00a0Lester Holt's \"Justice For All\" series, a report about the criminal justice system, ruffled the feathers of President Donald Trump. The nation's leader complained that he and his political party were not receiving the appropriate credit and\u00a0dragged the \"boring musician\" and his \"filthy mouthed wife\" Chrissy Teigen, who was not mentioned in the report. The judge in Huffman's case, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, addressed the actress' sentencing in court. \"I don\u2019t think anyone wants to go to prison,\" Talwani said. \"I do think this is the right thing here. I think without this sentence you would be looking at a future with a community around you asking how you got away with this.\" Meghan McCain defends Chrissy Teigen\u00a0after President Trump targets Teigen, John Legend Friday, Huffman said she was ready to \"accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation.\" \"I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,\" she said. \"I would like to apologize again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions,\" she added. \"And I especially want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children.\" Contributing:\u00a0Joey Garrison, Hannah Yasharoff and Anika Reed 'Legitimate donations':Lori Loughlin attorney previews college admissions defense in court 'I can't figure it out':John Stamos is still perplexed over Lori Loughlin scandal",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 First-place finishers for the past four Iowa caucus cycles \u2014\u00a0with the\u00a0exception of\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all surged ahead sometime in the final months before the caucus, from November through\u00a0January. That\u2019s good news for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who jumped 16 percentage points\u00a0from September to lead the pack in November\u2019s Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, conducted by Selzer & Co. He is the first choice of 25% of\u00a0likely Democratic caucusgoers. That jump is an even more pronounced surge than Barack Obama\u2019s in 2007, when the Illinois senator jumped 6\u00a0percentage points\u00a0from October to November, then another 4 points\u00a0in December. Buttigieg has been drawing\u00a0parallels between himself and Obama. But a November surge also doesn't assure a victory. In\u00a0caucus cycles since 2004, only three candidates who were first in the November Iowa Poll\u00a0\u2014 Clinton, Obama and Mike Huckabee\u00a0\u2014 won their party's\u00a0caucus a few months later. The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was\u00a0in third in November\u00a02004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011. \u25ba More: Iowa Caucuses Results History: 1972 to 2016 Former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said a last-minute surge is the\u00a0key to a successful caucus campaign. It\u2019s a maxim that\u2019s become known in Iowa politics as the \u201cNagle Rule.\u201d \u201cThere are three rules to success in Iowa,\u201d Nagle said in a phone interview. \u201cRule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is:\u00a0You get hot at the end.\u201d With two and a half months left before the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses, Democratic presidential hopefuls\u00a0have plenty of time to \u201cget hot\u201d and move up, even within a shifting\u00a0field. Buttigieg\u2019s trajectory in Iowa so far resembles the path U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz took to win the 2016 Republican caucus. Cruz was polling comfortably near the rest\u00a0of the pack in the summer of 2015, though he\u00a0lagged significantly behind\u00a0early favorites Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, and businessman Donald Trump. In the October 2015 Iowa Poll, 10%\u00a0of likely Republican caucusgoers\u00a0chose Cruz as their first choice, ranking him third. Buttigieg started this autumn in a similar place. In the September Iowa Poll, he was fourth, with 9% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming him as their first choice for president. Buttigieg was 13 percentage points behind the poll leader, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at 22%. Both Cruz and Buttigieg leaped over previously leading candidates in a single poll.\u00a0 Cruz\u2019s support skyrocketed to 31% in the 2015 December poll, overtaking both Trump and Carson. From the early December poll through the February caucus, Cruz struggled somewhat to keep his momentum. In early January, his support had fallen to 25% and then to 23% in a poll right before the caucuses, when\u00a0he trailed Trump by 5 points. Cruz won the Republican 2016 Iowa caucuses, with 27.6% of the vote. But sometimes a mid-fall surge\u00a0dissipates as quickly as it\u00a0began. In the 2012\u00a0race, former House Speaker\u00a0Newt Gingrich shot to 25% and first place in a November poll of likely Republican caucusgoers, after polling at fifth place with 7% in October. The lead disappeared by the end of December, when he fell back to 12%. Gingrich was a distant fourth on caucus night. \"The caucuses are replete with stories (of candidates) who've gotten out early and then came under closer public scrutiny and couldn't maintain their position as the front-runner,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cI think, if I were, for example, looking at Mayor Buttigieg right now, I'd be a little worried. It's November. You don't want to be hot in November because then you become a target,\" he said. \"What you want to do is become hot in the last two weeks of January.\" As Gingrich enjoyed his moment on top of the polls, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania lay in wait. In that same November 2011 poll, Santorum garnered just 6% of the vote, tied with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in sixth place. Santorum\u00a0languished in early Iowa Polls. In June, October and November 2011, he gained only 2\u00a0percentage points, moving up from 4%. He was not\u00a0leading among any demographic groups.\u00a0He did not poll highest on any questions of positive or negative attributes. \u201cConservatives have kept talking up the chances of the former Pennsylvania senator, who has spent more time in the state than any other candidate,\u201d former Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich\u00a0wrote one month before the 2012 caucus. \u201cHe\u2019s just not a factor, and there\u2019s not much time left.\u201d Santorum and his family had moved temporarily to Iowa over the summer of 2011. While he didn\u2019t seem to be gaining traction among voters, he had campaigned in all 99 counties in Iowa. In the final Iowa Poll, published just days before the caucus, Santorum found his stride: He shot up to third place, with 15% of the respondents ranking him as their first choice. \u201cThe former Pennsylvania senator embodies the old political saw: Work like hell and get lucky at the end,\u201d Obradovich wrote in a column published two days before the 2012 caucuses. \u201cHe\u2019s logged over 100 days in Iowa, more than any other candidate, toiling in virtual obscurity.\u201d Santorum and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who had been a strong contender since the summer before, were nearly tied in returns on caucus night. Initially the caucuses were\u00a0called in favor of Romney by 8 votes, but two weeks and a recount later, the Iowa Republican Party announced that Santorum had a 34-vote advantage. \"If you're in this race, until the second week of January, it's not late,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cThe second week of January is when you want to start looking to who's moving up and who's falling back.\" One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle:\u00a0The race is more stratified at this point than most.\u00a0After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of Warren\u00a0at 16% and\u00a0U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of\u00a0Minnesota is at\u00a06%. Everyone else is at 3% or under. Still, candidates in previous cycles have picked up well over a dozen percentage points from\u00a0November polls to caucus night. Santorum\u2019s jump from the November poll to the actual result\u00a0was nearly 19 percentage points. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, climbed 22 percentage points\u00a0from\u00a0a November poll to\u00a0his caucus results. If a struggling 2020 candidate picks up just 10 percentage points\u00a0over the next two months, that candidate\u00a0could be in the running for one of the three\u00a0coveted tickets out of Iowa. Since\u00a0the modern Iowa presidential caucuses began in 1972, with just one exception,\u00a0no candidate in either party has gone on to win the\u00a0nomination without placing first, second or third when\u00a0Iowa has held\u00a0contested caucuses. The exception: In\u00a02008, eventual nominee John McCain\u00a0was barely edged into fourth place in Iowa. \"There's still time,\u201d Nagle said of low-polling candidates. \u201cIs it likely?

      "content": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Buffalo Bills showed again they can beat a bad team, which won\u2019t help them in the playoffs. It might get them to the playoffs, though. Josh Allen tied a career high with three touchdown passes and ran for another score Sunday to help Buffalo complete a season sweep of the Miami Dolphins by winning 37-20. \u201cWe want to put together a good second half of the season,\u201d Allen said, \u201cand put ourselves into position to get into the playoffs.\u201d The victory gave the Bills (7-3) their best 10-game record since 1999. But a recent regression \u2014 they had lost two of their past three games \u2014 and a soft schedule has left doubts about whether they deserve to make the postseason for only the second time in 20 years. Through Week 10, Buffalo\u2019s wins had come against opponents with a combined record of 12-44. The Bills looked like a contender Sunday, at least compared to the Dolphins (2-8). \u201cThey had the eye of the tiger,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cThat was our best game,\u201d said John Brown, who caught two touchdown passes. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t played our best game yet.\u201d Miami was unable to extend a modest a two-game winning streak and lost to Buffalo for the fifth time in the past six meetings. \u201cI thought we\u2019d come in and be more competitive,\u201d said the Dolphins\u2019 Ryan Fitzpatrick, who threw for 323 yards. Allen\u2019s TD tosses covered 40 and 9 yards to Brown, and 23 yards to Dawson Knox. Allen also scored on an 8-yard run, and he had a 36-yard run to set up a field goal. Miami couldn\u2019t keep up against Buffalo\u2019s smothering front. The Bills totaled a season-high seven sacks and allowed only 23 yards rushing. \u201cThe game plan was great, moving us around,\u201d linebacker Lorenzo Alexander said, \u201cand they didn\u2019t\u2019 handle it well.\u201d Allen went 21 for 33 for 256 yards without a sack or turnover, and his passer rating of 117.7 was a career high. He extended his streak of passes without an interception to 163. Brown totaled 137 yards receiving, the most by a Buffalo player in nearly three years, on nine catches. The Bills netted a season-best 424 yards, and their point total was also a season high. The Bills scored on their first four possessions to take a 16-0 lead, and at that point they enjoyed a 211-24 advantage in total yards. Jakeem Grant scored for the Dolphins on a 101-yard kickoff return \u2014 his fourth career kick or punt return for a score. Grant also scored on a 7-yard run on a jet sweep. DeVante Parker set up Miami\u2019s first touchdown by turning a short pass into a 50-yard gain. RISKY BUSINESS A gamble worked but didn\u2019t pay off when Dolphins rookie coach Brian Flores tried an onside kick late in the second quarter after his team scored to trail 16-7. Kicker Jason Sanders recovered. But on the next play, receiver Allen Hurns lost a fumble at the Buffalo 25. \"It's a long foul ball \u2014 that's what it boils down to,\u201d Flores said. \u201cYou have to take advantage of those opportunities.\u201d HOMECOMING South Florida native Devin Singletary, who rushed for 75 yards, estimated he had about 100 friends and relatives at the game. Bills colors filled several sections of the stadium. \u201cWhat fans support their team like Buffalo Bill fans?\u201d McDermott said. INJURIES Dolphins: WR Gary Jennings (shoulder) missed the second half. ... S Bobby McCain (shoulder) left the game in the third quarter. ... T Julien Davenport (right knee) left in the fourth quarter. Bills: T Ty Nsekhe (right ankle) was carted off the field in the third quarter. ... S Siran Neal (concussion) sat out the second half. UP NEXT The Bills face another team with a losing record Sunday when they host the Broncos (3-7). Denver hasn\u2019t won in Buffalo since 2007.

      "content": "DAVIE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Miami Dolphins\u2019 latest loss offers a reminder they\u2019re not going to make much progress until they can block. Miami\u2019s revolving door of an offensive line was manhandled by the Buffalo Bills in a 37-20 loss. The dismal performance left the Dolphins last in the NFL in rushing, and tied for last in sacks allowed. They also fell to 2-8, meaning that for the 11th time in the past 12 years, they\u2019ll finish at .500 or worse. The Dolphins delivered a dud after a two-game winning streak hinted a foundation for their rebuild might be in place. It was their most lopsided defeat since September, and the problems started up front on offense. \u201cDefinitely a setback,\u201d rookie coach Brian Flores said Monday. \u201cThere were some instances where it was just bad technique, bad fundamentals. We got beat one on one in some situations. \u201cWe just have to play better in the offensive line. And I don\u2019t want to put it all on the O-line. It\u2019s everybody. It starts with me.\u201d WHAT\u2019S WORKING Special teams kept the score from being worse. Jakeem Grant had a 101-yard kickoff return for his fourth career special teams touchdown return, a team record. He left kicker Stephen Hauschka flailing as the last line of defense. \u201cOnce I broke through the second level, and it was just me and the kicker, I was like, \u2018No way is he going to tackle me, because if he tackles me my teammates will never let me live that down, and then I have to pay a fine,\u2019\u201d Grant said. Grant also had a 49-yard return. Jason Sanders recovered his own onside kick, but Miami squandered that scoring chance by losing a fumble on the next play. WHAT NEEDS HELP Some things never change: Persistently bad blocking is a big reason the Dolphins haven\u2019t won a playoff game since 2000. On Sunday, they gave up more yards in sacks (43) than they gained rushing (23). Miami is allowing 4.2 sacks per game while averaging 3.0 yards per rush, and no team is worse in either category. Part of the problem is the Dolphins have started seven personnel combinations from tackle to tackle this year. \u201cContinuity is a big thing,\u201d quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThose five really have to work together, especially the guys that are standing next to each other, whether it\u2019s the guards and the tackles or guards and center.\u201d STOCK UP DeVante Parker had a career-high 135 yards receiving on seven catches. Some came in garbage time, but the fifth-year pro is on pace for career highs in catches, yards and touchdowns. \u201cHe has been the most consistent guy that we have on our offense, and has been all year long,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that I know I can count on every Sunday.\u201d STOCK DOWN Cornerback Nik Needham was coming off the best game of his rookie season but had a rough day against John Brown, who caught two touchdown passes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to grow up quick, because you don\u2019t want to just be out there messing up all the time and then people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a rookie,\u2019\u201d Needham said. \u201cTo me personally, that doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d INJURIES Safety Bobby McCain (shoulder) and left tackle T Julien Davenport (right knee) were still being evaluated Monday for injuries suffered against the Bills, Flores said. KEY NUMBER 70-3: The Dolphins have been outscored by that margin in the third quarter this season. It was 7-0 Sunday. NEXT STEPS The Dolphins need to dig out the cold-weather gear. They play Sunday at Cleveland (4-6), which has won two games in a row, and have December dates at the Jets, Giants and Patriots. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL ___ Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "One of the most intriguing visuals in the political thriller \u201cThe Report\u201d is Adam Driver sitting stoically between massive towers of paper \u2013 the entire Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture practices after 9/11 \u2013\u00a0heaped\u00a0on either side of him. The guy who sat in that chair in real life reports that a single detail was different. \u201cI did not look as cool as Adam Driver. That's a very tall order,\u201d says Daniel J. Jones, the Senate staffer and lead investigator whose arduous work is at the heart of \u201cThe Report\u201d (in theaters Friday).\u00a0But \u201cif you get out some printer paper and actually stack 7,000 pages, it looks like that.\u201d \u201cThe Report\u201d revolves around\u00a0Driver\u2019s Jones, his boss Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening) and their efforts to\u00a0bring\u00a0heinous\u00a0and ultimately ineffective\u00a0CIA counterterrorism practices to public light. Review:Adam Driver's 'Marriage Story' emotionally devastates its characters (and you) 'The Laundromat':Meryl Streep takes on rich scammers and 'collusion of wealth' \u201cThis is a story about accountability and about how our branches of government interact with each other,\u201d writer/director Scott Z. Burns says. \u201cAnd that is very much the story of 2019 as well. They're not unrelated.\u201d Looking back now, Jones calls it \u201ca very interesting life for about seven years, for sure,\u201d as he and Burns discuss the accuracy of key \u201cReport\u201d scenes: When Feinstein tasked\u00a0Jones with digging into the agency's\u00a0Detention and Intelligence Program\u00a0in 2007, the CIA wouldn\u2019t let the Senate committee interview officials but made other records available. The base of operations was a\u00a0compact room in the bowels of a secret Virginia facility that, in actuality, was half as spacious. \u201cIt was a basement, no windows, and it had no internet,\u201d Jones recalls. \u201cYou couldn't take your phone there. You know when you really get into something and dive deep? It's almost better to not have any of those distractions.\u201d \u201cThe Report\u201d has many flashbacks to the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d developed by two Air Force psychologists that were at the core of Jones\u2019 investigation, including sleep deprivation, waterboarding, mock burials and rectal rehydration. While Burns admits to \u201ca little bit of movie magic,\u201d so things weren't\u00a0as dangerous for\u00a0the actors as they\u00a0appear on screen, he did have Navy SEALs as technical advisers \u201cto make sure they were depicting it correctly.\u201d Burns recalls asking one actor playing a detainee to point out any discomfort: \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m a Lebanese man and it's really important to me that you show the world what really happened and I want to help with that.' \u201d Everybody seemed to take a side on the report: In a restaurant scene, Jones\u2019 breakfast is interrupted by a CIA employee who tells him, \u201cYour (expletive) report will never see the light of day,\u201d but in one Deep Throat-style moment, Tim Blake Nelson plays a CIA medical officer formerly assigned to a detention site who gives Jones info on the sly. \u201cI was approached by all kinds of CIA officers, many of them offering really great details,\u201d Jones says. \u201cBut there was also the other end: \u2018Hey, this program was great. I'm sure you guys will find that, won\u2019t you?\u2019 We got played on both sides \u2013 it's a diverse organization.\u201d Not surprisingly, the agency had a lot of opinions about Jones\u2019 findings. In\u00a02013, newly confirmed CIA director John Brennan (played by Ted Levine) argues in a meeting with Jones that mistakes were made and addressed,\u00a0but the \u201cunique\u201d intelligence saved lives and led to the Osama bin Laden raid, with Driver\u2019s character getting testy in response. \u201cI was obviously frustrated with Brennan throughout this process,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe maintains he stood up and objected to the program. We went through 6.3 million pages of records \u2013 I found nothing to suggest that.\u201d During Jones\u2019 investigation, he discovers a\u00a0secret internal review by former CIA director Leon Panetta that also found Bush-era torture methods to be largely fruitless and relocates the classified document from the secret facility to his own safe. After the review goes public during a congressional hearing and the CIA enters Jones\u2019 workspace to investigate \u2013 a big no-no \u2013 the agency files a criminal referral against him. Jones meets with a lawyer about his situation, the charges are dropped, and like Jones back in the day, Driver plays it all pretty cool. However, \u201cI get more freaked out watching the film and thinking about it with some distance,\u201d Jones confesses. \u201cYou have such blinders on when you're in an investigation like that.\u201d Feinstein has Jones\u2019 back throughout the entire film, though just as important a champion in real life was Sen. John McCain, who doesn\u2019t appear until the end of \u201cThe Report.\u201d \u201cHe was always there to offer advice, to push through walls that came up,\u201d Jones recalls. McCain\u2019s eloquent speech in December 2014 commending the Senate\u2019s CIA report was one of the things that made Burns want to make his movie. Instead of getting an actor to play the late senator, Burns thought it\u2019d be more powerful to use a clip of McCain\u2019s actual speech\u00a0because \"he had been such an incredible spokesperson for this issue.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "MASON CITY, Iowa\u00a0\u2014 Before she started her stump speech Saturday night, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris told the crowd about the new office her campaign team opened two blocks away. \"Please come by and visit with us,\" she said. \"And you're always welcome. And we always welcome any help you can give.\" The office, one of 10 the Harris campaign opened in Iowa last month, was part of an injection of resources in the state. The campaign\u00a0more than doubled its paid staff here, and Harris visited Iowa five times in October, telling reporters she is shooting for a top-three finish in the Democratic caucuses. The team announced a second injection two weeks ago \u2014 only\u00a0with more desperation. Down in the polls and short on funding, Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez wrote in a memo that campaign\u00a0would shift workers to Iowa from New Hampshire, Nevada and California. Rodriguez said he and other headquarters staff would also take pay cuts. Since then, the campaign has still not fleshed out exactly what this second Iowa infusion will look like. It's not clear how many staffers will be relocated to the state or where they all will come from. Rodriguez's memo was also a bit vague. While he said \"many field staff\" would come here from New Hampshire, the team laid off its field organizers days later. Three of those organizers said they heard of no plans to come to Iowa. Broadly speaking, campaign officials in Iowa expect about 20 more workers\u00a0\u2014 bringing the total number of paid staff in the state to 150. They also expect to move about six workers from Baltimore to Des Moines. Iowa Communications Director Miryam Lipper said the campaign will add\u00a0digital organizers, schedulers and communications specialists here. Asked where the campaign sees an opportunity for growth in Iowa, she said, \"We're trying to just expand capacity across the board.\" 'We've been in constant contact for the entire campaign,\" she said of communication between Baltimore and the Iowa offices. \"But I think there's something to be said about having everyone squarely focused here on the mission on the ground.\" With three months until the caucuses, Lipper said campaign officials hope they can build momentum off Harris's\u00a0speech at the Iowa Democratic Party Liberty & Justice Celebration on Nov. 1. Her \"Justice is on the ballot\" rhetorical device received positive reviews from members of the party and some national political writers. Harris delivered that speech again Saturday night in front of about 200 people at the old City National Bank. She also trotted out a couple of new lines that drew the largest cheers of the night. \"Teachers don't want a gun,\" she said. \"They want a raise.\" \"Immigrants have helped make America great,\" she said seconds later. \"And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too.\" From her front-row seat, Monica Alarcon nodded her head and shouted\u00a0\"Yes!\" in response.\u00a0She did not know much about Harris before Saturday night and later asked a reporter how to pronounce the presidential candidate's first name. She entered the town hall leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden, given his ties to Barack Obama, but she is now leaning toward Harris. Her reaction was not about any specific issue that Harris discussed as much as was about her energy on stage. \"There was a smell of honesty from her,\" she said. \"I can't describe it. No corruption. I didn't smell anything rotten.\" Another attendee, Jim Davis, said there's still plenty of time for candidates to make up ground here. But he isn't sure how someone can break through. He has participated in caucuses for 43 years and doesn't remember his neighborhood ever being so flooded with organizers. During an interview with the Register last week, former New Hampshire organizer Jordan Thompson\u00a0experienced the same problems. He said voters are exhausted and have \"tuned out\" from the campaign. At the same time, he believes this creates an opening for a candidate to surge in the polls. \"A lot of people have very bluntly said they are not going to make their decision until the week of the caucus, until the weak of a primary,\" he told the Register last week. \"That's totally understandable. They're getting so many calls from so many campaigns.\" Thompson, who was laid off two weeks ago, now counts himself as one of those undecided. He supported Harris because he believed she would offer the strongest counter to President Donald Trump in the general election. He said he still has many friends on the Harris campaign, and he wants them to succeed. But the way he and his co-workers were laid off left him upset. He declined to say what specifically the campaign's leaders mishandled. \"This has been a difficult experience for many of us,\" he said. \"I can only speak for myself on this,\u00a0but I believe the handling of the situation was less than ideal. It has simply shifted my opinion on what the future of the campaign is.\" In his memo, Rodriguez name-checked two previous presidential candidates who came from behind to win their party's nomination: former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, a\u00a0Democrat, in 2004 and former U.S. Sen. John McCain, a\u00a0Republican from Arizona, in 2008. The Iowa state political directors for both campaigns said they disagree with the comparison. Kerry surged in the final months before the 2004 caucuses, according to Des Moines Register polls. He was stuck in third at 15% in November 2003 but overcame Howard Dean and John Edwards to win the state contest. John Norris, Kerry's Iowa political director at the time, said he convinced the national staff during a September meeting in Des Moines to put Kerry in the state more often. Like with Harris this year, the campaign brought extra organizers into Iowa around that time. Norris did not attribute the comeback to any particular moment in the race. He said Kerry simply showed up and impressed crowds. Norris rebuffed national campaign officials who asked him to give Kerry a tighter schedule, moving him around the area in shorter appearances. But Norris insisted that Kerry's 1 1/2-hour policy-laden\u00a0town halls were making the difference. He believes this could be a problem for a Harris comeback. Fair or not, voters\u00a0\u2014 Norris included\u00a0\u2014 see U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the wonk in the race. \"[Kerry]\u00a0could just go in-depth on any issues,\" Norris said. \"At that stage, maybe the marginal caucus voter wasn't making up their mind yet. But people who were really engaged were looking for that.\" McCain's Iowa political director, Jon Seaton, also doubts Harris can connect with crowds like his candidate did. But, he concedes, outsiders rarely see a comeback coming. The summer before the 2004 caucuses, having failed to hit their fundraising goals, the McCain campaign shut down its national headquarters that summer and shifted their teams into Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. In November 2007, according to the Register's poll, McCain was stuck in fifth place in Iowa at 7%. He clawed back to 13% on caucus night, enough to finish practically tied for third with Fred Thompson. The finish generated plenty of writing about a McCain comeback, which helped him win in New Hampshire and eventually clinch the party's nomination. Like Norris, Seaton attributes the comeback to impressive performances in smaller venues around the state. In September, with a staff of five, McCain embarked on a \"No Surrender\" tour through Iowa and defended President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq war. In V.F.W. posts and American Legion halls, Seaton noticed that McCain's speeches resonated with crowds. The campaign didn't see a boost in the polls for months. But looking back, Seaton believes\u00a0those simple speeches laid the groundwork. \"The bells and whistles\u00a0\u2014 I'm not saying they're insignificant,\" he said. \"It's a good idea to run TV ads. We had a professional campaign. [Harris] has a professional campaign. But these things, especially in the early states, are really driven by candidates' ability to connect with voters and convince them to show up on a cold (caucus) night.\" Tyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Register.

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Former Texas Rep.\u00a0and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke is pushing\u00a0back\u00a0against\u00a0Meghan McCain's recent\u00a0assertion\u00a0that implementing a\u00a0mandatory buyback policy for assault weapons\u00a0-- which O'Rourke has proposed --\u00a0would lead to violence. O'Rourke told the Daily Beast in an interview published Thursday that \"I think the response should be, \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert,'\" adding \"We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d Earlier this week, McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and an outspoken conservative in her own right\u00a0commented\u00a0on \"The View\"\u00a0that the \u201cAR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America, by far. I was just in the middle of nowhere Wyoming, if you're talking about taking people\u2019s guns from them, there\u2019s going to be a lot of violence.\u201d \u201cI just I think that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful,\u201d O'Rourke said in response, according to the Daily Beast.\u00a0\u201cIt becomes self-fulfilling; you have people on TV, who are almost giving you permission to be violent and saying \u2018you know this is this is going to happen.\u2019\u201d Meghan McCain:'There's going to be a lot of violence' if assault weapons are banned O\u2019Rourke used to represent El Paso, Texas, where a shooting at a local Walmart left 22 people dead. He asserted that McCain\u2019s comments dismiss the problems surrounding gun violence. He continued, \u201cWhen someone says 'if you do this, then this will happen,' almost as though that\u2019s a natural response or maybe even something that should happen or deserves to happen.\" \"When I think the response should be: \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert. There is violence right now and it is horrifying and it is terrifying and it is terrorizing.\u2019....We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d Meghan McCain responded to O'Rourke's comments in a tweet, saying: \"Beto is the only man in all of Texas who would revise \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 to \u2018Please, Come and Take It.\u2019\u201d The original phrase has come to represent defiance and pride to Texans dating back nearly 200 years. As the Houston Chronicle reported, the saying symbolizes \"defiance against someone or something looking to grind you down or deprive you of a right or privilege.\" O\u2019Rourke and McCain have clashed before when he was a guest on \u201cThe View\u201d and stood by comparing a controversial rally in North Carolina put on by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign\u00a0to a \"Nuremberg rally.\" in Nazi Germany. \"You\u2019re talking about Trump supporters, comparing them to Nazis in Nuremberg, that sounds extreme to me as well,\" McCain told O'Rourke at the time. \"When Democrats come on here and wax poetic about extremism\u2014I\u2019m not saying Trump isn\u2019t doing it, but you\u2019re calling everybody who was in that North Carolina rally a Nazi.\" \"From my standpoint, it seems like the left is pretty extreme as well,\" she added. \u201cWe all have accountability for our actions and everyone who shouted to send them back is responsible for that as well,\" he said to cheers from the studio audience on\u00a0\"The View\" in July More:Meghan McCain challenges O'Rourke on comment about Trump rally He later continued, \u201cI don't care who you voted for last time. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Trump supporter or a Republican. You\u2019re an American first before you are anything else and I call you to this country\u2019s greatness.\u201d O\u2019Rourke recently appeared on CNN\u00a0where he discussed gun violence after the shooting rampage in Odessa and Midland, Texas\u00a0that left seven dead. He said, \"To protect our kids, our families, our fellow Americans in public places. At a Walmart in El Paso where 22 were killed. In Sutherland Springs, in a Church. One or two a day all over this country. A hundred killed daily in the United States of America. We\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close.\" \"So yes, this is f***** up,\" the former Texas congressman concluded. The comments echoed remarks he'd made at an event the night before. And his presidential campaign recently started selling a new T-shirt on the website\u00a0that repeats \"This is f*cked up\" and concludes with a call to action: \"End gun violence now.\" \"Beto for America\" is printed at the bottom of the t-shirt.

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, sparred with the hosts of \"The View\" on Wednesday as he defended his policies and electability. The 77-year-old independent said he would work with politicians on the other side of the aisle if elected president in 2020. Sanders said he has \"conservative friends that I like and respect\" while expressing his view that President Donald Trump is a danger to the country. Co-host Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, cut Sanders\u00a0off. \"Can I hear, any in Congress or the Senate?\" she said. \"I\u2019m generally curious about bipartisanship. Can you name one?\" Sanders named Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican senator who recently announced his retirement due to health reasons. As Meghan McCain noted Isakson would be vacating his seat, Sanders continued by touting his relationship with John McCain. \"But they're dead,\" McCain started to say. \"Johnny is not dead,\" Sanders shot back. More:Meghan McCain says there will be 'a lot of violence' if assault weapons are banned Isakson's announcement that he will step down at the end of this year came in the middle of his term. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, a degenerative nervous system disorder, in 2013. Meghan McCain pressed Sanders\u00a0to name a Republican\u00a0currently in office that he can work with to achieve bipartisanship. Sanders finally named Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: \"Lamar is not a liar, Lamar is not a sexist, he's not a racist, he's not a homophobe. He's a conservative guy. It's called American politics.\" During Sanders' appearance on the daytime talk show, he was also pressed by co-host Whoopi Goldberg to address how he will deal with income inequality. She asked if he will change that, as she said candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang had pledged to do on a previous episode of the show. Sanders said, \"Of course I'll change it,\" Sanders said. \"Well, how do I know this?\" Goldberg replied. \"Because I've been talking about it for 25 years,\"\u00a0Sanders said, seemingly frustrated. Sanders also talked about his ability to defeat the current president in the 2020 election should he win the Democratic nomination, disagreeing with the idea that only a moderate Democratic candidate could take on Trump. \"I think the agenda that I am bringing forth is the most progressive agenda ever brought forth by any candidate \u2014serious candidate\u2060\u2014running for president of the United States,\" Sanders said.",
