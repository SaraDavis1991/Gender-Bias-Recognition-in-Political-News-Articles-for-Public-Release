      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0In March, when\u00a0thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers in Los Angeles went on strike\u00a0over low pay and lack of benefits,\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to slam\u00a0the companies and accuse them of \"squeezing\" workers while executives cashed in. \"The drivers are fighting for living wages and better working conditions, and I stand with them,\u201d the U.S. senator from Massachusetts\u00a0wrote. That same day, her campaign\u00a0entered\u00a0expense reports for seven Lyft and 54 Uber charges totaling more than $850. Warren condemned the companies again in May for using a \u201cbusiness model [that] depends, in part, on low wages for their drivers.\u201d But between January and June, her campaign paid nearly $12,000 to the companies, according to public Federal Election Commission filings. The only candidate to top Warren on ride-sharing expenses was Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who\u00a0spent\u00a0almost $15,000. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is general counsel of Uber, though Harris also voiced support for striking drivers. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, who like Warren has frequently promised on the campaign trail to rein in big corporations,\u00a0has also complained about the ride-sharing companies. His message for the companies? \u201cThe greed has got to end.\u201d His campaign still spent over $9,000 on Ubers and Lyfts in the first half of 2019. Sanders and Warren were also among the top spenders at a few other large technology companies, a class of businesses they have railed against repeatedly. In total, the progressive senators paid almost two million dollars to Uber, Lyft, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Their criticisms range from the companies'\u00a0practices on labor to their policies on privacy. The candidates have objected to the working conditions at Amazon warehouses, which Sanders called \u201cunconscionable.\u201d Sanders also introduced legislation \u2013 the \u201cStop BEZOS Act\u201d \u2013 in\u00a0the Senate proposing a tax on Amazon over the public benefits its employees receive. The duo even wrote to CEO Jeff Bezos warning him to stop the company\u2019s \u201cpotentially illegal anti-union behavior\u201d after a video leaked last fall that warned managers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores of the consequences of unionizing. They have also been vocal critics of what they see as monopolistic tendencies at the company. Sanders singled out Amazon for \u201cmoving very rapidly to be a monopoly\u201d at a Washington Post event in July. Sanders also frequently remarks that Amazon \u201cdid not pay one nickel\u201d in federal income taxes, despite raking in billions in profits. Earlier this month, at a New Hampshire campaign event, Sanders noted that he talks about this \u201call of the time.\u201d \u201cAnd then I wonder why The Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, doesn\u2019t write particularly good articles about me. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Sanders in remarks that drew comparisons to the criticisms President Donald Trump regularly lobs at Bezos and the Post. Trump has tweeted or retweeted criticism of The Washington Post more than 50 times since running for president. He has repeatedly accused The Post of being a \"lobbyist newspaper\" that Bezos uses\u00a0\"as protection against antitrust claims\"\u00a0against Amazon, despite assurances from top editors that Bezos allows the newsroom \"to operate with full independence.\" Like Sanders, Trump has also criticized Amazon for not paying taxes, writing on Twitter in 2015 that they are a \"big tax shelter\" with the \"power to screw public.\" He has said he is looking into antitrust policy regarding Amazon as well as\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and Google \u2013\u00a0both of\u00a0which he has also accused of anti-conservative bias. Despite his qualms, the Trump campaign paid Amazon about $17,500 in six months. In contrast, the Sanders camp spent almost $140,000 on office supplies, event supplies, and technology from Amazon in the first two quarters, while Warren spent more than $80,000 on the same goods and services. No other candidate spent even close to that amount, with Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker, D-N.J.,\u00a0coming in third at $31,000. For her part, Warren sums up her concerns about Amazon by suggesting it is acting as both \u201cthe umpire\u201d and \u201cthe player\u201d in online retail by running both the sales platform and selling its own goods. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be an umpire and have a team in the game,\u201d she says. Amazon's ability to collect data and information on all its users gives it an unfair advantage in the marketplace, Warren has said. Amazon has pushed back on this narrative. In April, the corporate Amazon News Twitter account retweeted video from a town hall where Warren discussed why she wanted to break\u00a0up big tech. \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual sellers\u2019 data to launch private label products (which account for only about 1% of sales). And sellers aren\u2019t being \u201cknocked out\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re seeing record sales every year,\u201d the tweet said. Warren responded by accusing Amazon of \u201cintentionally\" misconstruing the facts. Both Sanders and Warren have pledged that, if elected, they will seek to break up Facebook, Google\u00a0and Amazon. Warren published a plan\u00a0on the subject on Medium, vowing to make \u201cbig, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\u201d She wants regulators to roll back\u00a0big tech mergers, like Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and online retail company Zappos; Google buying navigation app Waze and smart home products maker Nest; as well as Facebook purchasing messaging platform WhatsApp and photo-driven social media site Instagram. Warren was also a top spender on Google and Facebook, which do\u00a0business during presidential campaign cycles with internet advertising, digital media\u00a0and subscriptions. She spent over $440,000 on Google, second to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg who almost hit $500,000. And she purchased over $1.17 million of Facebook advertising, more than any other candidate. Yet she accused Google and Facebook of having \u201cscooped up\u201d content from other creators, and admonished companies that \u201chave a ton of our data\u201d when consumers ought to have \u201cmore control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.\u201d Other big spenders on Google and Facebook, such as\u00a0Buttigieg, have their own proposals for the companies. Buttigieg, for example,\u00a0believes it\u2019s too soon to contemplate breaking up any of the companies. Instead, he wants to empower the enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission with more staff, funding or authority. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including\u00a0blocking or reversing merges in cases where there\u2019s anti-competitive behavior by tech companies,\u201d he said during a townhall on CNN in April. Angie Kronenberg, chief advocate and general counsel of INCOMPAS \u2013 a trade association whose members include Facebook, Amazon, Google Fiber, Netflix and Twitter \u2013\u00a0said she was hardly surprised by the money Sanders and Warren were spending on companies they criticize. \u201cIn our experience, Americans have embraced tech innovations and services because it makes their lives easier and better,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to us that the campaigns also would be using these services because they\u2019re convenient and affordable.\u201d Kronenberg encouraged the candidates to \u201cembrace the experience\u201d that their campaign staffers and supporters are having with technology, including its \u201cconvenience,\u201d \u201caffordability,\u201d and positive impact on the economy. \u201cI do think that they need to embrace that experience as they consider potential implications for policy positions they may have in the campaigns and certainly if they\u2019re elected president,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cThe potential threat to the positive consumer experience could be very troubling to voters.\u201d The Federal Election Commission\u00a0only records direct disbursements from candidates\u2019 accounts. However, candidates can also buy Google and Facebook advertisements through third-party consultants or strategists. The two tech giants\u00a0have published transparency reports since May 2018 offering their most up-to-date totals for ad buys, and they show that Sanders and Warren have not withheld their funds. Warren topped the list at Google, per its transparency report, totaling $1.74\u00a0million. Buttigieg was just behind her at $1.7\u00a0million. Sanders' number totaled just over $750,000, which\u00a0placed him midway through the Democratic field, in seventh place, behind other candidates including\u00a0Harris and Vice President Joe Biden. But Sanders topped the list of Facebook ad buy totals since May 2018 on its transparency report, totaling over $2.5\u00a0million for the purchase of 34,000 ads. Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand and Biden spent similarly, at $2.48 million and $2.16\u00a0million respectively. Warren was not too far behind at just over $2\u00a0million. The only candidate spending more than any of the Democrats, according to Google and Facebook, was Trump. The Make America Great Again Committee spent $6 million on Google ads and nearly $11.5 million on Facebook ads since May 2018. Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.,\u00a0spent an additional $2 and $5 million dollars on Google and Facebook, respectively.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump tweeted\u00a0Tuesday, complaining about\u00a0the media coverage of crowd sizes at Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign events. \"They do stories so big on ... Warren\u2019s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!\" Trump tweeted. An estimated\u00a015,000 people attended a Warren\u00a0rally in Seattle on Sunday, according to a report by Bloomberg News. It is also reported that she drew an estimated 12,000 people in St. Paul, Minn.,\u00a0just a week before. Trump's\u00a0latest dissatisfaction with the media's crowd size coverage comes as polls show\u00a0the Massachusetts senator is on the rise in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Both Warren and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have jumped to a virtual tie with front-runner former Vice President Biden in a new poll released Monday by Monmouth University. More:Poll: Sanders, Warren, Biden in virtual tie for top spot among 2020 Democratic candidates However, focusing on crowd size is nothing new for Trump as he has a history of boasting about the attendance at his campaign rallies and speeches. Footage and images of Trump's\u00a0inauguration in 2017 showed that the National Mall was partially empty during the ceremony. One expert cited by the New York Times estimated that Trump drew an audience about a third the size of President Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009. Immediately after Trump's\u00a0inauguration then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u00a0insisted that Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\u201d\u00a0Then, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway famously defended Spicer\u2019s claims by referring to\u00a0them as \u201calternative facts.\u201d Additionally, it was later reported\u00a0that a government photographer edited images\u00a0of\u00a0Trump\u2019s inauguration to make the crowd size appear larger than it actually was after the president was unhappy with how the event looked in photos. Recently, after critics pushed the hashtag \"#emptyseatmagatour\" to the top of Twitter\u2019s trending topics\u00a0following footage\u00a0showing some empty seats at a New Hampshire event, the president shared photos of the event later that night and pointed\u00a0out the audience size in a series of tweets. Offline, Trump has also remarked about the size of his crowds at various events. While in Texas after Tropical Storm Harvey in August 2017, Trump stood on a platform and exclaimed, \u201cWhat a crowd, what a turnout.\u201d More\u00a0recently, when visiting a hospital treating victims of the El Paso mass shooting, Trump used the opportunity to talk about how much larger his crowd had been\u00a0during a rally in in the Texas city\u00a0months earlier compared to the crowd at a competing rally held at the same time by Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O\u2019Rourke.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 During a busy night of Republican response to debating Democrats, President Donald Trump first took a low-key approach by saying he respected his opponents \u2013 but later mocked frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren with scathing nicknames. \"I\u00a0hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said, referring to Warren while speaking to a group of House Republicans. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden). ... He has no idea what\u2019s going on.\" Trump also threw in a jab at South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete\u00a0Buttigieg: \u201cHe\u2019s doing a rotten job running his own city.\u201d As the president spoke Thursday in Baltimore, Democrats who debated in Houston accused\u00a0Trump of fomenting racism by\u00a0attacking people of color and denouncing immigrants as invaders. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke described Trump as a \"white supremacist\" who poses a \"mortal threat\" to the country, particularly minorities. Trump's\u00a0trip to the House Republican retreat in Maryland forced him to miss most of the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\" Trump told reporters as he left the White House.\u00a0\"I look forward to going home. We're going to have to watch it as a rerun.\" Taking a more low-key approach before his speech, Trump said the 10 Democrats on the stage in Houston \"all have their weaknesses and strengths.\" While Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders are moving up in the polls, Trump said he still sees Biden as the favorite for the nomination. \"I would imagine Biden would be able to make it if he doesn't make any major mistakes,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens.\" More:Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront In contrast to his frequent attacks on the Democrats who want to replace him, Trump said earlier Thursday he respects \"every one\" of them. \"It takes a lot of courage to run for office,\" he said. Trump then joked:\u00a0\"See that? I'm getting to\u00a0be much better as a politician.\u00a0You never thought you'd hear that answer.\" During the debate, as Trump spoke to the House Republicans, his campaign tweeted out and emailed criticisms of various Democratic statements on issues like health care, border security, gun rights\u00a0and race relations. \"Thanks to President Trump, black Americans are making historic progress and enjoying growing opportunities,\" the Trump campaign said in one email. After the debate, Trump aides declared themselves the victors. \"You know what the Democrats have barely touched?\" said Andrew Clark, the campaign's director of rapid response. \"The Trump economy. Because the Trump economy is awesome.\" Republicans prepped for their debate response throughout the day, taking to the pages of\u00a0Texas newspapers as well as the skies above Houston, where the debate is being held. The Trump campaign sponsored planes carrying banners with messages like:\u00a0\u201cSOCIALISM WILL KILL HOUSTON\u2019S ECONOMY! VOTE TRUMP 2020.\" It also took out ads in Houston and San Antonio newspapers assailing the Democrats in general. \u201cEvery single Democrat candidate has job killing, economy crushing policies that won\u2019t work for America,\u201d said Erin Perrine, Trump campaign deputy communications director. Trump and aides made their views known during earlier debates among the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0in Miami and Detroit. The Democrats criticized Trump's leadership on those occasions, and did so again Thursday. In a pre-debate tweet, Biden cited the administration's plan to take money from the military budget to finance an anti-migration wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \"President Trump\u2019s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power,\" Biden said. \"It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children \u2013\u00a0all to score political points.\"",

Warren had appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u00a0on Tuesday where she sidestepped clearly answering a\u00a0question about whether middle-class taxes would increase under her health care plan. Warren repeatedly\u00a0refers\u00a0to overall \u201ccosts\u201d and Colbert interrupts to say, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you\u2019re not mentioning in your sentence: Isn\u2019t Medicare-for-All like public school?\u201d \u201cI accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that\u2019s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,\u201d Warren answered, not responding directly\u00a0on middle-class tax increases when she continues speaking. Warren has consistently been polling in the top three in the 2020 Democratic primary field along with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Warren\u00a0supports the Medicare for All legislation\u00a0authored by Sanders. \"Sen.\u00a0Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly,\u201d\u00a0Buttigieg said during an interview on CNN\u00a0Thursday, \"I think that if you are proud of your plan and it's the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\" he continued. \"And I think it's puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Sen.\u00a0Sanders's plan will raise middle-class taxes is 'yes.' Why you wouldn't just say so, and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?\" Buttigieg also tweeted Thursday that anyone \u201cwho lets the words \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 escape their lips should be honest and straightforward about the details.\u201d And Buttigieg penned an op-ed in the Washington Post\u00a0publishedThursday ahead of his interview on CNN, laying out his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" health care plan. His plan, which he says would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, is aimed at universal coverage by providing insurance in a variety of ways, depending on an individual's insured status and income, but allows people to keep their private insurance if they like it. \"For years, Washington politicians have allowed the pharmaceutical industry, giant insurance companies, and powerful hospital systems to profit off of people when they are at their sickest and most vulnerable,\" Buttigieg's campaign website says before outlining his health care plan.",

The race has narrowed to 10 candidates who qualified for the debate, which is hosted by ABC News and Univision in Houston, Texas. The debate will start at 8 p.m. ET\u00a0on Thursday, Sept. 12 and take place at the historically black Texas Southern University. It is expected to end at 11 p.m. Notably, it will also be the first time that former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the highest polling presidential hopefuls, will take the stage in a debate. Previous debates split up the candidates over two nights because of the crowded field. TV broadcast: ABC and Univision Online stream: ABCNews.com,\u00a0ABC News Live,\u00a0Good Morning America and FiveThirtyEight websites, Youtube, Facebook Watch, Apple News, Twitter En espa\u00f1ol: Univision, Univision Noticias y otras plataformas digitales de Univision como Facebook, Youtube y Periscope. Candidates will be arranged on the debate stage based on polling with the highest ranking\u00a0in the center. The following candidates will appear, in order from left to right: To qualify for the debate, candidates had to receive donations from at least 130,000 unique individuals, consisting of at least 400 individuals in at least 25 different states. They also had to reach a threshold of 2% or higher in at least four polls designated by the Democratic National Committee. More:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide ABC's anchor George Stephanopoulos, \"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir and correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos will moderate the debate. After candidates give opening remarks, they will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, with an additional 45 seconds allowed for rebuttals. They will not give closing statements. It will be the first time that front runners Biden, Warren and Sanders\u00a0share the same debate stage. Previously, Warren and Biden have appeared on alternate nights, though Sanders and Biden have faced off before.\u00a0Biden is polling at an average of 29.8%, Warren is at 18.7% and Sanders is not far behind with 18%, according to aggregated data from RealClearPolitics. They represent a split between more moderate, traditional Democratic values with Biden, and more left-leaning, progressive ideals with Warren and Sanders.\u00a0Pundits will have their eyes on how that dynamic plays out, but talking points to watch for where these tensions\u00a0may come up include health care\u00a0and\u00a0climate change. As in previous debates, concerns about Biden's record as an elected official and the numerous flubs he has had in public speaking events are likely to come up. Biden has in the past focused on his relationship with former President Barack Obama and his electability. Gun violence prevention will also surely come up, as Texas saw two recent mass shootings and is also the home state of both Castro and O'Rourke. More:Can Democrats win Texas?

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Doubts among Democratic voters about whether a woman can win the White House pose hurdles for Elizabeth Warren even as she has gained ground against 2020 primary rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos poll. Half of likely Democratic voters\u00a0said a woman would have a harder time than a man running against President Donald Trump next year, the poll said. And while nearly nine in 10 of those voters said they would be comfortable with a female president, a smaller number, 76%, said their spouse or immediate family members were amenable to the idea. And a mere 44% of voters likely to cast ballots in Democratic primaries thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a female commander-in-chief, according to the online survey conducted Aug. 28-30.\u00a0Among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters, just 37% said they thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a woman president. The survey was based on responses from 2,012 adults, including 923 Democrats and independents who say they \"are probably or certainly\" going to participate in the 2020 Democratic primaries. The poll's\u00a0credibility interval was 2.5 percentage points for all respondents and 2.9 percentage points for likely Democratic voters. A credibility interval is similar to a margin of error. Warren, 70, has been drawing enthusiastic crowds in early voting states over the past several weeks, including last weekend\u00a0when she got a standing ovation in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 11. Polls of voters nationwide and in early states showed that the Massachusetts senator solidified her place in the top tier of Democratic candidates over the summer. Former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, has maintained a sizable lead in the crowded field with Warren\u00a0and Sanders, 78,\u00a0consistently emerging as his nearest competitors. Yet the question of whether gender could play a role in electability \u00a0looms over the race nearly three years after Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton. Many voters see gender as an obstacle, not just for Warren but also for 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, 54, and Amy Klobuchar, 59. \"This country likes to go with tried-and-true and a white man is what they want, an older white man,\"\u00a0said Democrat Natalie Hughes, who is African American. The 55-year-old TSA screener from Landover, Maryland, said she is backing Biden because she believes he has the best chance to beat Trump. Hughes said she would vote for Warren if she is nominated but is concerned that \"the American public won\u2019t care that she\u2019ll be more presidential, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll care that she\u2019s more level headed or sane or more financially responsible than Trump.\" \"At this point in time, I don\u2019t think this country is ready for a woman,\"\u00a0said Hughes, who participated in the Ipsos poll. Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson said many Democratic voters worry that independents and moderate Republicans might be less likely to back a female candidate in an election against Trump, although there may also be some \"who have a measure of discomfort on their own and they\u2019re just reluctant to voice it.\" On the other hand, comfort with the idea of\u00a0a woman in the White House has grown in recent months. The Ipsos poll found 83% of adults who identified themselves as Democrats and independents were \"comfortable\" with a female president \u2013 an increase of nine percentage points since June when Ipsos asked the same question. Some Democratic primary voters who are wary of Warren as the nominee say their issue with her isn\u2019t gender but that her progressive policies on health care, college debt and other issues could alienate swing voters in key states. Warren declined a request to be interviewed on question of gender issues in the 2020 race. But her campaign referred USA TODAY to her remarks during a July 30 Democratic presidential debate on CNN where she reminded viewers she unseated GOP incumbent Sen. Scott Brown in 2012. \"I get it. There is a lot at stake, and people are scared,\"\u00a0she said. \"But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.\" Warren echoed those sentiments when she was asked more directly about her electability\u00a0at a New Hampshire rally Monday. \"I know how to fight, and I know how to win,\"\u00a0she said. \"But here\u2019s another key part at last as I see it: I think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe.\" Electability key:Joe Biden is a self-described 'gaffe machine.' So far, Democratic voters don't seem to mind. There were some signs of potential upside for Warren in the Ipsos data. Because Warren is not as well-known as Biden and Sanders, she has room to grow her support as voters get to know her more,\u00a0Ipsos' Jackson said. The poll found that as Democrats get better acquainted with her, they view her more favorably on traits traditionally seen as important to a nominee. For example, when all likely Democratic voters were asked to compare Biden and Warren\u00a0on their ability to stand up to Trump, 33% rated Biden as better, 27% rated Warren as better and 40% rated the two evenly. But when only the responses of voters familiar with all three were counted, 31% gave Warren the edge, while 26% said Biden was better and 43% rated them evenly. When all these voters were asked to make the same head-to-head comparison between Sanders and Warren, 33% rated the Vermont senator better, compared with 24% who chose Warren and 44% who said they were even. Among more familiar voters, Sanders (26%) and Warren (27%) were rated virtually the same with 47% calling it a draw. But the opposite theory \u2013 that less-engaged voters automatically ascribe qualities of toughness and decisiveness to the male candidates \u2013 is a red flag too,\u00a0Jackson said. \u201cSexism matters among the people who are less knowledgeable because, even up to the day of the election, we\u2019re going to have people who go out and vote who don\u2019t really know a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if sexism is moving those people then it can still matter, especially if the election\u2019s close like it was in 2016 when 70,000 votes made the difference between Trump and Clinton.\u201d Trump won three states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 by a combined 77,744 votes, giving him the electoral votes necessary to win the election. Many Democratic strategists say Clinton's flaws as a candidate were the main cause of her loss, not an unwillingness of voters to elect a woman. Clinton\u00a0struggled\u00a0to connect with blue-collar voters and was dogged by questions about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. And party activists say\u00a0the ascent of more female office holders in Congress and state offices across the country since 2016 \u2013 including in places Trump won \u2013 has\u00a0improved the prospects for a female presidential candidate in 2020. But\u00a0some worry that not much has changed in the three years since a majority of white female voters helped the country elect a president who boasted about grabbing women\u2019s genitals. \u201cWe are making great strides as a nation when it comes to sexism, but I still think there are plenty of older men, in both parties frankly, who still think it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s time to be president,\u201d said Grace Carrington, 53, a Democratic National Committee member from Coral Gables, Fla., who owns a home health care company. Warren rising:Joe Biden atop Democratic rivals in new Iowa poll, but Elizabeth Warren is catching up Carrington and others who gathered at the DNC\u2019s\u00a0summer meeting in San Francisco last month said the party needs a ticket that includes at least one woman. \u201cWomen are voting in such large numbers that if there isn\u2019t one on the ticket, there will be hell to pay,\u201d said Carrington, who is black. \u201cIt cannot be two men, and it certainly can\u2019t be two white men.\u201d That sentiment was echoed by Susan Eastlake, 73, a DNC member and national committeewoman from Boise, Idaho, who is optimistic that younger voters \u2013 who may\u00a0 be less likely to buy into gender stereotypes\u00a0\u2013 could help elect the nation\u2019s first female president. \u201cWe\u2019re in a totally different time (from 2016) when you have not just many female candidates but also many fresh faces,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know Kamala Harris or even Elizabeth Warren except for maybe her policies. So it\u2019s a chance to see people for who they are and not what their longstanding public image is.\u201d Overall, only 63% of all\u00a0respondents said the country is ready to send a woman to the Oval Office,\u00a0about the same level as 2008 when Barack Obama beat Clinton for the nomination, according to the Ipsos poll. Warren supporter Tanae McLean, 48, of Mooresville, N.C., has\u00a0doubts about whether voters are\u00a0ready to nominate a woman for president. The communications officer for a local school district thinks it's likelier today than it was at the beginning of the summer,\u00a0given the\u00a0momentum that's growing for Warren.\u00a0But she worries gender is still an issue for some. \"I hate that.\u00a0I think it\u2019s ridiculous (in) this day and age that, that is even a question,\" said McLean, an independent. \"We had a very qualified woman on the ticket in 2016 and\u00a0I get the whole likability issue with Hillary Clinton, I get the baggage that came with Hillary Clinton, but I don\u2019t think there was anybody on either side, right or left, that could say she wasn\u2019t qualified and she wasn\u2019t smart and she\u00a0didn\u2019t have what it takes to be a good president.\" Clinton broke an important barrier by becoming the first female nominee of a major party, said Robby Mook, who managed Clinton's 2016 campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the idea of a woman running for president, the idea of a woman being nominated is novel anymore,\" he told USA TODAY. \u201cI think that any woman running for office, particular executive office, faces a special set of challenges that are hopefully going to be overcome at some point but are still very much there,\" Mook said. \"For thousands and thousands of years, women were not always seen as the natural choice to take on an executive leadership role like this and a lot of that is still baked into our psychology.\" The 2020 Democratic field included six women at one point.\u00a0It's down to five after New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 52, dropped out in August. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the difficulty of envisioning a \u00a0woman in the White House is based on the simple fact that it hasn\u2019t happened yet. \u201cWe will cross this ultimate electability hurdle when a woman is elected and then we won\u2019t have to question all the time whether a woman can be elected.\u201d Margaret Rand, 64, an\u00a0ardent Warren\u00a0supporter, has no qualms about the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0ability to take on the president. \u201cI think she can beat Donald Trump because, first of all, she\u2019s head and shoulders smarter than he is,\u201d the\u00a0retiree from Oskaloosa, Iowa, said during a recent\u00a0interview. \"He uses intimidation and she doesn\u2019t have any problem standing up to people. She isn\u2019t a shrinking violet. \u2026 She\u2019s like the Energizer Bunny.\u201d Contributing: Kimberly Norvell, Des Moines Register",

      "content": "A new national opinion poll conducted by Monmouth University shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as the leading Democratic presidential candidates, though the poll also shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection to be unchanged since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry. Among registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Biden as the Democratic nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came in third place at 15%. Shortly before the poll's release, Sanders was hospitalized after suffering chest discomfort at a campaign event in Las Vegas. \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d said campaign adviser Jeff Weaver. The poll shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection among registered voters at 39%, an identical finding to Monmouth's August poll. His approval rating was 43%, and his unfavorable rating was 56%. Both South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., polled at 5%. Author and activist Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang polled at 2%. All other candidates polled at 1% or less. This poll, one of the qualifying polls for the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, does not change the makeup of the debate stage. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and businessman Tom Steyer polled at 1%, and Yang's polled at 2%, all below the 3% debate qualification threshold. More:2020 White House hopeful Bernie Sanders hospitalized after suffering chest pains More:Poll: Only 4 in 10 Republicans think Trump mentioned Biden on Ukraine call even though he acknowledged doing so Monmouth also surveyed voters about the controversy surrounding Trump's alleged pressuring of the Ukranian government to open an investigation into Biden. According to the poll, 43% of registered voters believe Trump's allegation that Biden had interfered in a Ukranian\u00a0government investigation into his son Hunter Biden's business dealings, though belief in that claim breaks along partisan lines. 67% of Republicans believed Trump's claim, in comparison with 19% of Democrats, and 45% of independents. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murra argued this finding could spell trouble for the Biden campaign \"The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,\"\u00a0said Murray. The poll of 434 registered Democratic voters was conducted from Sept. 23-29, with a 4.7\u00a0percentage point sampling margin of error. For the results about Trump's approval and the Ukraine controversy, Monmouth surveyed 1,018 registered voters, with a\u00a03.1 percentage point sampling of error.",

      "content": "Democrats, to their credit, are the one major party that cares about climate change.\u00a0But it can be frustrating to watch as their presidential hopefuls\u00a0get behind nonbinding policy papers or go wobbly on the hard decisions. Perhaps nothing shows the lack of seriousness\u00a0more than the candidates who play the anti-nuclear card even while claiming to be sincere\u00a0about global warming. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a climate plan\u00a0that calls nuclear energy a \u201cfalse solution\u201d and says it should be phased out by an unspecified date. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan is mum on the issue.\u00a0But, locked in a kind of arms race of impracticalities with Sanders, Warren said\u00a0at a recent CNN town hall on climate change that nuclear should be phased out by 2035. GREEN AMERICA:Nuclear power is too costly and too risky With 10 Democratic candidates set to square off in another debate Thursday night, more bad-mouthing of nuclear is possible in an appeal to progressives who have trouble distinguishing between atomic bombs and atomic energy. Nuclear is an important part of the puzzle in weaning the nation\u2019s power grid off fossil fuels. At the very least, it needs to retain its place. And if a new generation of smaller and simpler reactors can be developed, an expansion of nuclear's\u00a0role should be considered. Nuclear is America\u2019s third largest electricity source, behind natural gas and coal. It accounts\u00a0for nearly 20% of our power.\u00a0If it were eliminated, wind and solar would have to be more than doubled just to make up for its loss \u2014\u00a0while making no progress in cutting carbon emissions. What\u2019s more, wind and solar, while ideal in many respects, have shortcomings:\u00a0Solar is regional and seasonal. Most of its production is in the Sun Belt\u00a0and drops off precipitously in winter. Wind can disappear for days\u00a0at a time. Both need backup sources that can rise when they fall\u00a0and fall when they rise. At present, the only power sources with this flexibility are fossil fuels. Wind and solar, which collectively account for about 8% of the U.S. power supply, can and should be greatly increased. Given their limitations, however,\u00a0they are not going to produce the bulk of our power any time soon. Hydropower could pick up some of the slack, yet\u00a0we don't\u00a0hear a hue and cry to build more dams. Which brings us back to to nuclear. While it does have the vice of the radioactive waste it produces and the potential for catastrophic meltdowns, it is not without its virtues. In addition to not emitting any carbon, nuclear (along with hydro) produces a lot of power at night because it can\u2019t be easily turned off. This\u00a0means that people who live in areas powered by nuclear or hydro who buy electric cars can charge them at night with zero-emissions power. The record on getting rid of nuclear power has been disastrous. After the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima\u00a0plant in Japan, Germany decided to get rid of its plants. It has shut down eight and vows to close nine that remain.\u00a0While Germany, to its credit, is ahead of the USA on renewables, the plant closures make the nation more reliant on coal. The first rule of dealing with any problem is to not make it worse. The second is to think broadly and creatively about all of the solutions that are available. Nuclear power comes into play in both.

      "author": "Aamer Madhani",
      "content": "White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Monday endorsed two liberal candidates who have launched primary challenges against incumbent House Democrats. The endorsements of immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros in southern Texas and marketing consultant Marie Newman in the Chicagoland district offer\u00a0Warren, a Massachusetts senator, an opportunity to underscore her alliance with the more liberal wing of the Democratic party as she battles with Sen. Bernie Sanders for the progressive mantle in 2020 Democratic presidential contest. Cisneros and Newman have the backing of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., last year. \u00a0They are among eight Democratic candidates who have launched 2020 primary challenges against sitting House Democrats and that are backed by Justice Democrats. Newman had previously received endorsements from 2020 Democratic presidential contenders Sanders, New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Gillibrand and Inslee both dropped out of the presidential race in recent weeks, while Sanders is neck-and-neck with Warren in many early voting state and national polls, trailing Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cAt a time when women\u2019s reproductive rights are under attack daily from Republican lawmakers across America, Illinoisans deserve a leader with an unwavering commitment to fighting for women\u2019s access to reproductive health care,\u201d Warren said.\u00a0\"Marie Newman is that leader. She understands that this isn\u2019t a moment to back down \u2013 it\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d Warren on Monday also endorsed two candidates, Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, running for Philadelphia\u2019s city council. The two are aligned with the liberal group Working Families Party. Cisneros is challenging Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was elected in 2004, while Newman is taking on Rep. Dan Lipinski, who has served since 2004 and followed his father Rep. William Lipinski into Illinois' 3rd District seat. Cuellar and Lipinski are two of the most conservative Democrats serving in the House. Lipinski, who fended off a Newman in a\u00a0close primary race in 2018, opposes abortion rights and was the only Democrat in the Illinois congressional delegation to\u00a0vote against President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, because it required organizations to provide employees with contraception even if that clashed with a religious group's beliefs. \"Warren has moved from independent fact-based thinking to ideological orthodoxy,\" Lipinski said in response to the endorsement. \"My opponent has always been an ideologue. She has never focused on how she might serve the people of IL3, but has only parroted the talking points of radicals who would take away everyone\u2019s private health care, eliminate Medicare, and raise the taxes of hard working middle-class families by tens of thousands of dollars.\" Cuellar is one of only three Democrats in Congress with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. The Texas lawmaker also holds a 15% pro-choice rating from the abortion rights advocacy group NARAL. \u201cThe people of Texas\u2019 28th district are ready for systematic change and deserve a Democrat that will be on the side of working people; not the side of big money and obstructionist Republicans,\u201d Warren said in a statement about\u00a0Cisneros, who once served as an intern for Cuellar. \u201cI believe Jessica Cisneros is that fighter. As an immigration lawyer and daughter of small business owners growing up on the border, Jessica knows our diversity is our strength and that when progressives are unapologetic about our values and who we\u2019re in this battle for, we win. It\u2019s time Texans had a champion in Congress who does just that.\u201d Cuellar punched back at Warren for backing his opponent. \u201cWe told you the outside special interests were coming to take away local jobs,\u201d Cuellar posted on Twitter. \u201cElizabeth Warren and our opponent share an agenda that would kill over 108,000 jobs in our region. I'm fighting back. Will you join me?\u201d Justice Democrats welcomed Warren\u2019s support for Cisneros and Newman. The group has criticized the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which earlier this year warned campaign vendors that the party\u00a0wouldn't award contracts to political firms working for primary challengers. \u201cWe are so proud that Jessica Cisneros and Marie Newman are being endorsed by Senator Warren, a strong fighter for working families,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cAt a time when the DCCC is rallying around pro-NRA and anti-choice Democrats like Cuellar and Lipinski, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have candidates for president who remember what the Democratic Party should stand for.\u201d",

      "author": "Aamer Madhani",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month for roughly 64 million recipients by raising taxes on the top 2% of earners in the country. Warren, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, announced her plan ahead of Thursday evening\u2019s third presidential debate. She says her proposal would pull some 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and extend solvency of the perennially underfunded Social Security trust fund by 19 years. The proposal, Warren said, would lead to a nearly 25% increase in benefits for the bottom half of earners and a less than 5% increase for people in the top 10% of income distribution in the U.S. \u201cWe need to get our priorities straight,\u201d said Warren, touting her plan in a Medium post as the biggest boost to Social Security in nearly 50 years. \u201cWe should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program.\u201d Warren has laid out a series of proposals including ones to end college debt, create\u00a0universal child care and fight the opioid epidemic that she says she\u2019d fund by taxing the mega wealthy through a $2.75 trillion tax on American households making more than $50 million annually. But this plan to bolster Social Security, which will pay out more than\u00a0$1 trillion in 2019,\u00a0would also impact Americans who are wealthy, but are far from mega-millionaires. She unveiled the plan hours before she hits the stage in Houston for the third round of Democratic presidential debates. The proposal comes at a moment where she and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are neck-and-neck in many polls, but behind former Vice President Joe Biden, as they battle for support from the progressive wing of the Democratic party. Like the other plans Warren\u2019s floated, the proposal would likely face long odds in making its way through the Republican-controlled Senate. Social Security, which provides 90% of income for 21% of married recipients and 45% unmarried recipients, is funded by mandatory contributions to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or \u201cFICA,\u201d collected from workers\u2019 paychecks. The FICA contribution is 12.4% of wages, with employers and employees splitting those contributions equally at 6.2% each. (Self-employed workers contribute the full 12.4%.) If you\u2019re a wage employee, you contribute 6.2% of your very first dollar of wages to Social Security, and 6.2% of every dollar after that -- up to an annual cap, which is set at $132,900 in 2019. Warren says if she wins the White House she\u2019ll push to impose a 14.8% Social Security contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000 -- affecting less than the top 2% of earners -- split equally between employees and employers. She would also require a 14.8% contribution on individuals making at least $250,000, or $400,000 for married couples, in net investment income annually. \u201cWhile most American workers contribute to Social Security with every dollar they earn, CEOs and other very high earners contribute to Social Security on only a fraction of their pay,\u201d Warren writes of her plan. She has plans:Elizabeth Warren: Send executives to jail for their role in the opioid epidemic Texas in play?\u00a0Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, concurred with Warren that the extra revenue from wealthier taxpayers should keep Social Security solvent until 2054 and would also reduce the deficit. Social Security is currently projected to be solvent until\u00a02035. \u201cThe net macroeconomic impacts of the reform are small but positive in the long run; the economic benefit of smaller federal government deficits and debt load is largely offset as high-income people reduce their own work hours,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe plan results in a much more progressive Social Security system, as high-income people shoulder the financial burden of the plan, while low- and middle income people benefit substantially. \u201c",

Zuckerberg responded that if Warren was elected and looked to break up Facebook, that would \"suck\" and he would fight her in court. \"What would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren tweeted in response. Against that backdrop, Facebook wants to launch a new currency that people could use to buy things on the social network and elsewhere, a so-called\u00a0cryptocurrency. Litan told AP that Facebook can still easily launch Libra in countries that would welcome it, and challenged the notion that Facebook needed\u00a0partners like Visa and MasterCard\u00a0to run Libra. \u201cThe only reason they want the companies is because it looks good,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was never a democratic blockchain. It was always run by Facebook and a couple of financial companies that were going along for the ride.\u201d Still, when\u00a0Facebook announced Libra in June, the company said it looked to grow membership from the 27 announced companies to more than 100 in 2020, the planned year for the Libra launch. Instead, notes ArsTechnica, the association's membership has now fallen to 22 companies. Netherlands-based payment company PayU is still in the consortium. \u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d Facebook said, in a statement to Reuters. \u201cAlthough the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.\u201d Contributing: The Associated Press Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter",

Warren has edged herself to the front of the pack in New Hampshire, where she stands at\u00a027% among\u00a0registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the state's Democratic primary in February 2020, according to a Monmouth University poll published Tuesday.\u00a0The Massachusetts Senator is up 19 percentage points from May, where she was at 8%. Biden is currently at 25%, a\u00a09 percentage point drop from May. This Monmouth poll follows two other early state polling, Iowa and Nevada, where Warren is also inching ahead or close to Biden to take the lead. Poll:More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada Iowa Poll:Elizabeth Warren leads Register\u2019s Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement that Warren is looking \"stronger with every new poll.\" \u201cShe seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,\u201d he continued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is at 12% with Democratic and unaffiliated voters who will likely participate in the New Hampshire primary. He is down 6 percentage points from 18% in May. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the only other candidate to stand at double digits at 10%. More:Here's what to know for National Voter Registration Day There is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Between Sept. 17 to 21, 664 registered voters were contacted for the poll through telephone, with 401 of those contacted were voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary. Sen. Kamala Harris stands at 3% in the poll. Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are all at 2% in this poll. All other candidates are at 1% or less. By polling at 2%, this\u00a0is Gabbard's\u00a0fourth qualifying poll\u00a0to participate in October's upcoming debate. Gabbard now the 12th person to qualify for October's debate, which will likely bring debates back to two nights. It was only one night in September.\u00a0Candidates need\u00a0to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors by Oct. 1 to qualify for the October debate, according to the Democratic National Committee guidance. The next debates will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio by CNN and the New York Times. The debates will be held on Oct. 15 and on the 16 if necessary. With 12 candidates, the debates will likely be held on two nights.",

      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie\u00a0Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had\u00a0led each of the Register\u2019s three\u00a0previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide No other candidate reaches double digits. \u201cThis is the first major shakeup\u201d in what had\u00a0been a\u00a0fairly steady\u00a0race,\u00a0said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is\u00a0at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Eight others are polling at 1% or less. But the race is far from settled: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0their minds are\u00a0made up, while 63% say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. \u201cThe data in this poll seem to suggest the field is narrowing, but my sense is there\u2019s still opportunity aplenty,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThe leaders aren\u2019t all that strong. The universe is not locked in.\u201d The poll of 602 likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0was conducted Sept. 14-18, and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Other candidates have seen their Iowa Poll numbers briefly spike\u00a0\u2014\u00a0O\u2019Rourke hit double digits early after running in a competitive U.S. Senate race in Texas, then fell back.\u00a0Buttigieg surged after a well-received CNN town hall performance, then drops\u00a0in the new poll.\u00a0But no one in Iowa so far this cycle\u00a0has\u00a0seen Warren's steady and sustained momentum. The Register\u2019s first 2020 caucus poll, in December\u00a02018, pegged Warren's\u00a0support at 8%. In March, about two months after she first visited the state and formally announced she would run, that rose to 9%. In June, as Iowa Democrats began to marvel at her organizational strength, she rose to 15%\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though that poll\u2019s methodology differed somewhat from the others. Today, the universe of people who say they are considering Warren in some way\u00a0\u2014\u00a071% of likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is larger than it is for any other candidate. That includes 22% who say she is their first choice for president, 20% who say she is their second choice and another 29% who say they are actively considering her. Trailing her are: Biden (60%), Buttigieg (55%), Harris (55%), Sanders (50%), Booker (42%), O\u2019Rourke (38%) and Klobuchar (37%). It\u2019s also higher than where Warren was polling in June. Then, 61% of respondents were considering her in some way. \u201cThat appears to be a powerful leap forward and suggests that she can improve further, because she\u2019s got these people actively considering her and thinking of her as a second choice,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge number there. Those people can be converted.\u201d Warren is the best-liked candidate in the field:\u00a075% of likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0they view her favorably.\u00a0Next-best\u00a0are Buttigieg, who is viewed favorably by 69%, and Biden, at 66%. But Selzer said Warren\u2019s numbers also reveal some vulnerability. Among those who say she is their first choice for president, only 12% say their minds are\u00a0made up, while 88% say they could be persuaded to support another candidate. More Biden\u00a0supporters are\u00a0firm\u00a0in their choice: 26% say their mind is mind up, with 70% saying they could be persuaded. Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who have held first and second place, respectively, since last December\u00a0\u2014 have hit new lows, though they still outshine 16 other candidates. Their numbers aren\u2019t bad, Selzer said, but the downward trend line is troubling. Overall, the former vice president has slipped in each of the four Iowa Polls the Register has conducted this caucus cycle\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in terms of both support and favorability. In December 2018, 32% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0said Biden was their first choice for president. That\u2019s fallen in each poll as Biden reintroduces himself to Iowans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and as his competitors have targeted him as the polling front-runner. Biden\u2019s favorability rating also has fallen\u00a0\u2014\u00a082% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. Even among those who say Biden is their first choice for president, they\u2019re less enthusiastic than are supporters of other candidates. Twenty-eight percent of all poll respondents describe their feelings toward their first-choice candidate as \u201cextremely enthusiastic.\u201d But 32% of Warren supporters say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about their choice, compared with 22% of Biden supporters. Biden supporters are more likely to describe themselves as \u201cmildly enthusiastic\u201d (31%) than are Warren supporters (11%). Biden does best with older\u00a0caucusgoers,\u00a0winning the support of 35% of those 65 and older.\u00a0That demographic makes up about a quarter of likely\u00a0caucusgoers, and Biden is their top choice, with an almost 3-to-1 lead over Warren. But he struggles with young people. Just 9% of those younger than 35 say he is their first choice for president. Warren leads that demographic, at 27%. Sanders, too, has hit a new low among those younger than 35, falling from a high of 25% in March\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just after he announced he would run. He dropped to 16% in June and is at 11% today. Part of Sanders\u2019 problem: Warren has eaten into some of his key constituencies. Among those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. Thirty-two\u00a0percent say they will support Warren instead, and 12% opt for Buttigieg. Katie\u00a0Naset,\u00a0a 37-year-old poll respondent and Clive resident, said she caucused for Sanders in 2016 because he advanced a far-left agenda focused on issues such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d student loan debt relief and affordable child care. \u201cI aligned more closely with him than Hillary Clinton on those issues,\u201d the family law attorney said. \u201cBut at this point, Elizabeth Warren best approximates with where I am on these issues. She has bold, realistic ideas. They\u2019re backed with a lot of research and deliberate thought.\u201d Naset\u00a0is\u00a0among the 20% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0who describe themselves as \u201cvery liberal.\u201d\u00a0Of that group,\u00a048% back Warren and 20% support Sanders. Sanders\u00a0ties Warren among first-time\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0at 22%, and he's second to\u00a0her in generating support among young people. Twenty-two percent of those younger than 35 say Sanders is their first choice for president, trailing Warren by 5 percentage points. Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0say that nominating a candidate who has a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump is more important than nominating someone who shares their positions on major issues. Sixty-three percent say defeating Trump is more\u00a0important, and 31% say it\u2019s more important to find someone who aligns with them on the issues. Six percent are unsure. But what does electability\u00a0look like to likely Democratic caucusgoers? Asked which of two phrases better fits their definition of the more electable candidate, 74% choose\u00a0a candidate who can excite new voters and get them to show up, compared to 16%\u00a0who say it's someone who excites\u00a0the Democratic base. Sixty-three percent say a candidate who takes positions seeking to find common ground with Republicans is more electable than someone who takes positions moving the country to the left (28%). Fifty-seven percent say a candidate who represents a new generation of leadership is more electable than someone who has a long history of serving in government (28%). And when it comes to dealing with Trump, 54% say the candidate who will \u201ctake the high road\u201d is more electable than someone who will \u201cget in the mud as needed\u201d to take him on (35%). \u201cIt\u2019s very hard not to get down in the mud with him. He just kind of brings that out in people,\u201d said\u00a0J\u2019Andrea\u00a0Gibney, an 83-year-old poll respondent and Maynard resident. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to take the high road\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you can\u2019t be on his level or you\u2019re no better than he is.\u201d Gibney is among the 59% of likely\u00a0caucusogers\u00a0who believe\u00a0government will return to the way it was if Trump is removed from office in 2020.\u00a0Majorities of every demographic group agree. But 30% say they believe Trump\u2019s presidency has permanently changed the way American government works. Three candidates are polling at 1%: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former U.S. housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland. Two candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0author and activist Marianne Williamson and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are polling at 0%, when accounting for rounding. Three candidates had not a single person name them as their first choice for president: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended his campaign Friday, after polling had concluded; U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio; and former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania. Not a single person named de Blasio as either their first or second choice for president in three rounds of Register polling. \u201cThis is what lack of traction looks like in absolute terms,\u201d Selzer said of de Blasio\u2019s numbers. Among those candidates polling at 1% or below, Castro has the largest universe of people who are considering him in some capacity: 1% say he is their first choice, another 1% say he is their second choice and 20% say they are actively considering him, for a total of\u00a022%. But as he's become better known (71% can now rate their feelings toward him compared to 47% who could do so in June), Castro's unfavorability rating has nearly tripled. It's risen from 13% in June to 36% today. The data also suggest that Castro's performance in the Democratic debate earlier this month did him no favors with Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. On the Texas debate stage, Castro appeared to attack Biden's age, asking repeatedly whether the vice president had forgotten what he had said minutes earlier. Fifty-four percent of those who say they watched all of that debate view Castro unfavorably. He is viewed unfavorably by 23% of those who watched none of it. Delaney is the only other lower-polling candidate to crack double digits when looking at the full universe of people considering him in some way. However, that number\u00a0has shrunk to 10% from 18% since June. \u201cMost of them have come to Iowa at least once\u00a0\u2014\u00a0some of them many times,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve hired staff. They\u2019ve made an investment. And if you\u2019ve got people who are getting numbers above 50% and you\u2019re not getting 10%, you have to either really up your game or consider the alternative.\u201d But the caucus field typically doesn\u2019t crystallize until very late, and there is still opportunity for momentum, she said. The top three\u00a0candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Warren, Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014 account for just over half of first-choice votes, totaling\u00a053%. There are now 15\u00a0candidates vying for 47% of the remaining electorate. \u201cThose votes could start to coalesce around one of the also-rans and quite easily pop another candidate into double-digits as a contender,\u201d Selzer said.

The Iowa Poll, conducted September 14-18, 2019, for The Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 602 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 3,510 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex\u00a0and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. Questions based on the sample of 602 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses\u00a0have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are in a virtual tie in a\u00a0new Quinnipiac Poll published Wednesday, with Warren numerically ahead of Biden. This is the third poll in the past week that Warren has inched ahead of Biden, but the first poll nationally. Warren is at 27% among Democrat and Democratic-leaning voters nationally, according to the poll. Just last month, she was at 19% and trailing\u00a0Biden by 13 percentage points. Biden is at 25%, according to Wednesday's poll. He's dropped 7 percentage points from 32% last month. Wednesday's poll follows several early state polling where Warren has jumped ahead of Biden after trailing the former Vice President. Warren is numerically ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is closing in on Biden in Nevada. In all of the polls, Warren and Biden are within the margin of error. For Wednesday's poll, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,337 registered voters nationwide between Sept. 19 to 23, with 561 Democratic voters or Democratic leaning voters surveyed. Poll:More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada Sen. Bernie Sanders is the only other candidate to be in the double digits, standing at 16%.

She previously was at 7% last month. No other candidate is above 2% in this poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement that Warren and Biden are \"leaving the rest of the pack behind.\" \"After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\" he said. Malloy also points to the excitement Warren is garnering among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters.

For Biden, 56% said they would be excited if he was the nominee with 35 percent saying they would not be excited. 55% of voters said the would be excited for Sanders as the nominee while 38% said the would not be. \"Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear,\" Malloy said.\u00a0\"She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee.\"",

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Facing thousands of cheering supporters in the nation\u2019s largest city, Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren on Monday decried President Donald Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh\u201d and outlined her plans to root out corruption in the White House, Congress and courts. \u201cCorruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy,\u201d said Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has emerged as a leading presidential contender. While aggressive, the message was a familiar one. Warren has embraced corruption as a central campaign theme from the beginning of her 2020 presidential bid. But rarely has Warren addressed such a crowd with such a symbolic backdrop. The crowd \u2013 which exceeded 20,000 people, according to the Warren campaign \u2013 filled almost the entirety of the 10-acre Washington Square Park, wrapping around a massive fountain and clogging the pathways that connect the street chess games to the classrooms of New York University to the giant marble arch the downtown park is best known for. It was a younger audience, racially diverse and packed with women. One of the biggest applause lines of the night: \u201cWe\u2019re not here tonight because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all.\u201d Ilhan Omar:Trump admin can't be trusted on Iran if it ' lies about weather maps or crowd sizes' Amid backlash over his plan for homelessness:Donald Trump heads to California The event was set close to the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire, which killed more than 140 workers in 1911. She framed those deaths as the direct result of corruption. Many women died because factory owners neglected safety features to save money, with the implicit support of local elected officials who declined to intervene. Warren charged that the same thing is happening today. \u201cGiant corporations have bought off our government,\u201d she said. Specifically, her anti-corruption plan would \u201cend lobbying as we know it\u201d by instituting a lifetime ban on members of Congress and White House Cabinet secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists. At the same time, corporate lobbyists would be blocked from working for the federal government. Both practices are common today. She also would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts, prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases and ban class-action waivers for all cases involving employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights. And taking direct aim at issues involving the Trump administration, Warren would require candidates for public office to post their tax returns online. Presidents, Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress would also be prohibited from owning businesses on the side. Trump, of course, has refused to release his tax returns years after promising to do so, and the Trump organization continues to do business around the world. \u201cDonald Trump is corruption in the flesh,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe is sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he serves only himself and his partners in corruption.\u201d Warren noted, however, that Trump is only a symptom of the corruption that has infected the U.S. political and economic systems. Warren has\u00a0long argued that the nation\u2019s modern government\u00a0only works for \u201cthe wealthy and the well-connected\u201d like big energy, health care and insurance companies that employ lobbyists to advance their priorities over the best interests of ordinary citizens. Trump:Democrats should look into Barack and Michelle Obama's books, Netflix deals She wrote that popular policies championed by the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing \u2013 and many in its\u00a0crowded field of presidential hopefuls\u00a0\u2013 like universal child care, an overhaul of the federal criminal justice system, gun reform and plans to promote affordable housing have been \u201cstymied because giant corporations and billionaires who don\u2019t want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign noted that she already proposed a series of anti-corruption measures in Congress last year, but it says the proposal released Monday goes further. Warren has emerged as a central player in the broader fight for the direction of the Democratic Party in the age of Trump. Like her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, Warren is demanding transformational change that Trump and his allies deride as socialism. Warren and Sanders are up against Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, a favorite of the party\u2019s establishment wing. Warren didn\u2019t identify any of her Democratic opponents by name. She noted, however, that \u201ctoo many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done.\u201d Warren doesn\u2019t participate in high-dollar fundraising events as a 2020 candidate, though she did before launching her presidential campaign. On Monday, looking out at the swelling crowd, Warren noted that she typically takes selfies with everyone who wants one at her events. \u201cTonight is a little something different,\u201d Warren said.",

      "content": "Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network\u00a0Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed\u00a0Biden, the Massachusetts senator was\u00a0within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. It is the second poll in recent days to show her gaining on Biden in a key state:\u00a0She also has surged in Iowa, edging ahead of Biden in a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released over the weekend. \"Nevada was Elizabeth Warren's weakest early state but this finding is validation that Warren has reached an important inflection point,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"The Democratic nomination could now become a two-person race between Warren and Joe Biden, as she is positioning herself for a first or second place finish in the first three Democratic contests.\" Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4%\u00a0and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucus-goers, taken by landline and cell phone Sept. 19-23, has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Issues in Nevada::Poll respondents said top issues are health care, climate change. The race remains fluid. Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed, 58%, said they might change their mind before the caucuses, scheduled for February. Just 37% said their minds were \"firmly made up.\" The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the \"second choice\"\u00a0of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris. Warren insists it's too early to pay much attention to polls. \"I don't do polls,\" she told reporters when asked about the Iowa Poll. \"We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary election.\" Let's vote:When are the 2020 presidential election primaries? In national polls, Biden continues to have a durable lead among Democratic voters, now at 30% in the RealClearPolitics average of September surveys. Warren has moved into second place, at 19%, three points ahead of Sanders.\u00a0In New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary, the top three contenders are bunched within a few points of one another. Biden continues to have a yawning lead in South Carolina, which holds its contest a week after Nevada. National look:USA TODAY/Suffolk poll: Americans dread the 2020 election Nevada Democrats, like those across the country, care more about electability than ideology. By 20 points, 58%-38%, they said the most important thing for Democrats was to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Trump, rather than a candidate \"who reflects my priorities and values.\" Warren was boosted by her performance in the Democratic debate this month, the third of the series. Among those who watched the forum, she was the candidate most often cited as one who did better than they expected, by 23%. Biden was the candidate most often cited as one who did worse than they expected, at 22%. That could raise the stakes for both candidates in the next debate, slated for Oct. 15 and 16 on the campus of Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio. And the spate of good news for Warren could carry a cost: Her\u00a0rise could well make her the target for her Democratic rivals on stage.",

      "content": "When it comes to doing things, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 and she\u2019s happy to tell you all about it. But when it comes to paying for things, I'm sorry to say, the Massachusetts senator\u00a0dodges and deflects like a Donald Trump defender. It\u2019s estimated that \"Medicare for All\" will cost the federal government an extra $3 trillion a year.\u00a0That\u2019s more than $9,000 annually from every man, woman and child in America.\u00a0Despite being asked, again and again, Warren refuses to acknowledge that paying for this is going to require an across-the-board tax increase\u00a0\u2014 and a pretty massive one, at that. Instead, she keep talking about how \u201ccosts\u201d will go down\u00a0before she changes the subject to how stressful it is to have your insurance canceled when you get sick or when you have to cope with your mom having diabetes. That\u2019s very true, I\u2019m sure. But we\u2019re talking fiscal policy here. There\u2019s a very unpleasant collectivist feel to this. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet\u00a0without breaking some eggs \u2026 unless you\u2019re the egg. About\u00a056% of Americans \u2014 more than 180 million \u2014\u00a0have private health insurance through an employer. Medicare for All would sweep that all away, whether the people who have that insurance like it or not, in the name of the common good. Perhaps worse, as Warren knows perfectly well but steadfastly refuses to admit, there are going to be winners and losers. Costs might\u00a0go down in the aggregate, but individuals and families aren\u2019t aggregates. Elizabeth Warren's choice:\u00a0'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump? For example, Warren keeps saying that the total you pay for health care would end up being less under Medicare for All because it will eliminate out-of-pocket costs like premiums and copays. That\u2019s an oversimplification at best, especially since she hasn\u2019t said how she would finance this enormously expensive project. But it is a given that everyone will pay higher taxes, and it\u2019s older people who spend more in premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \u2014 a lot more. Consequently, older people will be far more likely to see these higher taxes offset by a decrease in the cost of their health care. By contrast, younger people and families at healthier stages of their lives would still be paying new taxes\u00a0but will see fewer benefits. On average, would people be better off with lower taxes and more disposable income to buy a home, invest, or raise a family when they were younger and then absorb higher health care costs when they are older? Or would they be better off forgoing that income and avoiding those health care costs later? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Sen.\u00a0Warren. But this is exactly the kind of thing we need to have an open and honest debate about. Warren is treating the American public like children and insisting that she knows best. This is foolish in the extreme. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to discuss the costs and trade-offs of Medicare for All, she can be sure that, should she become the Democratic nominee, the Republicans will do it for her. Her refusal to admit the obvious makes her look dishonest. Doing it wrong:2020 Democrats, stop arguing about health care and show leadership. Medicare for All is not a good idea. It\u2019s just an idea. It\u2019s up to the American people, after considering the pros and cons \u2014 which, yes, do include much higher taxes for everyone \u2014 to decide whether, on balance, the trade-offs make it worthwhile or whether something else, like an expanded and fortified Obamacare or a public insurance option, would be better. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is exactly correct when he says that Americans want choices,\u00a0and that we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves, for their families \u2014 and for the country. You do that by being straight with them. There are\u00a0many possible paths to beating Donald Trump in 2020, but I can guarantee you that trying to out-spin and out-dodge him is not one of them.

      "subtitle": "Here's how Elizabeth Warren would change Social Security",
      "author": "null",
      "content": "Social Security is one of the most contentious issues in American politics, and as the 2020 presidential campaign continues to ramp up, candidates have looked at ways to change the program. In particular, an increasing number of proposals have looked for ways to expand Social Security to extend larger benefits to some recipients, especially those in demographic groups who have greater financial needs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0has long been a proponent of expanding Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0She recently revealed her latest proposal about the program. Warren's strategy would make major changes to Social Security, boosting benefits for all and imposing new taxes on high-income earners to finance them. Is Social Security going bankrupt?:3 facts most people get wrong on retirement income Warren's proposal focuses on the financial straits that many Social Security recipients are in right now. According to her numbers, more than 7 million senior citizens live under the poverty line. With costs of living on the rise, especially in key areas for seniors like health care, it's hard to make ends meet. Few older Americans have significant retirement savings, and many even still have considerable debt to repay. Warren also notes that younger workers have even greater challenges. Between tough economic conditions in the labor market and high debt, it's been hard for typical Gen Xers and millennials to make much headway toward financial security. Lastly, Social Security's financial condition poses an approaching\u00a0threat. Current expectations have the Social Security trust funds running out of money in 2035, and that could bring about benefit cuts of roughly 20%. Social Security:3 things that determine how much money you get In response, Warren offers a simple remedy: a higher Social Security benefit for all. Under the proposal, everyone would get a $200 increase in monthly payments from Social Security, including both retirement and disability benefits. It would also tie future cost of living adjustments to a measure of inflation that's tailored toward the basket of goods and services that older Americans have to pay. Certain groups would see even larger increases. Family caregivers would have the value of their work recognized for Social Security eligibility and benefit calculation purposes, which Warren says will especially help women and people of color. Disabled widows and widowers would be able to claim survivor benefits earlier, and Warren's plan would reinstate special minimum benefit rules that would ensure an annual benefit of at least 125% of the federal poverty line. Public-sector employees would avoid negative adjustments from provisions like the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. In order to cover these benefits and shore up Social Security's future finances, Warren would impose two new taxes. First, a new payroll tax would apply to wages above $250,000, with employees paying 7.4% and employers matching with 7.4% of their own. This is above the 6.2% employee rate that applies to current wages up to $132,900 in 2019, under the rationale that Social Security should have a similarly progressive tax rate structure as the regular income tax system does. Warren notes that the current payroll tax scheme for Social Security is regressive as it charges no tax on earnings above the wage base limit. Second, individual filers making more than $250,000 or joint filers above $400,000 would owe a heightened net investment income tax at a rate of 14.8%. That would be in addition to the current 2.9% net investment income tax, which is based on the Medicare payroll tax withholding rate. Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally:'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh' Warren argues that the new taxes would simply be \"asking the top 2% to contribute their fair share to the program.\" It's not the first time that the presidential candidate has targeted the rich, with a previous proposal seeking to impose a wealth tax on those with a net worth above $50 million. Critics of that wealth tax were quick to note ways that wealthy taxpayers could potentially avoid paying it. With the payroll tax system already having the collection infrastructure in place across millions for employers throughout the nation, the new Social Security taxes would avoid some of the enforcement problems that the wealth tax would have faced. The Warren proposal breaks new ground by largely disconnecting the benefits that Social Security pays from the wages on which the program collects taxes. That's sure to draw the ire of opponents, and regardless of what happens in the 2020 election, the issue of Social Security will remain a contentious one well into the future.

      "content": "Elizabeth Warren is increasingly less of a long shot to win the Democratic presidential nomination, as a new Iowa poll shows. She now has a window\u00a0to either expand\u00a0her appeal to millions of voters who are uncertain about her candidacy, or make sure\u00a0they write her off. It all comes down to health care. The Massachusetts senator portrays herself as the candidate of dreaming big and fighting hard.\u00a0That is working well when it comes to her signature promise of fixing\u00a0what she calls a rigged economic system that favors rich people and corporations at the expense of much of the rest of America. Financial struggles and insecurity are problems that know no party, after all. And polls show\u00a06 in 10 believe that wealthy people aren't paying their fair share. The same large majority favors raising their income taxes or (as Warren has proposed)\u00a0imposing\u00a0a wealth tax. An even larger 69% say corporations aren't paying enough. Warren's\u00a0support for \"Medicare for All\" and the phaseout of almost all private insurance, however, is working much less well. In fact, it\u2019s scaring people off. Warren won predictable applause at the last Democratic debate when she declared, \u201cI've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d They like their doctors, nurses and pharmacists, she said, and they\u2019d be able to keep them \u2014 the only difference would be the bill would go to the\u00a0government, not an insurance company. That tremendously oversimplifies an intensely personal,\u00a0complicated issue. A few months ago, a friend told me over dinner that he liked his health insurance and would oppose any plan or candidate that forced him to give it up. That came as an utter shock, but then\u00a0I considered the sources of our respective plans. He has excellent insurance through a top university. I have expensive, skimpy insurance in an industry that has\u00a0fallen on hard times. There are lots of people with marginal insurance or no coverage at all. But there are also lots of people like my friend.\u00a0That has become increasingly clear as unions, a core Democratic constituency, defend the private health insurance plans they have negotiated,\u00a0sometimes giving up higher wages\u00a0in exchange. Polling\u00a0reflects this\u00a0reluctance to throw out the existing patchwork of private insurance and public plans like Medicare and Medicaid. Most people prefer to build on the current system, the premise\u00a0of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), rather than move to Medicare-only. Seven in 10 like the idea of giving everyone a choice between private insurance or a public, government-run option (like Medicare, for instance). Even a majority of Democrats favor that approach over Medicare for All. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who all oppose eliminating\u00a0private insurance companies, make\u00a0arguments tailored to those numbers. Buttigieg at the debate\u00a0framed Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan as \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d versus trust and choice, as in Buttigieg's\u00a0proposal for Medicare for all who want it: \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them.\u201d Warren's\u00a0health plan is headlined \u201cHealth care is a basic human right\u201d and says that while we must defend the ACA from damage, \u201cit\u2019s time for the next step.\u201d That step is\u00a0Medicare for All, \"a goal worth fighting for.\" There are no specifics\u00a0about costs, transitions,\u00a0structure or timing. There are, however, details on other ways Warren is trying to\u00a0improve health care. She has introduced bills to make\u00a0drugs more affordable, expand mental health coverage and help communities fight the opioid epidemic. She has several proposals to ensure that rural areas have the health care facilities and workforce they need. And\u00a0while she co-sponsored Sanders'\u00a0Medicare for All bill, she has also co-sponsored a\u00a0State Public Option Act\u00a0to let states sell\u00a0Medicaid plans to anyone, regardless of income. So Warren is not\u00a0as all-or-nothing as her rhetoric suggests. She\u00a0has plenty to talk about besides taking away private insurance. If she wanted to, she could sound more like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, also a Medicare for All backer. \u201cThere is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it,\" he said at the Sept. 12\u00a0debate. \"And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity.\u201d This may be a matter of trying to keep the focus on the highest, most aspirational\u00a0goal, much as Republicans did when they ran on killing the ACA while Obama was in the White House with a veto pen. The difference is that their rallying cry mobilized the GOP base. Warren\u2019s runs the risk of alienating even many liberal Democrats. Mia Farrow is hardly\u00a0an average American\u00a0or a swing voter, but she spoke for many when she tweeted after the last debate, \u201cLove @ewarren but if people like their pvt healthcare, taking it away is too extreme.\u201d If that's what Farrow says, imagine what President Donald Trump would say. Warren's Medicare for All emphasis may be\u00a0part of why\u00a0she is surging (apparently at the expense of Sanders) in Iowa,\u00a0which kicks off the nominating season\u00a0Feb. 3. But as the Democrats' 2020\u00a0standard bearer, a prospect not\u00a0out of the question, she\u2019d be saddled with a position making\u00a0it much harder to achieve the overarching goal of more than half the country: beating\u00a0Trump.

      "content": "\u2013 DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren is enjoying a remarkable stretch on the campaign trail. The Democratic presidential contender drew more than 20,000 to a New York City rally on Monday. She received praise from the crowd and activists at an LGBTQ candidates forum on Friday for starting her remarks\u00a0by naming all 18 transgender women of color murdered in the U.S. this year. And she capped the week on Saturday by taking the polling lead\u00a0in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, according to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. But her success means she now has a target on her back, and some of her 2020 competitors already have begun sharpening the knives. Democratic rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sharply\u00a0criticized Warren in recent days, charging she was avoiding\u00a0directly answering questions about whether her Medicare for All plan will lead to a tax increase for middle-class Americans \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Biden said in an exchange with a Warren supporter during a campaign event Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cSo if you\u2019re willing to pay, and I respect you \u2026 the extra taxes and you think you\u2019ll get that much more for that, that\u2019s good. But let's at least acknowledge, let's tell Elizabeth (to acknowledge) it's going to cost a lot of money, and she's going to raise people's taxes doing it.\u201d Meanwhile, Buttigieg in a CNN interview Thursday said Warren was \u201cextremely evasive\u201d about the tax hike issue. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it's the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd I think it's puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Senator (Bernie) Sanders' plan will raise middle class taxes is yes,\u00a0why you wouldn't just say so, and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?\u201d The tougher engagement of Warren by top-tier Democratic rivals comes at a critical moment in the Democratic presidential nomination. Nineteen major Democrats are still in the race, vying for attention, support and\u00a0the opportunity to take on President Trump in the November 2020 general election. Top of the heap:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Big, Big Apple rally:Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally: 'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh' The new Iowa Poll\u00a0that shows Warren for the first time at the top of the race in the Hawkeye State with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers is just a snapshot of where things stand in the Iowa caucus\u00a0that is more than 130 days away. Still, it is an important marker of the state of the race at a moment when more Americans are beginning to pay closer attention to the 2020 election. In addition to the Iowa Poll, a series of recent national polls following this month\u2019s debate in Houston showed Warren gaining on the frontrunner Biden, while\u00a0Sanders is fading. For her part, Warren has subtly taken aim at Biden and other lower-tier centrist candidates, who she complains lack vision for the country while too often pressing an argument that only a moderate can beat Trump in a general election. \u201cThere is a lot at stake in this election and I know people are scared,\u201d Warren told supporters at her New York City speech last week. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backwards.\u201d Throughout her campaign, Warren has unveiled a series of policy ideas, including providing Americans with universal child care, a plan to cancel student debt and make college free, and a proposal to raise social security payments for all beneficiaries\u00a0by $200. She has said she will largely pay for her proposals through a 2% tax on families with more than $50 million in annual income. More social security money:Elizabeth Warren plans to hike Social Security benefit $200 per month by taxing rich But her and Sanders' proposals to\u00a0expand Medicare\u00a0would cost more than $30 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analyses. When asked at this month\u2019s debate in Houston by ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos if her Medicare for All plan would mean a tax hike for middle-class earners, Warren avoided giving a direct answer. She again demurred during a\u00a0Tuesday appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations \u2026 and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down,\u201d Warren responded on Colbert. Angie Weiland, the Warren supporter from Cedar Rapids who engaged in a back-and-forth with Biden, said that she\u2019s been impressed with the senator\u2019s ideas. Weiland said she would like Warren to vociferously argue that a tax hike to pay for Medicare for All is worth it by making the case\u00a0that the benefits \u2013 such as improved health outcomes and ridding businesses of the burden of matching their employees with health care coverage \u2014 will outweigh the costs. Economists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst project that a Medicare for All program could reduce the cost of care by about 10% through\u00a0lower administrative and drug costs. Another analysis from the liberal-leaning Urban Institute estimates that households and businesses would see about $21.9 trillion in savings and state and local governments would save more than $4 trillion over the next decade. Still, there would be a $6 trillion gap in new federal spending, according to the Urban Institute. Sanders, who was the first to embrace Medicare for All, has acknowledged that the policy will require a tax hike and set out proposals for how he'd pay for it if elected. \u201cI think there is room to improve in making the case on how we\u2019d all be better off with Medicare for All,\u201d Weiland said. \u201cI wish she would embrace it like Bernie Sanders has in arguing that the benefits outweigh the costs.\u201d At Warren\u2019s rallies \u2014 which are starting to rival some of Trump\u2019s gatherings in terms of crowd size and where Warren has bolstered her reputation by hanging out for hours after speaking to take photos with supporters\u00a0\u2014 the Massachusetts senator has made \u201cI got a plan for that\u201d the calling card of her stump speech. Long photo lines:Elizabeth Warren's 'selfies' aren't just for kicks; they're a campaign strategy But Biden and some of her other more centrist opponents have sought to cast doubt on Warren\u2019s ambitious plans without directly naming her. On the day after this month\u2019s debate, Biden told supporters at a fundraiser in the well-heeled River Oaks section of Houston that becoming president was not about \u201cwhat you want to do\u201d but \u201cwhat you can do.\u201d \u201cWe need more than plans,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need a president. We need someone who can execute a plan.\u201d Warren has also repeatedly called for the need for structural change in America and been dismissive of Biden\u2019s focus on restoring pre-Trump norms to Washington. But even as Warren has intoned that the country is in crisis and that the \u201ctime for small ideas is over,\u201d other Democratic presidential rivals have countered that Democrats need to remain focused on winning back voters in areas where Trump won but that Obama took in 2008 and 2012. \u201cIf we want to win and deserve to win, we can't water down our values, and we also can't get so caught up in purity tests that we shut out half the country before we ever get to November,\u201d Buttigieg said in his address at this weekend's Polk\u00a0County Democrats Steak Fry, a gathering in Des Moines that drew 17 candidates and more than 12,000 attendees. \u201cWe've got to do this together.\u201d Warren says she is able to spend so much time taking photos with supporters, because she\u2019s declining to hold big-dollar fundraisers through the primary. But last week a senior aide to Sen. Kamala Harris offered thinly-veiled criticism of Warren, who transferred $10 million in reserves from her Senate campaign fund to her presidential war chest. \"We didn't come in with millions and millions of dollars that we'd raised in 2018,\u201d Lily Adams, Harris' communications director. \u201cWe spent 2018 raising for other candidates.\" Sanders and Warren, two of the most liberal members of the Senate, haven\u2019t criticized each other over the course of the campaign. But last month at a Sanders campaign event in Iowa, the actress and activist Susan Sarandon appeared to take a shot at Warren. \u201cHe is not someone who used to be a Republican,\u201d Sarandon told the crowd during her introduction of Sanders. Warren was a registered Republican until the mid-1990s. While her campaign may be surging, Warren took a more low-key approach to this weekend\u2019s Polk County Steak Fry. Biden marched into the steak fry behind an International Association of Firefighters union fire truck and with a drill team by his side. Harris shimmied her way into the event with her own band and dancers accompanying her. But Warren, a former Harvard law school professor, decided to take a more low key\u00a0yet\u00a0strategic approach to the gathering that drew thousands of likely caucusgoers to one place. Her campaign held an organizing event prior to the steak fry where it trained hundreds of supporters and then dispatched them into the event to have conversations about Warren with the huge Democratic crowd. Some carried clipboards and took the opportunity gather emails and phone numbers of attendees that seemed persuadable. Among the volunteers were Julie and Jim Maddox, retired teachers from Dubuque, Iowa, who managed to get one person to commit to caucusing for Warren just minutes into their canvass and met a second caucusgoer who was leaning toward Warren and agreed to stay in touch with the couple ahead of the Feb. 3 caucus. Julie Maddox said that she expects that Warren\u2019s Democratic rivals will step up their criticism that Warren plans are impractical. But Maddox said she\u2019s ready with an answer for Warren\u2019s Democratic doubters and critics. \u201cWe just have to start out by asking for pie in the sky and then we may end up getting a piece of the pie,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI think the point we have to make is that it could be a significantly more savory piece with Warren than if we stick with the current crowd.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Thursday called for President Donald Trump to release transcripts of phone conversations between him and President Xi of China after reports emerged that\u00a0Trump raised both her and former Vice President Joe Biden's political prospects. A phone call with Xi on June 18 was stored in the same highly-secured electronic system used to hold the\u00a0phone call with Ukraine\u00a0President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, CNN reported. Earlier Thursday, Trump publicly declared that\u00a0China should investigate Biden. \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Warren was reportedly\u00a0mentioned in the phone call as she was beginning to gain traction in the crowded field of 2020 contenders, often emerging as a front-runner along with Biden in polling. \u201cTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values.\u201d According to CNN, \"In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on\u00a0Hong Kong protests\u00a0as trade talks progressed.\" Biden responded on Twitter after Trump first mentioned China, accusing him of attempting to\u00a0\"rig the primary and pick your opponent,\" adding that the president\u00a0\"cannot extort foreign governments\" in his effort to win reelection. \"It\u2019s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security,\" Biden said. The demand for the release of the transcript\u00a0echoed California Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, who called on the White House to release documents\u00a0about Trump\u2019s conversations with Xi \"because we need to know what he has now said in private conversations, because we obviously know what he is saying in public.\u201d \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno on Wednesday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\"",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead a turbulent field for the Democratic presidential nomination, a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but his margin over Massachusetts Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren has been slashed in half. And most Democratic voters\u00a0say they could still change their minds. Almost exactly one year before Election Day\u00a0\u2013 and 96 days before the opening Iowa caucuses\u00a0\u2013 Biden was backed by 26% of likely Democratic primary and caucus voters in the survey. Warren was\u00a0second at 17%, followed by\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Biden's lead over Warren, now 9 percentage points, was 18 points in the last\u00a0USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, taken in late August. His standing has fallen by 6 points since then; hers has risen by 3. \"My front-runner would be Biden,\" Nathaniel Dortch, 77, an Air Force retiree from\u00a0Moreno Valley, California, who was among those surveyed, said in a follow-up interview. Then he added, \"I want to wait and see.\" Iowa caucuses:\u00a0Poll shows they are 'up for grabs' as\u00a0Buttigieg surges into top tier In a sign of the prospect for changes ahead, 18% of likely Democratic voters were undecided. Among those with a preferred candidate, a 57% majority said their minds weren't firmly made up. \"I am undecided in supporting a specific candidate right now because I am not looking for the issue differential, I want someone best equipped to take on Donald Trump,\" said Freyr Thor, 56, a tech CEO from South Pasadena, California. He's worried about\u00a0what he's seen, and hasn't seen, in the Democrats' televised debates so far.\u00a0\"No one has shown me they can take on Trump, including Biden.\" In a match-up between President Trump and an unnamed Democratic nominee, Trump narrowly led, 41%-39%, with 10% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate. Another 10% were undecided. That was a shift, albeit one within the margin of error, from the August survey, when the unnamed Democrat held a narrow lead over Trump,\u00a041%-39%. In the new poll,\u00a0Republicans expressed overwhelming confidence about the outcome of the election, with 86% predicting the president would win. Seventy-five percent of Democrats said their nominee would win. But independents by a double-digit margin expected Trump to prevail. Despite the cloud of impeachment, overall those surveyed predicted by 50%-40% that the president in the end would claim a second term. \"Trump has done a lot of the things he has set out to do,\" said John Siefkas, 52, a farmer and political independent from Osceola, Iowa, who was called in the poll. \"He needs to keep his hands off Twitter, (but) he is doing some stuff that is needing done that people haven't had the guts to do.\" William Collins, 56, an independent who is a retired police investigator from Fort Valley, Virginia, also plans to vote for the president. \"I believe Trump has directed America in the right direction, and I think he really has the American people in his own heart.\" Trump's job-approval rating was 46% approve-52% disapprove, with 27% saying they \"strongly\" approved and 37% saying they \"strongly\" disapproved. More from the poll:Who's sticking with Trump? His seemingly unshakable base. USA TODAY interview with David Rubenstein: 'The country will survive whatever happens now' The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The sample of 399 likely Democratic voters has an error margin of 4.9 points; the sample of 323 likely Republican voters has an error margin of 5.5 points. Those surveyed were split down the middle when it comes to Congress: 43% said they supported the Democratic candidate in their district; 42% the Republican. Asked whether they would prefer Democrats or Republicans to win control of Congress next November, they divided 46%-46%. The Democratic field now has a top tier of four candidates \u2013 Biden, Warren, Sanders and now Buttigieg, whose standing rose 4 points from the August poll. They were followed by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 4% \u2013 up from less than 1% last time \u2013 and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%. California Sen. Kamala Harris was also at 3%, a drop of 3 points from August. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, credited with a strong performance in the last debate, was at 2% \u2013 not a big number, but better than in August, when she registered no support. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also was at 2%. None of the other 11 candidates had support higher than 1%, a troubling sign as they try to raise money and break through. Seven of them had either no\u00a0or only a single backer in the survey. \"I like Warren, Harris and Booker,\"\u00a0said Doleen Reynolds, 51, an independent from Slidell, Louisiana, who is concerned that Biden \"would compromise too much\" with progressive principles. \"But if he gets the nomination, I will vote for him, because we cannot have the alternative.\" The big field is helping Biden, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"Biden's strength has been, at best, fixed, and he benefits from so many other candidates splitting the non-Biden voters,\" Paleologos said.\u00a0\"Overall, Biden has led in the national polls for some time but you can't flatline to the Iowa caucuses.\" The Democratic field has set records for size, but almost one in five Democrats, 18%, said they wished someone else would jump into the race. In response to an open-ended question about who, 10% identified former first lady Michelle Obama,\u00a07% said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg\u00a0and\u00a04% said Hillary Clinton, the party's 2016 nominee. Among Republicans, a similar number, 17%, said they wished someone else would enter the GOP contest. Asked who, 8% said former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and 6% said Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee. Mitt Romney:\u00a0A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party None of the three Republicans who are already running are cutting into Trump's support. In the poll, 85% of likely GOP voters backed Trump. Two percent supported former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld; and 1% each supported former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. Who are the candidates?\u00a0Meet them in our interactive guide",

      "content": "White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants to impose a massive tax on lobbying activities, creating a new levy that she hopes will nudge some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies and special interest groups toward curtailing federal lobbying. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2013 but in that case, all the better.\u201d The proposal might face long odds\u00a0\u2014 a seeming longshot in a divided Congress in which both sides of the aisle have deep ties to lobbyists \u2014 \u00a0but it marks Warren\u2019s latest effort to press her case to voters that she\u2019s the candidate most in tune with looking out for working-class\u00a0Americans. It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls Under the the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures. For every dollar above $1 million spent on lobbying, the rate will increase to 60% \u2013 and for every dollar above $5 million, it would increase to 75%, Warren explained in a Medium post.\u00a0Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade. Warren\u00a0in March unveiled a plan  that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram. Warren then\u00a0slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\" Big tech clash:Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech More:Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them She took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee. \u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d Warren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan also calls for using the money to bolster federal agencies that are being inundated by companies or industries lobbying against a rule. She noted that having such a mechanism would have been helpful during the Obama administration when financial industry lobbyists successfully stymied the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which would have limited brokers abilities to put fees and commissions ahead of earning returns for their clients\u2019 retirement accounts. After a public hearing on the rule, the agency received more than 100 comments \u2014including 45 from members of Congress \u2014 that seemed to repeat industry talking points. Under law, agencies much respond to all concerns laid out in the public comments; the Obama Labor Department ended up withdrawing the proposed rule amid the flood of comments. \u201cEvery time a company above the $500,000 threshold spends money lobbying against a rule from a federal agency, the taxes on that spending will go directly to the agency to help it fight back,\u201d Warren wrote of her proposal. \u201cIn 2010, DOL could have used that money to hire more staffers to complete the rule more quickly and intake the flood of industry comments opposing it.\u201d Contributing: Rebecca Morin",

      "content": "It has\u00a0been a big month\u00a0for Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren. She was center stage in this week's Democratic debate,\u00a0following recent poll numbers that showed her leading the field. Her third-quarter fundraising total\u00a0of $24.6 million\u00a0exceeded former Vice President Joe Biden's and\u00a0put her on par with Sen. Bernie Sanders,\u00a0a top fundraiser this year. But rising along with Warren is anxiety among corporate leaders, especially the growing number\u00a0of women working in the corporate sector, who fear her strident anti-corporate rhetoric could actually cost Democrats the presidency if she is the nominee. Typical was this Warren response\u00a0at\u00a0Tuesday night's debate: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d What Warren\u00a0says may not\u00a0be that distinct from other progressives in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, but she built her political stardom as a crusader against corporate malfeasance, and she strikes a particular nerve among those who work in industries she has gone after. In recent weeks, I have talked\u00a0with a dozen senior executive women at top financial services, technology, consumer product and health care companies. They all acknowledged Warren\u2019s formidable talents but expressed the same concerns: They want Warren to stop relentlessly vilifying corporate America. The women I spoke to were all Democrats who had passionately backed and bundled for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama. They dream of a woman president\u00a0and spend time and resources advocating for women\u2019s advancement at work and beyond, and yet,\u00a0they\u00a0are anxious. They particularly worry that Warren\u2019s attacks on industry\u00a0paint everyone with one brush stroke, lumping in hardworking, well-intentioned, often middle-class workers at big companies with bad actors or self-interested multimillionaires. Many corporate executives, especially in tech, finance and the pharmaceutical industry, have concerns about the prospect of Warren as the Democratic nominee, but she will likely need many of these people if she wants to win the general election. The concerns of the left-leaning working women I spoke to reflect both a changing tide in Democratic politics\u00a0and an abiding fear that any big negatives could sink Warren's\u00a0chances in a closely divided country. They fear that if\u00a0offended, big-company employees stay home in 2020, especially women, President Donald Trump\u00a0could win again. Here comes the squad:Bernie Sanders is big winner in Democratic debate, and not all because of his performance Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, running for president in 2012,\u00a0famously said that\u00a0\u201ccorporations are people\u201d and was lambasted for it.\u00a0The fact is, he was right. Large corporations employ millions of Americans at every level of the economic spectrum. The finance and insurance industries\u00a0employ 6.1 million people.\u00a0The pharmaceutical\u00a0industry supports 4.7 million jobs,\u00a0which include manufacturing and other middle-income occupations, and the tech sector is estimated to employ\u00a011.8 million people.\u00a0These include middle-income folks working IT, back offices, retail services and administration. And among those millions are, of course, millions of women who have steadily risen in the corporate ranks over the past 40 years and are paying close attention to this election. And yet\u00a0those women, so essential to a Democratic win in 2020, could stay on the sidelines if they feel attacked or vilified by the nominee. It\u2019s not just people working in targeted industries who may find that Warren\u2019s attacks don\u2019t resonate. There is evidence that the general public does not view companies broadly as bad actors.\u00a0An\u00a0Edelman\u00a0poll released this year found that trust in companies is rising. At the same time, according to the Pew Research Center, trust in government is near historic lows. That trust in business has risen for good reason. Over the past decade, big companies have stepped up to fill voids where government has failed. On everything from paid leave and LGBTQ equity\u00a0to environmental stewardship\u00a0and philanthropy, the banking industry and other large corporations have\u00a0been essential to progress on many issues that candidates like Warren care about. Let's break it down:5 reasons why Elizabeth Warren has the best chance to beat Donald Trump Should companies be held to account when they pollute, corrupt or break the public trust? Of course. But they also should be given credit where it\u2019s due. Warren has shown a remarkable ability to read the mood and passions of voters, and it has paid off in big ways. But to win the presidency, she might\u00a0need to consider a more inclusive, even nuanced approach. It remains to be seen if she\u2019s willing.

      "content": "Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment:5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "author": "Jeanine Santucci",
      "content": "One story that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly told on the 2020 campaign trail is about how she was let go from her first teaching job when she was 22, after school officials realized she was pregnant. But now Warren is on the defense with her account after an interview\u00a0from over a decade ago resurfaced in which she\u00a0described\u00a0the circumstances around her departure from the school district in a different way, and conservative outlets acquired\u00a0meeting notes from the school board of the time showing that her contract was extended. The Democratic presidential hopeful is now using her circumstance to highlight the stories of other women in the United States who have faced gender-based\u00a0discrimination. \"We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\" Warren said in a tweet on Tuesday. Warren's story goes like this: In 1971, she was offered an extra year to her contract after completing her first year as a teacher, before the school knew that she was pregnant. But after a couple months, once her pregnancy became obvious, \"The principal did what principals did in those days\u2014wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\" This all occurred before pregnancy discrimination was outlawed by Congress in 1978. More:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls In an interview\u00a0from 2007, Warren said\u00a0that she left her job and stayed home with her new family. \"I actually didn't have the education courses, so I was on an emergency certificate, it was called, and I\u00a0went back to graduate school and took a couple courses in education, and said 'I don't think this is going to work out for me,'\" she said. \"And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I Was really casting about thinking, 'What am I going to do?'\" In a statement to\u00a0CBS News, Warren attempted to clarify\u00a0the discrepancy. \"After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator,\"\u00a0she said. The school board meeting notes, which CBS also reviewed, include mention of her resignation. Conservatives have latched on to the changes in her account as yet another example of a \"made up\" story,\u00a0along with the now infamous\u00a0claim\u00a0to Native American ancestry. \"What you have here is a pattern of someone who's been successful\u2014and by the way she has been successful, she's a U.S. senator\u2014but rather than say, 'I've been successful,' she has claimed repeatedly to be the victim of discrimination,\" said Fox News' Tucker Carlson. But many women have come forward with their stories of pregnancy and gender discrimination to show that they believe Warren. \"I think of how this resonates with so many millions of women across this country and people who have been in, if not that exact\u00a0situation, similar situations,\" Warren told CBS. Warren has recently gained ground on 2020 rival former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, putting her in the lead in poll averages for the first time.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday. Trump \u2013 who has\u00a0a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58%\u00a0\u2013\u00a0trails\u00a0by\u00a0sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%);\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%);\u00a0South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%). Each of those Democratic candidates\u00a0performed\u00a0well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and\u00a0all of them expanded\u00a0those leads in this week's survey. Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is\u00a0not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances. Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that \"the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020\" won't start coming out until after the holiday season. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment \"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states,\" Johnson said. \"But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points.\" MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there\u00a0\"literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national\u00a0more than a year out from the election.\" \"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident,\" he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College. A recent poll\u00a0from\u00a0The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading\u00a0Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona. More:Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds According to the Post-ABC poll,\u00a0most Americans share\u00a0negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say\u00a0they don't think the president is\u00a0\"honest and trustworthy,\" 62% say\u00a0he lacks\u00a0presidential\u00a0temperament, 60% say\u00a0he does\u00a0not understand their problems, 55% say\u00a0he is not good at making political deals and 54% say\u00a0he is\u00a0not a strong leader. Fifty-four percent say the United States is\u00a0less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses\u00a0the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable. Forty-nine percent favor\u00a0impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill\u00a0Clinton's impeachment at 27% to\u00a041% in 1998. Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U.S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did\u00a0something wrong\u00a0\u2013 though 8% say they don't\u00a0think it was a serious matter. Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want\u00a0to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and\u00a030% say\u00a0they would prefer someone else. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and\u00a0Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When asked who has\u00a0the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say\u00a0Biden, 17% say\u00a0Warren and 16% say\u00a0Sanders.

      "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been in a feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and now she's using his own platform against him with a new ad\u00a0calling out the Facebook policy against fact-checking politicians. \"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" the ad begins. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?'\" it continues. \"Well it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\" Warren is referring\u00a0to a Facebook advertising policy that allows for politicians to present false or misleading information in ads due to the belief that any statement from a political figure is important to the public interest. Facebook ads, in general, are subject to a third-party fact-checking system. Ads with claims debunked by the fact-checkers are prohibited. Facebook says that ads are reviewed prior to being made public. Politicians, however, are exempt from that fact-checking program. A senior Facebook official explained that policy in a speech last month. \"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said. \"We don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\" Clegg added. Rather, Facebook \"demotes\" politician-generated ad content that has previously been determined false. The politician advertising policy has\u00a0come under recent scrutiny because of a Trump campaign ad featuring claims about former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine that is not supported\u00a0with credible\u00a0evidence. The Biden campaign requested that Facebook and other sites remove that ad due to misinformation, but Facebook refused, citing its policy. \"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" Trump's ad claimed. In fact, the prosecutor in question was considered by the United States and\u00a0international\u00a0groups to be ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0There is no credible evidence\u00a0for the assertion that the ouster of the prosecutor was intended to benefit Hunter Biden. More:CNN says it won't air a Trump campaign ad featuring 'false' claim against Biden Warren said in her ad, \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\" CNN and NBCUniversal both refused to air Trump's ad targeting Biden with the Ukraine claims. The Trump campaign spent more than $1 million on Facebook\u00a0ads in one week in September\u00a0to beat back the impeachment inquiry, ABC News reports.\u00a0The ads come as House Democrats push their impeachment inquiry over whether the president pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. Warren's ad is the latest in her battle with big tech companies over her plan to promote competition in the tech industry and roll back tech company mergers, such as Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp. In leaked audio published by\u00a0The Verge, Zuckerberg said\u00a0\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" Warren replied in a\u00a0series of\u00a0tweets, saying she is \"not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\" More:Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech \"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Warren tweeted\u00a0Saturday about her new Facebook ad. \"If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN in a statement.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's approval rating may be underwater, and about half of the country may want him impeached, but he still has shot to win in the half-dozen\u00a0battleground states that could secure his reelection next year, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College. The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan. Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the\u00a0Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election. The Times said the results of the poll \"suggest that the president\u2019s\u00a0advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole\u00a0remains intact or has even grown\u00a0since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could \u2013 for the third time in the past six elections \u2013 win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\" And The Times\u00a0said the results showed \"little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward\u00a0winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016.\" Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42%\u00a0\u2013 his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018\u00a0\u2013 and his disapproval at 57%. And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%. Forty-nine percent of registered voters said they thought he should be impeached and convicted in the Senate in Sunday's Fox News poll. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president?

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary:Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency:Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden dodged some of the piling on from other 2020 candidates he has seen in previous Democratic debates, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here. Tell us how you're going to do what you say you're going to do\" More:Elizabeth Warren is a new front-runner in town. Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

      "content": "The fourth round of the Democratic primary debates saw a record 12 candidates battling it out over top issues, while\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is underway. The focus shifted from former Vice President Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility. Here are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate: As expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. When asked about his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected. Foreign business deals:Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter)\u00a0made.\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct. Ukraine explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases This debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support\u00a0with varying levels of enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to\u00a0determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him\u00a0how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election\u00a0makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives\u00a0while pursuing impeachment:\u00a0\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\" Sen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d Warren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was\u00a0Warren's turn to take some hits. Warren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer. Costs will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\" \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan. Polls:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls More data:Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio Klobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump. \"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan. \u201cI\u00a0appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan.\u00a0\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d According to CNN's tracker, Warren\u00a0had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes. At the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate. O'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a\u00a0\u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support. More on\u00a0buyback debate:Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d Calling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said,\u00a0\"I\u00a0don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been\u00a0lost to gun violence. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d In a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election. \"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is\u00a0\u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable. Candidates' ages:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like. Sanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage. Biden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said. Warren, 70, said she'd\u00a0\"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. On the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37.\u00a0She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important. After a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate. \"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said. Later in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department\u00a0review before states passed anti-abortion laws. Klobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More:Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September. Warren is the choice of 50% of Democratic voters\u00a0and independents who lean Democratic\u00a0who identify as \"very liberal\"\u00a0in the poll from Quinnipiac. Sanders and Biden are tied at 14% within that group. Among those who call themselves \"somewhat liberal,\" Warren finishes\u00a0first at 34%, Sanders comes in at 17% and Biden at 15%. Biden is\u00a0the clear favorite among those who identify\u00a0as conservative Democrats at 36%;\u00a0Warren comes in second at 19%, and Sanders is third at 6%.

But Democratic voters indicate\u00a0defeating President Donald Trump in the general election is their top priority, and about half of Democratic voters see Biden as the candidate best equipped to pull that off. Forty-eight percent say Biden has\u00a0the best chance of defeating Trump, and 21% see\u00a0Warren as the candidate with the best shot. While Biden has hovered at 42% to\u00a056% in Quinnipiac polls on this question, Warren had never finished higher than 9% in previous surveys from the pollster. More:Elizabeth Warren leads\u00a0Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primary polls When asked which Democratic candidate they think would be the best leader, 32% say\u00a0Biden and 28% say\u00a0Warren. On the question of impeachment, 46% say\u00a0Trump should be removed from office, and\u00a048% oppose\u00a0such a move. A\u00a0narrow majority of 51% approve\u00a0of the Democrat-controlled House's move to open an impeachment inquiry, and 59% say\u00a0they disapprove\u00a0of the way Trump has responded to the inquiry. Fifty-one percent say the impeachment is a \"legitimate\" investigation, and\u00a043% say\u00a0it is a \"political witch hunt.\" Though 66% say it is \"not acceptable\" for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump encouraged\u00a0Ukraine to look at\u00a0Biden, only 44% say\u00a0that is a good enough reason to remove a president from office. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Oct. 11-13 among 1,195 registered voters. It has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

      "content": "I know this seems wild. But it's true: I'm 44, and within my lifetime, it was legal to fire women because they were pregnant. It's difficult to imagine.\u00a0But a few short decades ago, it was an unquestioned reality that pregnant women didn't belong at work, a conjunction of cultural norms\u00a0that strictly defined women's priorities as domestic, regardless of the circumstances of that woman's life. And in some workplaces, because of\u00a0even harder-to-understand ideas about sex. My mother is 87, and she taught school in the 1950s, one of few professional options for women who wanted or needed to work.\u00a0At the schools where my mother taught, she told me, it was simply understood that you wouldn't be able to keep teaching while pregnant, and the same norms applied in other professions. Why are we talking about this now? Because some media reports have questioned\u00a0a story Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Elizabeth Warren tells on the campaign trail, about being \"shown the door\" at her first teaching job in 1971\u00a0after becoming pregnant with her first child. Some outlets have dug\u00a0up school board meeting minutes that show Warren's contract was extended (Warren says that happened before she revealed her pregnancy),\u00a0and a politely phrased district announcement of her departure as evidence that this story just can't be true. Policies make some choices easier::I shouldn't have had to fight to be a stay-at-home mom. We need family-friendly policies. But that's kind of the point, my mother said. Firing a pregnant woman wasn't an extreme or objectionable act. \"They didn\u2019t want pregnant women in the classroom,\" she said. For\u00a0folks who lived through this era, that was as clear as it was unremarkable. \"When someone suddenly was missing during the school year, or the word came out that this year that so-and-so wouldn\u2019t be back,\u00a0it was because she was pregnant,\" my mother said. \"I\u2019m quite sure they didn\u2019t say 'Now that you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re being fired.'\" Things hadn't changed much by 1971. \"In the late 1960s and 1970s, you\u00a0have all this legislation pouring out that\u2019s trying to address political equality, social equality, economic equality, but you still haven\u2019t dislodged all these unwritten norms that try to nudge people into behaving in a certain way,\" said Janine Lanza, an associate professor of history at Wayne State University. And most of these norms were\u00a0aimed at constraining the agency women could exercise, whether in the workplace or with regard to their own sexuality. Treatment is out of reach for most:As a new mom, postpartum depression made the most wonderful time of my life also the worst \"They didn\u2019t have to write it down. It would be a very clear subtext of this conversation that if she was pregnant, her place was to be at home with the child, and not in the workplace. That was the assumption.\" Women's connection to work was presumed to be tenuous, Lanza said, and secondary to their responsibilities to their husbands and families. \"It was this idea that\u00a0men belong in public space, and women belong in private space,\" she said. There was also, my mother said, a weird sex thing. Unmarried women who had obvious sexual relationships faced steep social and economic penalties. But it was also dicey for married women, particularly women who taught young children, during\u00a0an era in which most couples on television were shown sleeping in separate beds, and a ground-breaking episode of \"I Love Lucy\" written to accommodate star Lucille Ball's second pregnancy couldn't use the word \"pregnant,\" considered too vulgar for the airwaves. \"Pregnancy would have brought up the question of sex, and at that point there were no sex ed classes, none of that,\" my mother said. \"They didn\u2019t want married women flaunting their marriages by being pregnant. They really didn\u2019t want the word 'sex'\u00a0ever mentioned. \"It was weird.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t as horrible as the Victorian age. But there were a lot of holdovers.\" After the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\u00a0in 1978, women who had lost or were at risk of losing a job\u00a0because of pregnancy had some legal resource. In a way, I suppose it's good that things have changed so much\u00a0\u2014 that an absolute fact of life for women a half-century ago is so outrageous now that we struggle to grasp it. But it's also true that in some ways, we're still laboring under the assumption that men belong in public life, and that women are there on tolerance. That's why female candidates like Warren have to defend their own stories. And why it's so important not to let the bad old days fade from memory.

      "content": "Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren. National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest \u2013 that would be the rivals competing for the nomination \u2013 were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates. Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed \u201cwealth tax\u201d could fly. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren declared.\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed\u00a0\u201creality check\u201d on Warren. \u201cI'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. \"I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\" Winners and losers:Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense The debate didn\u2019t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else\u00a0\u2013 Klobuchar,\u00a0South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left.\u00a0During the debate, he teased that he would have a \"special guest\" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday.\u00a0That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party\u2019s most influential young liberal voices. All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family\u2019s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through\u00a0\u2013 in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher. And when the debate was over? The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. \"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware. That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Sanders fired back at Biden, too. \"I say this as a friend,\" he said, \"but you got the Iraq war done.\" Biden vs. Warren:Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.\u00a0Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her\u00a0time to respond to attacks.\u00a0In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2. Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.",

      "author": "null",
      "content": "Hallelujah. In Michael Bloomberg, Democrats have just what they need: another presidential candidate who was alive when Harry Truman occupied the White House. The former New York mayor and billionaire business tycoon is 77. Until Donald Trump's victory in 2016, Americans had never elected a president who was 70 upon entering office. The age of the world's most powerful person is critically important, and most voters acknowledge it. Yet in the 2020 campaign, the issue is largely ignored. Why? Back on Oct. 1, when 78-year-old Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack, it set off a flurry of worry about aging politicians. But just a couple of weeks\u00a0later, with the Vermont senator looking robust and his usual frisky self in a three-hour debate, opinion flipped. Sanders, many said, was living proof that age doesn't matter. In truth, neither Sanders' heart incident nor his declaration soon after that \"I am back!\" changed anything about the physical and mental odds facing older candidates. We tend to evaluate politicians' fitness to serve based on the image they present in public. By that measure, Sanders looks vigorous now that he's back on the trail; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70,\u00a0bounds around the stage with pep in her steps; Trump, 73,\u00a0seems tireless delivering lengthy speeches at campaign rallies;\u00a0and former Vice President Joe Biden, 76,\u00a0appears lean and fit. Then again, just a few days before being stricken in Las Vegas, Sanders seemed as healthy as ever. Trump's tan from a bottle might help project an image of physical well-being, but his actions in office have prompted many to question his mental health. Biden has fumbled badly in campaign appearances, placing his cognitive faculties in doubt. Only Warren, youngest of the leading septuagenarians, shows no outward signs of aging, but even she is at a point in life when the odds turn against you. It\u2019s not surprising that Trump supporters aren\u2019t focusing on the president\u2019s age. With impeachment proceedings dominating the news and the White House staff unraveling, age becomes the kind of thing the late George Carlin spoke of in his comedy weather forecast when he said: The radar is picking up Russian ICBMs, so I wouldn't sweat the thundershowers. On the Democratic side, the goal of defeating Trump is so dominant that little else seems to matter. When Pew researchers asked Democratic voters about age, 97% said it would be better to have a presidential candidate younger than 70. Yet, the Real Clear Politics polling average\u00a0shows about two-thirds of Democratic primary voters supporting candidates 70 or older\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Biden, Sanders and\u00a0Warren. This disconnect might be due to voters\u2019 understanding that people do age differently. They see vibrant public servants like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 79,\u00a0and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86,\u00a0and dismiss concerns about the age of presidential contenders. Uneasy feeling:Joe Biden isn't the boringly reassuring candidate Democrats were hoping for Yet, the science of aging is clear-cut regarding factors that affect a president\u2019s ability to serve. As people grow older, their ability to multitask diminishes, as does their recall of new or recently learned information. Here is one particularly pointed observation from a paper on aging by the noted author Dr. Diane Howieson: \u201cOlder adults tend to be slower in conceptualizing problems and less ready to change strategies when circumstances shift.\u201d How would that work in the White House Situation Room? Former President Jimmy Carter, a marvel of clear-headedness at 95, said recently that by the time he reached 80, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president. For one thing you had to be very flexible\u00a0with your mind. You had\u00a0to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then\u00a0put them all together in a comprehensive way.\u201d Among the things that do improve with age is experience, which is often quantified as \u201cwisdom.\u201d Biden spoke of it in the October debate: \u201cLook, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom.\u201d When Sanders was asked about his health and age, he said: \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d Same question to Warren and a similar answer: \u201cI will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone.\u201d Three predictable responses, none of which addressed the reality about aging that concerns Carter. How older candidates look and sound today might be a good indicator of how well they would function tomorrow or next month. But the\u00a0candidates are seeking a term that would end half a decade from now. Maximum age:I'm the same age as Elizabeth Warren. We 70-somethings have no business being president. Some Democrats would like Biden and Sanders to pledge to only serve one term. A related\u00a0suggestion is\u00a0they'd\u00a0be wise to select a significantly younger running mate, who could step in if needed\u00a0or move to the top of the ticket after four years. How awful. The process of replacing a president is traumatic for the nation and on the world stage, no matter what the circumstances. And betting that a vice president could move up and win the next election is no sure thing. Carter believes there should be an age limit for presidents, which sounds like a good idea that comes from wisdom gained by experience. Of course, it\u2019s too late for that sort of thing in the 2020 campaign. But there is time, when the primary-season voting begins in February, to thank the older candidates for their service and turn to someone younger.

Those polls indicate the president could face an uphill battle in his fight for reelection\u00a0\u2013 though Trump has dismissed them as \"fake. A new poll from The Atlanta-Journal Constitution finds Trump\u00a0is trailing the five leading Democrats\u00a0in Georgia, a Republican stronghold where he\u00a0beat Hillary Clinton by five points.

      "content": "INDIANOLA, Iowa \u2013 Elizabeth Warren said she is planning to release information soon that outlines how she will pay for her \"Medicare for All\" plan. The issue has followed the Massachusetts senator in at least two Democratic presidential debates as she has declined to say whether taxes will go up to pay for her proposal, which would abolish private health insurance in favor of Medicare for every American. \"Right now, the cost estimates on Medicare for All vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to fund it \u2013 there are a lot of them,\" she said to a crowd of about 475 at Simpson College. \"So this is something I\u2019ve been working on for months and months and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it's finished.\" Warren is a cosponsor of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, introduced in the Senate more than two years ago. The senator from Vermont has said taxes will go up to pay for his plan, but all out-of-pocket expenses like co-pays, premiums and deductibles would be eliminated. There's a new front-runner in town:Elizabeth Warren. Just ask her Democratic rivals While Warren has been known to release robust policies and plans that detail ways to pay for them, she has yet to outline how she would\u00a0pay for her public health care program. The senator was asked pointedly by debate moderators last week whether taxes will go up to pay for her plan. Warren said her plan would reduce health care costs for middle class Americans but did not address how her plan would affect taxes. \"So, the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face,\" she said during the debate in Westerville, Ohio, last week. \"So, let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\" In Indianola on Sunday, Warren said she would not sign a Medicare for All bill \"that does not reduce the cost of health care for middle class families.\" Joe Biden digs at Elizabeth Warren:Polls don't show 'anybody else as a frontrunner' \"Because it is the cost of health care that is hurting families and the cost of health care is what they care about,\" she said. \"And because they care about it, I care about it.\" Her debate answer, however, paved the way for attacks from her Democratic rivals, particularly South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg who said Warren has failed to answer a yes or no question put forth by the moderators. He has released a plan that gives Medicare to anyone who wants it. \"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\" added Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who supports a public option that would expand Medicaid and Medicare. \"And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\" Warren kicked off a three-day Iowa swing Sunday at a town hall in Indianola. She plans stops in Des Moines, Ames and Cedar Falls. Follow Kim Norvell on Twitter:\u00a0@KimNorvellDMR",

      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vaulted to a 7-point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary race, according to a poll from Quinnipiac University released\u00a0Thursday. When asked whom they would vote for if the primary election were today, 28% of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democrat named the senator from Massachusetts, compared with 21% who selected Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was third at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg finished fourth at 10%. It was the fourth consecutive Quinnipiac poll in which Warren came out ahead of Biden. Before September, Biden consistently led Warren in Quinnipiac's surveys, usually by more than 10 percentage points. But the poll appears to be an outlier compared with other recent surveys on the race. Warren surged in late September and early October to drop Biden from the lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average for the first time since the race began. Since then, however, Biden has roared back, coming out\u00a0ahead in every major national poll released after\u00a0Oct. 15 except for Thursday's\u00a0from Quinnipiac. One poll from CNN on Wednesday\u00a0had the former vice president leading Warren by 15 percentage points. Warren:Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan When asked who had the best policy ideas, Warren was the pick of 30% of likely Democratic voters, compared with Sanders at 20% and Biden at 15%, according to the Quinnipiac poll. But 28% felt Biden would make the best leader\u00a0\u2013 24% said Warren and 13% said Sanders\u00a0\u2013 and he continued to lead in the all-important question of who is most likely to beat President Donald Trump. Democratic voters have made it clear that the ability to defeat Trump is one of the most important factors in their 2020 primary decision. Biden has consistently been seen as the best positioned to unseat the president, but the percentage of Democratic voters saying that has slipped from a high of 56% in April to 42% now. The share of voters saying Warren is the one to beat Trump has\u00a0gone from 3% in April to 20%. There's a new front-runner in town:Elizabeth Warren. Just ask her Democratic rivals Warren came under fire from her rivals this month at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, getting hit particularly hard on the question of how she would pay for her health care plan. But 26% said she did the best job at the debate, compared with 17% who said Buttigieg was the winner, 12% who said it was Biden and 11% who said Sanders. When asked who performed worst at the debate, Biden was the top pick at 15%. Eleven percent said\u00a0Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, performed the worst. \"Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden, who saw his numbers slip to where they were in early July following the first Democratic debate. Then, like now, he ranked among candidates doing the worst job in the debate. Later in July, his numbers rebounded. The question remains whether this is a blip or a trend,\" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow.",

Trump complained when it aired that \"people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform... came to me as a group and asked for my help,\" but now he isn't getting any credit, seemingly referring to the\u00a0First Step Act\u00a0he signed into law in December, which allows prisoners to get more days removed from their sentences for good behavior. Meghan McCain defends Chrissy Teigen after President Trump targets Teigen, John Legend \"Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\" Trump tweeted. Chrissy Teigen's all-time best mom-shaming clapbacks and most hilarious cracks ever Legend responded: \"Imagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \"Your country needs you, Melania,\" he added, before retweeting a photo of the first lady smiling while leaning in to greet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G-7 summit that previously had the hashtag #MelaniaLovesTrudeau trending. \"Ah yes, Melania is otherwise occupied.

      "content": "For many supporters of Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0for president \u2014 of which I am one \u2014 her comments on prostitution policy announced during a recent town hall meeting were a real shocker. Following up on the\u00a0wider plan outlining her LGBT policy, Warren tweeted: \u201cI am\u00a0open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.\u201d Touted as progressive policy, it\u2019s important to examine what\u2019s behind the liberal label, which in this case is quite regressive. Decriminalization of the prostitution industry would harm the women it purports to help. Nikki Bell is the CEO of LIFT (Living in Freedom Together), a prostitution survivor-led organization based in Worcester, Massachusetts, that provides resources and support to\u00a0survivors.\u00a0In responding to Warren\u2019s plan, Bell tells me: \u201cProstituted women do deserve autonomy, but autonomy is not having your body rented to the highest bidder, having acts performed on you that buyers deem too vile to expose their partners to. I am disappointed in Sen. Warren\u2019s statements and would invite her to have a conversation about the realities and harms of prostitution before supporting legislation that benefit the privileged few that choose, as opposed to the masses in prostitution that never had a choice to begin with.\u201d Warren\u2019s announcement is a rebuke to survivors who know in their bones that treating prostitution as simply another job is a prized gift to pimps, traffickers,\u00a0and the men who purchase women and girls for sexual gratification. As journalist and\u00a0Justice for Women founder Julie Bindel has argued, \u201cIf prostitutes are the workers, who are the bosses?\u00a0Pimps and brothel keepers.\u201d Hollywood Madam:\u00a0Want to stop human trafficking? Legalize consensual sex for money. Let\u2019s do away with the language of \u201csex work\u201d and \u201csex workers,\u201d which doesn\u2019t dignify prostituted women but rather ennobles the sex trade and its minions. Cherie Jimenez, who directs the survivor-led EVA\u00a0Center in Boston,\u00a0an exit program for prostituted women and girls, tells me that she\u00a0believes people don\u2019t understand that decriminalization effectively means \u201ca complete open market of abuse and pimping.\u201d Jimenez says decriminalization of prostitution can make victims more vulnerable to the exploitation and violence\u00a0\u201cinherent in the sex trade\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0violence she witnesses every day in helping victims of sexual exploitation who\u00a0come through her center. Several studies have found a connection between sexual abuse during childhood and victims turning to prostitution.\u00a0Most women in prostitution do not want to be in the industry, according to a\u00a02003 study, which found that 89% of prostituted women want to escape.\u00a0A 2012 study found that, in countries where prostitution is\u00a0legalized, the market for sex is expanded, and that there is an even higher rate of human trafficking in the country. This effect is strongest in high-income countries. Yet decriminalization advocates maintain that the \u201csex work\u201d model protects women by decriminalizing persons in prostitution. I\u00a0agree that decriminalizing persons who are prostituted is necessary because no one should be criminalized for her own exploitation. Promoting sex work to children:Hey, Teen Vogue, on career day, no young girl should say, 'I want to be a prostitute.' However, pro-sex work advocates go much further, and the consequences of their proposals are to let loose the perpetrators of sexual exploitation by romanticizing them as protectors. Advocates would have us believe that decriminalization of pimps is necessary to \u201cmanage\u201d women by turning pimps overnight into third-party business agents and by accepting sex buyers as cordial clients. This is akin to letting the proverbial foxes guard the chicken coop. Thankfully, the tide may be\u00a0turning against decriminalization of prostitution.\u00a0This summer in New York state, a decriminalization bill was launched by supporters. Taina Bien-Aim\u00e9, director of the international Coalition Against Trafficking in Women who advocated with a network of organizations that opposed the bill, tells\u00a0me that after state legislators were educated to the harmful consequences of decriminalization, the bill was dead on arrival. The National Organization of Women has opposed a similar bill in Washington, D.C., on the grounds that it would make the nation's capital\u00a0a \u201csex tourism capital and harm marginalized girls and women in our community.\u201d Last month, The Washington Post's Editorial Board\u00a0rejected\u00a0the decriminalization bill that has divided the\u00a0city council. Exploited:Who buys a trafficked child for sex? Otherwise ordinary men. Americans are waking up to the fact that giving legal permission to those who buy sex or profit from it will worsen, not improve, the sexual exploitation of persons who are victimized by it. The alternative to full decriminalization of the prostitution industry is decriminalization of those who are prostituted, as well as legislation that makes sex buyers accountable for their actions \u2014 an approach sometimes called the Nordic Model. In addition to Sweden, Norway and Iceland, this model has also been adopted in France, Ireland, Canada and Northern Ireland. At the very least, Sen. Warren should familiarize herself with her own state\u2019s anti-trafficking legislation, which also addresses sexual exploitation and the men who pay for sex. Massachusetts has one of the strongest state anti-trafficking laws in the nation. Part of its strength derives from the fact that the law addresses the demand side of trafficking and prostitution by upping the penalties on those who purchase persons, mainly women, for sex.\u00a0In making men accountable for their sexual exploitation of women and children, the law teaches that sex buyers can no longer hide behind a screen of anonymity. The legislation also makes clear prostitution is not a victimless crime, and women and children are not products to be bought or sold. If only Sen. Warren, as a presidential candidate,\u00a0took her policy cues from her own state.

      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren's\u00a0\"Medicare for All\"\u00a0plan promises to expand health care\u00a0coverage by increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations while not placing a hike on the middle class. The Democratic presidential candidate on Friday\u00a0released her much-anticipated plan to pay for\u00a0\"Medicare for All,\"\u00a0a massive expansion of the federal government's current role in health care to\u00a0establish a single-payer health care system. In a series of tweets and in a policy platform released online, Warren promised\u00a0she would fund the program, which she says will cost $20.5 trillion\u00a0without a tax hike on the middle class and keep total health care spending at \"under $52 trillion\" over the next decade. Her program would continue state and local payments to Medicaid, the federal-state health care insurance program that helps pay for health care for low-income people of any age, contributing about $6 trillion towards the establishment of Medicare for All. Warren says the funding for the program will mostly\u00a0come from a combination of tax hikes on corporations and the top 1%, as well as a shift in employer health spending. Warren wants to replace employer health spending with an employer Medicare contribution, which she says will get \"almost halfway\" to paying for the plan. What comes next in the impeachment inquiry?:\u00a0Public hearings on an uncertain timeline She also says her plan will help pay for itself by reducing costs within the health care system and taxing Americans' increased incomes. According to Warren, her plan will reduce administrative spending by \"setting net administrative spending at 2.3%,\"\u00a0but will continue to \"reimburse physicians and other non-hospital providers at current Medicare rates.\" Another $1.4 trillion in funding would come from \"existing taxes on the enormous amount of money that will now be returned to individuals\u2019 pockets\" after the system changes to Medicare for All. She identifies four other areas for funding: \"Health care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values. That system is Medicare for All,\" Warren writes\u00a0in her plan. Biden:Joe Biden describes his health care plan using Pete Buttigieg's term, 'Medicare for all who want it' Progressives praised Warren's plan. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus and was the lead co-sponsor of the Medicare for All Act in the House, tweeted that Warren's plan \"shows we can spend less & cover everyone w/guaranteed, comprehensive care.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0called Medicare for All \"expensive\" and said she was \"not a big fan of Medicare for All\" in a Bloomberg TV interview later Friday. Asked by \"Balance of Power\"\u00a0host David Westin if Democrats could win the Electoral College by running on Medicare for All, Pelosi replied, with a laugh, \"Well, it would increase the vote in my own district. But that is not what we need to do in order to win the electoral college.\u201d Other Democratic presidential candidates have embraced different forms of a Medicare for All plan, but at the most recent Democratic presidential debate,\u00a0candidates criticized Warren for\u00a0not laying out\u00a0a framework to finance the policy. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" former Vice President Joe Biden said at the October debate in Ohio. Following the release of Warren's plan, Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director\u00a0Kate Bedingfield slammed it as \"unrealistic\" and said its \"mathematical gymnastics\" will \"[hide]\u00a0a simple truth from voters\" about tax increases. It's impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle class tax increases,\" Bedingfield said.\u00a0\"To accomplish this sleight of hand, her proposal dramatically understates its cost, overstates its savings, inflates the revenue, and pretends that an employer payroll tax increase is something else.\" \"She will be left with only two choices: even further increase taxes on the middle class or break her commitment to these promised benefits.\" Warren's rivals have presented plans that would expand health care coverage but would phase in the program more slowly, or provide Americans the option to opt in to the coverage. Republicans have called Medicare for All plans \"socialist\" and say they amount to a government takeover of health care coverage. Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, said Warren's plan would result in cuts to American health care because of its reimbursement rates. \"Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s single-payer proposal would impose drastic cuts on American healthcare,\" he said. \"We know for sure from watching Maryland, which already has government-set prices, that American\u00a0hospitals would see revenues slashed by around 25%\u2014likely forcing some facilities to cut back services and others to close entirely.\u00a0A similar story would likely play out nationwide.\" Speaking at a Medicare event in Florida at the beginning of October, President Donald Trump said, \u201cMedicare is under threat like never before.\" \"Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government health care takeover that would obliterate Medicare,\" he said.",

Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Conference on Wednesday, Gates said that he's open to higher wealth taxes: \"I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. I'm glad to have paid\u2014if I'd had to pay $20 billion, that's fine.\" \"But when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK,\u00a0then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over,\" Gates said. \"Sorry, I'm just kidding.\" Gates also said he wasn't sure Warren would be open to \"sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money\" to discuss policy ideas. Warren responded in a tweet Thursday, saying, \"I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.)\" In the plan Warren released last week to pay for her proposed Medicare for All plan, she outlines a tax on billionaires of 6% net worth above $1 billion. More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Gates' net worth is estimated by Forbes to be nearly $107 billion. The Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Gates how he felt about that plan, and estimated it would add $6 billion to what Gates already pays in taxes. \"I'm all for super progressive tax systems,\" Gates said, but he added later that, \"I'd love somebody to find a middle ground approach,\" and said that taxing too much could harm the idea that the United States is a good place to \"do innovative companies.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another candidate running for president with a Medicare for All plan, also weighed in. \"Say Bill Gates was actually taxed $100 billion,\" Sanders tweeted on Thursday. \"We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country.\" \"Bill would still be a multibillionaire,\" Sanders continued. Sanders has come under scrutiny for saying he believes billionaires should not exist in America. 2020 candidate Tom Steyer,\u00a0a billionaire himself, also sent a message to Gates on Twitter: \"a wealth tax is the right thing to do. Don\u2019t panic - you\u2019ll be alright.\" Asked if he would vote for Warren if she were the Democratic nominee facing off against President Donald Trump, Gates declined to answer. \"I'm not going to make political declarations, but I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach...\u00a0I would weight the most,\" Gates said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Dozens of donors enjoyed a white-tablecloth dinner, an open bar and sweeping views of the U.S. Capitol this month when Elizabeth Warren strode on stage to headline a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. The setting was similarly swanky in August, when Warren addressed party contributors at the ornate Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. And it's likely to be much the same in December, when Warren is slated to headline another party fundraiser in Boston. The Massachusetts senator\u00a0has become a leading Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0in part because she has pledged to forgo events with high-dollar donors, which has resonated with progressives who believe wealthy donors have outsized political influence. But Warren has a notable exception for fundraisers that take in big money for her party, a practice she plans to continue if she becomes the Democratic nominee to take on President Donald Trump. Warren is already under scrutiny for seeding\u00a0her presidential campaign\u00a0with money she raised while running for the Senate, when she spent millions of dollars on fundraisers and took money from large donors. While that's common practice, the money transfers and the fundraisers for the national party committee could undermine Warren's image as a relentless fighter for the middle class who would rather spend hours taking selfies with supporters than schmoozing with elite donors. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide \"She's a great candidate,\" said Don Fowler, who ran the DNC for two years under President Bill Clinton and hasn't endorsed any of his party's White House hopefuls. \"She's just off-step on this particular point.\" Fowler and other Democratic leaders say Warren isn't being honest about her fundraising plans if she were to become the party's nominee. They say she can't tell voters she is personally shunning big-dollar fundraisers while simultaneously headlining state and national party events at which she would raise millions of dollars from major donors supporting her bid for the White House. \"What I hope she understands is that after a candidate becomes the nominee, the DNC is their campaign and their campaign is the DNC,\" said Rufus Gifford, Barack Obama's 2012 finance chairman. \"There is not a distinction that you can draw.\" Bernie Sanders, Warren's chief rival for the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, also is shunning large-dollar fundraisers in the primary. He hasn't headlined a party fundraiser, but his campaign says he would attend such events in the general election as long as they are grassroots driven and open to low-dollar donors. Warren's campaign said it hasn't made final decisions on how she would conduct party fundraisers as the nominee. Raising money for the party will be an especially urgent task in 2020. Whoever wins the primary will inherit a party that is $7 million in debt and has been outraised almost 5-to-1 by Trump and the Republican National Committee, which pulled in more than $300 million this year alone. Warren has struggled to explain how she would balance her opposition to big-dollar events against her plans to raise money for the party. \"I will help the party,\" Warren said while campaigning in South Carolina last weekend. \"I am not going to ask Democrats to unilaterally disarm in the face of an onslaught of money.\" She gave a different explanation weeks earlier in an interview with CBS. \"I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,\" she said while railing against politicians \"going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.\" Warren campaign spokesman Chris Hayden says she's avoided special VIP receptions at DNC events, keeping with Warren's \"no special access\" for big donors pledge. He noted that her past fundraising bolstered Democratic candidates across the country. No decisions have been made, he said, about how she would handle large sums pouring into the party from fundraisers if she becomes the nominee. So far, Warren's 2020 strategy of shunning donors appears to be working. She raised\u00a0nearly $25 million during the third quarter\u00a0and touts a grassroots operation that yielded a $26 average donation during that period. She's repeatedly slammed rivals including former Vice President Joe Biden for relying on big-dollar donors to fund his 2020 presidential campaign and reversing his past opposition to outside money backing his candidacy. More:Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan But as recently as last year, Warren spent considerable time and money cultivating relationships with the very same types of donors she now derides. Since her election to the Senate in 2012, Warren has spent more than $2.6 million holding fundraisers and used some of the proceeds to seed her presidential run, which she got off the ground with a $10.4 million transfer from her Senate campaign account, according to an analysis of records by The Associated Press. Over the years, she spent more than $1.6 million on fundraising consulting, nearly $500,000 on catering for fundraisers and at least $67,000 renting out event spaces, the AP's analysis found. That includes $43,000 spent at the four-star Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Warren lives, $38,000 at the five-star Fairmount Copley Plaza Hotel and almost $20,000 at City Winery, both in nearby Boston. Last year was one of Warren's top-spending years. She dropped $546,000 on fundraising while campaigning for reelection and laying the groundwork for her presidential run, records show. During that period she attended fundraisers hosted by Silicon Valley donor Karla Jurvetson, tech entrepreneur Stephen M. Silberstein, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Stephen Cozen, the head of Cozen O'Connor, a Philadelphia law firm that reported making $2.1 million in lobbying fees in 2018, records show. Rendell, who has helped Biden raise money for his presidential campaign, said he co-chaired the Warren fundraiser while she sought Senate reelection last year and donated $4,500. He said Warren sent him a handwritten thank you note then but slammed him and other past donors after they attended an April fundraiser for Biden. \"She attacked us, and I think 22 of us had given the maximum to her the year before at a swanky party in a swanky restaurant,\" Rendell said. \"We were called bundlers and access-seekers and all sorts of names by Elizabeth, including me. And I'm not a rich guy. For me, giving $4,500 is a lot of money.\" Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Rock Hill, S.C., contributed to this report.",

That capitalism is even in jeopardy should come as no surprise to any American working hard to make ends meet.\u00a0On paper, economic growth is\u00a0steadily climbing\u00a0and corporate profits are at a\u00a0record high. \u00a0Yet, income inequality has also risen at a\u00a0record pace\u00a0as real wages for most Americans have\u00a0remained stagnant. Whether you think capitalism is broken in the United States today depends on who you think the economy is supposed to work for.\u00a0If it\u2019s shareholders and CEOs, then capitalism is working just fine, thankyouverymuch. But if you think capitalism should also benefit workers \u2014 the people who actually supply the majority of labor that makes economic productivity possible \u2014 then American capitalism is in desperate need of significant repairs. Sen. Bernie Sanders famously considers himself a democratic socialist.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, however, is a capitalist.\u00a0Don\u2019t take my word for it: \"I love markets\u00a0\u2014 I believe in markets,\" Warren\u00a0said\u00a0in 2017. And in 2018, Warren\u00a0described\u00a0herself as \u201ccapitalist to my bones,\u201d\u00a0language Sanders recently\u00a0echoed\u00a0to articulate the main difference between his presidential candidacy and Warren\u2019s.\u00a0In other words, Sanders believes that capitalism is a bad model for achieving opportunity and prosperity for human beings.\u00a0Warren doesn\u2019t believe capitalism is bad, just broken.\u00a0And she wants to fix it. Indeed, Warren\u2019s capitalist bones have deep marrow.\u00a0By several\u00a0accounts, she was a pro-big business \u201claw and economics\u201d libertarian-leaning Republican\u00a0who became more progressive because she saw that\u00a0economics on the ground wasn\u2019t living up to its theoretical ideals. In particular, when as a young law professor Warren went to study bankruptcy courts expecting to find cheaters and deadbeats,\u00a0she instead encountered a wide range of hardworking, ordinary Americans crippled by economic systems that should have been designed to help them but were instead only helping the rich and powerful. To achieve what we want:5 reasons why Elizabeth Warren has the best chance to beat Donald Trump The revelation didn\u2019t turn Warren into a fist pumping protester but a thoughtful reformer, for instance coming up with the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u00a0and then leading the fight to implement it.\u00a0Just like we shouldn\u2019t have cars that suddenly explode on drivers, we shouldn\u2019t have bank loans that suddenly explode on borrowers \u2014 loans that banks were getting away with because they weren\u2019t being sufficiently regulated, just like cars were unregulated once upon a time.\u00a0Warren implemented a smart fix to the economic system in order\u00a0to make capitalism work better for working people. Capitalism is on the ropes.\u00a0That\u2019s not news to many of the nation\u2019s small business owners\u00a0who have experienced the U.S. brand of capitalism as decidedly rigged against them more and more in recent years.\u00a0But mega-corporations and the super-rich need to wake up to the threat they\u2019re facing, a threat their greed for short-term profits and deregulation has exacerbated rather than solved. In 1942 \u2014 following the economic horrors of the Great Depression \u2014\u00a0just\u00a025%\u00a0of Americans said some degree of socialism would be good for the United States.\u00a0Today, more than four in ten Americans express warm attitudes toward socialism.\u00a0Perhaps even more telling, according to fascinating\u00a0research\u00a0by Harvard Business School\u2019s Michael I. Norton and Duke University\u2019s Dan Ariely, with regard to inequality, a whopping 92%\u00a0of Americans would choose to live in an economy that looks more like Sweden\u2019s than America\u2019s. And as much as Trump and hard-line Republicans call any idea they don\u2019t agree with \u201csocialism,\u201d the simple fact is that the choice America faces going forward isn\u2019t between capitalism and not-capitalism but\u00a0between elitist, corrupt, unequal capitalism and a capitalism that actually works fairly for everyone, including working people.\u00a0Smart capitalists are reading the tea leaves.\u00a0They\u2019re watching mass uprisings around the globe, often based on the sorts of economic grievances that animated Occupy Wall Street and even, to an extent, the early anti-bailout Tea Party. Dem businesswomen nervous about Warren:The Democratic debate didn't help The bankers and traders and shareholders and CEOs know that if they don\u2019t help fix capitalism\u2019s ills now,\u00a0there are going to be people in their corporate lobbies wielding pitchforks.\u00a0It\u2019s in\u00a0corporate America's best interest to reform capitalism now rather than, by doubling down on inequality and intransigence, invite a full-scale revolution.\u00a0Which means in this moment, Elizabeth Warren isn\u2019t corporate America\u2019s worst enemy.\u00a0She\u2019s their best hope.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential primary, sharply criticized Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday for attending a \"secret dinner\" with President Donald Trump. \"Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers,\" the senator from Massachusetts\u00a0tweeted. \"And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members \u2013 a major Trump donor \u2013 had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple.\" Warren's tweet linked to an\u00a0article from NBC News, which first reported Thursday that Zuckerberg joined Trump for a previously undisclosed dinner during his trip to Washington in October. \"As is normal for a CEO of a major US company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,\" a spokesman for Facebook told USA TODAY in a statement, though he could not confirm when the dinner took place. Mark Zuckerberg:Facebook is transparent about cleaning up hate speech and violence, others aren't More:Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook fact-checking policy with false ad saying Zuckerberg endorsed Trump Facebook board member Peter Thiel\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who donated to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign\u00a020and was a speaker that year at the Republican National Convention\u00a0\u2013 also attended the dinner, according to NBC News. It was not clear what was discussed at the dinner or why it was not disclosed before. \"This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability,\" Warren said of the dinner. She vowed that if elected president, she would not \"cozy up to Facebook\" and would \"root out corruption in Washington.\" Zuckerberg also had a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office when he went to Washington in September. Warren has long expressed distrust toward large corporations. And n a March op-ed posted on Medium, she announced that as president she would break up Facebook, Amazon and Google because those\u00a0companies have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In leaked audio from July, Zuckerberg said\u00a0he would \"go to the mat\" and \"fight\" any attempt to break up Facebook, and that if Warren \"gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\" he added. \"What would really 'suck'\u00a0is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren replied in a tweet. Warren and Zuckerberg butted heads again in October when she purchased an ad on Facebook that falsely claimed Zuckerberg and Facebook had endorsed Trump as a form of protest against the social media's policy that it would not fact check political ads on its site. \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks,\" Warren's ad said.

      "content": "CEDAR FALLS, Ia. \u2014 When the first notes of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" started playing over the sound system at\u00a0a cattle call of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates this summer, the crowd roared. The pounding keyboard riff\u00a0signified to those in the audience\u00a0that Sen. Elizabeth Warren was ready to take the stage. Unlike the other candidates before her, people\u00a0didn't need to wait until Warren's name was announced to know who was up next. Her campaign speech at the Democratic Wing Ding fundraiser\u00a0didn't break new ground from the stumps she's\u00a0given throughout Iowa since announcing her presidential campaign in January. Instead, what\u00a0sets Warren\u00a0apart from the more than a dozen\u00a0other Democratic presidential candidates traipsing across Iowa is the\u00a0systematic approach she's taken with her\u00a0campaign.\u00a0From her opening song \u2014 which channels themes of class, politics and populism \u2014 to the \"selfie\" lines and the \"2\u00a0cents\"\u00a0chants that ripple through crowds,\u00a0Warren employs\u00a0a methodical approach to events and organizing that has coincided with a steady rise in the polls. \"There's a culture that other campaigns don't have,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. In addition, Warren has built a highly visible ground team that has made itself known to Iowa politicos as it canvasses cities and organizes caucus leaders.\u00a0It's that robust organizational presence that could explain, in part, her rise in the\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Iowa Democrats have said. In\u00a0September,\u00a022%\u00a0of likely Democratic caucusgoers said Warren was their first choice for president, compared with 20% for former vice president Joe Biden and 11% for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. No other candidate reached\u00a0double digits. Warren said her Iowa strategy was born out of the decision to run a grassroots campaign. Instead of holding private fundraisers, she decided to spend time on the ground and in town halls, she said. \"(I decided) I was going to take the money that came in and put it right back into organizing and to hiring a paid organizing staff so that volunteers have a place to go, so they have a way to get connected. And it's worked,\" Warren told the Des Moines Register before a town hall in Cedar Falls recently. \"My job, mostly, has just been I'll show up and do the town halls and say to my Iowa team, 'Go get 'em.'\" Here's a look at some of the Warren-specific aspects of\u00a0the campaign: The senator from Massachusetts\u00a0spends about 30 to 45 minutes at each Iowa event outlining the reasons she's running for president:\u00a0To make government work for the working class, not the rich and powerful. To overhaul America's tax system.\u00a0To get corruption out of politics. But before she\u00a0takes the stage, whoever introduces her makes a promise: Every person who wants a photo with the senator will get a photo. And at every campaign stop in Iowa, she\u00a0stays until the last person in line gets their shot. The \"selfie line\"\u00a0\u2014 this is Warren's phrasing, though it's actually a photo taken by another human, therefore, not a selfie \u2014 is highly organized. More:'That's what girls do': Elizabeth Warren tells young Iowa girls why she's running for president, with a pinky promise At least eight staffers or volunteers usher people through the line.\u00a0Each interaction takes less than 10 seconds, but can have a lasting impact on the candidate's supporters. \"You don't have to hustle and bustle and try to elbow your way through a crowd to have a moment to ask a question or a moment to get a photo,\" said Michelle Mouton, a professor at Cornell College at a Warren house party in\u00a0Mount Vernon. Mouton, who has yet to decide for whom she'll caucus\u00a0in February,\u00a0posted her photo with Warren on Facebook. She, like others before her and others after her, also asked the senator a question. It's in these selfie lines where Warren says she's able to connect with her supporters in a different way than\u00a0her competitors do. \"For me, you know, because I do the selfie lines, it's often the people who come through and get to say just to me, 'Here's what I want you to hear,'\" Warren said. Earlier that week, in Indianola, Warren said a\u00a0couple explained to her they had amassed $100,000 in medical bills when he developed an aneurysm and she was diagnosed with cancer, even though they had \"gold-plated\" health insurance. They asked her to keep fighting for \"Medicare for All,\" she said. \"It's a lot of individual stories I get to hear,\" Warren said. Her campaign team estimates she's taken more than 10,000 selfies in Iowa. What started at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair has now become a rally cry from supporters at Warren's events. Since then, nearly every Iowa crowd erupts into a chant of \"2\u00a0cents! 2\u00a0cents!\"\u00a0when the candidate explains her \"ultra-millionaires\" tax and what\u00a0it can pay for. \"All we're saying is, when you make it to the top, pitch in 2\u00a0cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it in America,\" she says, before the chant starts its ripple. Her plan, which would impose a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, would fund universal child care and pre-kindergarten, provide tuition-free college, invest $50 billion into historically black colleges, and\u00a0cancel\u00a0student loan debt\u00a0for an estimated 42 million people, she says. \"2 cents! 2 cents!\" with an image of Warren on two pennies is now a\u00a0Raygun T-shirt. The shirt comes\u00a0in the campaign's signature\u00a0\"liberty green\" after an Iowa organizer requested it and\u00a0tweeted the company the color code. Two organizers regularly appear at events wearing cardboard pennies. A 25-foot inflatable dog, a\u00a0likeness inspired by\u00a0the senator's own pup, Bailey, wore two pennies on its collar at her rally before the Iowa Democratic Party's\u00a0Liberty and Justice Celebration\u00a0early this month. At every Iowa event, Warren says six words that have come to define her campaign: \"I've got a plan for that.\" The phrase encapsulates a key way she has\u00a0branded herself in this campaign \u2014 taking complicated policies and ideas and boiling them down into a form that is instantly recognizable. When Iowans across the state tell Warren about their struggles affording health care, paying student loan debt\u00a0or finding quality child care at a reasonable price, she replies with the catchphrase.\u00a0Then she\u00a0launches\u00a0into the systemic reason for the\u00a0problem, her plan to fix it, and how she will pay for it. Warren has created a policy-rich campaign focused on \"rewriting the basic rules\u00a0in our economy\" that\u00a0she says now favor\u00a0the wealthy and leaves behind working families. She has rolled out more policy proposals than any other presidential candidate in the 2020 cycle. Several Iowa Democrats have said Warren has built an Iowa team that has\u00a0the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state. It started when Warren announced a presidential exploratory committee. That same week, she\u00a0made her first trip to Iowa, announced she had\u00a0hired four of the state's top Democratic political operatives\u00a0and then quickly built\u00a0one of the state\u2019s largest organizing teams. \"If she ends up winning this, one of the factors very well may be that she took the time to recruit top talent and have that talent in place and focused on a plan before announcing,\" said\u00a0Matt Paul, a Des Moines operative who ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Iowa caucus campaign but does not have a favorite for\u00a02020. \"That continues to pay dividends.\" Bagniewski, the Polk County Democrats chair, said Warren's focus on\u00a0organization has continued in the 11 months since. The local party affiliate asked all Democratic campaigns\u00a0for help finding 40 precinct captains for caucus night. Warren's campaign was the only one to offer volunteers\u00a0\u2014 and her staff\u00a0found 20 people in fewer\u00a0than 48 hours, he said. \"Their organization is one of the best in the field, if not the best,\" he said. \"They're very conscientious and thoughtful on the way they give back to the party and their community.\" The campaign's\u00a0on-the-ground organizing\u00a0\u2014 canvassing every weekend, \"Pints and Policy\" discussions, game nights, a community garden and phone banking\u00a0\u2014 also caught the eye of Our Iowa Values, a\u00a0Republican-leaning Super PAC. \"Elizabeth Warren has earned her place in the polls,\"\u00a0the organization tweeted in August. \"Iowa Values has been running a massive field effort across Iowa since our launch and we have only run into canvassers from one campaign anywhere in the state \u2014 Warren for President.\" Her campaign focuses on organizing at major candidate events in Iowa, too. At the\u00a0Polk County Steak Fry, Warren's team turned the rally site outside the venue\u00a0into an \"organizing HQ,\"\u00a0where the\u00a0staff trained volunteers to canvass the crowds inside. Warren\u00a0volunteers bearing clipboards and trailing \u201cliberty green\u201d floating balloons fanned out across the massive event space.\u00a0(Sanders' campaign took a similar approach at that event, but knocked on area doors instead.) At the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration on Nov. 1, the campaign team participated early in the day in sign wars and loud chants. But it\u00a0also used the opportunity to host a caucus-night training for its supporters gathered from across the state. Warren made a surprise visit to thank\u00a0volunteers for knocking on doors, making phone calls and engaging people in conversation while in line at the grocery store. \"Every time you do that, you not only add to our campaign, you not only increase our chances that we win come November 2020\u00a0\u2014 you repair a little thread of democracy,\" she said. \"I'm so deeply proud of what we\u2019re doing together.\" Reporters Brianne Pfannenstiel and Anna Spoerre contributed to this story.

      "content": "We asked presidential candidates questions about a variety of issues facing the country. This is what Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren had to say about climate change,\u00a0gun control, health care\u00a0and other issues. Do you believe the earth\u2019s climate is changing? If yes, do you believe it is caused by humans? Climate change is not a matter of belief, it\u2019s a matter of scientific fact. The world\u2019s leading experts have long known that climate change is man-made and we are running out of time to avoid the most disastrous impacts, which Americans all across the country are already beginning to experience. I will prioritize defeating the climate crisis from day one of my administration and use every tool in my power to confront the greatest challenge of our time If you could unilaterally make one change, or enact one policy, that would affect the climate, what would that be? And why? We won\u2019t defeat the climate crisis with one policy or one piece of legislation. We need a comprehensive approach to meet the urgency of the moment \u2014 one that brings sustained, big, structural change across all sectors and industries, at home and abroad. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve woven climate policy throughout my plans \u2014 from directing Congress to pass 100% clean energy legislation to transition America\u2019s electricity, building, and transportation sectors to 100% clean energy within the next decade to issuing a sweeping climate executive order that will include rolling back all of Trump\u2019s disastrous pro-fossil fuels policies, (and) banning new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands. How would you engage foreign leaders to work with the United States on issues related to climate? I have a plan to use all the tools in our diplomatic and economic arsenal to encourage other countries to purchase American-made clean, renewable, emissions-free energy products including making a $100 billion commitment to accelerate exports of American-made clean energy technology. I also will transform our approach to trade to tackle climate change. Under my plan, countries will be required to join the Paris Climate Agreement and eliminate domestic fuel subsidies as a precondition for entering trade negotiations with the U.S. I will seek a new multilateral agreement to protect domestic subsidies for green products and preferential treatment for green energy production from WTO challenges. Should the U.S. explore additional use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source? Why or why not? There are concerns about waste and environmental justice. In my administration, we're not going to build any new nuclear power plants. But I recognize that nuclear is about 55% of our clean energy today. We should phase it out and replace it with renewable energy, not fossil fuels. I want to get 100% clean energy as quickly as possible and that's why I have adopted and built on Governor Inslee's plan. Should the U.S. government offer subsidies for renewable energy, such as wind energy or ethanol? Why or why not? A Warren administration will end the legacy of handouts to the fossil fuel industry to level the playing field for clean and renewable electricity, zero emission vehicles, and green products for commercial and residential buildings. To reach the goal of net zero emissions by 2030, we will need to subsidize the economic transition towards the clean technologies of the future because that is what the scope and scale of the climate crisis demands. We must support investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including distributed generation and clean energy technologies like solar, wind, and water power. How would you address gun violence in America? While mass shootings get the bulk of attention, these shootings occur in our homes, on our streets, and at our playgrounds. Gun violence is a public health crisis, and Black and Latinx Americans have borne the brunt of it. I will immediately take executive action to rein in an out-of-control gun industry by requiring nearly all gun sellers to obtain a federal license and directing my government to investigate and prosecute all those who violate existing gun laws. I support reforms like federal licensing, background checks, waiting periods, reporting on multiple purchases, raising the minimum age to purchase a gun, and more. I believe we need a new federal assault weapons ban. How do you propose making schools safer from acts of violence? Parents shouldn\u2019t have to buy bulletproof backpacks for their children \u2014 guns have no place on our campuses or in our schools, and teachers shouldn\u2019t be armed. Congress should improve the Gun-Free School Zones Act to include college and university campuses, and apply to individuals licensed by a state or locality to carry a firearm. We must also make schools safe environments for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. In 2017, more than half of LGBTQ+ students reported feeling unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, and over 70% of LGBTQ+ students reported being verbally harassed or bullied. What role, if any, should the government have in regulating large technology companies? Today\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. I believe we must break up big tech by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d and broken apart from any participant on that platform. If you are elected, how would you interact with North Korea? What relationship would the U.S. and North Korea have? Our goal should be the full elimination of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But while we work toward that goal, we must reduce the threat now. We need serious, realistic negotiations to address this threat. As a first step, and in coordination with our partners and allies, I would be prepared to consider partial, limited sanctions relief in return for a strong, verifiable agreement that keeps North Korea from expanding its arsenal or proliferating to other countries. An interim agreement would open the door to negotiations to reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities, control conventional weapons, and stop the regime\u2019s crimes against humanity. Would you re-enter the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran? Why or why not? If Iran returns to compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal, the U.S. should return as well. If Iran is not in compliance, I will pursue strong and principled diplomacy in concert with our allies to bring both the U.S. and Iran back into the deal. The JCPOA is only the beginning. We will need to negotiate a follow-on to the agreement that continues to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear program past the \u201csunset\u201d of some of its original terms. We also need to address serious concerns about Iran\u2019s policies beyond its nuclear program, including its ballistic missile program and support for destabilizing regional proxies. The JCPOA made addressing these problems easier. How do you plan to address the threat of extremism in the U.S.? Violent extremism of any kind has no place in American society, and that includes white nationalism. We\u2019ve got to recognize the threat. White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist groups, like ISIS, like al-Qaida. As president of the United States, I will use every tool available to me. My Justice Department would go after white nationalists with full prosecution. Do you believe there is equal access to voting in the U.S.? If not, how would you go about expanding access to voting? No, there is not. Voting should be easy. But instead, many states make it hard for people to vote. It is time to make high-quality voting in the greatest democracy in the world easy, convenient, and professional. We need federal standards to ensure everyone can vote. I have a plan to mandate automatic and same-day voter registration, early voting, and vote by mail. My plan will mean no more arbitrary voter purges. No more registration issues. And no more gerrymandering. We will also make Election Day a holiday to make it easier for people to get to the polls. Do you believe voter fraud is a problem in the U.S.? If yes, how do you plan to you address it? No. Voter suppression is a problem. The right to vote is a fundamental right, and we will not let racist and corrupt politicians undermine it or our democracy. Should it be a crime to enter the U.S. illegally? Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist Senator, it\u2019s also a criminal violation. This additional criminal provision is totally unnecessary for border security, and for a century, it was rarely enforced. But since the early 2000s, it has been used to build and sustain a massive immigration detention complex. In 2016, over half of all federal criminal prosecutions were for immigration violations \u2014 more than prosecutions for terrorism, organized crime, hate crimes, or financial fraud. This obsessive focus ties up federal prosecutors and overwhelms federal courts. It\u2019s costly and unnecessary. Should the U.S. expand or limit legal immigration? As president, I will work to expand legal immigration. America should welcome more legal immigration \u2014 done in the right way and consistent with our principles. We should use targeted immigration as a tool to create jobs and businesses and grow our economy. We should reflect our values, which means expanding family reunification and making it easier for relatives of citizens and green card holders to come to the United States. We should put American workers first by ensuring that workers already here get the first opportunity to fill any available positions. In many areas of the country, there is a critical shortage of affordable housing. What would your administration do to address it? Housing costs have skyrocketed and a big part of the reason is developers are building mansions and high rises instead of basic housing for families. Another reason is the federal government isn\u2019t making the investments it used to make in housing for lower-income and middle-class families. My housing plan would build, preserve, or rehabilitate 3.2 million housing units across this country for lower-income and middle-class Americans. An independent analysis found my plan would bring down rents by 10% across the country and create more than a million good jobs. What is your plan to address the growing national debt? I\u2019ve proposed a number of ways to bring in more tax revenue from the wealthy and big corporations \u2014 including a two-cent wealth tax on fortunes above $50 million. But we need to rethink our approach to the debt. It\u2019s less about the size of the debt and more about whether we are making the right investments to grow our economy. When we invest in infrastructure or universal child care for every kid ages 0-5 or reducing the student loan debt burden so people have chances to buy a home or start a business \u2014 all of those are good investments that build financial security for working families and boost our economy. Do you think our national debt is a national security issue? Why or why not? We should not ignore the national debt. But the national debt poses nowhere near the threat to current and future generations as climate change, the rise of white nationalism, or any number of other issues. Is capitalism the best economic structure for the United States? If yes, why? If no, what is better and how do you believe it will benefit Americans? I believe in markets. Markets can create wealth and opportunity. But markets without rules is theft and there are areas where markets just don\u2019t work, like health care. In many parts of the country, there is a skilled worker gap. How would you close that gap to get more people employed in the industries that need them? I believe we should take aggressive steps to overhaul our worker training programs so they produce better results for American workers and companies. I will dramatically scale up apprenticeship programs by increasing investment in apprenticeships tenfold and make a $20 billion commitment to apprenticeship programs for the next ten years. These efforts should bring together community colleges, technical schools, unions\u00a0and companies. I also want to create sectoral training programs \u2014 a model that has been successful in Wisconsin. These local or regional sector training partnerships would help align training with the local job market (and) leverage the community college system. Should the government forgive student loans? If yes, why and for whom? If no, why not? I have a plan to cancel student debt for more than 95% of the nearly 45 million Americans with student loan debt. It cancels $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000. It provides substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000. The $50,000 cancellation amount phases out by $1 for every $3 in income above $100,000. It offers no debt cancellation to people with household income above $250,000 (the top 5%). My plan will close the racial wealth gap. It\u2019s paid for by a 2% tax on giant fortunes over $50 million. Should community college be free to anyone who wants to attend? Should other colleges and universities be free to attend? Yes. Our public schools for K-12 students are free for everyone. That\u2019s because we understand that a high school-level education is a basic need for our society and our economy \u2014 and it should be available to all. My plan will eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in America. The federal government will partner with states to split the costs of tuition and fees and ensure that states maintain their current levels of funding on need-based financial aid and academic instruction. This is paid for by my 2% tax on giant fortunes over $50 million. Is more funding needed for mental health care in America? If yes, what amount and how should it be allocated? Where should that money come from? Yes. In addition to the right to physical health care, we must prioritize affordable, high-quality mental health services. Despite the widespread need for these services, many Americans are denied coverage. Medicare for All will fix that. But in the transition to Medicare for All, my Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act would hold insurers accountable for providing adequate mental health benefits and ensure Americans receive the protections they are guaranteed by law. In the Senate, I secured increased funding for the Mental Health Block Grant, which supports early intervention for children experiencing serious mental illness for the first time. Read what all the candidates have to say about health care here. How would you address rising prescription drug costs, specifically for medications that are necessary for people to live, such as insulin and mental health medications? Prescription drug prices are crushing families. My Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to step in and manufacture affordable generic drugs where the market has failed. Further, Medicare and Medicare for All should aggressively negotiate with drug companies. We should crack down on rampant abuse of the patent and regulatory system. And we should import drugs from countries that sell the same medicines and meet strong safety standards but that charge their citizens a fraction of our costs. What do you believe is the biggest health care issue facing Americans? How would you solve it? I have spent my whole career studying why families go broke and found that one of the top reasons for that is medical problems -- even for families that have insurance. Private insurance companies raked in $23 billion last year while premiums skyrocket and prescription drug copays are going through the roof. It\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not sustainable. Medicare for All should be the law of the land. And under Medicare for All, hard-working families across this country will see their health care costs go down. How would you address the opioid crisis? I have introduced the most comprehensive plan to tackle the opioid crisis in Congress. My legislation, the CARE Act, would provide $100 billion in federal funding over the next decade for states that are hardest hit, giving communities the tools they need to take on the epidemic. It combines federal funding with local decision-making, allowing communities to decide how the dollars should be spent to address their most urgent prevention, treatment and recovery needs. My bill also acknowledges this crisis didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it didn\u2019t happen on its own. And I would make it easier for us to hold corporate executives at companies that fueled the epidemic accountable for their actions Should marijuana be legalized federally for medicinal use? Should it be legalized for recreational use? Yes. I believe we should legalize marijuana and wipe clean the records of those unjustly jailed for minor marijuana crimes. I'm a proud co-sponsor of the Marijuana Justice Act. I also have a bill that says if states have already decided on legalizing marijuana, the federal government should back off. By outlawing marijuana, the federal government is putting communities of color, small businesses, public health, and safety at risk. Do you support a public health insurance option for all Americans? If yes, do you support the elimination of private health care in favor of a government-run plan, or do you support an option where Americans can choose a public or private plan? If no, why? I believe Medicare for All should be the law of the land and that is why I\u2019m a co-sponsor of the Medicare for All legislation in the United States Senate. I spent my whole career studying why families go broke, and came to find that one of the top reasons for personal bankruptcies is health crises and medical expenses \u2014 even for families with insurance. Medicare for All should be the law of the land. Should the federal government re-institute the death penalty? If yes, for what crimes? Studies show that capital punishment is often applied in a manner that\u2019s biased against people of color and those with a mental illness. I oppose the death penalty. A Warren administration would reverse Attorney General Barr\u2019s decision to move forward with federal executions, and I believe Congress should abolish the death penalty.",

      "content": "Celebrities and politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, are weighing in on Taylor Swift's public fight with Big Machine Label Group. On Saturday, Warren\u00a0commented on the singer's claims that her former label is blocking her from performing\u00a0her old hits at the American Music Awards. \"Unfortunately,\u00a0@TaylorSwift13\u00a0is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm,\" Warren tweeted.\u00a0\"They're gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries. It's time to rein in private equity firms \u2014 and I've got a plan for that.\" U.S. Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared a similar message on Twitter: \"Private equity groups\u2019 predatory practices actively hurt millions of Americans. Their leveraged buyouts have destroyed the lives of retail workers across the country, scrapping 1+ million jobs. Now they\u2019re holding\u00a0@taylorswift13\u2019s own music hostage,\" she tweeted. \"They need to be reigned in.\" Cher also voiced her support for Swift on Saturday, validating her fellow singer's complaints that she isn't getting fair access to or compensation for her own work. \"BABE, THIS (expletive) HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE (a) MILLION SELLING ARTISTS WERE PAID OFF WITH A CADILLAC & A BOTTLE OF JACK!! I'M SORRY,\" Cher tweeted, adding an emoji with a puzzled look next to music tycoon Scooter Braun's name. Developments between Swift and her music industry foes\u00a0Big Machine Label Group owner Scott Borchetta and Braun escalated Friday. To recap: Swift took to Twitter on Thursday, claiming she's being asked to meet an onerous set of conditions if she wants to play a medley of her old hits at the American Music Awards show on Nov. 24, where she's being presented with the artist of the decade award. Swift says Borchetta and Braun, who purchased her extensive back catalog in June (to Swift's loudly expressed shock and horror), are blocking her from performing her old songs on television because \"they claim that would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year.\" Big Machine\u00a0says it's not so. In a statement provided to USA TODAY, the label said it was \"shocked\" to see Swift's statements \"based on false information.\" Later, Swift's\u00a0spokeswoman, Tree Paine, shared an updated statement with USA TODAY, insisting that Borchetta and Big Machine \"flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix.\" Who is Scooter Braun?\u00a0A look at the man who became Taylor Swift's 'worst case scenario' More celebrities like Hayley Kiyoko, Adam Rippon, Cara Delevingne and\u00a0Kathy Griffin\u00a0have announced their support for Swift on social media since then. \"Who the (expletive) do these guys think they are?\" Griffin tweeted Saturday. \"You, Taylor, have gone through the proper channels. That cost a fortune of your hard earned money. You created your own content. They don't have talent, just greed. Stay the course.\" 'I won't let you fall':Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes debut dreamy new lyrics in 'Lover' remix Justin Bieber, who is managed by Braun, appeared to take his and Borchetta's\u00a0side on the matter, sharing (and later deleting) a TMZ article on his Instagram Story about Big Machine denying Swift's claims. Earlier this week, singer Halsey also\u00a0shared a message on her Instagram Story about the matter. \"Not only are we looking at an awful business move ... but this is just mean. This is punishment. This is hoping to silence her from speaking about things by dangling this over her head,\" she wrote. Selena Gomez, a self-described best friend to Swift, also commented in a lengthy post to her Instagram Story, saying her heart is \"so heavy right now.\" \"It makes me sick and extremely angry,\" she wrote.\"...It's greed, manipulation and power. You've robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.\" Gomez said she hoped there would be a change of heart over this \"unfortunate\" situation. And she issued fair warning: \"Taylor fights. She will never stop fighting.\" Contributing: Andrea Mandell and Hannah Yasharoff More:Scooter Braun says he had a 'friendship' with Taylor Swift prior to Big Machine drama More:Justin Bieber's longtime manager Scooter Braun praises his 'courage,' slams media coverage",

      "content": "Pity the poor billionaires. Democratic presidential hopeful\u00a0Elizabeth Warren is\u00a0vigorously promoting her proposed wealth tax aimed at the super rich whom she says don\u2019t pay their fair share. It isn\u2019t really a \u201cbillionaire tax\u201d \u2014\u00a0the levies kick in at 2%\u00a0annually on households with a net worth of $50 million, rising to 6%\u00a0for those with a net worth of a billion dollars or more.\u00a0And unlike income taxes, this covers every form of wealth and property, even \u201cyachts, jewelry\u00a0and fine art,\u201d held in the United States or abroad.\u00a0It takes class warfare to a whole new \u2014 and probably illegal \u2014 level. Fellow candidate\u00a0Bernie Sanders has his own version of the tax. Soak the rich proposals are nothing new. President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced a \u201cwealth tax\u201d in the Revenue Act of 1935, stating,\u00a0\u201cPeople know that vast personal incomes come not only through the effort or ability or luck of those who receive them, but also because of the opportunities for advantage which government itself contributes. Therefore, the duty rests upon the government to restrict such incomes by very high taxes.\u201d The idea that the wealthy at some level owe their riches to society is the same, but Roosevelt\u2019s wealth tax was a steeply graduated income tax. This\u00a0is fundamentally different from Warren\u2019s proposal, which is a national property tax on wealth and possessions. This has never been done before in America\u00a0for a simple reason: It is unconstitutional. Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution forbids the government from laying a \u201ccapitation, or other direct, tax\u201d unless in proportion to the census. Alexander Hamilton, in a brief supporting a national carriage tax, explained that a direct tax comprises, among other things, \u201ctaxes on lands and buildings. General assessments, whether on the whole property of individuals, or on their whole real or personal estate.\u201d In 1895, the Supreme Court ruled that income taxes were forbidden under this logic in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.\u00a0Chief Justice Melville Fuller noted that \u201cnothing can be clearer than that what the Constitution intended to guard against was the exercise by the general government of the power of directly taxing persons and property.\u201d This was the background to the 16th\u00a0(or income tax)\u00a0Amendment, which was proposed, passed and ratified during William Howard Taft\u2019s single term.\u00a0It gave Congress the right to levy a form of taxation that was originally constitutionally suspect. But there is no provision in that amendment for a general federal property or wealth tax. And while the definition of \u201cdirect tax\u201d can be debated, if Washington is able to tax everything you own then it is either \u201cdirect\u201d or the term is meaningless. A marked success:Lower tax refunds show how the Republican tax cut is keeping money in your hands all year A second objection is that the wealth tax proposal is functionally a bill of attainder, which is also forbidden under Article 1 Section 9, and denied to the states under Section 10.\u00a0The ban was based on the abuse of this process by British governments seeking to punish political dissent. Hence bills of attainder, according to Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1965 case United States v. Brown, were intended by the Framers to bar \u201clegislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or group.\" Under the test laid out in the 1946 case United States v. Lovett, bills of attainder identify specific groups (in this case \u201cbillionaires\u201d) and impose punishment (taking wealth) without a trial.\u00a0Laws denying employment to members of subversive organizations have been overturned by this standard; replace \u201ccommunists\u201d with \u201cthe wealthy\u201d and you can see how the class warfare script has flipped. The fact that this is bad economics seems intuitive. The wealthy already bear a heavy tax burden; the top 1%\u00a0of wage earners pay a greater share of federal income taxes than the bottom 90%\u00a0combined.\u00a0Why make the investment climate in the United States worse? If anything, we should be finding ways to attract wealth to the country, not punish it. And it should be equally clear that the super rich have enough clout to either have the loopholes they will need to escape the worst of the wealth tax written into the legislation, or find other ways to avoid it. In response, Sen. Warren has advocated a juiced-up IRS with \u201csuper duper enforcement\u201d powers, but most Americans would see that more as a threat than a promise. An argument can also be made that the Warren wealth tax is offensive to the fundamental rights on which the Constitution is based. In short, it is a recipe for unlimited government. Do we really want a system in which Washington has the right to tax anything you have simply because you have it? If so, no property would ever be safe. The introductory bottom tax line of $50 million would drop to $10 million, then lower. A government that can take the property and possessions of billionaires can as easily do the same to millionaires. And who is a millionaire anyway? Recall President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1993 \u201cmillionaire\u2019s surtax\u201d proposal that would have applied to households earning a million dollars over four years. What impact will she have on the economy:Anti-Trump businesswomen are nervous about Warren, and the Democratic debate didn't help Government is a black hole of spending, and establishing this mechanism for extracting wealth from citizens would open new avenues for politicians and bureaucrats to invent ever more intrusive ways to transfer your money to their purposes. We would wind up with what Chief Justice Fuller warned of in the Pollock case, in which \u201cthe rule of protection could be frittered away\u201d and with it \u201cone of the bulwarks of private rights and private property.\u201d Of course, to Sen. Warren\u2019s progressive supporters that is probably the objective. James S.

      "content": "ANKENY, Iowa. \u2014 U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized\u00a0Micheal Bloomberg's newly announced run for president, saying the former New York City mayor \"plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party.\" \"Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020. He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money,\" Warren said Monday at a community meeting in Ankeny.\u00a0\"I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election.\" After weeks of speculation, Bloomberg\u00a0Sunday\u00a0announced he was entering the crowded 2020 Democratic primary race. His announcement coincided with an estimated $30 million television ad buy. In Iowa, Warren said Bloomberg's that approach is \"fundamentally wrong\" compared to hers, which she says has a focus on meeting people \"face-to-face\" while foregoing high-dollar fundraisers. It is rare for Warren to make direct attacks on fellow Democratic candidates, even when asked direct questions about other contenders. \"If Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes. And it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward,\" she said.\u00a0\"Because, believe me, there are plenty of billionaires who think they should be president or at minimum should be picking the president.\" Forbes estimates Bloomberg's wealth at more than $50 billion. Bloomberg has said he won't focus his time in early states like Iowa, where Warren has held more than 70 events since January when she announced she was exploring a run for president. She has been lauded for having one of the most sophisticated ground organizations in the first-in-the-nation state. \"Think about it his way: His view is that he doesn't need people who knock on doors. He doesn't need to get out and campaign with people. He doesn\u2019t need volunteers,\" Warren said. \"And if you get out and knock on 1,0000 doors he\u2019ll just spend another $37 million to flood the airwaves.\" The former mayor has rejected Democratic proposals such as \"Medicare for All\"\u00a0and the \"Green New Deal\" \u2014 two measures\u00a0Warren has co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate and ideas on which she\u2019s centered her campaign. Bloomberg\u00a0has also criticized her proposed wealth tax, which would impose a 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million, saying it is \"probably unconstitutional\"\u00a0and warning\u00a0it could ruin the economy. Bloomberg has called for what he considers more pragmatic approaches. \"I\u2019m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,\" Bloomberg declared in a\u00a0statement on his campaign website. \"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\u2019s reckless and unethical actions.\u00a0He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.\" William Cummings with USA TODAY contributed to this report. Kim Norvell covers growth and development for the Register.
