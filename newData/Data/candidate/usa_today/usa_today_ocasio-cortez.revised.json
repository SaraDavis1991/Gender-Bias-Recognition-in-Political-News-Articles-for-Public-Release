Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that it pays warehouse workers \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d saying in a tweet that it pays workers at least $15 per hour plus full benefits. In response to a question on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Ocasio-Cortez said whether Bezos is a billionaire is less of a concern to her than how the company\u2019s policies impact Amazon warehouse workers. Ocasio-Cortez said she was concerned that Bezos\u2019 \u201cbeing a billionaire is predicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access health care, and also if his ability to be a billionaire is predicated on the fact that his workers are taking food stamps.\u201d Amazon tweeted a response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cAmazon is a leader on pay at $15 min wage + full benefits from day one. We also lobby to raise federal min wage.\u201d Competitors coming for Prime:Two reasons it may be time to drop Amazon Prime Amazon\u2019s head of communications, Jay Carney, later tweeted that Ocasio-Cortez should change the minimum wage law. Ocasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken public critics of Amazon\u2019s plan to move its second headquarters to Long Island City, in the borough of Queens, before Amazon pulled out. Amazon\u00a0decided to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018\u00a0after facing criticism for its pay disparity. In April, Bezos\u00a0issued a challenge to other retailers\u00a0to match Amazon\u2019s pay and benefits. \u00a9CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

      "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0said Thursday that Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0does not need to apologize to\u00a0Joe Biden after the New Jersey Senator criticized the former vice president's controversial comments about working with segregationist senators during his early years on Capitol Hill. Booker on Wednesday had asked Biden to apologize for praising his work with former Democratic Sens.\u00a0James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia during a fundraiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York, both of who fought against the civil rights movement and opposed the racial integration of schools. Biden, however, said that Booker \"knows better\" and should be the one to apologize. The former vice president added that he doesn't \"have a racist bone on my body.\" Ocasio-Cortez, who has been critical of Biden, weighed in on the debate on Thursday. \"For the record, Cory Booker does *not* owe Joe Biden an apology for pointing out that waxing nostalgic about working with segregationists is insensitive,\" she tweeted. \"'He knows better?'\u00a0Really? What is 'better?' To stay quiet about it?\" she wrote. More:Biden: Booker should apologize after criticism of my comments on segregationists 'He is out of step':Backlash after Biden talks 'civility' with segregationist senators Booker campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh confirmed Booker and Biden spoke Wednesday night after the New Jersey Democrat appeared on CNN. \u201cCory shared directly what he said publicly \u2014 including helping VP Biden understand why the word 'boy' is painful to so many,\u201d\u00a0Singh said. \u201cCory believes that Vice President Biden should take responsibility for what he said and apologize to those who were hurt.\" The Biden campaign confirmed in an email that two candidates spoke. Ocasio-Cortez also warned that voter turnout in the 2020 election could be harmed by Biden's comments. Many of the Democratic wins in the 2018 midterms were driving by black voters, particularly black women, according to analysis from the NAACP. \"For folks saying we should gloss over this, I think it\u2019s important to realize that we can\u2019t risk depressed turnout in 2020,\" she wrote in a second tweet. \"The original remark is valid to ask about & have a discussion on or clarify - not dismiss. We should be compassionate toward each other, but not silent,\" she continued. Biden's comments defending his stance on civil rights\u00a0came\u00a0on Wednesday, which was Juneteenth\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a day marked in many states and by African Americans across the country\u00a0commemorating June 19, 1865, when blacks in Galveston, Texas, learned they were no longer slaves, almost two years after President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation. A number of top lawmakers that are part of the Congressional Black Caucus have defended Biden, Politico\u00a0reported. Ocasio-Cortez has previously criticized Biden for his \"middle-of-the-road approach\" on climate change, for his previous support of the Hyde Amendment, and believes that only a true progressive candidate could beat Trump. Biden has repeatedly touted as being moderate and working with both sides of the aisle, while maintaining that he is progressive. Despite her criticisms, Ocasio-Cortez has said she would support Biden if he was the nominee during an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" She added that she still thinks the candidate that is picked as the Democratic nominee is \"going to be exciting to vote for, that all people, women, people of all genders, races, income levels, geographies feel excited and good about voting for.\" \"I think that it is absolutely important that we defeat Donald Trump,\" she said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0praised workers from Wayfair, an online home goods website, for planning a walkout after the company sold furniture to an organization that is managing migrant camps along the U.S-Mexico border. \"Wayfair workers couldn\u2019t stomach they were making beds to cage children,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\u00a0\"They asked the company to stop. CEO said no.\" \"Tomorrow, they\u2018re walking out,\" she continued. \"This is what solidarity looks like - a reminder that everyday people have real power, as long as we\u2019re brave enough to use it.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is a top-tier candidate in the 2020 Democratic field, also tweeted that she supports the walkout. \"I stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow,\" she wrote. \"The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for. \" Wayfair employees are staging a walkout in Boston, Mass.,\u00a0on Wednesday after the company said it\u00a0would not end its\u00a0business relationship with\u00a0BCFS, a government contractor that has been managing migrant camps at the border, according to several reports. Employees for the company learned last week that a $200,000 order of bedroom furniture was placed by BCFS for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas,\u00a0the Boston Globe first reported. Friday, nearly 550 employees on Friday signed a letter to Wayfair\u00a0executives asking that the company\u00a0cease all business with contractors that operate detention camps for immigrants. \"We believe that the current actions of the United States and their contractors at the Southern border do not represent an ethical business partnership Wayfair should choose to be a part of,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Globe, which obtained a copy of the letter.\u00a0\u201cAt Wayfair, we believe that \u2018everyone should live in a home that they love.\u2019 Let\u2019s stay true to that message by taking a stand against the reprehensible practice of separating families, which denies them any home at all.\" The walkout is set for Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. local time in Boston, the Washington Post reported. In addition, employees are calling on Wayfair to donate all profits made from the sale to BCFS to Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based non-profit that provides legal services to immigrants. More:Federal appeals court orders more fact-finding on Trump administration's plan to add census citizenship question More:GOP Rep. Michael Burgess says migrant children in one detention center can leave 'at any time' This is not the first time Wayfair has sold furniture to a migrant center. According to the Post, the company sold to a facility in Tornillo, Texas, last September. That center has since been shut down. A Twitter account\u00a0about\u00a0the walkout was created, as well as a Facebook page. Wayfair and the organizers of the walkout have not responded to requests for comment. Another Democratic lawmaker\u00a0has also responded to the media reports about the planned\u00a0walkout. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., whose district includes Wayfair's headquarters, said she stands in solidarity of those walking out on Wednesday. \"We must actively #resist any & all efforts by this cruel, incompetent administration to cage children and separate families,\" she tweeted.\u00a0\"I proudly stand in solidarity w/ the hardworking individuals at #Wayfair who are walking out in the name of #justice & humanity.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "author": "William Cummings",
      "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Ivanka Trump's suitability as a U.S. diplomatic representative at last week's G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, saying on social media that simply being the president's daughter does not make her qualified for the role. \"It may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification,\" the freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York said in a tweet on Saturday night. \"It hurts our diplomatic standing when the President phones it in & the world moves on. The US needs our President working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either,\" she added. Ocasio-Cortez's post included a link to a tweet featuring a viral video clip\u00a0\u2013 which has more than 9 million views\u00a0\u2013 of President Donald Trump's oldest daughter, and White House adviser, participating in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0and\u00a0the director of the International Monetary Fund's director, Christine Lagarde. At G20, Trump tells Putin playfully:'Don't meddle in the election.' Putin laughs New strategy?:Trump criticized Kamala Harris at the G20, breaking a silence More:Donald Trump's future depends in part on Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un The context of the 19-second video clip\u00a0that\u00a0was published on the official\u00a0Instagram account of the French presidential palace\u00a0is not provided, and the sound quality leaves some of the dialogue unintelligible. But it shows Macron making a comment about \"social justice\" to which Ivanka Trump nods and expresses agreement. \"As soon as you begin talking about the economic aspect of it, though, a lot of people start listening who otherwise wouldn't listen,\" May says. \"Yeah,\" Trump agrees. \"And the same with the defense side of it,\" which she says is \"male-dominated.\" Many Twitter users characterized the attempts by the president's daughters to join the conversation as embarrassing. A number of commentators noted an apparent eye roll from Lagarde as Ivanka Trump spoke. \"Your thoughts on this video, @IvankaTrump? Your thoughts on the French government releasing it for the world to see?\" tweeted actress and liberal activist Alyssa Milano. Edward Luce, a columnist for the Financial Times, wrote\u00a0that Ivanka Trump \"inserting herself into an awkward circle of world leaders\" will be the \"abiding image\" of the G-20 summit. He noted the \"varying expressions of tortured politeness\" displayed by the European political figures as Ivanka Trump spoke, and said that \"Lagarde, in particular, was unable to conceal her irritation.\" \"America\u2019s self-named 'First Daughter' is rarely out of the frame at global summits. Other Trump officials are almost invisible compared with Ms Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the only two White House players who are thought to be immune from Mr Trump\u2019s trademark phrase: 'You\u2019re fired,\" Luce wrote. Some of Ivanka Trump's defenders pushed back against Ocasio-Cortez's criticism. They said it was ironic that Ocasio-Cortez, a bartender and the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, was criticizing someone as being unqualified. College professor Oliver McGee, a frequent guest on Fox News, accused Ocasio-Cortez of \"jealousy\" for Ivanka Trump's place\u00a0\u00a0\"on the world stage\" and called her criticism \"petty & classless.\" \"Diplomat Ivanka is savvy in business & politics to dialogue with world leaders! Being a bartender is NOT a savvy qualification for Congress,\" McGee tweeted. \"Imagine lacking this much self-awareness. The bartender turned Congresswoman, called someone unqualified,\" the Students for Trump Twitter account replied to Ocasio-Cortez's post. \"She didn\u2019t 'turn'\u00a0Congresswoman,\" another Twitter user replied to Students for Trump's criticism. \"She campaigned, beat an entrenched politician, and she did it with grit and a vision. You may not like her views, but nothing was handed to her ... unlike Ivanka.\"",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden sounded a note of caution Friday about progressive Democrats and their policies, saying\u00a0that Democratic voters are more \"center-left\" and not \"way left.\" During an interview with CNN broadcast\u00a0Friday, Biden pointed to a number of moderate Democrats who won swing districts during the 2018 midterms. \"That's what this election is about. I'm happy to debate that issue and all those issues with my friends because guess what, look who won the races. Look who won last time out,\" Biden said. Throughout the Democratic presidential primary race, Biden\u00a0has continued to tout his more moderate proposals as some other\u00a02020 Democrats have announced their support for more left-leaning ideas, such as Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all. He said his plan includes keeping private insurance while allowing people to opt in to Medicare if they would like. The former vice president also downplayed last year's electoral victory by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \"By the way, I think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary,\" Bidden said. \"In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education and health care.\" More:Joe Biden says that he wasn't prepared for Kamala Harris' criticism on segregation and busing More:Elizabeth Warren's 35,000 selfies aren't just for kicks; they're a campaign strategy Ocasio-Cortez, 29, had a stunning\u00a0upset during the 2018 primaries against former Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, who served in the House for 10 terms. The district is predominately Democratic and Ocasio-Cortez won the general election with\u00a078% of the vote. Since then, Ocasio-Cortez has become\u00a0the face of the new progressive lawmakers elected to the House of Representatives. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination, retweeted a clip of Biden's comments and\u00a0said he was proud to work with Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders has endorsed the New York Democrat's Green New Deal. The two lawmakers have also introduced legislation that would impose a 15 percent interest rate cap on all consumer loans. \"I\u2019m proud to be working with @AOC and so many other Democrats to pass Medicare for All, debt free college and a Green New Deal,\" he tweeted. \"This is the agenda America needs \u2014 and that will energize voters to defeat Donald Trump.\" Ocasio-Cortez retweeted Sanders and then added a thank to the Vermont senator: \"Thank you, @SenSanders. It\u2019s an honor to work alongside you and the millions of other people fighting for education, healthcare, and a living wage as rights.\" However, during the 2018 midterms, many of the Democrats who flipped districts were more moderate. And those moderate Democrats helped the party flip key House districts from Republican hands, according to analysis from Vox. Biden described the Democratic Party as moderate. \"Look, it's center-left, that's where I am,\" he said. \"Where it's not is way left.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0has been outspoken about\u00a0the Trump administration's treatment of migrants crossing\u00a0into the U.S. via the southern border with Mexico\u00a0and about\u00a0undocumented immigrants living in the United States currently. The New York Democrat\u00a0has repeatedly called for\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be abolished. And now, Ocasio-Cortez says she thinks that the Department of Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over\u00a0ICE, should be eliminated as well. \u2018They tore out a piece of my heart\u2019:Migrant mother describes toddler\u2019s illness, death In an interview with the New Yorker, the progressive lawmaker\u00a0said she believes the core structure of ICE and the DHS\u00a0\"are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight\"\u00a0and \"it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies.\" When asked whether she would\u00a0get rid of DHS, she said: \"I think so.\" \"I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush Administration did,\" she said.\u00a0\"I feel like it is a very qualified and supported position, at least in terms of evidence and in terms of being able to make the argument that we never should have created D.H.S., in the early 2000s.\" Amid intra-party bickering between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several freshmen congresswomen, including Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat said she doesn't believe she really has a relationship with the House speaker. \"I think sometimes people think that we have this, like, we have a relationship,\" she said during the interview. When asked whether she does, Ocasio-Cortez said: \"Not particularly.\" \"Not one that\u2019s, I think, distinguished from anyone else,\" she said. More:Pelosi after quarrels with AOC, Tlaib: 'You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it' She added that the last time she spoke to Pelosi one-on-one was when the House speaker asked her to join the select committee on climate change. Ocasio-Cortez said she did not join the panel because\u00a0she had several requests regarding the committee which were not accommodated: that the committee have a legislative mission that\u00a0included\u00a0drafting legislation by 2020, that\u00a0it have subpoena power and that\u00a0members of the select committee\u00a0not take any money from the fossil fuel industry. In addition, she said that her committee assignments that she was ultimately given have been \"very intense and very rigorous.\" Ocasio-Cortez serves on the\u00a0House Financial Services Committee and the House Oversight Committee. \"I was assigned to two of some of the busiest committees and four subcommittees,\" she said.\u00a0\"So my hands are full.\" \"And sometimes I wonder if they\u2019re trying to keep me busy,\" she added, laughing. In 2016, Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Now the Vermont senator is\u00a0running again, but Ocasio-Cortez has not endorsed him\u00a0just yet. However, she has worked on legislation with him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Ocasio-Cortez said she has been approached by several candidates seeking her endorsement. She said she tells them all the same thing:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody for some time.\u201d \"I certainly don\u2019t want to endorse anyone this year,\" she said, but she noted\u00a0that she will likely make an endorsement before the Democratic nomination is locked in. \"You know, I think we need to have debates. I think we need to have a national conversation. And also, I need to do my job.\" Ocasio-Cortez also commented on former Vice President Joe Biden's and Sen. Kamala Harris' debate performance late last month. The freshman congresswoman said she thinks it was fair that Harris confronted Biden on his comments about working with segregationist Democrats during his time in Congress and about\u00a0his stance on busing decades ago. More:Penalizing candidates who interrupt, and other changes coming to the Democratic debates \"I absolutely think she was fair,\" Ocasio-Cortez said of Harris.\u00a0\"And I think this is also part of a larger discussion, and that issues of race and gender are not extra-credit points in being a good Democrat. They are a core part of the competencies that a President needs.\" However, the New York Democrat said that past criticism of Harris has\u00a0been warranted and she wants to learn about the California senator's worldview. Ocasio-Cortez said that\u00a0Biden's debate performance called into question whether he is capable of being president due to his age. \"His performance on the stage kind of raised some questions with respect to that,\" she said. Biden is 76 years old. However, if Biden\u00a0is the Democratic nominee, Ocasio-Cortez said \"I will do what I can\" to help beat President Donald Trump in 2020. \"Well, we need to defeat this President.\" she told the New Yorker, \"And so, to the extent that I could be helpful in that, you know, I will do what I can.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

The measure supplies money for a compensation fund for firefighters, police officers and other emergency personnel who worked on the scene in New York City\u00a0in the aftermath of\u00a0the terrorist attacks of\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001. The bill passed the Senate earlier this week by a margin of 97-2, despite attempts by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah,\u00a0to offset the costs and add amendments. Trump will sign it into law during a ceremony with dozens of first responders, but one high-profile advocate won\u2019t be there. Comedian and longtime first-responder activist Jon Stewart will reportedly be on vacation. After weeks of public friction, high-profile Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York) are scheduled to meet face-to-face Friday in Washington, DC.\u00a0Pelosi said she's \"looking forward\" to the meeting and Ocasio-Cortez added it is \"nothing too climactic.\" Signs of tension between the two have arisen since Ocasio-Cortez's arrival in January, but they appeared to boil over after Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-year congresswomen from the party's progressive wing known as the \"Squad\"\u00a0were the only Democrats to vote against a version of a border funding bill that Pelosi promoted.\u00a0Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez have appeared to unify in recent days after President Donald Trump unleashed a series of racist attacks against\u00a0the Squad.

      "content": "A group of freshman Democratic congresswomen responded on social media this weekend to criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who dismissed them and \"their Twitter world\" in an interview with The New York Times. Columnist Maureen Dowd asked Pelosi about the opposition to a border funding bill from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.;\u00a0Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Pelosi said \"our bill\"\u00a0was the best Democrats\u00a0could do. She\u00a0criticized the four liberal freshman\u00a0\u2013 whom Dowd referred to as \"the Squad\"\u00a0\u2013 for being the only members of their party\u00a0to vote\u00a0against the original version of the legislation passed by the Democratic-led House, which included some protections for migrant children. \"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\" Pelosi\u00a0said, according to Dowd. \"But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\" The response was swift. \"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment,\" Ocasio-Cortez fired back on Twitter. \"And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\" 'Children come first':House passes $4.6 billion in aid for migrants at border after Pelosi caves to Republicans More:AOC criticizes CBP after report of secret Facebook group as agency opens investigation \"I don\u2019t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, explaining her opposition to the legislation. \"It\u2019s a huge mistake. This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People\u2019s lives are getting bargained, & for what?\" The House version of the border funding bill was rejected by\u00a0the Republican-led Senate. Pelosi then capitulated and agreed to join the moderates in her party in passing\u00a0the Senate version of the $4.6 billion bill. Ninety-five Democrats bucked their leader and voted against that version, with another 10 not voting. Pelosi said she \"reluctantly\" decided to back\u00a0the Senate version of the bill because\u00a0\"the children come first\" and the emergency funding was needed to get resources to help the mass of migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Pelosi told Dowd that the blame should go to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whom she called \"authentically terrible.\" \"With all due respect, the press likes to make a story that is more about Democrats divided than the fact that Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t care about the children,\" she said. Migrant children's haunting drawings:'These children coming into our country need a voice,' doctor says The stuff of nightmares:Inside the migrant detention center in Clint, Texas 'They are run beautifully':Trump responds to report describing dangerous conditions at detention facilities Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti said on Twitter that the four Democrats had opposed Pelosi's version of the bill because they did not trust a promise he says McConnell made to Pelosi that he would pass the House version of the bill. \"Nah. It is deeper than that,\" Tlaib wrote in response to\u00a0Chakrabarti's tweet. \"Why would we fund a broken system that rips children away from their parents, deny asylum seekers due process & fuels a racist ideology that dehumanizes people?\" Tlaib also retweeted two posts that fired back at Pelosi's comment to Dowd, including one from immigrants right advocate Greisa Mart\u00ednez Rosas who said, \"The strategy is simple: Don\u2019t fall for lies. Play to Win,\" and another from Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein that pointed out the \"pivotal policy proposals\" authored by each member of \"The Squad.\" Democratic divisions:Biden urges caution about policies of 'way left' Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez Stein's tweet was also shared by Omar, who responded to Ocasio-Cortez's post about\u00a0Pelosi's comments with a cry of\u00a0\"Patetico!\"\u00a0\u2013 apparently referring to the Spanish word for \"pathetic.\" \"You know they\u2019re just salty about WHO is wielding the power to shift 'public sentiment' these days, sis. Sorry not sorry,\" Omar tweeted. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, also took issue with Pelosi's dismissal of Twitter, saying the speaker would \"rather campaign like it\u2019s 2008.\" \"I find it strange when members act as though social media isn\u2019t important,\" she said before using emojis to slam conventional campaigning, which spends\u00a0millions of dollars on television advertising. \"I haven\u2019t dialed for dollars *once* this year, & have more time to do my actual job,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

      "content": "No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not a racist. Yes, she has been an ally of women of color for her entire 31-year career in Congress. I have seen her up close and personal, when she spoke at\u00a0an event my Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority held last year in Washington, D.C. at the Library of Congress to honor a historic black woman. She is all in on black women\u2019s advancement and policy issues. To argue otherwise would be untrue. Yet\u00a0freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\u00a0has it right \u2014 Speaker Pelosi is old guard. She does not like her new, high-profile women of color members nipping at her heels. She paid her dues. She worked her way up through the male dominated congressional system for decades to become the nation\u2019s first female Speaker of the House. The daughter of a powerful Baltimore Mayor, Pelosi was raised in the 1950s and came of age in the early 1960s. She remembers a time when women were like \"Leave it to Beaver\u201d or \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d moms, known for their pearls and perfectly coiffed hair. Pelosi remembers an America where women were largely silent, and could advance in politics, but only through steady party loyalty, staying in their place, waiting their turn, and never running their mouths to the media. This is Pelosi\u2019s formation as a politician and to a large degree as a person. Enter New York\u2019s 29-year-old \"AOC,\u201d a\u00a0she is known, and her Democratic colleagues Rep.\u00a0Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. These bold, young women of color \u2014 unbought and unbossed in the spirit of the late Rep. Shirley Chisholm \u2014 have turned the Democratic caucus on its head. They are unafraid to speak out, to call out, and demand the change that we are so often asked to delay or deny as women of color. The current tensions erupted\u00a0after\u00a0the four women opposed a border spending\u00a0bill they said failed to protect migrant children from President Donald Trump's policies. Pelosi criticized them\u00a0 in\u00a0interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, the women fought back, and AOC\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post that Pelosi had been \"outright disrespectful.\" She accused her of \"the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\" The issue here is NOT that Pelosi is a racist. In fact, Trump's Twitter attack Sunday\u00a0on \u201c'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen\" and his suggestion that they \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" drew a strong defense of the four women from Pelosi, who called his comments xenophobic and evidence that he wanted to make America \"white again.\" No, the real issue here is what we academics call \u201cintersectionality\"\u00a0\u2014 the combined impact of racism, sexism and other types of discrimination on people and groups. In practice, it means that white women in power often take on the same characteristics of white men in power toward women of color. Last straw:\u00a0'I think I'd take it'?\u00a0Nancy Pelosi, it's time to impeach Trump. The effect on women of color is widespread.\u00a0White women earn 77\u00a0cents on the dollarcompared to white men. Hispanic or Latina women earn 53 cents on\u00a0the dollar. Black or African-American women earn 61 cents. White women have made notable advancements in industry, politics, academia and corporate America, whereas women of color make up only about 5% of corporate executives and there is only one woman of color heading a Fortune 500 company. In\u00a0medical schools,\u00a0law schools\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0law firms, while\u00a0women overall\u00a0have achieved parity or better,\u00a0women of color lag far behind.\u00a0I could go on and on with data points, but that is not the issue at hand. When you need Trump to defend you as not being a racist, you must stop and consider why. What do I mean?\u00a0On Friday, Trump told reporters that AOC had been \"very disrespectful\" to Pelosi. \"I don't think that Nancy can let that go on,\" he added. What the heck? What Trump really meant to say is that older white people like him, Biden, and yes, Pelosi, simply do not yet know how to deal with women of color being in power and holding their feet to the fire. Pelosi tough:\u00a0Donald Trump caved to Nancy Pelosi on shutdown, now the wall will never be built Black women are deemed \u201cangry.\u201d Latina women are deemed fiery. And Muslim women are \u201cradical.\u201d These words often used to describe us are meant to marginalize and silence us. The solution here is not for Speaker Pelosi to silence AOC or condemn her. It is to listen and learn and find a way to work together. This is not Congress in 1978, 1988 or 1998. This is 2019. People of color have a voice. Women of color have a voice. These women are members of the United States Congress. These women of color have a national platform that empowers them and indeed demands of them that they speak up for themselves and their constituents. Sophia A.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 New York businesswoman Scherie Murray announced Wednesday that she is running for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's congressional seat in 2020. In a series of tweets announcing her candidacy, Murray, who immigrated to New York from Jamaica when she was 9, said Ocasio-Cortez was more \"worried about being famous\" than representing her constituents. \"There\u2019s a crisis in Queens and it\u2019s called AOC,\" the Republican\u00a0said, referring to Ocasio-Cortez by her initials. She said the freshman Democrat \"seeks celebrity & publicity\" and \"thinks public service is not about serving the public, but herself.\" Murray said she had experience building bridges \"between constituents in our community and the elected officials that represent them, between different nationalities and races, and between political parties.\" She said Ocasio-Cortez instead favored conflict and criticized her for her role in driving Amazon to abandon its\u00a0plans to build a second headquarters in New York. The youngest\u00a0woman ever\u00a0elected to Congress, Ocasio-Cortez has been a frequent target of attacks from conservatives on Capitol Hill and in the news media. A self-described democratic socialist best known for being a sponsor of the Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez had been portrayed as the face of a leftward shift in the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez is also known as a member of \"The Squad\" along with\u00a0Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. The freshmen lawmakers'\u00a0liberal positions have at times put them at odds with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This week, Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib have been at the center of a firestorm created after President Donald Trump told the four minority\u00a0congresswomen, all of whom are U.S. citizens, to \"go back\" and fix their countries of origin before try to push legislative changes in America. Murray made an unsuccessful run in a special election for a\u00a0New York Assembly seat in 2015, losing by more than 85 percentage points. She lost by a similar margin in a 2013 bid for New York City Council. She is the fourth Republican to file for a run against Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Post reported, joining former police officer John Cummings, journalist\u00a0Ruth Papazian\u00a0and\u00a0building superintendent\u00a0Miguel Hernandez. The Republicans will face an uphill battle in New York's heavily Democratic 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens. Ocasio-Cortez won the seat in 2018 with 78% of the vote.",

He has repeatedly criticized the four progressive Democrats and called on them to \"go back\" to their countries. All four congresswomen are U.S. citizens, with three being born in the United States.

That\u2019s not going to happen.\" The Gretna Police Department did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. Rispoli's post comes amid mounting concern for elected officials' safety in an increasingly rancorous political climate. In June 2017, a man opened fire on a group of Republican members of Congress\u00a0during their baseball team's practice in Virginia. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisana was severely injured in the attack. Last week,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told lawmakers\u00a0\"we continue to see the threat assessment cases we're opening continue to grow.\" In May, Ocasio-Cortez said she was regularly getting \"hateful messages\" and a \"flood of death threats.\" She said there was a connection between the threats and the reporting about her on\u00a0conservative news media outlets and also blamed Fox News. On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez, a fierce critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies, questioned\u00a0Homeland Security head Kevin McAleenan over threatening messages directed at her \u2013 including Photoshopped images depicting her rape\u00a0\u2013\u00a0on a secret Facebook group\u00a0for\u00a0Border Patrol agents.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blames GOP groups for death threats Ocasio-Cortez is one of four Democratic congresswomen, known as \"the Squad,\" who have been the target of sharp criticism from President Donald Trump. Trump has said Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., \"hate our country.\" The president has also suggested that the four congresswomen of color, all of whom are U.S. citizens and three of whom were born in the U.S., should return to their countries of origin and fix the problems there before trying to make legislative changes in the U.S. Omar has said she has faced an increase in death threats since she became a target of the president's ire. In April, a New York man was accused of saying he would \"put a bullet\" in Omar. That same month, a Florida man was arrested after he allegedly threatened several high-profile Democrats, including Tlaib and Omar, whom he said he wanted to throw off the Empire State Building. Trump and his family have been targeted as well.\u00a0In May, a New Jersey man was arrested for allegedly saying he wanted to \"bomb Trump Tower,\" and two years before that\u00a0a Michigan man was charged with threatening to assassinate Trump. And in February 2018, Donald Trump Jr.'s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, was rushed to the hospital after opening a package containing a \"suspicious\" white substance that was later determined to be non-toxic. Those around Trump and his administration have also been confronted in public on a number of occasions. Last month, Eric Trump said an employee at a Chicago cocktail bar spat on him. In April, charges were dropped against a woman who White House counselor Kellyanne Conway says grabbed her and shook her by the shoulders.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are in talks to set up a face-to-face meeting with each other, amid intra-party tension between the two Democratic lawmakers. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hamill said Ocasio-Cortez's office reached out Tuesday afternoon for a one-on-one meeting. During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd\u00a0earlier this month,\u00a0Pelosi downplayed four votes from a group of progressive Democrats against a\u00a0border funding bill. Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all voted against the bill. The four congresswomen of color are colloquially known as \"The Squad.\" \"We are working to schedule this meeting,\" Hamill said of Pelosi meeting with Ocasio-Cortez, adding that the speaker's chief of staff has already met with the four chiefs of these offices. In an interview with CBS News\u00a0broadcast Wednesday,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez said she \"absolutely\" wants to meet with Pelosi. More:New York businesswoman and Jamaican immigrant Scherie Murray launches campaign to unseat Ocasio-Cortez More:House votes to condemn Trump's racist tweets with support from only 4 Republicans Pelosi in the New York Times said of The Squad: \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Since then, some members of \"The Squad\" have individually responded to the\u00a0speaker's remarks on Twitter. That prompted Pelosi in a closed-door meeting to warn Democratic lawmakers that if any\u00a0lawmaker had an issue within the party, they should come directly to her and not tweet about it. During an interview with the Washington Post\u00a0last week,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi of \"singling out of newly elected women of color.\" The\u00a0next day, she told\u00a0CNN that she \"absolutely\" did not believe Pelosi was racist. Since then, however, the tension between Pelosi and the Squad has been drowned out by days of tweets and attacks on the four progressive lawmakers by President Donald Trump. Trump on Sunday tweeted that\u00a0the four lawmakers should\u00a0\"go back\" to their countries, and has since doubled down several times on his attacks and criticisms of the Democrats. Three of the congresswomen were\u00a0born in the United States. Omar immigrated to the U.S. over 20 years ago from Somalia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. The House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's comments as racist,\u00a0by\u00a0a 240-187 vote. During the CBS interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she did not believe there is a fracture in the Democratic Party. \"I think that just as there were members of Congress that did not vote for the speaker on the House Floor the day of our swearing-in, just as there are members who challenge her conclusions, who disagree with her, so do we from time-to-time,\" she said.\u00a0\"But that does not mean that there is a fundamental fracture or a dehumanizing going on within our caucus.\" Contributing: Christal Hayes Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is welcoming a new member to \"The Squad\": 82-year-old Rep. Bill Pascrell. The New Jersey Democrat\u00a0asked Tuesday to\u00a0be part of the outspoken group of House Democratic congresswomen who have been given their own moniker. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are the four freshmen lawmakers who have\u00a0collectively become known as \"The Squad.\" Pascrell responded to a tweet from The Onion, a satirical website, that posted an article entitled \"82-Year-Old New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell Quietly Asks Ilhan Omar If He Can Be Part Of The Squad.\" 'We want to just fight':Democrats' attempt to condemn Trump's racist tweets through House resolution delayed More:George Conway, husband of Kellyanne Conway, calls Trump a racist in op-ed \"Well. How bout it @AyannaPressley @AOC @RepRashida @IlhanMN?\" Pascrell tweeted. Shortly afterward, Ocasio-Cortez gave her approval to the 82-year-old. \"You\u2019re in, @BillPascrell!\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, with several emojis including a smiley face and heart. The exchange comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized \"The Squad\" in recent days. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted for the progressive lawmakers to \"go back\" to their country, a phrase often used in racist tropes. Three of the lawmakers were born in the U.S. Omar came\u00a0to the United States as a refugee from Somalia more than 20 years ago and is\u00a0a naturalized U.S. citizen. The president has doubled down on his comments several times since his initial tweets on Sunday.\u00a0The four congresswomen held a press conference Monday denouncing Trump's comments, calling them \"racist,\" \"xenophobic,\" and \"bigoted.\" More:House GOP leaders refuse to condemn Donald Trump's racist tweets, say the uproar is 'all about politics' More:Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad.' Here's what we know Pascrell is one of many Democrats who have defended the congresswomen from Trump's attacks, saying that the president\u00a0\"can't leave soon enough.\" Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also criticized the congresswomen after they voted against a\u00a0border funding bill. The speaker's statement sparked tension between The Squad and Pelosi, which has since been diminished following Trump's remarks as Pelosi and\u00a0many Democrats have lined up in solidarity behind the four congresswomen.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met face-to-face Friday\u00a0after weeks of public friction between the two high-profile Democrats. \"It went very well,\" Pelsoi said after the meeting. When asked if she and Ocasio-Cortez resolved any of their differences, Pelosi replied, \"we don't have that many differences.\"\u00a0The speaker wrote in a tweet later that the two met \"to discuss working together to meet the needs of our districts and our country, fairness in our economy and diversity in our country.\" Speaking later Friday at her weekly press conference, Pelsoi expressed \"some level of confidence, and actually joy\" at the diversity of the House Democratic caucus and its ability to unify around issues. \"Ever since I came here, we have engaged in differences of opinion in our caucus, and that is a good thing,\" Pelosi said.\u00a0\"In our caucus, we have our differences. Respect that, instead of making a big issue of it. Respect that.\" The collegial tone after the meeting appears to be the latest iteration of the sometimes-contentious\u00a0relationship between the speaker from California and the freshman lawmaker from New York,\u00a0who has come to represent the progressive wing of the party. The two have have quibbled over both policies and tactics during their six months together in the House but recently appeared to unify after President Donald Trump made\u00a0racist attacks against\u00a0four minority members of Congress. Budget deal:Donald Trump's budget deal with Democrats passes House but conservatives pan it as reckless The pair condemned Trump\u2019s tweets\u00a0in which he told the four House Democrats, which included Ocasio-Cortez,\u00a0to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d Pelosi said the tweets were \u201cdisgraceful and disgusting\u201d and introduced a resolution to condemn the comments as racist. But before Trump's attacks, signs of tensions between the two had\u00a0been\u00a0visible\u00a0from the time of Ocasio-Cortez's congressional orientation, when she joined\u00a0a climate protest outside Pelosi's office. And they continued as Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0disagreed\u00a0with the speaker's cautious approach to pursuing impeachment proceedings against Trump, while Pelosi offered\u00a0lukewarm support for Ocasio-Cortez's\u00a0Green New Deal. Tensions appeared to boil over after Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-year congresswomen from the party's progressive wing were the only Democrats to vote against a version of a border funding bill that Pelosi promoted. '45 is a puppet':Trump appears in front of altered presidential seal saying '45 is a puppet' During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Pelosi criticized Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for voting against the bill. \"They didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got,\" Pelosi said. That article prompted\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff\u00a0to criticize Pelosi and centrist Democrats on social media.\u00a0Pelosi then called out Ocasio-Cortez and the other three freshman congresswoman\u00a0in a caucus meeting. \"You got a complaint?\u00a0You come and talk to me about it,\" Pelosi said, according to a source in the room. \"But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK.\" From impeachment to indictment:5 repercussions from Robert Mueller's testimony Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying it was \u201coutright disrespectful\u201d for Pelosi to repeatedly single out newly elected women of color, though she later tried to downplay any ill-will between herself and the speaker. On Thursday, Pelosi minimized\u00a0reports of strain in her relationship with Ocasio-Cortez, saying,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\" \u201cI don\u2019t think there are tensions,\" she said. When asked about the meeting Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said, \"I don\u2019t think I have a strong message for her.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, views the meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0as a further sign of de-escalation. \"The speaker is our coach and leader, and (Ocasio-Cortez)\u00a0is a star recruit freshman who\u2019s capable of big plays,\" he said, \"so they should see that they both have a particular role to play on the team and ultimately the goal is for the team to win.\" Executions:Justice Department resumes capital punishment after nearly two decades, orders executions of five inmates Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar for the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump's comments \"actually brought Democrats together.\" \"They felt under siege in a completely vile way and that created a commonality,\" he said. \"It created an opening for a different kind of dialogue between the speaker and AOC.\u201d Ornstein said the meeting is significant because\u00a0\"the speaker doesn\u2019t meet individually with a lot of members on a regular basis because she has so many other things going on.\" When Pelosi was asked at her weekly press conference if she and Ocasio-Cortez had buried the hatchet, Pelsoi replied, \"I don't think there ever was any hatchet.\" Contributing: Christal Hayes",

Hice had accused her of having \"deliberately misled the American people\" about the treatment of migrants in detention. Ocasio-Cortez had previously said migrants in Border Patrol custody were held in substandard conditions and \"forced to drink out of toilets.\" Hice disagreed. In the first of two videos posted on Twitter on Monday, Hice drank out of one of the combined drinking fountains and toilets at the center of controversy. \"There's drinkable water within this toilet system, AOC is giving fallacious information, here's the truth,\" Hice said, after drinking from it. In another video,\u00a0Hice visited a warehouse he called a \"miniature Walmart,\" full of basic necessities like socks, toothbrushes, and clothing for detained migrants. The disagreement stemmed from comments Ocasio-Cortez had made after a visit to a Border Patrol facility at the beginning of July.\u00a0On July 1, after touring the facility, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to say Border Patrol officers were telling detained migrant women\u00a0 \"to drink out of the toilets,\" sparking a social media firestorm.

Ireland was charged with \"one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, one count of being a fugitive in possession of a firearm and one count of making interstate threats,\" according to\u00a0the Department of Justice.

On August 2, the Capitol Police called Ireland at a number found in public records and asked him if he made the post and if he owned firearms. The Capitol Police said Ireland told them he was \"very proud of that post he made,\" and admitted to owning firearms. Six days later, Capitol Police and the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents searched Ireland's house after obtaining a search warrant. They detained him at the scene and\u00a0found seven rounds of ammunition inside his kitchen drawers\u00a0\u2013 three rounds of .32 caliber ammunition and four rounds of .45 caliber ammunition.

Bernie Sanders for president came as he took the stage alongside his 2020 rivals and showed he was still in the game after a health scare. But Sanders got the news from the New York representative herself as he was still recovering in the hospital from a heart attack earlier this month, according to a new report. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told\u00a0Politico\u00a0he answered the phone that day and passed it over to Sanders, who was in his hospital bed. \"Think about the courage of this person who says, \u2018You know, I know what you just went through but I have so much trust and confidence in you that you are the one who will fight the fight that I believe in. I'm with you,' \" Shakir said. Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, another freshman Democrat in Congress who announced her support of Sanders Tuesday night, also told the senator about her decision after his heart attack, according to Politico. Sanders\u00a0said during Tuesday's debate that a \"special guest\" would be joining him at a rally this weekend, and it was later confirmed the guest would be Ocasio-Cortez and that she would make her endorsement then. In response to a question about his heart attack and recovery at the debate, the 78-year-old\u00a0said, \"I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great.\" Sanders had canceled several campaign events after his surgery.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic congresswoman\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0got real in an interview with the Huffington Post about the toll of sudden fame. The 30-year-old arrived in\u00a0the national spotlight in 2018 after defeating a well-known and powerful incumbent in New York's 14th congressional district while working as a waitress. At 29, she became the youngest congresswoman\u00a0ever. She has 5.5 million Twitter followers, is consistently targeted\u00a0by President Donald Trump, and repeatedly makes national headlines and appearances\u00a0on television. She told HuffPo,\u00a0\u201cSometimes I just want to be a human being. And you don\u2019t get to be a human anymore. Everything you do from wearing sweatpants to the bodega to getting a haircut \u2015 every personal decision you make for yourself is never going to be yours anymore.\u201d Earlier this month, AOC shot back after a story in the conservative Washington Times criticized her for a \"high-dollar hairdo,\" after spending $300 on her haircut, lowlights, and the tip. 'The halls of Congress are no joke':AOC reflects on Congress as she endorses Sanders The interview from AOC comes just days after American-born Duchess Meghan Markle of Sussex gave a raw\u00a0interview on British television\u00a0about the hardships of fame that went viral. AOC had responded to the interview via tweet, \u201cSudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There\u2019s a part of your life that you lose, & it later dawns on you that you\u2019ll never get it back.\u201d \u201cThe people who treat you like a human make all the difference,\u201d she continued. AOC told HuffPo that while she has accepted her privacy will never return to normal, she added, \u201cYou kind of grieve for that. It has its highs and it has its lows. A lot of people look at the highs, but sometimes it feels like you got a tattoo on your face that you didn\u2019t ask for. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very hard. Sometimes you just want to get a drink or eat a hamburger.\u201d Despite mixed feelings about all the attention, AOC said, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to be hidden away. In order for me to do my job, I need to be connected to people. My job is to love people. And that\u2019s very difficult sometimes given the amount of barriers.\u201d",

      "content": "After freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez officially endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president at a Queens, N.Y. rally on Saturday, the Vermont progressive said he wants Ocasio-Cortez to work in his White House Sanders was asked in a joint interview with\u00a0CBS News\u00a0if he would consider Ocasio-Cortez to be his running mate. The congresswoman answered for him as both laughed: \"I think I'm too young for that.\" \"There you go, she's answered,\" Sanders added. But when Ocasio-Cortez was asked if she'd work in Sanders' administration should he be elected president, he interjected with a forceful \"Yes, you would.\" Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, said at the rally that\u00a0the pressure that has been on her since she was elected to office made her\u00a0\"appreciate the enormous, consistent, and non-stop advocacy\" of Sanders. Sanders' recent health scare was a \"gut check,\" Ocasio-Cortez told CBS.\u00a0She informed Sanders of her decision to back his campaign while he was still recovering from a heart attack earlier this month. \"Neither me nor the senator cannot do this by ourselves,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. On health scare:Bernie Sanders reassured voters following heart attack Last week's Democratic primary debate was Sanders' return to the campaign trail following\u00a0his hospitalization, and in response to a question about his heart attack and recovery at the debate, the 78-year-old\u00a0said, \"I\u2019m healthy.\u00a0I\u2019m feeling great.\" Sanders\u00a0canceled several campaign events after his surgery but said that he would continue with a \"vigorous\" campaign. Sanders also has the backing of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and she and Ocasio-Cortez have faced some criticism from those who question their choice to support a white man's candidacy. When asked why, as a woman of color, Ocasio-Cortez made that decision, she said,\u00a0\"I'm actually very excited about this partnership because it shows what we have to do in our country, is that we have to come together across race, across gender, across generation.\" 'It is no joke':Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reflects on Congress as she endorses Sanders Ocasio-Cortez says she had also\u00a0spoken to other candidates, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ahead of her endorsement. \"I think she's a fabulous candidate. Frankly, Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren and myself are all on the same team in the party,\" she said. Warren is currently outpacing Sanders in national and early-state polls alongside former Vice President Joe Biden. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Sanders is in fourth place behind Biden, Warren and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. USA TODAY/Suffolk poll:Iowa caucuses are 'up for grabs' as Pete Buttigieg surges into top tier Nationally, Sanders is in third place after Biden and Warren, according RealClearPolitics averages.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apologized Monday to a man\u00a0she had blocked on Twitter as part of a settlement of a federal lawsuit he brought against her earlier this year. The New York Democrat said she had reconsidered her decision to block\u00a0former New York state Assemblyman\u00a0Dov Hikind, who had often criticized her on the social media platform, particularly her\u00a0comparison of migrant detention centers to concentration camps. \"Mr. Hikind has a First Amendment right to express his views and should not be blocked for them,\"\u00a0she said in a statement. \"In retrospect,\u00a0it was wrong and improper and does not reflect the values I cherish. I sincerely apologize for blocking Mr. Hikind.\" But Ocasio-Cortez, who has said she has received many threats,\u00a0reserved the right to block those she felt were harassing her. Hikind said in a news conference that he was pleased with Ocasio-Cortez's apology and that he \"couldn't ask for much more at this point.\" He said he hoped it would be the start of a dialogue between himself and the congresswoman. From unknown to US Congress:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0says sudden fame is like 'a tattoo on your face' More:Bernie Sanders says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will work in his administration if he's president \"Every public official needs to unblock the public from following them on Twitter,\"\u00a0Hikind said. \"You want to be in elective\u00a0office? Don't be afraid of what people have to say to you.\" His lawsuit was filed after a federal appeals panel ruled that President Donald Trump could not block Twitter users who criticized him. The panel said that because Trump often made policy announcements and conducted official business through his Twitter account, he was silencing critics and violating their First Amendment rights by blocking them. Voices:Trump blocked me on Twitter. I sued (and won) because modern town halls happen online. Hikind\u00a0said that people who \"cross the line\" and threaten public officials are \"another story.\" \"But just because you don't like what someone is saying, or you don't like the way they're\u00a0saying it, does not give you a right to abridge their freedom of speech,\" he said. Ocasio-Cortez has more than 5.7 million Twitter followers on her account, which she uses to discuss topics ranging from mundane personal matters to legislation and congressional affairs. The congresswoman had been scheduled to testify Tuesday in the case, Hikind said, adding that he had looked forward to hearing \"why Ocasio-Cortez decided to silence me, to silence my voice, to take away my speech.\" Contributing: The Associated Press 'The halls of Congress are no joke':AOC reflects on Congress as she endorses Sanders 'They\u2019re just mad we look good doing it':AOC responds to story about the price of her hairstyle",
