The agency will look at remedies aimed at vulnerable groups, such as infants and people who might be using them for life-threatening diseases like cancer.

Three days before that vote, in a memorable July 25 Senate floor speech, delivered at the height of partisan rancor over whether to repeal or save Obama's Affordable Care Act, McCain made a passionate case for the Senate to return to regular order and the civility and camaraderie for which the upper chamber once was known."

It'll raise the odds of a strong 2020 presidential ticket.","null","","Younger Democrats, such as Gabbard (37) and Castro (44), are going through the presidential process to build a following and establish credentials for a more serious run in 2024 or 2028. They could spend millions, clog the debate stage, and still wind up hoping to be selected as a running mate by the party’s eventual nominee.

As for the party’s heavyweights, such as Joe Biden and Warren, picking a running mate early would serve to counter weaknesses. Biden could team with a younger, more progressive Democrat, ideally a woman. Warren could select a younger male from the nation’s midsection who supports her views but is closer to the center of the liberal spectrum.

Care and soul-searching would have to take place among the candidates and their handlers. Picking the wrong running mate could ruin a campaign, as was famously proved by John McCain in his selection of Sarah Palin in 2008. Yet, such ruination during a hectic nominating convention might be avoided by vetting now, before the race heats up.

Many of the newer Democratic hopefuls speak of duty to country in explaining their decision to run. A powerful expression of that commitment would be to suspend presidential aspirations in favor of teaming with another candidate.

Carefully crafted Democratic pairings at this early stage would present voters with tickets that are truly greater than the sum of their parts.

We need another bipartisan pair in 2020.","The last presidential 'unity ticket' was in 1864. We need another bipartisan pair in 2020.","null","","This idea is not new, even in recent times. Republican John McCain seriously considered picking Democrat-turned-independent senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate in 2008. His aides advised against it, warning it would divide the party. McCain regretted taking their advice. He wrote in his 2018 memoir, “My gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.”

Critics will dismiss a unity ticket as a pipe dream, saying the “base” of both parties would never go for it. Yet a recent Unite America poll of voters in New Hampshire, home of the nation's first primary, found 61% would support their preferred candidate choosing their running mate from the other part. That includes 67% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 51% of Republicans.Further, in a Democratic primary that will likely split the progressive coalition across more than two dozen candidates, a ""Unity"" candidate who makes a unique appeal and consolidates centrist voters may find a winning ticket not only to the convention, but also through the general election."
