I started at House & Garden Magazine, worked there for five years, and worked my way up from being the editor-in-chief’s assistant to being everybody else’s assistant. I learned a lot, and the women there were amazing – there were lots of mentors there – like Wendy Goodman was a huge mentor to me – and then Mr. (S.I) Newhouse closed it. A mutual friend recommended me to Anna Wintour, and I went to Vogue. I ended up loving it and staying just shy of a decade, and at the end of the decade she asked me to work on Teen Vogue, this idea she had of a spinoff of Vogue for young people. I founded Teen Vogue and ran it for 13 years. Teen Vogue was editor-in-chief bootcamp: I learned how to run a team, how to hire people and manage them, make a digital product and how to be a mentor to other people and let them shine. It really prepared me for the next step, which was Architectural Digest. I hate to use a cliché like dream job, but I think all the currents of my life were pointing me towards AD. I’m fortunate that that’s what happened. I got to come full-circle back to where I started, back to shelter, after a long career in fashion, beauty and the teen world. These decades of working were honing my eye and helping me develop really deep networks and trust among people in the art world, the fashion world, the social world and the entertainment world. Now, I’m able to call on all the networks of people and bring it all back to AD. The decades of doing that work brought me to this place, and I relish it. It’s the perfect job, which is such a gift."

That is one reason the Obama administration buried bin Laden at sea in 2011. There would be no grave to become a shrine. ...
