      "content": "USA TODAY has obtained a copy of \"A Warning,\" a book written by a self-described senior official in the Trump administration. The author paints a scathing portrait of a president and administration in chaos. The White House has denounced the book as a work of fiction, with press secretary Stephanie Grisham saying, \"the coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies.\" Some key excerpts: \"Advisors brandished\u00a0their knives, back-stabbing each other to get the jobs they wanted. At the same time, a parade of job-seekers made the pilgrimage to Trump\u00a0Tower in New York to pay homage to the incoming commander in chief,\u00a0seeking a place on his short list. Most had conveniently changed their\u00a0minds about the president-elect. Factions formed. Conspiracies to undermine\u00a0potential candidates \u2013 while boosting others \u2013 were hatched and\u00a0dissolved, sometimes in the same day. There was the Kushner camp, the Bannon camp, the Conway camp, and others such as Penceland or the\u00a0so-called Flynn-stones, acolytes of the anointed national security advisor.\u00a0They were united at times and divided at others. This was a real-life\u00a0version of 'The Apprentice.' \" 'Anonymous' author::Trump 'will not exit quietly,' even if defeated or impeached \"The president has proposed doing away with judges on more\u00a0than one occasion. Too many of his policies are getting stuck in legal\u00a0limbo, he says. \u201cCan we just get rid of the judges? Let\u2019s get rid of the f---ing\u00a0judges,\u201d Trump fumed one morning. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any at all,\u00a0really.\u201d He went a step further and asked his legal team to draft up a\u00a0bill and send it to Congress to reduce the number of federal judges. Staff ignored the outburst and the wacky request.\" \"In fact, it was Trump himself the previous year who suggested\u00a0shooting immigrants found crossing the border. Yes, shooting them,\u00a0real human beings, with bullets from guns held by members of our\u00a0armed forces. 'They are throwing rocks viciously and violently,'\u00a0he\u00a0said, discussing an incoming caravan of people, most of whom were fleeing poverty. They\u2019d been on the march for weeks and had gotten\u00a0past Mexican authorities. 'We are not going to put up with that. If\u00a0they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I\u00a0told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did\u00a0at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle.' \"The president\u2019s obvious admiration for Vladimir Putin ('great\u00a0guy,'\u00a0'terrific person') still continues to puzzle us, including those\u00a0on the team who shrug off his outlandish behavior. Where did the\u00a0Putin hero worship come from? It\u2019s almost as if Trump is the scrawny\u00a0kid trying to suck up to the bully on the playground. Commentators\u00a0have speculated, without any evidence, that Moscow must 'have\u00a0something'\u00a0on the president. I wish I could say. All I know is that\u00a0whatever drives his love for Putin, it\u2019s terrible for the United States\u00a0because Vladimir is not on our side and no US president should be building him up.\" \"Jared is a likable person, a youthful and energetic advisor and\u00a0an empathetic listener. However, when the secretary of defense is\u00a0cut out of Jared\u2019s meetings regarding a crucial part of the world,\u00a0or the national security advisor isn\u2019t back-briefed on an important\u00a0conversation Kushner has with a foreign ambassador, it can cause\u00a0problems, sometimes big problems. It isn\u2019t clear the president is satisfied\u00a0that so many issues run through his son-in-law\u2019s office, but\u00a0the arrangement persists because Jared is careful to always demonstrate\u00a0loyalty to his wife\u2019s father, even at the expense of his standing\u00a0among other top officials. Thus, the unclear and unhealthy lanes of\u00a0authority persist.\" \"Trump remains\u00a0fixated on his previous presidential rival years into his tenure, continuously disparaging and demeaning her. It might be a different situation if he expected to face off again with Hillary Clinton, yet she appears to be finished with public office. Don\u2019t get me wrong. No one in the Trump White House is a fan of Hillary Clinton, but we started to find the president\u2019s chronic animosity toward her to be a little weird. He has tweeted about Clinton hundreds of times since taking office. He has even flirted with using the powers of his office to investigate and prosecute her. ... Electoral defeat is not enough; Donald Trump wants total defeat of his opponents.\"",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump urged supporters in\u00a0Monroe, Louisiana, Wednesday night to cast their ballot early for\u00a0Republican businessman Eddie Rispone, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. \"I'm here for early voting,\" Trump said\u00a0before hinting he planned to return next week to\u00a0Louisiana, a state he won by nearly 20 points in 2016, to stump for Rispone. The trip\u00a0would be Trump's third trip to the state in a month. In remarks that last more than an hour, Trump railed against what he called the\"deranged, delusional, destructive, and hyper-partisan\u00a0impeachment witch hunt\"by House Democrats. He warned\u00a0they are becoming \"increasingly totalitarian\" by \"suppressing dissent, defaming the innocent, eliminating due process, staging show trials and trying to overthrow American democracy to impose their socialist agenda.\" Trump said the impeachment inquiry would benefit him in his re-election bid, and decried a whistleblower who launched the investigation\u00a0against him over a July 25 phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president dig up political dirt on Democrats. Trump read out a 2017 tweet from one of the lawyers representing the whistleblower, Mark Zaid, who was reacting to Trump's dismissal of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates at the time. The tweet, which resurfaced in a Fox News story\u00a0earlier Wednesday,\u00a0referenced a \"coup\" and said \"impeachment would follow.\" Trump has accused Democrats of plotting to illegally remove him from office. In an emailed statement, Zaid said:\u00a0\"I have zero Democrat ties. In the time since that tweet was posted, I've probably represented more Republicans, including [White House] officials, than Democrats.\" \"This is nothing more than the continuing partisan deflection to desperately avoid discussing the substance of my client's whistleblower complaint,\" he added. Rispone, a wealthy Baton Rouge businessman,\u00a0took the stage alongside Trump\u00a0to declare Louisiana\u00a0\"Trump country.\"\u00a0Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy also joined Trump on stage to echo Rispone's declaration for the president. Key moments:\u00a0Five takeaways from Trump's Monroe rally on impeachment, China and election \"With your help we can make it Rispone country,\" Cassidy said as the crowd cheered. Kennedy defended the president against the impeachment inquiry, slamming\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for launching the probe. \"I don't mean any disrespect but it must suck to be that dumb,\" he said of Pelosi. Among the guests Trump brought on stage were Duck Dynasty stars Willie and Phil Robertson. \"If you are pro-God and pro-American and pro-gun and pro-duck hunting. That's all I want,\" Phil Robertson said. Tuesday night marks Trump's second campaign rally this week following his Monday night appearance in Lexington, Kentucky, in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who appears to have fallen short in Tuesday's gubernatorial race. Trump told the Lexington crowd on Monday that losing the governor's race would send \"a really bad message,\" but he quickly pointed out on Twitter Tuesday night that every other Republican candidate seeking statewide office in Kentucky won their race.\u00a0Democratic state Attorney General Andy Beshear\u00a0led Bevin by a few thousand votes\u00a0with 100% of precincts reporting, but the incumbent governor refused to concede. Bevin's campaign on Wednesday formally requested an official recanvass of the election results. He campaigned on the eve of the Oct. 12 primary election in Lake Charles,\u00a0calling on supporter to vote for\u00a0Rispone or GOP Rep. Ralph Abraham in an effort to prevent\u00a0Edwards from getting at least 50% of the vote to force a runoff. Edwards got 46% of the vote while Rispone took 27%, setting the stage for the the Nov. 14 runoff. Trump also has cut a campaign commercial for Rispone, calling him \u201ca fantastic man, a great success\u201d and boasting that \u201ceverything he\u2019s touched has turned to gold.\u201d More than 40,000 people requested tickets for Wednesday night's rally at the Monroe Civic Center, but the arena can only hold between 7,500 and 10,000 people.\u00a0Independent\u00a0forecasters such as Cook Political Report have described the Louisiana race\u00a0as a tossup. He also plans to attend Saturday's LSU-Alabama game in Tuscaloosa, Ala., a battle of 8-0 teams pursuing college football's national championship.\u00a0 Trump mentioned LSU's fine quarterback, but did not cite him by name (Joe Burrow). Trump has stumped for several GOP\u00a0candidates in recent weeks in an effort to push them over finish line in off-year elections as both Republicans and Democrats watch\u00a0for warning signs ahead of next year's presidential election. Looking ahead:What Tuesday's elections could tell us a year before Trump faces voters Kentucky Rain: Trump looks like the bright side of election night results The president also suggested his rally last week in Tupelo,\u00a0Mississippi, for Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves \"moved the numbers\"\u00a0in the state's governor race and handed Reeves a win over\u00a0Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. Republicans in the Magnolia State will hold all eight statewide offices for the first time since Reconstruction. But Democrats emerged victorious Tuesday after flipping Virginia's state Senate and House of Delegates, giving them control of both the legislature and the governor's office for the first time in more than two decades.

Please advise his clients and Administration officials accordingly.\" Trump learned about Esposito's claims through one of his least favorite news sources, The Washington Post. In a story posted on Friday afternoon, the Post reported that, in pitches to prospective clients, Esposito claimed \u201can open line of communication to the President of the United States\u201d and his advisers, including members of his family. \"Some of those very people, however, told The Post that Esposito\u2019s claims are greatly embellished\u00a0\u2013 or simply not true,\" the newspaper said.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 A powerful House committee and New York prosecutors separately investigating President Donald Trump's financial dealings urged the Supreme Court Thursday to affirm their right to examine years of his tax returns\u00a0and financial records. The filings by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance followed arguments\u00a0by the president's lawyers that the records should be withheld \u2013 in the New York case because they claim Trump is immune\u00a0from criminal prosecution\u00a0while in office. \"Petitioner\u2019s assertion of absolute presidential immunity is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, which conclusively establishes that '(no person)\u00a0in this country is so high that he is above the law,'\" Vance responded. The House committee's request came less than a week after Trump's lawyers sought to block a federal appeals court's decision that said the records from the accounting firm Mazars USA must be released. Douglas Letter, the House of Representatives' legal counsel, argued that Trump\u2019s legal team has not \u201cdemonstrated that any harm they will suffer if Mazars responds to the subpoena outweighs the severe harm that Congress would suffer by being deprived of information it urgently needs to exercise its constitutional functions.\u201d Letter argued the records are needed to help determine \u201cwhether senior government officials, including the president, are acting in the country\u2019s best interest and not in their own financial interest ... , whether federal agencies are operating free from financial conflicts and with accurate information, and whether any legislative reforms are needed to ensure that these fundamental principles are respected.\" The justices are expected to decide in the coming days whether to grant Trump's effort to delay\u00a0and potentially reverse\u00a0the lower court's edict. They also are considering the request to block New York City prosecutors\u00a0from getting the records as part of a criminal probe into payments made to two women who claimed\u00a0they had affairs with Trump years before his election in 2016. The president\u00a0has denied those\u00a0allegations. Taken together, the cases involve\u00a0broad constitutional questions. One focuses on the breadth of Congress' investigative and legislative powers;\u00a0the other involves the untested issue of whether presidents, while they are in office, are subject to criminal investigations by local prosecutors. Last week's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit called for Mazars USA to release the records to the House committee by Nov. 20.\u00a0But Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to a brief delay this week while the two sides file legal papers in the dispute. In his response, Letter argued that the circuit court order should not be blocked while it is appealed.\u00a0\u201cIt cannot be the case that the president has the right to stall any congressional subpoena to which he objects through the months or years that it takes for a challenge to work its way through the lower courts,\" he said. \"If that were the case, the House \u2013which has only a two-year term \u2013 would be radically constrained in its ability to conduct oversight or to collect information about the executive branch.\u201d Trump's lawyers have called the\u00a0House subpoena an unprecedented test of the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. They claim the committee is engaging in law enforcement, not its legislative function. \"It is the first time Congress has issued a subpoena, under its legislative powers, to investigate the president for illegal conduct,\" the attorneys argued in reference to the House investigation. \"And, for the first time, a court has upheld a congressional subpoena to the president for his personal papers.\" Trump dropped the practice\u00a0of past presidents and presidential candidates in 2016 when he refused to release his tax returns, claiming his hands were tied because of a federal audit. He since has continued to maintain their secrecy. In the New York case, Vance urged the justices not to stand in the way of what he called \"a garden-variety investigation of purely private conduct.\u201d \"The only question here is whether a third-party custodian of the president\u2019s financial records may be subpoenaed for those records when they are relevant to a secret grand jury investigation and completely unrelated to any official action (and in fact were largely created before the president took office),\" he said. Trump's lawyer, Jay Alan Sekulow, told the justices last week that prosecutors are seeking \"reams of President Trump's private financial records for the express purpose of deciding whether to indict him for state crimes.\" \"For the first time in our nation's history, a state or local prosecutor has launched a criminal investigation of the president of the United States and subjected him to coercive criminal process,\" he wrote. Vance's subpoena\u00a0seeks records and communications related\u00a0to payments to two women: adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal.\u00a0Both\u00a0claimed to have had sexual affairs with Trump years ago, which he has denied. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, paid $130,000 to Daniels\u00a0to buy her silence\u00a0about her alleged affair with Trump. The payment was made shortly before the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0Cohen subsequently pleaded guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud and violations of campaign finance law in connection with the payment. The owner of the National Enquirer acknowledged that it paid McDougal $150,000 to squelch her account and avoid damaging\u00a0Trump's presidential bid. Cohen coordinated with the company on that effort to \"suppress the model's story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,\" court records show. Vance argued that a swift resolution of his case\u00a0is \u201cessential to avoid further disruption of the grand jury\u2019s ongoing investigation.\u201d \u201cEach day that compliance with the Mazars subpoena is delayed increases the likelihood that \u2013 as a result of this lawsuit \u2013 criminal conduct may go unpunished, giving petitioner a de facto victory on the merits of his sweeping immunity claim and giving other individuals under investigation similar immunity from prosecution,\u201d he said. The justices do not have to hear the New York case but are likely to do so after all legal papers are received. If they grant the request in December or January, it likely would be heard in April and decided in late June. In a related case, the California Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously struck down a law aimed at forcing the president to disclose his tax returns in order to get on the state's primary ballot next spring. The justices said the law violated the California Constitution. The two legal efforts in the D.C. and Manhattan federal appeals courts\u00a0to get financial records are progressing amid other investigations, including the ongoing House impeachment proceeding. That\u00a0investigation centers on whether Trump\u00a0delayed nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine while pressing for investigations into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden,\u00a0a 2020 presidential campaign rival. The proceeding is also examining whether Trump similarly pressed for evidence that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered\u00a0in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0Trump, backed by most congressional Republicans, has said he did nothing wrong. In his filing, Letter said the impeachment proceeding \"makes it particularly important that Congress not be deprived of the information sought by the subpoena.\" If the high court nevertheless blocks the lower court order, he said, it should decide as early as next month whether to hear the case, so it can issue a decision in the current term, which ends next June. The justices' last private conference this year is Dec. 13. The House committee, controlled by Democrats, is seeking records from the president, his family business, a trust, and the company that runs\u00a0the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The panel wants to compare them with testimony from Cohen\u00a0as well as with government disclosures. Cohen, who testified to Congress that Trump routinely overstated or understated\u00a0his holdings in financial records to suit his own needs,\u00a0is serving\u00a0a prison term in part for lying to Congress about other Trump-related issues. The filing said the committee\u2019s investigation stemmed in part from an Office of Government Ethics finding that Trump neglected to report a liability in his 2017 federal financial disclosure report. It said the omission involved a payment by Cohen \"to a third party,\" a reference to a woman who said she\u2019d had a sexual affair with Trump. The president has denied that allegation.",

Trump scores a victory in\u00a0court (but not of the impeachment type). It's Thursday's news. And later, I'll talk with the League of Women Voters about this month 100 years ago, when California ratified the 19th Amendment. Arlene Martinez writes In California, a daily roundup of stories from newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network. Sign up here. Just five months ago, Juul spent\u00a0$400 million\u00a0for a 28-story office building in San Francisco, with plans to eventually move in its quickly growing workforce of more than 1,200. Now, the e-cigarette company\u00a0may sell the property.\u00a0The move is \u201cpart of the leadership team\u2019s ongoing review to align the company\u2019s organization and financial resources behind key priorities,\u201d a company spokesman told the San Francisco Chronicle. Earlier this week,\u00a0California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced he was suing Juul, alleging the company markets its products to teenagers and fails to give warnings about the product\u2019s potential health risks. Read it here: California files lawsuit against Juul. A teen used an unregistered\u00a0\"ghost gun\"\u00a0to\u00a0kill two\u00a0classmates\u00a0at a Santa Clarita high school last week. And in the wake of that shooting, a familiar call for metal detectors. Here are approaches experts think are far more effective. President Donald Trump doesn't have to release any tax records,\u00a0much less five years' worth, to appear on the March 2020 presidential primary in California, the state's high court ruled Thursday.\u00a0Writing that the recently approved\u00a0law\u00a0exceeds the state Legislature's authority and is \"unenforceable,\" the court ruled it violates provisions of California's Constitution guaranteeing voters can choose freely from nationally recognized candidates. The Legislature may be correct that the returns would provide information, but ultimately, voters can decide that for themselves,\u00a0California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote. Trump is only the second major-party presidential candidate to not release tax returns. Millions of voters, as we know, weren't especially\u00a0bothered by that in 2016.

Elected officials unanimously approved a 45-day ban on putting prisons, jails, correctional facilities and detention facilities in the city. The decision comes as the state and federal governments are locked in a fight over private, for-profit immigration detention centers. Gov. Gavin\u00a0Newsom last month\u00a0signed AB 32, which phases out the use of private prisons and private immigration detention centers in the state beginning Jan. 1. \u201cWe know that the federal government is actively looking for a site,\u201d Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez said.

And now, a\u00a0break from the news of the day.\u00a0Meet Carol Moon Goldberg, the president of the League of Women Voters in California. Many women got the right to vote in California on Nov. 1, 1919.\u00a0Goldberg talked with me via email\u00a0about the historic moment, and where women are today. The interview has been edited for brevity. California was the 18th state to ratify the 19th amendment. Not bad, of course, but not leading the pack. Was there some resistance here? A little background first. ... In 1911, California became the sixth state in the country to allow women to vote in statewide elections. \u2026In June 1919, when the 19th Amendment was sent out to states for ratification, the California Legislature was not a full-time legislature.\u00a0 The 1919 legislative session ended in April 1919.\u00a0 An \u201cextraordinary session\u201d of the Legislature was called by Gov. William Stephens for \u201c...the purpose of considering and acting upon the matter of the ratification of the amendment of the Constitution of the United States extending the right of suffrage to women...\u201d\u00a0 This session was on Saturday, Nov. 1, 1919. What was women voter participation like in those early years? There aren\u2019t exact figures on this. It is estimated that about 35% of the votes cast for president in 1920 were by women. In California, it is estimated that 38% was the women\u2019s turnout rate that year. Voting was new and intimidating, plus the reasons used to oppose women voting did not vanish into thin air after the 19th Amendment passed.\u00a0 It takes time to develop the muscle memory of voting. ... In every presidential election since 1980, the proportion of eligible female adults who voted has exceeded the proportion of eligible male adults who voted. Why were so many women still unable to vote after the 19th Amendment? Put us in 1919. The 19th Amendment was a step, but only a step, in achieving a representative democracy. Individual states could still set up residency rules and conditions that prohibited people from voting. Jim Crow laws restricted participation by African Americans, both men and women, through poll taxes and literacy tests.\u00a0Native Americans, including women, were barred from voting because they were not citizens in many states. What is women voter participation like today? Put us in 2019. In the last five\u00a0midterm elections since 1998, women turned\u00a0out to vote in slightly higher numbers than men.\u00a0About 55% of women eligible to vote\u00a0turned out in the 2018 elections.\u00a0In the same election approximately 52% of the eligible men voted. There still aren\u2019t\u00a0tons of women serving at the state level in California. Why? There are many reasons for this phenomenon.\u00a0For one thing, women seem to be less likely to decide to run of their own accord.\u00a0They sometimes lack the political connections and networks that give the confidence to start.\u00a0The lack of a network impedes fundraising efforts.\u00a0There is also a perception that the political system and electorate are biased against female candidates. Modern campaigning is time-consuming and sometimes negative. Plus women still feel the burden of balancing family obligations against professional and political life. Tell me two things at the top of the upcoming year\u2019s legislative agenda. We support two bills, one on voting rights and the other addressing the housing shortage. LWVC is supporting ACA 6, (a constitutional amendment)\u00a0allied with AB 646 to restore voting rights upon completion of a prison term.\u00a0This will allow formerly incarcerated people who are on parole to vote. These people are reintegrating into society, holding down jobs, going to school, and having families. Voting is part of reintegration. Also, LWVC is supporting SB 50, the More Homes Act, to help California build its way out of housing shortages by incentivizing dense construction near jobs and transit. I\u2019d love to hear about something you\u2019re super proud of the League for doing, maybe that people don\u2019t know of. It\u2019s hard to pick one thing.\u00a0Here\u2019s something that is sometimes overlooked. For all its history, (the) League has sought to educate people about their own government. At the local level, our members go to schools and community organizations to help people understand the importance of participating in our democracy at the most basic level. At the state level, we\u2019ve developed voter information tools like our Easy Voter Guide\u00a0in five\u00a0languages and our online voter guide Voter\u2019s Edge so that everyone has access to information they need.\u00a0The whole point of this work is to give people the information they need and the confidence to feel prepared to participate in making our democracy work.\u00a0That\u2019s important.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said that Sen. Lindsey Graham \"is about to go down\" in reaction to the South Carolina Republican's request for documents from the State Department related to Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Biden said that he was \"embarrassed\" for Graham in an interview with CNN on Friday, and said that President Donald Trump is \"holding power\" over Graham. \"They have him under their thumb right now. They know he knows, if he comes out against Trump, he's got a real tough road for re-election,\" Biden said. Graham, the Senate Judiciary chairman, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Thursday requesting documentation in the possession of the State Department about Biden's communications with Ukraine's former president, and about an alleged business meeting between a Hunter Biden associate and the former Secretary of State John Kerry. The request comes as key Republican allies of Trump try to push back against the current impeachment inquiry into Trump, and pivot the focus onto their theory that Biden tried to use his office to help his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian company. Explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases Trump is accused of improperly pressuring the Ukrainian government to open investigations into the Bidens that would benefit him in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has maintained that his concern was over corruption in the country. \"I am disappointed, and quite frankly I'm angered by the fact that he knows me, he knows my son, he knows there's nothing to this,\" Biden said Friday. \"Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"I say, Lindsey, I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing, for you.\" The Biden campaign also told Politico that Graham has \"forfeited his conscience to escape a primary.\" In response, Graham's office told Politico that Graham has requested the documents because the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff \"will not look into the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Burisma.\" Biden also discussed with CNN recent additions to the 2020 race, including former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and a potential run by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Biden said he welcomes the competition. \"Watch me. Watch me,\" he said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump returned\u00a0to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to\u00a0mock two\u00a0U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. A day after a U.S. diplomat told lawmakers his staff overheard the president pressing for a Ukrainian investigation into his rivals\u00a0\u2013 a bombshell revelation the president has denied\u00a0\u2013 Trump was hoping to turn the tide in Louisiana's razor-thin race for governor. Trump\u00a0has not scheduled any additional\u00a0rallies through the remainder of the year. Speaking in\u00a0Bossier City, Louisiana, at his first campaign rally since public hearings began Wednesday in the Democratic-led inquiry, Trump claimed that the impeachment hearings were helping his reelection effort. Trump's campaign said Thursday it had raised more than $3 million in the 24 hours after the hearing. \"The people of this country aren't buying it \u2013 you see it because we're going up and they're going down,\" Trump said. \"Let's keep it going for a while.\" Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the loyalty of Republican lawmakers in recent weeks, said the GOP is now sticking together, and\u00a0\"it's a beautiful thing.\" Trump also mocked\u00a0State Department official George Kent\u00a0and\u00a0Ambassador Bill Taylor, the first witnesses to testify in the public hearings, suggesting they didn't have an answer for why what they were describing is an impeachable offense. \"And they stood there and went like, 'what?'\" In fact,\u00a0Kent and Taylor, who have served presidents of both parties, repeatedly said that they would not make a determination about whether Trump's actions were impeachable because that was a job for members of the House. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will testify Friday. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in May amid criticism in conservative media that she was an Obama holdover. Yovanovitch has, in fact,\u00a0served presidents of both parties. Stung by Kentucky Gov.

He told the crowd that Bevin, who conceded the race Thursday, would have performed worse without his involvement. \"You gotta give me a big win please,\" Trump told the crowd. \"Please.\" More:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Trump's Louisiana rally could be his last of 2019; his long-range schedule, including holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida,\u00a0does not currently include additional political rallies, though he could always add them later. Trump did not mention Thursday\u2019s deadly school shooting in California during his remarks, though he did tweet his condolences to the victims en route to the event. Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers Wednesday was that\u00a0one of his aides overheard a July 26 phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about \"the investigations\" he had been pressing\u00a0Zelensky to open. Trump had requested Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been\u00a0under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in\u00a0the 2016 presidential election. The president told reporters Wednesday that he did not recall that conversation. \"First time I've\u00a0heard it,\" Trump said. \"I don\u2019t recall. Not at all.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell continues to hold the line when it comes to impeachment, saying Monday he \"can't imagine a scenario\" in which the U.S. Senate would remove President Donald Trump from office. This comes the week after\u00a0the U.S. House of Representatives began holding\u00a0public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. The House still has to vote on whether to approve articles of impeachment. If that happens, McConnell said Monday he's still confident it\u00a0wouldn't lead to Trump's ouster. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a scenario under which President Trump would be removed from office with 67 votes in the Senate,\" he said, reaffirming comments he made two weeks ago in Washington. Although he seems assured of the outcome, he noted it's still an open question of how long a Senate impeachment trial would last. Impeachment would\u00a0displace the chamber's other business, McConnell said. Earlier:Billboard warns McConnell to impeach Trump or 'lose your job' He indicated the ongoing inquiry is already slowing its progress on priorities such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which requires\u00a0Congress' approval. \"Nothing is happening because House Democrats\u00a0seized with Trump derangement syndrome are consumed with this argument with the president,\" he said. McConnell was in downtown Louisville on Monday to receive this year's\u00a0\"Distinguished Rural Kentuckian\" award from the Kentucky Electric Cooperatives. During his acceptance speech, McConnell spoke about how he has been able to use his position as Senate majority leader to benefit rural Kentucky and \"Middle America.\" He also criticized a general lack of civility in American political discourse, which he considers to be \"our biggest national problem\" right now. Stay updated:USA TODAY's impeachment coverage \"People are acting out,\" he said. \"We need to learn how to behave better, how to disagree without anger ...\" McConnell is up for reelection next year and has a reputation for running cutthroat campaigns against his political opponents. And he acknowledged Monday that campaigns are \"hot salsa\" but emphasized that the governing process doesn't have to be that way. Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his own reelection bid this month to Democrat Andy Beshear, often has been criticized for the way he spoke\u00a0about public school teachers and other people who opposed his policies. But\u00a0McConnell told reporters Monday that he wasn't thinking about Kentucky politics when he made those comments about the need for civility. Previously:McConnell thinks Trump would be safe if a trial was held today He said he was thinking about national issues, and in particular about when U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the country's highest court was being considered last year. Kavanaugh's nomination was highly controversial. Both he and Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, testified before Congress in the lead-up to his eventual appointment to the Supreme Court. On Monday, McConnell spoke critically of that period of time, when \"we had people\u00a0chasing members (of Congress) through the halls and getting in their faces and screaming and hollering and going over to the Supreme Court and acting out. \"Certainly we have free speech in this country, but I think we have a serious civility problem,\" he said. When a reporter asked whether Trump shares some of the blame for that, given his penchant for harshly criticizing people he disagrees with, McConnell said: \"I think we have a civility problem, and I didn't confine it to just liberals. I think it's across the board.\" As for Bevin's loss to Beshear, McConnell reiterated statements he previously made in which he said Bevin had a good four years but came up short in the November election. He also said he called Beshear after Bevin conceded the race last week and plans to meet with the attorney general \u2014 and soon-to-be governor \u2014 before the end of the year.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump heaped praise on Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0during a day-long visit to the White House on Wednesday despite bipartisan concern\u00a0that the authoritarian leader is sowing\u00a0chaos in the Middle East. As House lawmakers began public hearings\u00a0to investigate Trump's interactions with Ukraine, the president fully embraced\u00a0another controversy weighing on his White House: His decision last month to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, clearing the way for Turkey's\u00a0invasion into that country days later. There was little sign Wednesday of the bipartisan criticism that has cropped up in response to Trump's approach to Turkey. After a series of meetings, the president told reporters during an East Room press conference that he hopes to broker an agreement with Turkey that would significantly expand trade between the two countries. \"I'm a big fan of the president,\" Trump said of Erdogan. The meeting with Erdogan, in the works for weeks, allowed Trump to marshal some attention away from the impeachment hearings taking place on Capitol Hill, but it also renewed\u00a0focus on an issue that has caused rebellion within his own party. \"Although I have expressed concerns about granting President Erdogan such an honor in light of his recent actions, I hope the meeting produces better behavior from this important NATO ally,\"\u00a0Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said earlier Wednesday.\u00a0\"I share my colleagues' uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored at the White House.\" Both Democrats and Republicans\u00a0have argued Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria was a betrayal of the Kurdish forces that helped American troops fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Trump dismissed those concerns Wednesday. Trump said Erdogan, who has described many of the Kurds on the Turkey-Syria border as terrorists,\u00a0has a \"great relationship with the Kurds.\" Speaking to reporters, the president also sided with Erdogan over the question of Syrian refugees. He said Europe should help Turkey pay for the more than 3 million refugees who fled Syria during that country\u2019s civil war. Erdogan said Turkey had resettled 365,000 of those Syrian refugees into northern Syria. But many of them come from other parts of the country and some critics have suggested that by relocating them to northern Syria, Turkey is forcing Kurds, Christians and other minorities there to flee \u2013 essentially engaging in \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Trump did not answer a question from a Turkish reporter about whether he is planning to invite the leader of the Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Kobani, to Washington.\u00a0Lawmakers in Congress have pushed for such a visit and Kobani tweeted that Trump had invited him. \"We'll see what happens,\" Trump said in response. Trump invited a\u00a0group of Republican senators to meet with Erdogan. Reporters whisked into the Oval Office to briefly witness the meeting saw Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.;\u00a0Jim Risch, R-Idaho;\u00a0Ted Cruz, R-Texas;\u00a0Rick Scott, R-Fla.;\u00a0and\u00a0Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, sitting with the two leaders. \"The purpose of this meeting is to have an American civics lesson for our friends in Turkey,\" said Graham, who has\u00a0been highly critical of Erdogan and Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\u00a0\"And there\u2019s a pony in there somewhere if we can find it.\u201d Erdogan's visit comes amid reports of clashes in Syria \u2013 and questions about whether Turkish-backed forces have engaged in ethnic cleansing and other atrocities. Turkey's\u00a0assault,\u00a0along with the U.S. withdrawal\u00a0from northeastern Syria, has prompted more than 180,000 civilians to flee the border areas, according to the United Nations. More:'It is a zone of death, and we're complicit': Why evangelicals are upset with Trump's Syria policy Although the United States\u00a0brokered a cease-fire between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, it's not clear how well that is holding.\u00a0According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, fighting has continued this week between the SDF and forces loyal to Turkey. Russian and Syrian government troops have\u00a0moved in to fill the power vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal. \u201cThe cease-fire is holding very well,\u201d Trump said earlier in the Oval Office. Trump did raise one major point of friction with Erdogan: Turkey's purchase of a Russian-made missile system, the S-400. Turkey received delivery of the Russian weapons system\u00a0this year, despite stern U.S. warnings against such a move. The White House responded by canceling Turkey's participation in the Pentagon's elite\u00a0Joint Strike Fighter program, saying the\u00a0S-400 system could be used to collect sensitive data on the F-35 jet fighter program, making Turkey's participation \"impossible.\" Trump said Turkey's decision\u00a0had caused \"very serious challenges for us.\" The president is under pressure to impose stiff sanctions on Turkey for the S-400 purchase, as well as for its Syria attack. The House\u00a0approved a\u00a0biting\u00a0sanctions bill last month aimed at crippling\u00a0Turkey's economy and punishing\u00a0Erdogan personally by\u00a0requiring an assessment of his net worth. \"We'll be talking about it,\" Trump said of the weapons purchase.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The House panel conducting the impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals started releasing\u00a0the transcripts from the\u00a0closed-door\u00a0interviews with witnesses on Monday. For weeks, the public relied only on leaks and comments from lawmakers to get details from the depositions. The transcripts offer\u00a0the public an unfiltered view of what witnesses said they knew about the president's dealings with Ukraine. The first two transcripts to be made public were of the testimonies of Marie\u00a0Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and Matthew McKinley, who had served as an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. On Tuesday, the panel released\u00a0the testimony of Kurt Volker, a former envoy to\u00a0Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. On Wednesday, the panel released the testimony of, Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and on Thursday, it released the testimony of State Department official George Kent. Despite the bipartisan composition of the committees conducting the interviews, Republicans had denounced the private depositions, implying House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was up to something nefarious by holding the \"secret\" hearings in the \"basement\u00a0of the Capitol.\" Republicans at one point\u00a0staged a dramatic interruption of one hearing, halting\u00a0the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper after they barged into the secure room where she was being questioned. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday found Republicans' concerns resonated with voters, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying they thought the hearings should be public. Democrats have defended the private depositions as a necessary step before they begin to hold public hearings and hoped the release of the transcripts would help quell concerns about transparency. 2020 poll:Trump trails Biden, Warren, Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg by double-digit margins Here is the text from the testimonies that have been released so far: AMERIND Risk provides peace of mind with our comprehensive suite of coverage products.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 David Holmes, the State Department official who overheard a key conversation between President Donald Trump and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, told lawmakers during a closed-door deposition Friday that Sondland assured Trump that Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d and would do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d when asked about investigations he sought. Holmes testified, \"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\" Holmes\u2019 opening statement, which was first reported by CNN\u00a0and confirmed by other outlets, recounted how\u00a0he overheard the phone conversation between Sondland and Trump at a restaurant in Ukraine\u2019s capital on July 26, just a day after the conversation between the two foreign leaders at the center of the inquiry. \"While Ambassador Sondland's phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the President's voice through the earpiece of the phone. The President's voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume,\" Holmes said. He clarified he did not take notes but had a \u201cclear recollection that these statements were made.\u201d More:Roger Stone found guilty of lying to Congress to protect Trump and his campaign During the July 25\u00a0phone call, Trump had requested that\u00a0Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been\u00a0under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in\u00a0the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence has found no evidence of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 elections. Evidence of the phone conversation was first brought-up during the public testimony of Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, on Wednesday,\u00a0where he testified a member of his staff, now known to be Holmes,\u00a0was with Sondland at the restaurant and overheard the conversation. \"The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about 'the investigations,'\" Taylor said in his opening statement. \"Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\" Holmes also told lawmakers that when he asked Sondland \"if it was true\u00a0that the President did not 'give a s--- about Ukraine\", Sondland replied that Trump only cared about \"big stuff\"\u00a0that benefited\u00a0Trump, like the investigations\u00a0into the Bidens led by Rudy\u00a0Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer. More:Intimidation among key takeaways from the Trump impeachment hearing with Marie Yovanovitch Sondland\u00a0has already amended his testimony from his closed-door deposition a few weeks ago, and did not mention this conversation to investigators. In the update, Sondland added that he had communicated a quid pro quo to a Ukraine official, linking military aid for Ukraine that was delayed by the United States to a public statement committing to investigations Trump and\u00a0Giuliani wanted.\u00a0He is set to testify publicly\u00a0next Wednesday before the Intelligence Committee. An official working on the impeachment inquiry told USA TODAY that\u00a0Holmes was subpoenaed\u00a0in light of an attempt by the State Department to limit his testimony and direct him not to appear for the scheduled deposition. Holmes testified that two other people also overheard the alleged phone call between Trump and Sondland.",

You don't get the days back you blow off,\u201d Clinton said his message to Trump would be. \u201cEvery day's an opportunity to make something good happen.\u00a0I would say, 'I've got lawyers and staff people handling the impeachment inquiry and they should just have at it.\u00a0Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people.'\" More:Former Rep. Katie Hill says she's 'really, really concerned' for Saugus High School shooting survivors The former president was reacting to a clip of Attorney General Bill Barr saying Wednesday, the first day of the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, that\u00a0\"discussions on the legislative aspects\" of gun control\u00a0\"have been sidetracked because of the impeachment process on the Hill.\" \u201cLook at how much we got done in 1998 and 1999,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the years he faced his own impeachment inquiry, and called\u00a0blaming\u00a0the inquiry an \"excuse.\" Previously, Trump had voiced some support for background checks after back-to-back mass shootings this summer in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas left 31 people dead. Since then, no gun control legislation has passed, and Trump has\u00a0backed away\u00a0from supporting legislation\u00a0such as enhanced background checks for firearm purchases. Clinton expressed that he believes Trump was pulled back from such measures by the gun lobby who \"got a hold of him.\" \"But at some point, denial is no longer an option. The Congress is basically in denial of the consequences of doing nothing, or at least the people who are opposed to it,\" he continued. Clinton was the last president to have signed major gun control legislation, signing off on the assault weapons ban in 1994 that has since expired. Analysis:As public impeachment hearings open, the surprise was that there was a surprise The Democratic-led House has passed stricter gun measures, but so far, the Republican-controlled Senate has not moved to support such laws. Clinton insisted that the American public is much more supportive of gun control laws from when he passed the 1994 legislation and that politicians are less likely to face electoral consequences as they did in the 1990s when Democrats lost the majority. He stated,\u00a0\"It's not that way anymore. It's now a voting issue for the people that agree with us.\" \u201cIf you\u2019re just worried about the naked politics, it\u2019s at least a wash,\" Clinton said, reiterating his support for reinstating an assault weapons ban, or at least a clean background check law grounded in modern technology. \"People should instead do what\u2019s right for the children.\u201d Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A New York judge\u2019s ruling that President Donald Trump must pay $2 million to charity appears to be the final chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s troubled charitable foundation. State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla of Manhattan ruled on Thursday that Trump pay $2 million in damages to various nonprofit groups to settle allegations that he and his family used the Trump Foundation to further his political and business interests. Though Trump admitted the misconduct in court documents, he issued a defiant statement in which he accused New York\u2019s attorney general of mischaracterizing the settlement process for political purposes. Trump\u00a0claimed he had been attacked by \u201cpolitical hacks in New York State.\u201d Here\u2019s a closer look at the ruling and the foundation\u2019s legal troubles: The lawsuit, filed last year by then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, outlined a wide array of mismanagement\u00a0by Trump and his three eldest children. Chief among them: allowing Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign to orchestrate a televised fundraiser in Des Moines, Iowa, for the foundation, which then distributed $2.8 million to veterans\u2019 charities that were also chosen by the campaign. Charities are prohibited by New York law\u00a0from supporting political candidates or campaigns. Trump staged the\u00a0fundraiser on Jan. 28, 2016, days before the Iowa caucuses, rather than participate\u00a0in a\u00a0Republican presidential debate. According to the lawsuit, Trump's campaign staff, not the foundation, chose the veterans' groups that would get the money.\u00a0That violated New York's charity laws. The Attorney General's Office and the Trump Foundation\u00a0reached an agreement last year to dissolve the foundation and distribute its remaining $1.8 million in assets to a variety of charities, including the Army Relief Fund and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. In a settlement agreement reached last year,\u00a0Trump and his foundation admitted the campaign had complete control of how the funds were distributed and that Trump took credit for the grants. The final part of the settlement involved how much in damages should be paid to the charities. Scarpulla resolved that issue this week with her order that Trump must pay $2 million. That's less than the $2.8 million\u00a0sought by\u00a0New York\u2019s current attorney general, Letitia James. She based that figure on how much the foundation brought in\u00a0at the fundraiser. But Scarpulla reasoned that Trump had agreed to dissolve the foundation, and the money raised at the Des Moines event did eventually reach charitable organizations\u00a0tied to veterans, even though that\u00a0was done at the campaign's behest. Sh In this week's ruling, Scarpulla wrote\u00a0\"that Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty\" with statutory violations that included \"allowing his campaign to orchestrate the fundraiser.\" That conduct, she wrote, resulted in \"distribution of the funds to further Mr. Trump's political campaign.\" The Donald J. Trump Foundation was founded as a philanthropic enterprise with the initial goal of distributing proceeds from his\u00a0book, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" to various charities. The foundation\u00a0expanded its fundraising and distribution over the years. It was registered as a tax-exempt nonprofit, so donations were tax-deductible. Its federal tax form for 2015 showed annual expenditures of just over $900,000. Until 2017, the foundation's board consisted of Trump, his three children, and the Trump Organization's treasurer. A series of Washington Post stories in 2016 raised questions about the foundation's fundraising and expenditures. The New York Attorney General's Office followed up, alleging that substantial sums of foundation money were used to pay business debts, finance the presidential campaign and even purchase a giant painting of Trump. Trump\u2019s\u00a0charity even had a Ukraine angle. In September 2015, a foundation tied to\u00a0Victor Pinchuk, the\u00a0billionaire son of a former Ukraine president,\u00a0contributed $150,000 to Trump\u2019s charity, according to the charity's tax return. The contribution arrived in conjunction with a speech that Trump made via satellite hookup to a Pinchuk Foundation conference in Kyiv. Trump, who was running for president at the time,\u00a0referred to Pinchuk as a friend during the speech, according to a 2018 report by a Forbes contributor. Former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigative team examined the Pinchuk payment\u00a0as part of its probe into foreign funding that\u00a0streamed to Trump and his associates in the year\u00a0before Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit was a civil action, rather than a criminal complaint. (Separately, the New York Attorney General\u00a0has filed criminal charges against the president in connection with his taxes.) However, the lawsuit alleged that Trump violated multiple statutes that\u00a0prohibit the use of nonprofit revenue\u00a0for business, personal and political purposes and require\u00a0directors of nonprofit boards to perform their duties in good faith. The judge ruled that Trump admitted to the violations in a settlement reached to end the lawsuit. Early stipulations by Trump and his lawyers included an agreement to dissolve the foundation and distribute its remaining $1.8 million assets to various charities such as City Meals-on-Wheels, the Children's Aid Society and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. As a result of the final order, the $2 million fine also will go to those philanthropies. The Trump Foundation will no longer exist. In addition, Scarpulla issued stiff requirements for Trump and his family members to meet before they create or oversee any nonprofit in the future.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 As House Democrats conducted another impeachment hearing,\u00a0President\u00a0Donald Trump and top aides held meetings Thursday with Republican senators who might well have to serve as jurors for an impeachment trial of the president. While Trump touched briefly on impeachment at a White House lunch with eight GOP senators, aides met with another group of senators to start discussing plans for a Senate trial that could last at least two weeks, participants said. The president's lunch guests\u00a0\u2013 including GOP senators who have been critical of Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine \u2013 said Trump talked about impeachment during the meeting at\u00a0the White House\u00a0but did not demand their loyalty should the Senate be forced to conduct a trial. \u201cHe made a few brief comments (about impeachment) at the beginning,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. \"He did not ask anything of anyone.\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who has had a tense relationship with the president and pointedly declined to defend him during the impeachment inquiry, said he and Trump were \"friendly and cordial.\" Meanwhile, another delegation of Senate Republicans met with Trump aides who\u00a0included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, said officials\u00a0speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a private conference. The\u00a0Senate delegation included\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and other committee members such as\u00a0Ted Cruz of Texas. Graham also began laying the groundwork for a trial by sending a letter\u00a0to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seeking documents on the Bidens' relationship with Ukraine. No final decisions were made, officials said. The meetings came after a rough week\u00a0for Trump during a series of House impeachment hearings.\u00a0His\u00a0ambassador to the European Union and national security officials\u00a0testified about a Trump plan to extract\u00a0a pledge from Ukraine to investigate\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u00a0in exchange for military aid. In the run-up to Thursday's lunch, Trump appeared to appeal to the Republican-run Senate in a tweet in which he denounced House Democrats who are pursuing impeachment as \"scum.\" \"Keep fighting tough, Republicans, you are dealing with human scum who have taken Due Process and all of the Republican Party\u2019s rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in American History,\" Trump tweeted. He added: \"But we are winning big, and they will soon be on our turf.\" Trump did not define \"turf,\" but Republicans do control the Senate and would conduct a trial of Trump if House Democrats decide to impeach him. The White House lunch meeting included at least two GOP senators \u2013 Romney and Collins \u2013\u00a0who have questioned\u00a0Trump's\u00a0dealings with Ukraine that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. It was the latest event in a Trump outreach program to Republican lawmakers that began after the prospect of impeachment surfaced in mid-September. Officials said Trump has probably spoken, either individually or in groups, with all 53 Republican senators \u2013 all\u00a0jurors in a potential impeachment. Two officials discussed the outreach on condition of anonymity, citing the private nature of the meetings. Several administration officials have said they would not be surprised if the Democratic-run House votes to impeach Trump, albeit with no Republican votes. Officials also said\u00a0they expect the Republican Senate to acquit Trump\u00a0and perhaps dismiss the case outright. Others said the votes for a dismissal are not there, at least not right now, and the White House is braced for an eventual trial that was the subject of the senators' meeting with Mulvaney, Cipollone\u00a0and other top Trump aides. Conviction and removal from office would require a\u00a0two-thirds vote of the Senate; Republicans have 53 of the 100 seats in the Senate. That means impeachment advocates would need to flip at least 20 Republican senators. Romney said the president brought up impeachment at the start of the White House meeting, but not to strategize\u00a0or seek support. Trump \"made some initial comments that related to the impeachment process, but it's nothing that I haven't heard on TV from him,\" Romney said. \"So, there was no inside story or some argument that he was providing for us.\u201d Trump then\u00a0opened the floor and asked the group of senators what they wanted to discuss and were interested in, a frequent request at meetings of this type. Topics included\u00a0legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, vaping and flavored refillable cartridges\u00a0and the proposed Canada-Mexico trade deal. Senators said they and Trump also discussed the proposed short-term spending bill to punt a looming government shutdown to the end of the year; Collins said she believes\u00a0Trump would sign that plan. Romney, a longtime Trump rival, has criticized him for asking the president of Ukraine to investigate\u00a0political rival\u00a0Biden. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, called Trump's actions \"wrong and appalling.\" Trump responded by calling Romney \"a pompous ass,\" while Trump allies described Romney as a fake Republican. The two men also clashed during Trump's 2016 campaign. During the primary process, Romney cast the New York businessman as a threat to the Republican Party, while Trump branded Romney \"a loser.\" Yet after his election, Trump interviewed Romney for the secretary of State job before nominating Rex Tillerson to the post. As for a potential impeachment trial in the\u00a0near future,\u00a0Romney told USA TODAY last month that \"I will study the law and the facts and on that basis make an informed judgment consistent with Constitutional duties.\" After the White House meeting, Romney told reporters that his difficult relationship with Trump did not surface during the lunch meeting. When a reporter read back Trump's \"pompous ass\" tweet, Romney laughed and said: \"That's as accurate as it is irrelevant.\" House impeachment investigators are also looking into evidence that Trump halted military aid to Ukraine if it did not agree to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the state. Collins, a moderate Republican senator, has said she will not comment on the evidence unless or until it comes before the Senate. The Maine senator has criticized some of the president's tweets about the case. \u201cI think the president would be better served by not tweeting at all on the testimony,\u201d Collins told WMTW-TV.\u00a0\u201cHis attorneys will be representing him should this come to a trial in the Senate and that's the time for them to have their say on the president's behalf.\u201d Other Republican senators at the White House included Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (a fierce critic of impeachment), Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Hoeven of North Dakota, James Lankford of Oklahoma\u00a0and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. The meeting also featured Johnny Isakson of Georgia, one of at least four Republican senators who do not plan to see re-election in 2020. Impeachment supporters have eyed those retiring senators as potential pickups, though White House officials expressed confidence that the party is united. Meanwhile, future steps in the House impeachment inquiry are uncertain. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0did not provide any timeline for where the inquiry goes after Thursday's hearing, including the question of whether Democrats would begin to draw up articles of impeachment. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decision yet,\u201d Pelosi said.

      "content": "Gov. Matt Bevin's stay at one of President Donald Trump\u2019s luxury hotels\u00a0could cause the White House further legal headaches, according to The Washington Post. Plaintiffs have alleged in two separate cases that the president\u00a0violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s domestic emoluments clause when former Maine Gov.\u00a0Paul LePage visited Trump hotels. Legal experts have said under\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cemolument,\"\u00a0or payments clause, Trump\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who maintains\u00a0financial interest in his companies \u2014 is barred from receiving any payments\u00a0from the states or foreign governments. Bevin reportedly stayed at the Trump hotel\u00a0in Washington, D.C., from Jan.\u00a029-31, 2018,\u00a0according to records obtained by The Washington Post. The $686\u00a0bill was paid for by Kentucky taxpayers, and the Kentucky Republican Party later reimbursed the state. But\u00a0the transaction is likely going to be cited by the attorneys general for Washington, D.C., and Maryland, who are pursuing the anti-corruption case tied to the LePage stays. Read this:\u00a0Pro-impeachment group goes after McConnell with\u00a0TV ad in Kentucky University of Kentucky law professor Josh Douglas said he couldn't comment on whether\u00a0the transaction merits attention from prosecutors. But he said the case underscores how Trump's business interests and official duties have become increasingly intertwined. \"I think it shows again the danger of having a president who is in the position to benefit financially from being president,\" he said. \"And it shows how Trump is pushing the boundaries of democratic norms.\" Bevin, a Republican,\u00a0was a close Trump ally who remained wedded to the president during his failed reelection bid against Democratic challenger Andy Beshear. The governor's office did not announce Bevin was in Washington during that time, and it is unclear if he was joined by any\u00a0other state officials, staff or security personnel. A review of Bevin's official Twitter account shows no mention of him being in Washington\u00a0during that\u00a0time. Gordon Sondland hearing: How McConnell and challengers did (or didn't) react Since\u00a0a Kentucky Court of Appeals ruling in 1995, governors have not been under any legal obligation to provide a daily schedule of their activities. Records obtained by The Courier Journal show Bevin used the state plane\u00a0to fly to Washington on Jan. 11,\u00a0and twice in February of that year, but not during the dates reported by The Washington Post. Bevin's office and the Kentucky GOP did not return messages seeking comment.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump offered some words of advice to the people in charge of Fox News' programming after Rep. Eric Swalwell appeared on the network Wednesday night: Stay away from \"losers.\" Swalwell, a California Democrat who dropped out of the 2020 presidential race in June, appeared on \"Fox News @ Night,\" where he told host Shannon Bream that Trump had orchestrated a \"shakedown\" to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Jow Biden. Trump wondered why Bream and Fox News \"waste airtime on Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell, who recently left the Presidential Primaries having attained a grand number of ZERO in the polls. \"I don\u2019t even know how that is possible. Fox should stay with the people that got them there, not losers!\" The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide More:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee, which has been holding open hearings in the impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump leveraged military aid to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that would benefit him politically. And even before the Ukraine scandal surfaced, Swalwell had called for Trump's impeachment for the potential obstruction of justice acts outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Swalwell routinely\u00a0appears on Fox News, a\u00a0favorite news outlet of the\u00a0president because he considers its coverage more fair to him that other networks. Trump often quotes Fox hosts on Twitter and touts the network's ratings relative to other cable news networks. But he also lashes out at Fox on social media for coverage that he perceives as negative. Earlier this week, he called \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace \"nasty\" and \"obnoxious\" after a contentious interview with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise about the impeachment inquiry. And it was not the first time Trump complained about Swalwell appearing on his favorite news network. \"Just watched Rep. Eric. Swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews about the phony Witch Hunt,\" Trump tweeted on July 23. \"He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 A prominent politician shows up at a major sports event.\u00a0Many in the crowd hoot and boo, some delivering shouted insults about his character.\u00a0The politician just smiles and waves to the fans who are cheering. That's right: Bill Clinton at the Southern 500 stock car race in 1992. And Donald Trump at the World Series just two weeks ago, not to mention a long line\u00a0of other presidents who have mixed politics and sports. Clinton, then a presidential candidate,\u00a0laughed off the bombast he encountered that day at the track in Darlington, S.C., reminding reporters of his days as Arkansas governor:\u00a0\"I was booed at an Arkansas football game after I won two-thirds of the state.\" Trump's response to his rough treatment at the baseball park: More sporting events\u00a0with friendlier crowds. After an appearance last weekend at an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout in New York City, where he heard cheers as well as scattered catcalls, Trump received a loud ovation and few boos\u00a0at Saturday's college football game between\u00a0the Alabama Crimson Tide and the LSU Tigers\u00a0in Tuscaloosa, Ala. More:Opinion: President Trump's increased interest in public sporting events hardly a coincidence \"Thank you to LSU and Alabama for a great game!\" Trump tweeted after the Tigers defeated the Crimson Tide 46-41. (Trump later tweeted that the \"fake news\" would \"never show\" the cheers he received, though they were widely covered.) Many presidents have enjoyed going to games and welcoming championship teams to the White House,\u00a0hoping the glow of success will rub off on them. Trump,\u00a0in the view of many analysts, has been a little more political with his forays into sports,\u00a0from attacking football players who knelt at national anthems to promoting his appearance at the LSU game to Bayou State voters. \"The president\u00a0has made his political career by getting people to think about politics in the terms of sports fandom: Red versus blue, Trump country versus urban centers, winners versus losers, us versus them,\" said Erin Tarver,\u00a0author of \"The I in Team: Sports Fandom and the Reproduction of Identity.\" Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Presidents have used sports as a way to identify with the \"common man and woman\" for as long as there\u00a0have been sporting events, analysts said. This is especially true when it comes to large communal extravaganzas like major league baseball or football games. \"Sports\u00a0\u2013\u00a0especially college football in the South \u2013\u00a0is a cultural touchstone,\" said Robert Mann, a mass communications professor at Louisiana State University. \"It's a way for politicians to say, 'Hey,\u00a0I'm just like you.'\" Michael Butterworth, director of the Center for Sports Communication and Media at the University of Texas at Austin, said, \"everybody wants to be associated with a winner and presidents have always wanted to do that.\" And there's always been an element of politics involved, whether it's the politics of race or\u00a0the politics of economics. \"It's an illusion to say sports and politics are separate,\" Butterworth said, though the mix seems more toxic\u00a0in the Trump era. LSU-Alabama:QB Joe Burrow: 'The president at the game is pretty cool' Two years ago, Trump began attacking National Football League players for kneeling during the national anthem.\u00a0Players and supporters said they knelt to protest racial injustice, and accused Trump of baiting black players in an appeal to his \"America First\" political base. \"Trump has mobilized sports fandom and its general ethos in his political life long before this,\" said Tarver, who is an associate professor of philosophy with the Oxford College at Emory University in Atlanta. Of course, the politics works two ways, Trump supporters said: People booing the president are making political statements of their own. In the run-up to Saturday's game, Alabama's student government warned its constituents against \"disruptive behavior\" toward the president. It later amended its statement to affirm \"its belief in free speech and the rights of all students to express their opinions.\" Meanwhile, critics of the president floated their \"Baby Trump\" blimp near Bryant-Denny Stadium, named in part for legendary Crimson Tide coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant. Some football fans in Tuscaloosa seemed to be in the spirit of politics.\u00a0A member of the crowd who attended ESPN's College GameDay broadcast displayed a sign joking about the impeachment investigation of Trump and LSU's quarterback. \"Joe Burrow is the whistleblower,\" it said. Trump at LSU-Alabama:Alabama says it won't punish students who boo Trump at LSU game In the long relationship between presidents and sports, one president played a key role in making football what it is today: Theodore Roosevelt. In the days before passing was allowed, football was a game of brutal scrums that produced many deaths. In 1905, Roosevelt warned college administrators they needed to make the game safer or have it face extinction. That threat led to the creation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which still governs college sports, and approval of the forward pass, the innovation that opened up the game and made it increasingly popular. John J. Miller, author of \"The Big Scrum: How Teddy Roosevelt Saved Football,\" said it's no surprise that many of Roosevelt's successors would want to get in on the LSU-Alabama game and similar spectacles. \"They're great American events, right?\" Miller said. \"It's an old thing politicians have always done.\" 'Put me in, coach':Second lady Karen Pence embraces bigger role on 2020 campaign trail Roosevelt's immediate successor, William Howard Taft, began the tradition of having the president throw out the opening pitch of the major league baseball season (though Trump has yet to perform this ritual). Over the years, presidents have sought to link sports to old-school verities like loyalty, patriotism, and family. Loyalty After winning the presidency in 1992, Clinton often\u00a0indulged his passion for college basketball. In 1994, he traveled to Charlotte to watch his home-state Arkansas Razorbacks capture the NCAA title with a win over Duke. Patriotism George W. Bush, a former manager general partner of the Texas Rangers, stayed true to baseball during his two terms in office\u00a0\u2013 most famously when he threw out the first pitch at a World Series game in New York City less than\u00a0two months after 9/11. Later, Bush jokingly recalled the brotherly advice from New York Yankee star Derek Jeter:\u00a0\"Don't bounce it, they'll boo you.\" (Bush indeed threw a strike.) Family President Barack Obama also took in his share of college basketball games, including ones featuring\u00a0Oregon State when brother-in-law Craig Robinson coached there. In 2010, Obama and Vice\u00a0President Joe Biden \u2013 and an entourage that included son Hunter Biden \u2013\u00a0sat in the front row as Georgetown upset Duke. Prison guards:Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts As unbeaten Alabama and LSU prepare to take the field,\u00a0Trump won't be the first president to attend a big-time college football contest. In December of 1969, President Richard Nixon traveled to Fayetteville, Arkansas, to watch Texas play Arkansas in a battle of unbeaten powers. Nixon took along a congressional delegation that included Texas congressman and future president George Herbert Walker Bush. After Texas rallied to nip Arkansas 15-14, Nixon presented a national championship plaque to the Longhorns \u2013\u00a0much to the annoyance of also-unbeaten\u00a0Penn State. In 1973, with Nixon mired in scandal, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno extracted some rhetorical revenge:\u00a0\"I've wondered how President Nixon could know so little about Watergate in 1973 and so much about college football in 1969.\" Trump Foundation:Judge's ruling ends troubled foundation This also won't\u00a0be Trump's first highly publicized college football game. In January of 2018, Trump attended the championship\u00a0game between Alabama and Georgia. In December of that year, the Commander-in-Chief appeared at the Army-Navy game, an event he also took in as president-elect in 2016. A prolific golfer, Trump has also appeared at golf tournaments, including the U.S. Women's Open when it was held at his club in Bedminster, N.J. When Trump announced he would attend Alabama-LSU, critics joked he was just looking for a crowd that would cheer him. Trump carried both states easily in 2016, and is expected to do so again in 2020. During a rally Wednesday in Monroe, Louisiana, a state in the midst of a governor's race, Trump made the political connection explicit. He told Louisiana residents to go ahead and vote early so that they could enjoy the football game in peace. \"I said that's the game I want to go to,\" Trump said. \"That will be tremendous. Two great teams. Two great teams.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Gordon Sondland seemed to feast on his newfound political power when he snagged a plum ambassadorship\u00a0and landed in Brussels\u00a0as America's top diplomat to the European Union. Appointed to the post\u00a0by President Donald Trump after he donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, Sondland had a direct line to the Oval Office. And he wasn't shy, or even careful, about using it. He apparently flaunted\u00a0his ability to dial Trump's phone number at will and told more seasoned administration officials to move aside as he usurped their portfolios \u2013 particularly when it came to Ukraine, even though it's not part of the EU. Now, Sondland's relationship with Trump and his extensive dealings with Ukraine have put the former hotelier, and his boss,\u00a0in a precarious position.\u00a0On Wednesday, Sondland takes center stage in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry\u00a0when he gives public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. For impeachment investigators, he is a unique witness; \u00a0he was\u00a0Trump's point man in the effort to push politically motivated investigations in Ukraine, and he seemed to have the most extensive, direct dealings with the president on the matter. David Holmes:Aide testifies Sondland told Trump that Zelensky would 'do anything you ask him to' \"Sondland\u00a0will be the first individual in this inquiry to give open testimony about direct contacts with Mr. Trump on the issue of the investigations, military assistance (to Ukraine) and the relationship with Zelensky,\" said Aaron David Miller, a top State Department negotiator for past presidents of both parties and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Whether he chooses to open the door to further teasers ... I don\u2019t know,\" Miller said. The wealthy Portland hotelier has already told lawmakers he relayed a\u00a0quid pro quo to a top Ukraine official, telling him U.S. military aid to Ukraine was likely contingent on a public statement by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, committing to the investigations Trump wanted. These included one\u00a0into former Vice President Joe Biden and another into a debunked theory about Ukraine's involvement in 2016 election interference. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, likened Sondland's diplomatic agenda to a \"drug deal.\"\u00a0Bolton's deputy, Fiona Hill, portrayed him\u00a0as a\u00a0dangerously uninformed and unconventional diplomat. Now, new\u00a0evidence\u00a0emerged during last week's first public impeachment hearing\u00a0that makes Sondland\u00a0\u00a0an even more intriguing witness for House Democrats. The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, revealed Nov. 13\u00a0that one of his deputies overheard Sondland chatting with the president on July 26\u00a0while they were in a restaurant in Kiev. Yovanovitch testimony:Intimidation among key takeaways from the Trump impeachment hearing with Marie Yovanovitch During that cellphone call, \"the member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone\u00a0asking Ambassador Sondland about \"the investigations,\" Taylor recounted during the House Intelligence Committee's first public impeachment hearing. \"Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\" After the call, Taylor's aide asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. \"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden\" than he does about Ukraine, Taylor recounted. House Democrats interviewed Taylor's aide during a closed-door session on Friday. David Holmes told lawmakers\u00a0Sondland assured Trump that Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d and would do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d when asked about investigations he sought, according to his opening statement obtained by CNN and confirmed by The New York Times. Holmes testified, \"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\" Trump told reporters on Nov. 13 that he didn't remember any Kiev\u00a0phone call with Sondland. \"I know nothing about that.\u00a0First time I've heard it,\" the president said, adding that there was no quid pro quo \"pure and simple.\" Buttigieg campaign:On the campaign bus, Pete Buttigieg talks stress dreams, misconceptions, \u2018just in case\u2019 letter to parents The day before the call with Sondland, on July 25, Trump pressed Zelensky to open the two investigations\u00a0during a phone call that triggered a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That allegation is the focus of the House Democrats' investigation. Even before the Nov. 13 revelation, Sondland had told lawmakers that a White House visit for Zelensky \u2013 something the Ukrainian leader desperately wanted as a public demonstration of U.S.\u00a0support \u2013 would be granted only after Zelensky publicly committed to the investigations Trump, and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were demanding. Sondland also told the impeachment panel that he \"presumed\" U.S. military assistance was linked to a public Zelensky\u00a0statement because there was no other credible explanation for a delay in that aid. Sondland offered that testimony in a Nov. 4\u00a0addendum he submitted to the House Democrats after his initial closed-door interview. He said testimony from other witnesses had refreshed his memory about his dealings with Ukrainian officials. Taylor's new information links Trump even more directly to the Ukraine pressure campaign. It\u00a0also raises fresh questions about Sondland's diplomatic portfolio and qualifications. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who is trained either in the art of diplomacy or in the practicalities of information security,\u201d said Ned Price, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst. Price noted that in Sondland's initial closed-door testimony, he seemed to minimize Trump's role in Ukraine by failing, for example, to mention the July 26 call and the link between U.S. military aid and the Biden investigation. \u201cI think he faces a decision as to if he wants to betray his political benefactor, or if he wants to risk his own reputation,\u201d said Price, who also was a National Security Council adviser under President Barack Obama. \"Obviously he\u2019s going to be facing a lot of pressure because it\u2019s either him or Trump.\u201d Trump has moved to distance himself from Sondland in recent days. \u201cI hardly know the gentleman,\u201d he told reporters on Nov. 8. Before Sondland testified, Trump called Sondland \"a really good man and great American\" in a tweet. Price and others say Sondland's July 26 call with Trump raises\u00a0red flags for another reason: It was likely a highly compromising security breach, and illustrates how lax Sondland was about following State Department protocols to protect sensitive information. \u201cThe president is the most lucrative intelligence target throughout the world,\u201d\u00a0Price said.\u00a0\u201cWhen the Russians presumably heard that he was connected to the president of the United States, they knew they had hit the jackpot.\u201d Ukraine and Russia are essentially at war. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and Ukraine continues to battle Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of its territory. Conducting a cellphone call with the president in a public place in Ukraine's capital, \"it just doesn\u2019t get any worse than that,\" said Clint Watts,\u00a0a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute\u00a0and author of \"Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians, and Fake News.\" Watts said Ukraine is \"ground zero\" for Russian espionage campaigns, and Moscow almost certainly intercepted Sondland's conversation with Trump on a major foreign policy issue of keen interest to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the revelation about Sondland\u2019s call with Trump was remarkable\u00a0\u2013 and not just because it exposed their exchange to foreign espionage. \u201cSondland calling Trump on a cellphone from Kyiv is extraordinary for all sorts of reasons,\u201d McFaul said in a tweet. Normally, he said, EU ambassadors don\u2019t call the president. \u201cThey never do so to discuss Ukraine policy. Doing so on a cellphone from Kyiv means whole world was listening in,\u201d McFaul wrote. Even before Wednesday's new disclosures, other witnesses had raised questions about Sondland's security practices and his unorthodox approach to diplomacy. Fiona Hill, who until recently served as the Trump administration's\u00a0National Security Council adviser for Europe and Russia, said he engaged in behavior that posed a major \"counterintelligence risk\" and he seemed either unwilling or unable to follow normal diplomatic protocols. \"Ambassador Sondland would frequently give people my personal cellphone to call up and demand meetings\" with her or with Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton,\u00a0Hill told lawmakers, according to a transcript of her testimony. \"We had all kinds of officials from Europe ... literally appearing at the gates of the White House, calling on our personal phones, which are actually in lock boxes,\" Hill said in her closed-door interview Oct. 14. \"I'd find endless messages from irate\u00a0officials who'd been told that they were supposed to meet with me by Ambassador Sondland.\" Text messages and other testimony shows that Sondland spent months\u00a0relaying Trump and Giuliani's demands to Ukrainian officials and other U.S. diplomats. Sondland has said he got his authority and instructions from Trump\u00a0and Giuliani. Before he amended his testimony, Sondland had told lawmakers there was \u201cno quid pro quo\" and that Trump relayed that to him directly. \u201cThere is no quid pro. The president repeated, no quid pro. No quid pro quo multiple times,\u201d Sondland told lawmakers during his closed-door deposition Oct. 17. \u201cThis was a very short call. And I recaIl that the president was really in a bad mood.\u201d National Security Council official Timothy Morrison testified Oct. 31 that Hill told him he \"would be wise\" to stay away from engagement with Giuliani and the \"parallel\" pressure campaign on Ukraine. \"She\u00a0mentioned that Gordon talked with Rudy, and she mentioned that she stayed away from any conversation with Rudy and that I would be wise to do the same,\" Morrison said. In his three-page amendment,\u00a0Sondland said he recalled a Sept. 1 meeting in Warsaw with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky, where he said aid wouldn\u2019t resume without investigations. \u201cAfter that large meeting, I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak, where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\u201d Sondland said. Other diplomats, including Taylor and George Kent, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia, said Trump and Giuliani's\u00a0demands for politically motivated investigations ran counter to U.S. national interests. Kent said the message also contradicted efforts to establish the rule of law in Ukraine. \"I believe he was looking to dig up political dirt against a potential rival in the next election cycle,\" Kent told the Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, referring to Giuliani. \"I agree with Mr. Kent,\" Taylor added. Trump has said the July 25 call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d because he never mentioned the suspension of nearly the $400 million in military aid\u00a0in exchange for Ukraine announcing investigations. Many Republicans have attacked the impeachment inquiry as a sham. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., amounted the controversy to\u00a0\"a policy difference between the President of the United\u00a0States and a few people at the State Department.\" But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday the correct description is bribery. \"The devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery covered in the inquiry and the president abused power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival,\" Pelosi told reporters Thursday.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 During\u00a0a day of bombshell testimony by\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union\u00a0at the center of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, President\u00a0Donald Trump strenuously denied knowing the man well. Sondland, nominated to his post in 2018,\u00a0was among only a few dozen donors who gave $1 million or more to Trump's presidential inaugural committee in 2017. The rarefied group included owners of sports teams, the aerospace giant Boeing and some of the nation's leading investors. Many were invited\u00a0to\u00a0receptions, dinners and other events with the president during the inaugural festivities in 2017. It's not clear whether Sondland attended any of them. Trump raised $107 million for his inauguration, roughly double the amount President Barack Obama pulled in eight years earlier. At least\u00a047 people or organizations gave $1 million or more to Trump, according to the nonpartisan\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics. Some of those top-tier donors wound up serving in Trump's administration along with Sondland, an Oregon man who founded\u00a0a hotel chain called\u00a0Provenance Hotels and initially supported Jeb\u00a0Bush in 2016. Others had business pending before federal agencies. More:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group\u00a0Public Citizen. \"These kind of donations\u00a0were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" Donors at the $1 million level were granted access to a series of\u00a0dinners and receptions with Trump and other officials, the Center for Public Integrity reported in 2016. Ambassador donors The list of top donors to Trump's inaugural committee includes\u00a0Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who contributed at least $1 million along with her husband. Another $1 million donor:\u00a0Robert \"Woody\" Johnson, the owner of\u00a0the New York Jets. He's\u00a0now the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. San Diego businessman Doug Manchester, who gave at least $1 million to the committee, was nominated in early 2017 to serve as ambassador to the Bahamas. The White House withdrew his nomination\u00a0last week. Star witness:Jocular and unflappable, Sondland gave bombshell impeachment testimony Appointing donors as ambassadors is not new, but Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Other top inaugural donors included Sheldon Adelson, the\u00a0Las Vegas casino mogul, and Robert Mercer, a Republican mega-donor with longtime ties to Trump.\u00a0Robert Parsons, the billionaire philanthropist and GoDaddy founder, made the list. So did\u00a0Howard Lutnick, the chairman and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Testifying on Capitol Hill in the House impeachment inquiry on Wednesday,\u00a0Sondland confirmed the existence of a \"quid pro quo\" in which military aid to Ukraine was tied to Trump's desire for an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Sondland said\u00a0Trump's personal attorney,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, pressed the demand\u00a0that Ukraine announce an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump emerged from the White House early in the hearing and, reading from written notes, told reporters on the South Lawn that he didn't really know Sondland. \"This is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy, though,\" Trump said. \"He was with other candidates. He actually supported other candidates \u2013 not me.\u00a0Came in late.\" Pressed on that claim by lawmakers later in the day, Sondland described his relationship with Trump as \"professional\" and \"cordial\" and said he spoke with the president by phone about 20 times. Earlier, when asked if he used a vulgarity when telling Trump about Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky's desire to cooperate with the United States, Sondland said that sounded right. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words,\" he said. Fred Wertheimer\u00a0of the Democracy 21 watchdog group\u00a0said it's hard to know if Trump and Sondland spent time together at events.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard to believe that Trump, who was using Sondland as his intermediary for the extortion, hardly knew him,\u201d Wertheimer said. Presidential inaugural committees are private fundraising vehicles that pay for the concerts, balls and festivities that surround the swearing-in. Inaugural committees operate under less stringent rules than political campaigns. There are no limitations on how much a donor can give, for instance, and companies can\u00a0give directly. Trump's inaugural committee was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in New York earlier this year. Watchdog groups pay\u00a0particular attention to companies that give.Major corporate donors to Trump's inaugural committee included companies like AT&T, the communications giant that at the time was pushing to acquire Time Warner\u00a0\u2013 a merger the president opposed. Dow Chemical Co. donated $1 million; the company's former CEO,\u00a0Andrew Liveris, was tapped for\u00a0an advisory council on manufacturing. The Trump administration later ruled against banning a controversial Dow-made pesticide. \"In exchange for the contributions,\" Public Citizen wrote in a 2017 report, \"donors are to receive unprecedented access to the senior members of the incoming Trump administration and other U.S. government leaders.\" We protect Tribes from financial losses and keep Tribal dollars in Indian Country.

Metropolitan Police Department officers from an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit were at the scene. Washington police spokesman Karimah Bilal said the unit did not find any hazardous materials in the vehicle. President Donald Trump was at the White House at the time of the incident after returning from Texas on Wednesday night. He was tweeting about unrelated matters from his account around the time of the incident.

      "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the Trump administration looks to replace a recently fired Obama appointee tasked with battling homelessness, California officials and advocates are\u00a0in the dark and bracing for battle. The abrupt nature of the dismissal on Nov. 15 of Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, has suggested to many who work on homelessness that the White House is poised to deliver a new agenda as early as next week. \u201cIf joining and funding real solutions to homelessness, instead of political theater and points scoring, are the Trump administration\u2019s objective, California continues to be ready to engage,\u201d says Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, adding that \u201cthe state has not been contacted by federal officials.\u201d Although Trump has sparred with California leaders\u00a0all year on issues ranging from fire safety to tailpipe emissions, he has been particularly scathing about the Golden State\u2019s inability to beat back a surging tide of homeless residents. Around 140,000 people are homeless in California, or about a quarter of the nation\u2019s homeless population. Trump has\u00a0suggested\u00a0federal intervention is needed. \u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up and the people of Los Angeles are fed up, and we\u2019re looking at it, and we will be doing something about it at the appropriate time,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to California in September. While the details of a new White House strategy on homelessness remain unknown, suggestions of its direction can be found in a Council of Economic Advisers report released in September. Trump officials take aim at homelessness:Blaming shelters and street sleeping, Donald Trump blasts California for homeless crisis In it, administration officials argue that housing needs to be deregulated to get costs down, shelters are partly to blame because they delay re-housing, and policing should be ramped up in the interest of public safety. Those working to alleviate homelessness note that the federal government has always had the power to provide relief in this arena, as evidenced by the various public works projects enacted during the Great Depression. But some homelessness experts are skeptical about the motivations of the Trump White House when it comes to the less fortunate. For example, the administration so far has moved to cut food stamps three times in the past year, including a proposal last month to cut $4.5 billion from the program. \u201cIt is my hope that if the administration issues an Executive Order, it will be one that supports and expedites proven solutions to homelessness,\u201d says Nan Roman, president and CEO of the nonpartisan National Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington, D.C. Roman says\u00a0helpful measures could include providing access to surplus federal properties for shelter and linking health and behavioral care to housing. \u201cInstead, the administration has suggested providing more shelter, but nothing about getting people from those shelters into the housing that would end their homelessness,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has promoted more aggressive policing, which has proven not to end homelessness, and proposed policies that create barriers for people trying to access shelter and housing.\u201d Newsom spokesman Melgar says \u201cthere are a number of federal actions\u201d Trump administration officials could reverse to help alleviate homelessness, including ending \u201ctheir misguided quest to slash social safety net programs like food stamps that many of these folks rely upon.\u201d Jennifer Friedenbach is on the front lines of the crisis as executive director of San Francisco\u2019s Coalition on Homelessness. She says that while \u201cthere\u2019s a lot (Trump) can do that would be positive,\u201d her mind often runs to more dire edicts. \u201cI suppose he could try and get participation from cities to go hardcore and set up camps, but you can\u2019t really force people to go to them,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t criminalize not having a home, or having a substance abuse problem, but that seems to be an easy out for politicians. It\u2019s an approach that sets us back in the struggle.\u201d The camps Friedenbach mentions are a reference to a mobile facility that was recently on display when Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development, visited\u00a0Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row in September. He spent time with homelessness experts such as Union Rescue Mission CEO Andy Bates, and toured a tent-like structure that could be used to shelter people temporarily. Just before that visit, Trump administration officials visited L.A. and spent time with Herb Smith, CEO of Los Angeles Mission, a faith-based organization serving the city\u2019s homeless. Smith welcomed the meeting but was disappointed when the emissaries did not appear well informed about the issue. \u201cThey had no handle on the causes of homelessness and its challenges,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey were struggling to understand the problem, which is largely about getting people to accept shelter in the first place.\u201d Smith encouraged the administration officials to look at the crisis as a natural disaster. \u201cI asked them, what if Skid Row were wiped out by a surging river, what would you do, and they said, \u2018We\u2019d send in FEMA,\u2019\u201d recalls Smith. \u201cSo, I asked them why not provide that same response here? They didn\u2019t have an answer for that.\u201d For Smith, any executive action that relies on disrupting an already fragile ecosystem would be unwelcome on the part of those helping the homeless. \u201cLook, the Feds don\u2019t have the authority to come in and arrest people for being homeless,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my real concern about whatever might be presented is that it will include moving people around, traumatizing people and generally just exacerbating the level of human misery we already have.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava AMERIND Risk provides peace of mind with our comprehensive suite of coverage products.

      "subtitle": "Is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mulling a Senate run in Kansas? Trump tells Fox he might do it",
      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo might leave the State Department to run for a Senate seat in Kansas. In an interview on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said Pompeo \u2013 a former House member\u00a0\u2013 might resume his political career if he feels a Republican cannot win a Kansas Senate seat that is open in 2020. \"If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that,\"\u00a0Trump said. While Pompeo \"has done an incredible job\" at the State Department, Trump added that \"Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it's a Trump state. He'd win easily.\" It might be an awkward time for Pompeo to launch an election campaign. Just this week, Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, testified that Pompeo was \"in the loop\" on the campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 president election. More:Trump visits Dover to honor remains of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan Sondland described that as a clear \u201cquid pro quo\u201d and said Pompeo was kept apprised of the effort. \"We kept the leadership of the State Department and the NSC (National Security Council) informed of our activities,\" Sondland said. \"They knew what we were doing and why,\" the EU ambassador said. Pompeo denied wrongdoing. Pompeo listened in on the now-infamous July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has publicly\u00a0defended the conversation as \"wholly appropriate,\" arguing that Trump was pushing to root out corruption in Ukraine. Pompeo sought to block\u00a0some State Department witnesses from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, with little success. He\u00a0has also refused to comply with the House Democrats' subpoena for documents related to the State Department's actions on Ukraine and its dealings with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and a key player in pressuring Ukraine's new government. It\u2019s unclear if the impeachment scandal would hurt Pompeo\u2019s prospects in Kansas, which has been a GOP stronghold but now has a Democratic governor. If Pompeo leaves the administration, it would be a major blow to Trump \u2013 particularly as his presidency is engulfed in an impeachment investigation that prominently features foreign policy. Pompeo is Trump's second secretary of state and succeeded Rex Tillerson in the post. Pompeo has staunchly defended Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine, even as his State Department employees provided damaging testimony. While Pompeo has publicly denied interest in the Kansas Senate race, he has repeatedly returned to the state and nurtured his political connections there. Pompeo,\u00a0who represented Kansas in the House for three terms before joining the Trump administration, is one of the president's longest-serving and most trusted advisers. He joined the Trump administration early, becoming the president's CIA director three days after his inauguration. Pompeo then took the helm at\u00a0the State Department in April of 2018, and he has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders amid a series of foreign policy crises \u2013 from Afghanistan to North Korea to Syria. The\u00a0filing deadline\u00a0for the Senate race is not until June, giving Pompeo time to contemplate a bid. He still has a congressional fundraising account, with nearly $1 million in the bank, according to the most recent\u00a0federal campaign finance\u00a0report.",

      "content": "ALBANY \u2013 A federal judge on Monday dismissed President Donald Trump's claims against a pair of New York officials after the state approved a law earlier this year allowing Congress to request copies of Trump's state tax returns. The ruling Monday from U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, said\u00a0Trump could not challenge New York's\u00a0 Attorney General Letitia James and Tax Commissioner Michael Schmidt in federal court in Washington D.C., where Nichols is based and the suit was filed. The ruling, however, allows Trump the option of refiling the lawsuit in New York or after Congress makes a formal request for his tax returns, meaning the legal battle is likely to continue. And it also allowed Trump to continue to challenge the House Ways and Means Committee, one of the three congressional committees allowed by the state law to request his taxes, in hopes of blocking it from requesting his taxes from the state. \"Mr. Trump may renew his claims against the New York Defendants should future events trigger one or more provisions of the D.C. long-arm statute, and he may, of course, sue either New York Defendant in another forum (presumably in New York),\" Nichols wrote. The decision marked the second time within a week that federal courts have ruled against Trump's legal efforts to shield his tax returns and financial records from public scrutiny. Trump's July lawsuit challenged a New York law known as the TRUST Act, which lawmakers approved in May and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed into law in July. The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Brad Hoylman of Manhattan and state Assemblyman David Buchwald of White Plains, was crafted with Trump in mind after the Republican president declined to publicly release his tax returns during his presidential campaign. The law allowed the state Department of Taxation and Finance to provide copies of New York tax returns to three congressional committees if the committee chairs request them for a \"specified and legitimate legislative purpose.\" Trump, a lifelong New York resident until he changed his legal residence to Florida earlier this year, argued the law violated his constitutional rights, accusing New York's Democrat-led Legislature of targeting him for his politics and policies. Trump's legal team had tried to argue in favor of filing the lawsuit in the Washington, D.C.-based court, making the case that the president would suffer harm there\u00a0should Congress make a request for his state tax returns. \"The TRUST Act also\u00a0grew out of a larger campaign in New York to uncover and expose the President\u2019s private financial information in the hopes of damaging him politically,\"\u00a0Trump's attorney, William Consovoy, argued in the\u00a0lawsuit. But Nichols was not persuaded. He ruled\u00a0that neither James or Schmidt had conducted any business in D.C. that would have subjected them to the District of Columbia\u00a0federal court. His decision Monday dismissed Trump's claims against James and Schmidt. Trump's lawsuit had also named the House Ways and Means Committee as a defendant. Consovoy\u00a0could not immediately be reached for comment Monday afternoon. The ruling was a significant victory for James, whose office has argued the TRUST Act should be upheld. Under the law, the chairs of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation can request Trump's New York returns. So far, none of them have. On Twitter, James said the TRUST Act \u2014 which stands for \"Tax Returns Released Under Specific Turns\" \u2014 is an \"important tool that will ensure accountability and transparency.\" \"No one is above the law,\" she wrote. Buchwald, the Assembly sponsor of the TRUST Act, said he's hopeful the courts will \"move quickly to dismiss the other claims in Mr. Trump's lawsuit\" against the Ways and Means Committee. \"New York state will stand ready to provide the committee with the President\u2019s New York state tax returns,\" he said in a statement. A federal appeals court based in New York City dealt Trump and his attorneys a similar legal setback last week. In a narrowly-tailored ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled rejected claims by Trump's lawyers that U.S. presidents have\u00a0absolute\u00a0immunity\u00a0from grand jury investigations of criminal conduct\u00a0until the end of their terms. Trump's lawyers had claimed total immunity applies even if a president\u00a0were suspected of shooting someone. The ruling came in a lawsuit Trump against Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, whose office is investigating hush-money payments made to two women who said they'd had sexual affairs with Trump before he was elected president. He has denied the claims. Trump's lawyers are expected to file a petition this week asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. A legal stay remains in place during the\u00a0appeal process, keeping Vance from gaining immediate access to Trump's tax returns for his grand jury investigation.

When asked which statement best reflected their view of the president's conduct after the first round of open testimony, 70% said \"Trump's actions were wrong.\"\u00a0Fifty-one percent said his acts were wrong and deserved impeachment in the House and conviction\u00a0in the Senate. Thirteen percent said what he did was wrong but not impeachable. And 6% thought his actions were wrong, and that he should be impeached but not removed from office by the Senate. A quarter of the respondents did not think the president had done anything wrong. According to ABC News, 85% of Democrats said Trump should be removed from office, and 65% of Republicans did not think the president had done anything to warrant impeachment.

Another 19% said they decided when news of the story was first reported. Nearly a third said they had made up their mind about Trump and impeachment even before the first news reports about Ukraine in September. The poll found that 21% of Americans have been following the impeachment inquiry hearings \"very closely,\" and 37% have been following \"somewhat closely.\" But 42% said they were not closely following the testimony. Of those who are watching closely, 60% believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, ABC News said.

      "content": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect recent White House policy actions on Israel, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement Nov. 18 that the U.S. would be shifting its position on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. BEIT UR AL-FAUQA, West Bank \u2013\u00a0Rep. Rashida Tlaib's 90-year-old grandmother says that when President Donald Trump releases his long-awaited plan for peace between Israelis and Palestinians he is welcome to visit her house\u00a0to talk it over. \"But only as a guest \u2013\u00a0not as a politician,\" Muftia Tlaib told USA TODAY in September\u00a0as\u00a0she sat on the porch of her home sandwiched between two Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank, a Palestinian-governed area Israeli's military has occupied since 1967. \"What should I do, curse his father?\"\u00a0she added, noting\u00a0pressure Trump applied on Israel\u00a0in August\u00a0that led her Michigan Democrat granddaughter to cancel a visit. As she spoke, Tlaib ran a string of wooden prayer beads through her aged fingers. She lives in a squat house made of sandstone blocks in Beit Ur Al-Faqua, a village on a hilltop about nine miles from the bustling Palestinian city of Ramallah. Israel held its second election in less than six months in September, a close race in which the nation's longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to burnish his credentials with voters by playing up his close relationship with Trump. He also pledged to annex Jewish settlements built\u00a0on Palestinian land in the West Bank. Netanyahu and his main rival, Israel's ex-military chief Benny Gantz, finished\u00a0neck-and-neck for the second time. They may\u00a0try to form a\u00a0unity government or a third election, which has never happened in Israel,\u00a0may be needed to break the stalemate. Trump has undertaken a series of firmly pro-Israel actions: He's moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as part of their future capital; recognized the Golan Heights as belonging to Israel instead of Syria, in defiance of international law; and pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 landmark Iran nuclear deal with world powers, an accord that Israel, Iran's sworn enemy, firmly opposed. Trump has also looked the other way when it comes to the expansion of Israeli Jewish settlements, which are also considered illegal under international law even if\u00a0not by Israel, closed a Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u2013\u00a0its de facto embassy\u00a0\u2013 and has withdrawn all funding for Palestinian-related aid projects. On Monday,\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0announced\u00a0that the U.S. would be shifting its position on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law. Trump factor:As Israel votes, Donald Trump proves he's the 'King of Israel' \"If a miracle happens and this plan of Trump's has anything in it for us\u00a0we'll of course be very happy,\" said Nasser al Kidwa, nephew of the late Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) most high-profile leader.\u00a0Arafat was for years\u00a0at the forefront of violence, border disputes and, later, diplomacy with Israel over Palestinian demands. He became\u00a0known for his checkered head scarves\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\"kaffiyeh\" in Arabic. \"No hope, no openings, nothing for Palestinians\u00a0\u2013 this is what we expect,\" added\u00a0Al Kidwa, who runs the Yasser Arafat Foundation, a Ramallah-based cultural and educational institution dedicated to Arafat's legacy. \"I mean, look at the so-called U.S. Ambassador to Israel (David Friedman), he himself is a settler,\" he said, referring to supporters of\u00a0Israeli\u00a0civilian communities on Palestinian land, widely\u00a0seen as\u00a0a major obstacle in\u00a0resolving the long-simmering Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many Palestinians are convinced that\u00a0Friedman, a former longtime lawyer for the Trump Organization, the president's private business, has personally contributed\u00a0financially to settlements in Israel. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Jerusalem did not respond to a direct question about that claim, but said that prior to taking up his role as ambassador Friedman\u00a0served as the president of the American Friends of Bet El Yeshiva Center, an organization dedicated to sponsoring academic study in Bet El, a large Orthodox settlement that is located in the hills north of Jerusalem, next to Ramallah. Trump's dissolved\u00a0charitable foundation has also contributed to\u00a0Bet El, according to tax records published in 2016 by\u00a0The Jerusalem Post, an English-language Israeli newspaper. Along with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rep. Tlaib, D-Mich., had planned in August\u00a0to lead a delegation to Israel and the Palestinian territories. However, after\u00a0Trump tweeted that Israel should ban them from entering the region partly because\u00a0they are outspoken and highly\u00a0visible critics of Israel who support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls on governments and companies to put economic pressure on Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, the country obliged. Rep. Tlaib was subsequently granted permission to visit her grandmother in Beit Ur al-Faqua provided she promised not to promote BDS and abided by other restrictions, but the lawmaker turned the offer down, saying to visit her grandmother \"under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in.\" The U.S. House of Representatives voted in July to pass a resolution condemning the BDS campaign against Israel. It has no force in law. Israel passed legislation\u00a0in 2017 that it has used to ban outspoken supporters of BDS from entering the country. Omar Barghouti, one of the BDS\u00a0movement's Palestinian co-founders, disputed in an interview allegations, from pro-Israel groups in the U.S.\u00a0and elsewhere but also from Germany's Parliament \u2013\u00a0which in May passed a symbolic resolution\u00a0equating\u00a0the group with anti-semitism \u2013\u00a0that BDS is an any way\u00a0hostile to Jews. \"BDS opposes all forms of racism, including anti-Jewish racism. Anti-semitism, which means hate, bigotry. or discrimination against Jews is absolutely condemned and rejected,\" he said. Barghouti would not say whether he planned to meet Rep. Tlaib on her now-abandoned West Bank visit. He said the idea was \"discussed\" with her local Palestinian hosts. The Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group\u00a0that\u00a0describes itself as a \"strong voice for Israel,\"\u00a0includes in its\u00a0anti-semitism definition\u00a0\"political efforts to isolate\" Jews.\u00a0In April, Barghouti was barred from entering the U.S. despite having a valid visa. This week, Barghouti\u00a0was denied a visa to visit Britain, where has was going to speak at an event about Palestinians' rights on the fringes of the opposition Labour Party's annual conference. The Labour Party has struggled to shake off anti-semitism allegations that followed it around under\u00a0its leader Jeremy Corbyn. It's not clear how much, if any, pressure\u00a0Trump\u00a0applied\u00a0on Israel\u00a0behind closed doors while he was publicly advocating that the country prevent entry to\u00a0two sitting members of Congress, but for Palestinians\u00a0it was\u00a0another example of U.S. favoritism. \"Trump represents the real face of the American administration,\" said Kassam Mtoor, 21, a law major\u00a0at Birzeit University, in Ramallah. Mtoor is the president of the student council at the college. A year ago, Omar al-Kiswani, his predecessor in the role, was filmed being violently detained on campus by undercover Israeli operatives pretending to be Palestinian journalists there to interview him. Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, accuses\u00a0al-Kiswani of helping to funnel money to Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist organization the U.S. and other countries have designated a terrorist group. Birzeit University says\u00a0al-Kiswani is being interrogated and held without charge and described the Israeli operatives as \"kidnappers who carried firearms in their backpacks.\" Carmen Kishek, a\u00a0Birzeit University public relations representative, said that \"most of our students who are involved and active in the student council get arrested (by the Israelis) at some point no matter what their political affiliation might be.\" More than a decade ago, Palestinian resistance tactics to Israel centered on suicide bombings\u00a0and today there are still frequent, mostly spontaneous and opportunistic,\u00a0attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers\u00a0\u2013 usually with a household weapon such as a kitchen knife. Israel insists it only detains Palestinians who represent a security risk. Its forces crack down on near-daily\u00a0Palestinian protests by firing live rounds and rubber-coated bullets. Across the West Bank, large red signs warn Israelis not to enter Palestinian villages because their lives will be at risk. Mtoor represents the youth party of\u00a0Fatah, a Palestinian nationalist party and the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization assembly that governs the West Bank. The student council regularly leads clashes with Israeli soldiers. \"Serving the students has a price. It doesn't matter what that price is,\" he said. Back in Beit Ur al-Faqua, Rep. Tlaib's relatives\u00a0were disappointed that their famous American relation decided not to return to a place she last visited in 2006. But they\u00a0understood. \"We had planned to slaughter a sheep to celebrate her coming back to visit with us,\" the lawmaker's uncle\u00a0Bassam Tlaib, 53, an electrician, said. \"But we\u00a0supported her decision. And we know why the Israelis didn't want her here: Her visit would have shown how we Palestinians are suffering under their occupation,\" he said, Rep. Tlaib's grandmother, despite her congenial offer to host Trump at her house to \"enjoy sitting under an olive tree,\" seemed ultimately less inclined toward conciliation. \"Even if I get an invitation from Trump to travel to the U.S., I won't go,\" she said.\u00a0\"Even if my husband returns from the grave and tells me to go, I refuse,\" she said. \"I don't like it there,\" she added. She said that she spent about 18 months in the U.S. when her granddaughter was in high school. \"I decided not to ever go back after I made 'Hadj'\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, prescribed as a religious duty for Muslims. Attempts to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have\u00a0stagnated despite numerous high-profile and rigorous attempts at diplomacy: the Madrid Conference (1991), the Oslo Accords (1993-95), the Camp David Summit (2000), the Clinton Parameters (2000), the Taba Summit (2001), the Arab Peace Initiative (2002), the Middle East Road Map (2003), the Annapolis talks (2007), the Kerry Peace Initiative (2013-14). Palestinians have branded Trump's forthcoming plan, somewhat dismissively because of his real-estate roots, as the \"Deal of the Century.\" Trump himself has also used variations on this\u00a0phrase to describe it. The plan is not expected to offer any\u00a0political solutions, including a\u00a0\"two-state\" solution that\u00a0envisages an independent Palestine sitting alongside Israel. There are different views about what caused these previous peace efforts to fail. There is also divergence over what the peace process correctly entails. But at its core it's a\u00a0dispute \u2013 one of the world's longest-running\u00a0\u2013 over ancient land that two peoples, Jews and Arab Palestinians, both lay claim to for their respective states. The 1967 war that Israel successfully fought with\u00a0neighboring Egypt, Jordan and Syria ended with it in military control of two areas that have large Palestinian populations: the West Bank, nestled between Israel to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east, and the Gaza Strip, an isolated Hamas-controlled enclave on the Mediterranean Sea. Israel has imposed a sea blockade and built a security fence around\u00a0Gaza, where militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on\u00a0Israel.\u00a0Hamas\u00a0has fought several wars against Israel. The next one seems forever around the corner. The White House promised to release its peace plan for the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has dragged on for more than 70 years\u00a0after Israel's election. But with a possible third vote needed to break the political deadlock, and because Palestinian leaders have rejected the plan outright even before they've seen it\u00a0partly due to Trump's perceived pro-Israel actions, its fate remains uncertain. In emailed comments, Friedman said the embassy move \"injects a long-needed note of realism to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and signals to the Palestinians that they do not have a veto on the truth and may not dictate to America where it chooses to locate its embassy to a critical ally. While perhaps raising some friction in the short term, the move has created a foundation upon which real peace discussions may proceed.\" Still, Ali Jarbawi, a former Palestinian government cabinet member for planning and development who teaches political science at Birzeit University, said that Israel's election and Trump's peace plan were almost meaningless for Palestinians. \"We have tried everything: diplomacy, fighting, more diplomacy,\" he said. \"For most of us, we only know Israel through our interactions with its soldiers or its settlers,\" he added,\u00a0expressing the exasperation many here feel over peace talks\u00a0that effectively stalled when Netanyahu came to power, for the second time, in 2009. \"One of the most difficult things is to be a moderate Palestinian,\" he said, referring to a litany of Palestinian complaints about Israel's military control of the West Bank that\u00a0are backed up by the United Nations and humanitarian groups. These include\u00a0onerous travel restrictions; Israel's control of Palestinians' water resources; forced evictions;\u00a0police harassment; the indignities that come with being one of the approximately 200,000 Palestinians in the West Bank who live in crowded refugee camps that lack basic infrastructure;\u00a0and myriad arbitrary bureaucratic processes that prevent Palestinians from carrying out even simple tasks like going to work or school. More than 1.5 million Palestinians, a third of the total,\u00a0live in 58 official refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syrian, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). A major sticking point in any future lasting peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians is what to do with all these refugees who claim a right to return to cities and villages now controlled by Israel. \"My son is 28 years old and he has never been to Jerusalem\u00a0just a few feet from here on the other side of that wall,\" said Omar Daaja, 53, pointing to the security barrier that separates the UN-run refugee camp Aida near Bethlehem, where he lives in a few rooms with more than a dozen members of his extended family, from the holy city. Jarbawi, like a growing number of Palestinians, believes that a \"one-state\" solution\u00a0\u2013 a combined Israeli-Palestinian nation encompassing\u00a0all of the present territory of Israel, plus\u00a0the West Bank, East Jerusalem\u00a0and possibly the Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2013 may be the only realistic\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for Palestinians \u2013 way of moving beyond an impasse that has been resistant to decades of intense military and diplomatic activity. But Israel's government\u00a0has seemed interested only in annexing Palestinians' land, not its people. And last year,\u00a0Israel\u2019s Parliament enacted a law that enshrined\u00a0the right of national self-determination as \"unique to the Jewish people,\" not all its nationals. The\u00a0move effectively downgraded\u00a0Israel's 1.8 million Arab Muslim citizens, although they do have the right to vote and can serve in the military\u00a0even if\u00a0most\u00a0choose not to. \"There is only one way to describe how Arabs and Palestinians\u00a0here live and that is under 'apartheid,'\u00a0said Uri Davis, an Israeli Jewish-born academic and activist who converted to Islam and is a member of the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, the Palestinian nationalist party that governs the West Bank. Davis believes that his views\u00a0reflect less\u00a0than 1% of Israeli public opinion and he defines \"apartheid\"\u00a0as a \"political and legal system that regulates racism through acts of Parliament.\" During his election campaign, Netanyahu's official Facebook page posted a message that urged voters to vote for his Likud party because \"Arabs want to annihilate us all\u00a0\u2013 men, women and children.\" He also tried, but failed, to pass a law that would have permitted representatives from political parties to film voters inside and outside voting stations, a move he said was necessary to ensure the integrity of Israel's democracy but that critics saw as an effort to intimidate Arabs voters and suppress voter turnout. Yet many Israelis, while perhaps sympathetic to the hardships\u00a0Palestinians face,\u00a0say they\u00a0ultimately do not do enough to help themselves, that they suffer from poor leadership and corruption, rely on Israel too much\u00a0and that years of violence against Israeli citizens has exposed a fundamental unwillingness to pursue peace. With the exception of being a billionaire from Saudi Arabia, \"the best place to be an Arab in the Middle East is Israel ...\u00a0and the second best place to be an Arab in the Middle East is the West Bank,\" Gantz, Netanyahu's chief rival for prime minister, said last week. It reflected\u00a0the view from some corners in Israel that, while Israel's Arab citizens and\u00a0Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza with whom they identify, may have problems, they have it better than other Arabs in the region. \"Palestinians I know would prefer if they could live under Israeli leaders,\" said Yinon Israeli, 43,\u00a0a rabbi who lives in\u00a0Ganei Modi'in, a Jewish settlement just\u00a0over the Green Line into the West Bank, the boundary that separates it from\u00a0Israel. Tens of thousands of Palestinians who live\u00a0in the West Bank are employed in Israel and even its settlements. They pass through security checkpoints each day to travel there on their way to jobs in hotels, restaurants and on constructions sites. \"Israeli laws, working conditions, social and medical benefits, all these things are much better for us. Palestinians see that and wish it was different,\" said Israeli. Osamah Khalil, a professor at Syracuse University\u00a0who specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said\u00a0Israel's government believes any peace with the Palestinians would likely only be temporary because Gaza-based groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a\u00a0terrorist group\u00a0that calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and that like Hamas is not part of the PLO,\u00a0would continue to threaten it. \"I don't agree with these claims,\"\u00a0said Khalil. \"What\u00a0years of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed is the opposite: The most the Israelis are willing to offer does not meet the minimum demands of the Palestinians. This includes a viable, independent state with sovereignty over its borders and resources,\" he said. \"I haven\u2019t met an Israeli who doesn\u2019t think that a peace process will lead to another intifada,\" said\u00a0Nickolay Mladenov, United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, in a closed-door meeting Thursday ahead of the international organization's\u00a0annual general assembly in New York. There have been two\u00a0intifadas, both originated by Arafat,\u00a0in the West Bank and Gaza. They were\u00a0violent\u00a0Palestinian uprisings against Israel's presence in the territories\u00a0that in the past included\u00a0suicide bombings, rocket attacks and sniper fire. The last one ended in 2005. They had a deleterious impact on Israeli-Palestinian relations. \"(And) I haven\u2019t met a Palestinian who doesn\u2019t believe a peace process will lead to their losing more land,\" said\u00a0Mladenov. He said\u00a0one consequence of Trump's aid cut\u00a0to Palestinians could be \"schools (that) fall into the hands of radicals.\" For Avigail Be Nun, 81, a Holocaust survivor whose home in the\u00a0Neve Tzuf settlement, north of Ramallah, was burned down in 2016 in what Israeli media labeled an \"arson intifada,\"\u00a0her arrival there in\u00a01978 \"was a very strange, very strong feeling.\" It was, she said,\u00a0\"as if I came home.\" At the time, Be Nun\u00a0said, there were no houses or other signs of infrastructure on the land, then owned by Palestinians and later seized by Israel's military. \"We were the first here,\" she said. Ben Nun\u00a0and her husband Yossi, 86, currently live\u00a0in a temporary trailer-home\u00a0in\u00a0Neve Tzuf. They are expecting to soon move\u00a0to a new house on the plot that burned down. She said that they believe Palestinians deliberately started the blaze. There has not been definitive proof. Ben Nun\u00a0said initially there were no problems with her Arab neighbors who lived in the area's surrounding villages. \"They would come to ask if they could help, we were invited to their weddings, we would have coffee with them and I would go to their houses. We were friends and we had a very nice community.\" One day, Ben Nun couldn't remember exactly when, she noticed a change. She traced it to around the time Arafat returned to the Palestinian territories 27 years after he was forced into exile as a result of the 1967 war between Israel and its neighbors. \"We used to buy vegetables from the Arabs. Then they stopped coming,\" she said.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne WASHINGTON \u2013 The House impeachment inquiry begins public hearings Wednesday after weeks of closed-door depositions investigating President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Much of the evidence gathering occurred behind closed doors, as three key committees gathered depositions from State Department and National Security Council officials. But now the entire House \u2013 and the country \u2013 will be able to watch as testimony unfolds. Democrats suggest that Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his rival while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid could warrant impeachment. During a July 25 call, Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of\u00a0Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. But Trump has dismissed the investigation as a partisan \"witch hunt\" and said he was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine. The hearings will educate the American public about what happened in anticipation of a possible House vote on whether to impeach Trump. If the House adopts articles of impeachment, the Senate would hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office. \u201cIn my view, the public hearings have the potential for significant impact,\u201d said John Marston, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Foley Hoag LLP. \u201cIf the case is made clearly and with compelling evidence in the hearings, that can move the needle in the public, and that is what will drive the views of congress. So public hearings have the potential for significant, even determinative, impact as this moves forward.\u201d Movie nights, phone calls:How Trump is uniting the GOP to fight impeachment Two witnesses are scheduled Wednesday.\u00a0Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who told lawmakers about gradually learning about demands for investigations, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition to receive military aid. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of State, raised concerns about Giuliani steering policy privately. The witness Friday is\u00a0Marie Yovanovich, the former ambassador to Ukraine, who explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April. A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair Here are five things to look for in the public hearings: House Republicans have remained unified in defending\u00a0Trump against the Democratic rules for the impeachment inquiry. To this point, Republicans have focused their opposition to how the inquiry was conducted. Three key panels took depositions behind closed doors that other\u00a0lawmakers couldn't attend. Then the House authorized public hearings with the support of just Democrats. Trump said Saturday that there shouldn't be any hearings because there shouldn't be any investigation. He encouraged people to read the summary of his July 25 call with Zelensky rather than listen to witnesses with third-hand knowledge. \"There shouldn\u2019t be anything. There shouldn\u2019t be impeachment hearings, is what I said,\" Trump said. \"This is a witch hunt at the highest level, and it's so bad for our country.\" The approach of hearings focused attention on the president's actions, but some Republicans have said even if Trump's request for investigations was inappropriate, it doesn't merit impeachment. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said it was inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. But Thornberry said the July 25 call sounded like how Trump talks regularly and shouldn't be grounds for impeachment. \"I believe it was inappropriate,\" Thornberry told ABC's\u00a0\"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" on Sunday. \"I do not believe it was impeachable.\" Impeachment inquiry:Read all the transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, also said a president shouldn't urge the investigation of a political rival, but that calls for impeachment were premature. \"I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign \u2013 is not something a president or any official should be doing,\" Hurd, a former CIA officer who serves on the Intelligence Committee,\u00a0said on\u00a0\"Fox News Sunday.\"\u00a0\"I think everybody has \u2013 most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he would look for evidence of the president's motivations if the House sends articles of impeachment for trial in the Senate. \"Here are the two possible scenarios,\" Kennedy said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"No. 1,\u00a0the president asked for an investigation of a political rival. No. 2, the president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The latter would be in the national interest. The former would be in the president's parochial interests and would be over the line.\" The initial witnesses will describe how two channels of diplomacy emerged. Taylor learned gradually from May through September about demands for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and Burisma, first as a condition for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky and then as a condition for Ukraine to receive military aid. Taylor called the trade-off \"crazy.\" Kent raised concerns about Giuliani's private back-channel efforts, testifying that Trump \"wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden,\u00a0and Clinton.\" And Yovanovich explained how Giuliani's criticism and pressure led to her ouster in April. Congressional Republicans asked to hear from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, on the same panel as Taylor and Kent because Volker dealt first-hand with Giuliani and others. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., argued that witnesses such as Taylor and Kent had only indirect knowledge of the arrangements because neither spoke\u00a0directly to Trump or Giuliani. Closed-door testimony:Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said? Volker in his closed-door testimony described Trump's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine. \"And like a lot of business people, I think he just recoiled at the corrupt environment,\" Volker said. The special envoy also said \"no,\" when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election. \"Even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something,\" Volker said. Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Notre Dame, said the hearings will put arguments about serious allegations into a public forum for the American people to decide whether the president's conduct was appropriate. Republicans and Democrats may have made up their minds already, he said. \"But there are independents, many of whom are on the fence and many of whom haven\u2019t made up their minds about the nature of this scheme and whether it was an abuse of power or not,\" Gurule said. \"I think that in the end is the intended audience.\" Much of the closed-door testimony credited Giuliani\u00a0with guiding Ukraine policy to push for investigations. But how much was Trump involved? Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said Trump told him at a May 23 briefing on Ukraine to deal with Giuliani, who \u201cemphasized that the president wanted a public statement from President (Volodymyr) Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues.\u201d Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, asked Sondland in late June who assigned him to oversee Ukraine. \u201cAnd he said, the president,\u201d Hill said. Giuliani also said repeatedly he was working for Trump. Giuliani tweeted Nov. 6 that his investigation was done solely as a defense attorney to protect Trump from false charges. Taylor said during a July 18 conference call that an unidentified Office of Management and Budget staffer said the directive to withhold military aid \u201chad come from the president to the chief of staff to OMB.\u201d Trump and his Republican defenders have insisted that while he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens during the July 25 call, he didn't explicitly mention the trade-off for military aid. \"The fundamental facts have never changed and will never change,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee who joined the Intelligence Committee to participate in the hearings. \"There was no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo.\" . Yovanovitch was a career foreign service officer serving as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine when she was removed abruptly in late April, after months of criticism by Giuliani. Hill called the removal \"a real turning point\" among diplomats recognizing Giuliani's influence because \"there was no basis for her removal\" based on a\u00a0\u00a0\"a mishmash of conspiracy theories\" that had \"no merit whatsoever.\" Republicans have questioned whether Yovanovitch\u00a0collaborated with Democrats, as they have alleged with the whistleblower.\u00a0Zeldin asked during her closed-door deposition about her contacts with the House Foreign Affairs Committee after her recall from Ukraine. Yovanovitch testified that she received two emails from a staffer and referred the person to the State Department. But Zeldin said department emails suggested she had more contacts, saying she apparently \u201cdid not accurately answer this question\u201d under oath. Republicans earlier drew attention to the whistleblower\u2019s intermediary contacting the House Intelligence Committee before filing a complaint about Trump's July 25 call. Trump retweeted Zeldin\u2019s exchange with Yovanovitch, calling it \u201ca terrible lie. How can she do such a thing?\u201d But the committee headed by Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., tweeted in reply to Trump that the panel had \u201calready debunked this ugly smear.\u201d Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee asked Saturday for nine categories of witnesses at the public hearings scheduled to begin Wednesday. Under rules the House adopted for the hearings, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., could reject any of the requests. Republicans could ask for a vote on any rejections, but Democrats control the committee and it\u2019s not clear how many will be allowed or rejected. Republicans requested testimony from the whistleblower, the only witness Schiff rejected outright, and any individuals who helped the person prepare the complaint about the July 25 call. Schiff said the panel wouldn\u2019t help Trump threaten, intimidate or retaliate against the person who filed the complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence about the call. Andrew Bakaj, one of the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, said his client was willing to answer written questions, but not in person out of concern about being identified. Government officials who testified in closed-door depositions are also on the Republican witness list: David Hale, the undersecretary of State for political affairs; Tim Morrison, the National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and Volker. Republicans also requested subpoenas for Hunter Biden\u00a0and Devon Archer, a Biden business partner who was a fellow board member for Burisma, to ask about possible corruption at the\u00a0company. Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party And Republicans sought testimony from two witnesses associated with the 2016 election: Nellie Ohr, a contractor for the research firm Fusion GPS\u00a0that produced the dossier of alleged ties between Trump and the Kremlin, and Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee staffer with alleged connections to Ukrainian efforts to interfere with the election. Schiff replied to Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, that he was reviewing the requests. But Schiff sounded pessimistic in his Saturday reply to Republicans about accepting the Bidens or political operatives as witnesses. \u201cAs we move to open hearings, it is important to underscore that the impeachment inquiry, and the committee, will not serve as vehicles for any member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about the 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit,\u201d Schiff said.",

The call is a key aspect in the whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine for political benefit. In her testimony, Williams said the call\u00a0\"struck me as unusual and inappropriate.\" \"Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine,\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\" Impeachment:Morrison said he was 'not comfortable' with Ukraine President Zelensky being involved in US politics: the latest When asked for comment on Trump's tweet, Pence press secretary Katie Waldman told CNN, \"Jennifer is a State Department employee.\" Trump has insisted that a rough transcript of the call shows he did nothing wrong. But Democrats say it demonstrates\u00a0that Trump wanted a \"favor\" in the form of investigations in exchange for military assistance. The president and his supporters have dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a politically motivated \"hoax.\" And they have implied political bias motivated several of the career government officials who worked in the White House and have testified in the inquiry. Trump also accused the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Willam Taylor, of being a \"Never Trumper.\" And on Thursday, the president sparked an uproar when he tweeted criticisms of Marie Yovanovitch, the\u00a0former U.S, ambassador to Ukraine, as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee.

      "content": "ATLANTA \u2013 President Donald Trump on Friday pitched his immigration and economic policies in an appeal to African American voters, telling a crowd in Atlanta, Georgia, that Democrats were fighting harder for people in the country illegally than for\u00a0the black community. Speaking at the campaign launch of the \"Black Voices for Trump\" coalition at Atlanta's World Congress Center, the president used his signature issue of immigration in his latest attempt to gin up support among African American one year out from the 2020 election. \"Democrats want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens, courtesy of you, the American taxpayer and the African American community,\"\u00a0he told a crowd of about 300 people as they cheered and chanted, \"four more years!\" \"Republicans believe that public benefits should be protected for American citizens.\" Throughout his speech, Trump argued that his Democratic opponents were more focused on helping countries and people outside the U.S. rather than the black community at home. \"The money that we spend on illegal aliens we could be rebuilding our inner cities, repairing our crumbling infrastructure and fixing our terrible public schools...but instead Democrats want to redistribute your wealth all over the entire world,\" Trump\u00a0said. He railed against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats, accusing them of holding up passage of a trade agreement with Canada and New Mexico because they \"would rather hurt their political opponents than help their black constituents.\u201d Trump blamed Democrats for eroding urban areas and driving up crime, suggesting \"Nancy Pelosi should go back home to San Francisco and clean up its problems.\" He also touted his move to formally pull out of the 2015 landmark Paris agreement\u00a0on Monday, a move that has drawn worldwide condemnation, contending he was focusing on domestic issues while Democrats were looking abroad. \"Democrats want to invest in green global projects. I want to invest in black American communities,\" he declared as the crowd cheered. Ivanka Trump:Whistleblower's identity 'not particularly relevant' in impeachment inquiry But Trump faces\u00a0an uphill battle over the next year as he looks to expand his\u00a0appeal among black voters.\u00a0Only 8% of African Americans\u00a0cast their ballot for Trump in 2016, compared to Hillary Clinton's 89% among the voting bloc,\u00a0while his approval rating among black voters sits at just 10%, according to\u00a0a recent survey by\u00a0Quinnipiac University. The president often highlights his economic record when arguing for why African Americans should support his re-election bid.\u00a0When he took office in January 2017, the black jobless rate\u00a0was 7.7% and has since fallen to 5.4% \u2013 the lowest on record dating to 1972 - while the overall unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.6%. That message has resonated with some supporters from\u00a0\"Blacks for Trump\", a Miami-based group that traveled to Atlanta Friday to support the launch of the coalition. Lateresa Jones, a member of the group, said African Americans should not feel afraid to voice support for Trump. Michael Bloomberg:Former NYC mayor opens door to 2020 presidential campaign Jones, 55, said the black community expected more from former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration but it did not deliver. Under Trump\u2019s administration, Jones said she sees more young, black professionals getting jobs and small businesses opening. \u201cWe have been allowing ourselves to be ignored politically,\u201d said Jones, who was wearing a \u2018Blacks for Trump\u2019 T-shirt and a red jacket. \u201cOur president has an urban agenda that will grow every urban community across the country.\u201d The Atlanta event drew a few hundred African American supporters, many wearing red and\u00a0Make America Great Again hats, with the line stretching through the lobby\u00a0of the World Congress Center. Outside the Atlanta event, hundreds of protesters gathered at nearby Centennial Park before marching toward the World Congress Center. The president has drawn criticism\u00a0over what some see as\u00a0racially divisive language, most recently in clashes with the late\u00a0House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump referred\u00a0to his black-majority district in Baltimore as a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested mess.\" He also criticized four freshman congresswomen of color known as \"The Squad.\" He initially attacked Reps. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), before zeroing in on Omar, who was born in Somalia but is a U.S. citizen. The spat intensified after supporters chanted \"send her back\" at one of his campaign rallies in North Carolina in July. Trump has made other overtures to the black community in recent months.\u00a0Last month he spoke at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, in what was billed as a keynote speech at a three-day presidential forum on criminal justice reform that featured some of his Democratic\u00a0challengers. Instead, Trump's speech came a day before the other\u00a0candidates appeared and\u00a0was delivered to a handpicked\u00a0crowd of supporters and just seven students. He was honored for the bipartisan passage of the First Step Act, which gives elderly inmates opportunities for release,\u00a0increases the amount of good-time credit inmates can receive and assists with their transition back into society. His award prompted Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris to pull out of the event Saturday. Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Trump also hosted the Young Black Leadership Summit, an event organized by the conservative group Turning Point USA, at the White House\u00a0Oct. 4 In September, he spoke to leaders from\u00a0historically black colleges and universities at an annual conference in Washington, where he announced faith-based HBCUs would no longer be restricted from federal funding for capital projects. He often points out that he outperformed former Republican presidential nominee\u00a0Mitt Romney, who received just\u00a06% among\u00a0African American voters in 2012. But\u00a0Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who focuses on race and politics, emphasizes\u00a0he was running against the first black president,\u00a0Barack Obama, who received 93% of the black vote. Prison guards:Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts \"He actually fared worse than every other Republican presidential candidate that didn't run against a black man since [Barry] Goldwater in 1964,\" Johnson said. Goldwater took 4% of the African American vote. George W. Bush received the highest number of African American voters of any modern Republican candidate with 11% in 2004, a jump from 8% in 2000. While convincing black voters he's delivered on his promises at the end of his first term, it'll be a stretch for Trump\u00a0to deliver on one he made in August 2016, when he told a crowd\u00a0he would get 95% of the African American vote at the end of his first four years. Johnson isn't convinced that the coalition or any of the president's efforts among the African American community are aimed at expanding his appeal, but keeping the slice of black voters he does have in place. \"When he talks about unemployment numbers, when he talks about criminal justice reform and visits HBCUs, this is just to hold on to that 8% of those folks that he does have, in particular black men,\" Johnson said. Karen Pence:Second lady embraces bigger role on 2020 campaign trail \"He gives just enough to show that they care, to some extent,\u00a0about the black American experience by pointing to these policy wins, but the bigger thing is to cast doubt on whoever the Democrats put forth,\" he said. Johnson noted that black voter turnout dropped by seven points\u00a0from 2012 to 2016. If turnout among black voters falls short in 2020, Trump would benefit. Every\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate has received no less than 82% of the African-American vote\u00a0since 1972. Yahanesh \u201cYG Nyghtstorm\u201d George, vice chairman of the Forsyth County GOP, said he supports Trump\u2019s outreach to black voters in Atlanta because too often Democrats take the black vote for granted. Many presidential candidates, he said, skip campaigning in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of him showing that he is trying to appeal to American citizens period, he\u2019s trying to talk to everybody,\u201d said George, adding that he was pleased with the country\u2019s low unemployment rate. \u201cSo if you act like you\u2019re entitled and say \u2018I know I\u2019ve got this group\u2019 then you\u2019re not working for that group. We are a voting bloc and we deserve to be talked to as well.\u201d Contributing:\u00a0Eric Connor and Carol Motsinger, The Greenville News",

But Trump stopped short of repeating his claim that Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman is a \"Never Trumper.\" \"I don't know Vindman at all,\" Trump said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. \"I never heard of him.\" Trump's remarks came as a House committee was conducting another impeachment hearing in which Vindman was one of the witnesses. Vindman, who listened to Trump's call with Zelensky, told lawmakers Tuesday he knew without hesitation that he had to report his concerns about the conversation to White House lawyers. \u201cIt was inappropriate,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cIt was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this could be an impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge.\u201d Vindman said that given the \"power disparity\" between the United States and Ukraine, it was clear that Trump's request for investigations was more of a demand. At the White House, Trump said he briefly watched Vindman's testimony.\u00a0\"I'm going to let people make their own determination\" about Vindman's remarks, he said. Trump faced a backlash from Democrats and Republicans\u00a0last week after he tweeted negative remarks about Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, while she was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Yovanovitch was testifying in the second public hearing of the impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump used military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations that stood to benefit him politically. As she testified about her removal as ambassador,\u00a0Trump tweeted: \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\" Yovanovitch told Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that she found the\u00a0tweet \"intimidating.\" Schiff called the tweet \"witness intimidation.\" More:The Trump impeachment inquiry in pictures More:Impeachment hearings: the latest on the Trump impeachment proceedings and what it means",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump signed a short-term spending bill on Thursday that will avoid another government shutdown, at least for now. The measure will fund the government at current levels through Dec. 20, buying lawmakers a few more weeks to agree on long-term spending but backing difficult decisions up against the Christmas holiday and, potentially, an impeachment vote. Budget talks have hit an impasse over Trump\u2019s demand for billions in funding to build a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border. Last year, a fight over border wall funding triggered a partial government shutdown that lasted a record 35 days. The push to keep the government open comes amid ongoing impeachment inquiry hearings.\u00a0House Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his office to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats also are looking to wrap up the investigation and hold a possible impeachment vote before Christmas. Federal agencies have shuttered three times\u00a0under Trump. The first, in early 2018, lasted three days. The second, which lasted\u00a0only a few hours, took place in February of that same year. A third, caused by an impasse over funding for the president\u2019s proposed wall, lasted 35 days \u2013 the longest closure of federal agencies in U.S. history.

      "author": "",
      "content": "President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration would propose a\u00a0minimum age\u00a0of\u00a021 for the purchase of e-cigarette products. The president made the comment\u00a0during a robust \"listening\" session at the White House with vaping industry executives, public health advocates, as well\u00a0as\u00a0some members of Congress and the Administration. Trump, who earlier expressed support\u00a0for a\u00a0ban on non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes,\u00a0appeared to reverse course\u00a0saying\u00a0he believes prohibition often leads to less safe black market products. \"If you don't give it to them, it is going to come here illegally,\" he said, warning \"they could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible.\" Regarding an age limit, Trump said, \"21 we are going to be doing.\" The session was called amid reports\u00a0of soaring vaping-related lung illnesses. And with some 5 million U.S. teens now vaping, the e-cigarette issue has taken on more urgency . At one point, Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican from Utah, who was seated next to Trump, said \"most adults are not using flavors,\" prompting vaping industry\u00a0leaders to shout back, \"yes they do,\" offering adult sales statistics. Romney responded by pointing\u00a0to Juul voluntarily ending flavors, but other companies said many or most of sales are of flavored products. Romney clashed multiple times with vaping advocates. \"Utah is a Mormon state, and half the kids in high school are vaping,' he said at one point.\u00a0He claimed vaping companies sold a flavor called \"unicorn poop\" to appeal to children. Ryan Nivakoff, CEO of Njoy, an e-cigarette company, said teen vaping is \"not necessarily a flavor problem.\" At another point, Reynolds American chief commercial officer Joe Fragnito, told Trump, \"we believe we can market flavors responsibly.\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said the gathering\u00a0was aimed at giving Trump and administration officials an opportunity to hear from all sides of the issue \"as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people.\u201d Greg Conley, president and founder of the American Vaping Association, said afterwards that the president\u00a0\"seemed to understand that prohibition is not the only option.\" \"He cares a lot about youth and keeping them away from these products, but there is the jobs issues and the adult cessation issue that is clearly weighing on his mind,\" Conley\u00a0said. Conley added, however, that there was no indication of the timing of any broad plan. \"He wants ideas.\" Dr. Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said Trump \"listened intently\"\u00a0 to what developed into a\u00a0\"very spirited discussion.\"\u00a0He said the \"jury is still out\" regarding any Administration decisions or legislative proposals. LeRoy noted that the sides were far apart on such issues as the value of vaping to wean adults off of cigarettes,\u00a0but said all sides seemed to agree that vaping \"has no place for young adults below the age of 21.\" Among those on the guest list were Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, and two executives of the largest U.S. tobacco companies, Altria CEO Howard Willard and Fragnito of\u00a0Reynolds'. Other invitees included\u00a0Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, and Tony Abboud, executive director of the\u00a0Vapor Technology Association. Health leaders who attended included\u00a0Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids president Matt Myers, American Academy of Pediatrics president-elect Sally Goza and American Lung Association President Harold Wimmer. The administration\u00a0has sent mixed signals on how it plans to tackle the problem of young people vaping and the outbreak of lung injuries. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced plans by the administration to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves in a widening crackdown. Last week, however, Mitch Zeller, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's\u00a0Center for Tobacco Products, declined to confirm such a ban in testimony before a Senate committee, referring inquiries instead to the White House. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0reported Thursday\u00a02,290 cases of vaping-related lung injuries in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, 47 vaping-related deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and D.C. The median age of deceased patients was 53 years and ranged from 17 to 75 years. Among those cases where data was available, 68% of patients\u00a0were men and 38% were between the ages of 18 and 24. The CDC recently reported vitamin E acetate was associated with the outbreak. The substance is used as a \"thickening agent\" in e-cigarette products containing THC, the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. The CDC said vitamin E acetate usually does not cause\u00a0harm when ingested as a vitamin or is used as skin treatment, but that research suggests if\u00a0inhaled \"it may interfere with normal lung functioning.\" Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner until April, told CNBC on Friday\u00a0White House hesitation on the banning issue was likely due to fears of political blow back. \u201cI think they were spooked by the politics of this and the push back,\u201d said Gottlieb, a physician and\u00a0health advocate. He added that he thinks the White House is \"legitimately concerned about shutting down these small mom and pop shops and these adult vape stores.\u201d The Vapor Technology Association, a trade group, says a report prepared for it by economist John Dunham & Associates\u00a0found a ban on flavor products would eliminate more than 150,000 jobs, force most of the country's 13,480 independent retail stores to close and cost\u00a0$8.4 billion in lost sales. Meanwhile, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee passed a measure this month that would raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21, prohibit all flavored tobacco products and, in a bid to stop mail purchases,\u00a0direct the FDA\u00a0to issue a ban on all cigarettes and e-cigarettes sales not sold in person.",

      "content": "Sponsored by AMERIND Risk WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 More than a dozen witnesses have been called before a trio of House committees and questioned for hours about President Donald Trump and\u00a0Ukraine. The witnesses include diplomats and White House officials with knowledge of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\u00a0Each has provided new details\u00a0as\u00a0part of the quickly moving impeachment inquiry examining whether Trump abused his power as president in asking Ukraine to investigate political foes while dangling military aid for the country and a White House meeting. Their testimonies combined span about 100 hours. Almost a dozen of these witnesses have also appeared publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Here are the 17\u00a0witnesses who have been interviewed\u00a0behind closed doors by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees or later testified publicly, why they matter in the impeachment saga and what we know about their testimony. Why he matters: A\u00a0career State Department official, Volker worked with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and various White House officials to set up Trump's phone call July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a potential White House visit. This happened\u00a0as military aid for the country was on\u00a0pause. What he told lawmakers:Volker said he never saw anything that made him believe there was a quid pro quo\u00a0with Ukraine and said he felt coordinating with Giuliani could change Trump from his negative feelings about Ukraine. His testimony made clear the influence Giuliani had over policy, including Giuliani dictating\u00a0a statement to Volker that he wanted the Ukrainians to issue on corruption. In his public testimony Nov. 19, Volker told lawmakers he was not aware of or knowingly took part in any efforts to pressure Kyiv to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0At the time, he told lawmakers,\u00a0he did not realize investigations into the Bidens and into Burisma had been conflated. Why she matters: A career diplomat, Yovanovitch was forced out of her role. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Yovanovitch was confused by her ouster and the comments made by conservatives and\u00a0Trump, who called her \"bad news.\"\u00a0She said she\u00a0raised concerns about the shadow campaign pushed by Giuliani and how it ran counter to U.S. policy. In her Nov. 15\u00a0public hearing, Yovanovitchhow she felt after being ousted as ambassador amid the \"smear\" campaign against her. When asked how it felt to be told to leave Ukraine as quickly as possible, she said it felt \u201cterrible, honestly. After 33 years of service to our country it was terrible. It's not the way I wanted my career to end.\u201d Why she matters: Hill worked for years on the National Intelligence Council and as Trump's senior adviser on the Kremlin and Europe. She held a key role in U.S. policy in Ukraine and was part of several meetings where she expressed concerns over the shadow policy led by Giuliani and White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Hill told lawmakers\u00a0national security adviser John Bolton likened\u00a0the policy in Ukraine to a \"drug deal\" and called Giuliani a \"hand grenade\" who was going to blow everyone up, according to The New York Times and NBC News. In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Hill slammed the \"fictional narrative\" of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans\u00a0have argued Ukraine colluded with Democrats to hurt Trump in the election. Why he matters:\u00a0Kent serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department. What he told lawmakers: Kent told\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0he raised red flags about Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden more than six months ago. In his public testimony, Kent said\u00a0the Ukrainian oligarch owner of gas company Burisma should be investigated over allegations of paying a bribe to kill a probe into the company. Why he matters: McKinley boasted a career that spanned decades at the State Department and resigned just before his testimony\u00a0because of low morale at the department and because he said\u00a0Pompeo did not stick up for career employees, such as\u00a0Yovanovitch. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0McKinley didn't oversee issues related to Ukraine, so his testimony did not deal with the core allegations against Trump. He outlined his concerns about the ouster of\u00a0Yovanovitch\u00a0and said he was troubled that the State Department did not have her back and that she\u00a0and the department\u00a0were\u00a0being politicized. Why he matters: A\u00a0businessman and major Trump donor, Sondland\u00a0was in communication with the president and Giuliani and attempted\u00a0to get Ukrainians to investigate several\u00a0political matters, according to witnesses. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Sondland amended his original testimony and told lawmakers he communicated a quid pro quo to a Ukrainian\u00a0official, linking military aid for Ukraine\u00a0to a public statement committing to investigations Trump and Giuliani wanted. In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Sondland gave more details not previously included in his closed-door interview, telling lawmakers that \"everyone was in the loop\" on the pressure campaign \u2013 including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence. Why he matters: Taylor\u00a0voiced concerns about conditioning military aid and a\u00a0White House meeting on political investigations. What he told lawmakers: Taylor directly tied Trump and his allies with a quid pro quo. He said Trump made the order to pause military aid for Ukraine, and it was his \"clear understanding\" that \"security assistance money would not come until the (Ukrainian)\u00a0president committed to pursue the investigation,\" according to a transcript of his testimony. In his public hearing, Taylor gave new testimony saying one of his aides overheard a call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations,\" which caused Trump to deny the conversation. Oct. 23: Defense official Laura Cooper Why she matters:\u00a0Cooper serves as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine\u00a0and Eurasia. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0Behind closed doors, Cooper gave lawmakers further details about the\u00a0withholding of aid. In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Cooper provided new details about emails from the Ukrainians showing they had concerns about security assistance on July 25\u00a0\u2013 the day of Trump's infamous call with Zelensky. Why he matters:\u00a0Reeker serves as the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0According to The Wall Street Journal, he discussed with lawmakers failed efforts to help\u00a0Yovanovitch. Why he matters: Vindman is one of several officials who listened to Trump's phone call with\u00a0Zelensky on July 25. He served as the White House's top Ukraine expert. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Vindman said in prepared remarks\u00a0he twice reported concerns to superiors that the president and those\u00a0working for him linked\u00a0foreign aid to Ukraine with political\u00a0investigations. He said he worried the efforts undermined\u00a0U.S. national security. In his public testimony on Nov. 20, Vindman said he reported his concerns about a July 10 meeting between Sondland and Ukrainian officials, as well as Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, out of a sense of duty. \"I was concerned by the call,\"\u00a0Vindman said. \"What I heard was inappropriate.\" Why she matters: Croft worked for Volker at the State Department and has expertise on Ukrainian issues. She focused on arms sales and security assistance for the country as it fended off Russia. What she told lawmakers:\u00a0According to a copy of her opening statement, Croft told lawmakers\u00a0she received calls from a lobbyist trying to oust Yovanovitch. She said she learned that aid was put on hold stemming from an order from the president. Why he matters:\u00a0Anderson worked for Volker at the State Department and was present for at least one\u00a0meeting\u00a0where political investigations were discussed. What he told lawmakers: In his opening statement, Anderson said\u00a0 Giuliani's efforts were discussed at a Ukraine strategy meeting over the summer. At that meeting, Bolton said Giuliani's efforts \"could be an obstacle.\" Anderson said he believed it was important to not request specific investigations from the Ukrainians. Why he matters: Morrison is the top Russia and European adviser to Trump's National Security Council and was cited by multiple witnesses in conversations about a quid pro quo. He is a political appointee and not a career official. What he told lawmakers: Morrison confirmed testimony given by Taylor that outlined a quid pro quo, basically halting aid until Ukraine committed to investigations. Morrison testified that he didn't believe Trump's call July 25 was illegal. In his Nov. 19 public testimony, Morrison said\u00a0fellow NSC staffer Fiona Hill warned him of the \u201cGordon problem\u201d regarding\u00a0Sondland\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. Why he matters: Hale is the third highest-ranking official at the State Department. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Hale told lawmakers about the political considerations in dismissing Yovanovitch\u00a0and how those decisions affected military aid for Ukraine. In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Hale said the State Department's decision not to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch\u00a0could only be made by someone\u00a0\"more senior to me. The Secretary most likely would have been the person.\" Why she matters: A\u00a0foreign policy aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Williams was one of a handful of officials who listened to Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. What she told lawmakers: In her closed-door interview, Williams told lawmakers and staff\u00a0it was \u201cfolly\u201d to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was \u201cunusual.\u201d In her Nov. 19 public testimony, Williams said she found Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call \u201cunusual\u201d because of the discussion of \u201ca domestic political matter.\u201d Why he matters: In his public testimony, Taylor told lawmakers about a call one of his aides, later identified to be Holmes, overheard between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations.\" What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Holmes confirmed he overheard the call and that he \"heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\" In his Nov. 21 public testimony, Holmes said U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine\u00a0\"became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted\" by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and a \"cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\" Why he matters:\u00a0Sandy a White House official in the Office of Management and Budget, is the first OMB official to testify in the inquiry. What he told lawmakers:\u00a0Documents presented during the deposition of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper showed\u00a0that Sandy signed one of the \"apportionment\" letters in July 2019 halting security assistance to Ukraine. Democrats allege Trump tied the aid and a White House meeting to requests for investigations that benefited him politically.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Gordon Sondland was President Donald Trump\u2019s go-to guy\u00a0on Ukraine. On Wednesday, he\u00a0became the House Democrats\u2019 most consequential impeachment witness \u2013 providing dramatic testimony of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d and implicating top White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \"Everyone was in the loop,\" Sondland,\u00a0Trump's ambassador to the European Union,\u00a0declared in his opening remarks before the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment probe. Sondland said he worked with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, at \"the express direction of the president\" to pressure Ukrainian officials to open two politically motivated investigations. Multiple witnesses have testified that Trump wanted Ukraine's president,\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky, to announce two investigations:\u00a0one into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in\u00a0the 2016 presidential election\u00a0and a second\u00a0involving former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0and his son\u00a0Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma. \"Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president,\" Sondland, a\u00a0wealthy hotelier who snagged the plum EU ambassadorship after donating\u00a0$1 million\u00a0to the president's inaugural committee,\u00a0said Wednesday. \"So we followed the president\u2019s orders.\" Read the full text:Gordon Sondland's opening statement in impeachment hearing Sondland said the Ukraine effort\u00a0was not a rogue shadow foreign policy operation, as other witnesses portrayed it,\u00a0but rather authorized and supported at the highest levels inside the Trump administration. \"We kept the leadership of the State Department and the NSC (National Security Council) informed of our activities,\" Sondland said. That leadership, he said, included Pompeo;\u00a0his top State Department attorney, Ulrich Brechbuhl; and his executive secretary Lisa Kenna, as well as John Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser. \"They knew what we were doing and why,\" the EU ambassador said. Sondland's testimony marked the most dramatic moment yet in the unfolding impeachment proceedings. A longtime Republican donor,\u00a0Sondland was seen as a Trump loyalist \u2013 someone with direct access to the president and a diplomat who operated outside the State Department's cadre of career professionals. Trump and GOP lawmakers have derided other State Department witnesses as \"never Trumpers\"\u00a0hostile to the president's unconventional approach\u00a0foreign policy. They could not say that about Sondland, who said he has talked to Trump about 20 times since he became ambassador in June 2018. \"This is a seminal moment in our investigation,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman\u00a0of the Intelligence Committee, said after Sondland's testimony concluded. Even before Sondland wrapped up, Schiff said the diplomat's account\u00a0\u201cgoes right to the heart of the issue of bribery, as well as other potential high crimes or misdemeanors.\u201d Sondland said there was a clear \"quid pro quo\" in Giuliani's demands, which he said came from Trump: Zelensky would have to announce the investigation into Joe Biden, one of Trump's political rivals, as well as the probe\u00a0into alleged Ukrainian election meddling. In exchange, Zelensky would get a coveted meeting with Trump at the White House. Sondland also said he came to understand that U.S. military aid to Ukraine, needed to help the budding democracy counter Russian aggression, was probably being held up as leverage over Zelensky. Under Republican questioning, Sondland said neither Trump nor Giuliani ever made that direct link to him. Sondland's testimony threw official Washington into a frenzy, with Pence, Pompeo and others issuing carefully worded rebuttals. During a news conference in Brussels, Pompeo initially said he couldn't comment on Sondland's account because he hadn't had time to watch Wednesday's hearing. \"I was in meetings all day and haven\u2019t had a chance to see any of that testimony,\" Pompeo told reporters after attending NATO meetings and other events in Belgium. Several hours later, the State Department's spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, issued a statement disputing Sondland's testimony. \"Gordon Sondland never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents,\" Ortagus said. \"Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false.\u201d Sarah Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Bolton, said he had \u201cno comment\u201d on Sondland\u2019s testimony. Was it a bribe?\u00a0Democrats trade 'quid pro quo' for 'bribery' in Trump impeachment messaging White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said \"no quid pro quo ever occurred\" connecting the Ukraine security aid to the opening of investigations. \u201cDemocrats keep chasing ghosts,\u201d she concluded. Sondland said he was deeply concerned that the U.S. military aid was being used as leverage to pressure Zelensky because there was no other \"credible explanation\" for the White House's refusal to release the nearly $400 million in funds. \"In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded,\" Sondland said. Sondland said\u00a0Pompeo was approved those connections. He produced an Aug. 22 email to Pompeo\u00a0asking whether he should try to schedule a brief face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Poland\u00a0to help break \"the logjam,\" referring\u00a0to the frozen military aid.\u00a0At the time of the email, Trump was scheduled to travel to Warsaw \u2013 a trip that was later cancelled. \"Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for Potus to meet Zelensky?\" Sondland wrote in the email to Pompeo, using the common abbreviation for president of the United States. \"I would ask Zelensky to look him\u00a0(Trump) in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine\u2019s new justice folks are in place (mid-Sept)\u00a0Ze(lensky) should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and to the US. Hopefully, that will break the logjam.\" Secretary Pompeo responded three minutes later: \u201cYes.\u201d \"Even as late as Sept.\u00a024, Secretary Pompeo was directing Kurt Volker (Trump's special envoy for\u00a0Ukraine) to speak with Rudy Giuliani,\" Sondland recounted. \"In a WhatsApp message, Kurt Volker told me in part,\u00a0'Spoke w Rudy per guidance from S.'\" Sondland noted that \"S\"\u00a0is shorthand for secretary of state. Sondland said he directly raised concerns about\u00a0the Ukraine pressure campaign with Pence during a meeting in Poland, where the vice president was standing in for Trump. \u201cI mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,\u201d Sondland told lawmakers. He said that conversation occurred Sept. 1\u00a0before a meeting between Pence and Zelensky. Pence did not respond orally but nodded his head, Sondland recounted. \u201cI was in a briefing with several people, and I just spoke up and I said it appears that everything is stalled until this statement gets made. ... And the vice president nodded, like you know, he heard what I said, and that was pretty much it, as I recall,\u201d\u00a0Sondland said. Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, said no such conversation occurred. \u201cThe Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,\" Short said in a statement released Wednesday. \u201cAmbassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland.\u00a0This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened,\" Short said. Short noted that other witnesses have testified under oath that Pence never raised Joe Biden, his son Hunter\u00a0or\u00a0Burisma, the\u00a0Ukrainian energy company that Hunter Biden worked for when his father was vice president. Republican lawmakers tried to undercut Sondland's credibility, pointing out that, unlike other witnesses, Sondland\u00a0did not take notes of his conversations with Trump and other players. And Sondland's testimony has shifted; in his private deposition last month, Sondland evaded a direct answer when asked about a \"quid pro quo\" but testified that Trump had told him there was not one. He later amended that, saying that the accounts of other witnesses had refreshed his memory. \"You don't have records, you don't have your notes because you didn't take notes, you don't have a lot of recollections,\" said Steve Castor, the Republican committee's staff attorney who led much of the questioning. \"I\u00a0mean, this is like the trifecta of unreliability, isn't that true?\" Sondland said he was trying to be \"as forthcoming as possible.\" In his opening statement, Sondland told the panel that the State Department had blocked him from getting access to documents that would help\u00a0him give the committee a fuller account of his Ukraine dealings. \"My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials,\" but those requests have been stymied, he said. As part of Sondland's\u00a0testimony, he produced emails he sent to Pompeo and other top Trump administration officials, showing that he communicated with them regularly about his Ukraine efforts. Pence is not among the recipients. A July 19 email from Sondland to Pompeo, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u00a0and other officials started with the subject line\u00a0\u201cRe: I Talked to Zelensky just now\" and said Zelensky was ready to receive a call from Trump. \u201cHe is prepared to receive POTUS' call. Will assure him [Trump] that he [Zelensky] intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone,\u2019\u201d Sondland wrote. Impeachment witnesses:Who are the 17 witnesses and what have they said? Perry and Mulvaney responded to Sondland\u2019s email. On Aug. 11, Sondland sent an email to State Department officials and addressed to Pompeo: \u201cMike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky\u00a0to be delivered for our review in a day or two,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cThe contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Ze[lensky]\u00a0plans to have a big presser on the openness subject (including specifics) next week.\u201d Sondland said \"boss\" referred to Trump.\u00a0Kenna responded that she would pass the note to Pompeo. \"The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false,\" Sondland said. \"Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.\" Contributing: Nicholas Wu Stay informed:Keep up with USA TODAY's impeachment coverage AMERIND Risk provides peace of mind with our comprehensive suite of coverage products.

      "author": "",
      "content": "ALBANY \u2013 A state judge has ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million to charity to settle a lawsuit accusing him and his family of illegally mismanaging his charitable foundation. State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla of Manhattan issued her decision Thursday, faulting Trump for allowing his 2016 presidential campaign to orchestrate a televised fundraiser in Des Moines for the Trump Foundation, which then distributed $2.8 million to veterans charities that were also chosen by the campaign. Trump and then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood reached a deal last year that saw the Trump family agree to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its remaining $1.8 million in assets to a variety of charities, including the Army Relief Fund and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. But the two sides couldn't reach consensus on penalties for the Iowa fundraiser, leaving it up to Scarpulla to order Trump to pay an additional $2 million to the same charities. \"Mr. Trump\u2019s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign,\" Scarpulla wrote in her decision Thursday. Trump blasted the decision in a lengthy statement posted Thursday on Twitter, calling the litigation \"politically motivated harassment.\" \"All they found was incredibly effective philanthropy and some small technical violations,\" Trump said. In a statement, Trump attorney Alan Futerfas said the Trump Foundation was pleased with the decision. Underwood, a Democrat, first filed a lawsuit\u00a0against Trump, his three eldest children and the Trump Foundation \u2014 which was registered in New York \u2014 in June 2018. The lawsuit accused the Trump family of a wide variety of mismanagement, including using the charity to advance his self interests and boost his successful 2016 presidential campaign. A large part of the suit focused on the Iowa fundraiser, which Trump held as counter-programming to a Republican presidential debate he chose to skip. Trump's campaign staff organized the event\u00a0and\u00a0directed where the funds went. When Trump issued enlarged checks to the veterans organizations, they had his \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan on the bottom. New York law prohibits charities from participating in political events. The lawsuit also accused the Trump Foundation board of being largely nonexistent, failing to hold a meeting since 1999 and allowing Trump himself to determine when and where contributions were made. Several times, the foundation paid six-figure sums to other foundations to settle legal issues at Mar-a-Lago and Trump's other clubs in violation of state and federal law. The two sides reached an agreement in December to settle many of the lawsuits claims, in large part by agreeing to dissolve the Trump Foundation, despite Trump previously vowing he wouldn't settle the case. After further negotiation, the state and Trump\u00a0agreed to allow Scarpulla to decide the remaining issues surrounding the Iowa fundraiser. The Attorney General's Office, now led by Attorney General Letitia James, had been pushing for Trump to pay an additional $2.8 million to settle the Iowa claims and more for punitive damages. But Scarpulla declined to award the full amount, instead ordering Trump to pay $2 million because the money raised from the Iowa fundraiser did ultimately go to veterans charities. The money will go to eight different charities:\u00a0Army Emergency Relief, Children\u2019s Aid Society,\u00a0City Meals-on-Wheels,\u00a0Give an Hour,\u00a0Martha\u2019s Table,\u00a0United Negro College Fund,\u00a0United Way of Capital Area\u00a0and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, according to the settlement. In his statement, Trump's attorney criticized the lawsuit as being \"politically motivated\" and praised Scarpulla for rejecting the Attorney General's push for additional damages. \"We are pleased that the Court, in rejecting the Attorney General\u2019s frivolous request for statutory penalties, interest and other damages, recognized that every penny ever raised by the Trump Foundation has gone to help those most in need,\" Futerfas said. \"Now that this matter is concluded, the Trump Foundation is proud to make this additional contribution.\" James said the judge's decision and her office's lawsuit show \"no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.\u201d \u201cThe court\u2019s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain,\" James wrote.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00a0testified\u00a0on Capitol Hill\u00a0that\u00a0President Donald Trump directed him and others to work with his personal lawyer\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0to pressure Ukraine to make a statement about investigations the president sought. Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, confirmed the existence of a\u00a0\"quid pro quo\"\u00a0in which Ukraine was urged to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, one of the president's political rivals,\u00a0in exchange for military aid the country desperately wanted and a White House meeting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Follow along:Impeachment hearing: Sondland says Giuliani sought Ukraine 'quid pro quo' at Trump's behest \"Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians. Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us,\" Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee. \"We all understood that these prerequisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected President Trump\u2019s desires and requirements.\" Here are highlights\u00a0from the impeachment inquiry's fourth day of public hearings: Sondland, who had firsthand knowledge of high-level discussions with Ukraine, dispelled a perception that some U.S. officials had that there were two tracks to the diplomatic efforts: a \"regular\" channel and an \"irregular\" one pursued by Giuliani. Several diplomats testified that they were focused on goals such as helping Ukraine fight corruption and that they tried to stave off what they saw as\u00a0shadow diplomacy efforts\u00a0by Giuliani centered on pushing for investigations of Joe Biden, his son Hunter and Burisma, the energy company that Hunter worked for in Ukraine. In fact, the ambassador testified, Giuliani was the pivotal player driving the Ukraine policy\u00a0because that's what Trump wanted. \"Rudy was the guy,\" Sondland said, adding that Trump left no doubt about the central role he wanted his lawyer to play. \"It wasn't an order. It was 'if you want to work on this,\u00a0this is the guy you've got to\u00a0talk to,' \" Sondland testified. Sondland said he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and special envoy Kurt Volker worked with Giuliani at the \"express direction\" of Trump. \"It\u00a0became very clear to all three of us\u00a0that if we wanted to move the (U.S.-Ukrainian) relationship forward, President Trump was not really interested in engaging, he wanted Rudy to handle it,\" the ambassador said. The same day as the call between Trump and Zelensky, there were emails from the State Department saying both Congress and the Ukrainians were asking about security assistance. \u201cMy staff showed me two unclassified emails that they received from the State Department. One was received on July 25th at 2:31 pm. That email said that the Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking about security assistance,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe second one was received on July 25th at 4:25 pm. That email said that the Hill knows about the FMF [Foreign Military Financing] situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy.\" She did not know, however, what specifically the Ukrainians asked about in their July messages, and she said she was not informed of the July 25 emails at the time. Republicans have said the Ukrainians did not know about the hold on security assistance at the time of the call, which happened on the morning of July 25. Sondland drew a direct line from the president through Giuliani to the diplomats who worked with Ukraine. \"Mr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,\" he told lawmakers. \"Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations. \u2026 Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president.\" The statement from Sondland, a former GOP donor-turned-ambassador\u00a0who dealt directly with Trump, is the strongest statement to date from a Trump insider linking the president to the controversy. Sondland said many top officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,\u00a0understood the president's desire for a quid pro quo. Sondland testified that on Sept. 1, he mentioned his concerns to Pence, and he submitted to lawmakers\u00a0emails he had written to Pompeo and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney about the issue. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said. Before Pence met with Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland, on Sept. 1, Sondland said, he mentioned to the vice president his concerns \u201cthat the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.\u201d Sondland told lawmakers Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Pence who told the Ukrainian president he would speak to Trump about it. Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, denied the conversation Sondland said he had with Pence. \u201cThe Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,\" Short said in a statement. Sondland said Giuliani was a central player on Ukraine policy, but Sondland\u00a0made it clear he and other administration officials, including Perry and Volker, were reluctant to deal with him. \"We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani,\" Sondland testified. \"Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very\u00a0important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president\u2019s orders.\" Sondland said he viewed Giuliani's role as \"improper\" because it seemed to undermine regular U.S. diplomatic channels, a criticism other State Department officials\u00a0expressed. \"Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong.\" the ambassador said. Sondland, who said he likes Trump, turned out to be a surprise star witness for the Democrats. A deep-pocketed GOP donor who gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, the ambassador is a political ally of the president\u00a0\u2013 which made the admission of a quid pro quo that much more startling. Trump added Ukraine (which is not a member of the European Union) to Sondland's diplomatic portfolio. Sondland testified he has spoken about 20 times to the president since he became ambassador in June 2018. According to Sondland, he and Trump \u201care not close friends\u201d but \u201chave a professional, cordial working relationship.\u201d Last month, Trump tweeted that Sondland was \u201ca really good man and great American.\u201d Wednesday, after Sondland\u00a0acknowledged the quid pro quo with Ukraine, Trump said he wasn't close to the ambassador he nominated. \"I don\u2019t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much,\" Trump said. Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": "WASHINGTON - Testimony has concluded for the day and will resume on Thursday. What's next: Two other witnesses will testify this week: After the hearing, Republicans cast aside the new information offered by Cooper, dismissing it as \u201csome email from some staffer.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed out that the email Cooper said her staff got from an official at the Ukrainian embassy on July 25 \u2013 the same day that Trump has his infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u2013 did not include any mention of Ukrainians worried about a hold on military aid, only questioning the status of assistance. Asked about the specific timing of the email and that it was the same day as Trump spoke with Zelensky, Jordan said \u201cI find it interesting. At the same time, I don't find it significant.\u201d - Nicholas Wu and Christal Hayes House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, ended Wednesday's marathon hearings with a moment of levity after top Republican Devin Nunes mocked him in his closing remarks. Nunes concluded by saying he was handing over to Schiff for \"story-time hour.\" \"I thank the gentleman as always for his remarks,\" Schiff said before the audience broke out into laughter. But the top Democrat used the remaining minutes to\u00a0reflect on what he said is the difference between corruption and anti-corruption. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to believe that Donald Trump is a great corruption fighter...let\u2019s look at his words and deeds,\" he said. Removing former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and\u00a0allegedly tying U.S. security assistance to Trump's request for an investigation into the Bidens \"is not anti-corruption. That is corruption,\" he said. Schiff then closed out the hearing by recalling what he said was a telling moment in Kurt Volker's testimony on Tuesday, in which the former special envoy to Ukraine recalled cautioning top Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak against investigating the country's previous president. \"You mean the type of investigations you're pushing for us to do on Biden and Clinton?\" Yermak said, according to Volker. Schiff\u00a0pointed out that's not corruption or anti-corruption, but hypocrisy. \"When they see a president of the United States who is not devoted to the rule of law, who is not devoted to anti-corruption, but instead demonstrates in word and deed, corruption, they are forced to ask themselves, what does America stand for anymore?\" - Courtney Subramanian Following the conclusion of Cooper and Hale\u2019s testimony, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee declined to take up an attempt by Republicans to compel witnesses like the whistleblower and Hunter Biden to testify. \u201cI do not concur in these requests for subpoenas,\u201d Schiff said, adding that the committee would not attempt to investigate the whistleblower or debunked conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. The members voted to table the motions along party lines. Hale: Yovanovitch was an 'exceptional officer doing exceptional work' Rep. Denny Heck, D- Wash., allowed Hale to have the floor and set the record straight on Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to the Ukraine who was ousted after a smear campaign. In a lengthy statement, Heck outlined the smear campaign and said he was allowing Hale \u201cthe opportunity to demonstrate leadership.\u201d \u201cAmbassador Hale, I want to give you an opportunity to now do what Secretary Pompeo did not do,\u201d Heck said. \u201cI\u2019m offering you the opportunity to reaffirm to this committee and the millions of Americans hopefully who are watching, that Marie Yovanovitch is a dedicated and courageous patriot and that she served with grace and dig even in the face of that orchestrated and unsubstantiated smear attack against her.\u201d Over several minutes, Hale offered praise for Yovanovitch, saying he only met her when he took this job and knew \u201cimmediately\u201d that she was an \u201cexceptional officer doing exceptional work\u201d in a critical area. He said he supports the institutional officers working at the State Department and said they consist of the \u201cbest groups of diplomats in the world.\u201d Hale noted he wished that Yovanovitch could have stayed in her post. - Nicholas Wu Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., went through particular arguments Republicans have lodged in defending the president, using holds on aid in other countries and that Ukraine did not know about a hold on money when the president made a request for investigations in his July 25 call with Zelensky. Swalwell outlined how a hold on military aid\u00a0on Lebanon was different, something Hale said was legitimate due to concerns in the country. He ended his questioning with noting how Cooper\u2019s testimony about emails from Ukrainians that showed there was concern in July over military aid, including a July 25 email where a Ukrainian embassy official asked what was going on with military assistance. The emails raise questions over whether Ukrainians knew about a hold on $400 million in aid before a key phone call between Trump and Zelensky, which also happened on July 25. \u201cMs. Cooper. Your testimony today demonstrates the power of coming forward and defying lawless orders from the president,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cBecause you came forward and testified, we learned this new information, which destroys a central defense that the Republicans have put forward.\u201d - Christal Hayes Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper gave information about additional relevant emails to lawmakers regarding\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s concerns about security assistance, an addition to her previous closed-door testimony. The same day as the call between Trump and Zelensky, there were emails from the State Department saying both Congress and the Ukrainians were asking about security assistance. \u201cMy staff showed me two unclassified emails that they received from the State Department. One was received on July 25th at 2:31 pm. That email said that the Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking about security assistance,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe second one was received on July 25th at 4:25 pm. That email said that the Hill knows about the FMF [Foreign Military Financing] situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy.\" She did not know, however, what specifically the Ukrainians asked about in their July messages, and she said she was not informed of the July 25 emails at the time. Republicans have said the Ukrainians did not know about the hold on security assistance at the time of the call, which happened on the morning of July 25. Cooper did not discuss the hold on aid with President Donald Trump. \"I have never discussed this or any other matter with the President, and never heard directly from him about this matter,\" she said. - Nicholas Wu Democrats have outlined before Americans throughout the public hearings, with Cooper providing insight on the freeze on Ukraine military aid and Hale witnessing the smear campaign against former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. \u201cHale pushed to get the State Department to put out a robust full-page statement of defense and praise for Ambassador Yovanovitch, sadly to no avail,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat silence continues today.\u201d Nunes used his time at the start of the hearing to depict the inquiry as partisan and unfair, listing the witnesses who they would like to have testify before the committee. \u201cThis is impeachment in search of a crime,\u201d Nunes said. Cooper and Hale arrive for the second impeachment inquiry\u00a0hearing Defense Department official Laura Cooper and State Department official David Hale arrived on Capitol Hill for the second hearing today in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Cooper, who oversees Ukraine policy at the Pentagon, previously testified behind closed doors about the withholding of security assistance to Ukraine. Hale, a senior State Department official, told lawmakers and staff behind closed doors about the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The evening hearing is likely to be shorter than this morning\u2019s lengthy hearing with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. - Nicholas Wu Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, said Democrats continued to change what they sought in their investigation. The hearing failed to answer fundamental questions such as who was the whistleblower, Nunes said. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sondland provided crucial information. \u201cThis is a seminal moment in our investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe evidence you have brought forward is deeply significant and troubling.\u201d - Bart Jansen Stay updated:Follow USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., walked Sondland through a series of questions about his July 26 call with Trump about Ukraine investigations, with the ultimate question about who would benefit from the investigation of the president\u2019s political opponents. Sondland said he preferred not to characterize who would benefit. Sondland also parried by saying he didn\u2019t realize at the time that investigations of Burisma Holdings meant an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Ultimately, he surrendered. \u201cI assume President Trump,\u201d Sondland said, to applause in the audience. After a pause, Sondland added: \u201cI\u2019ve been very forthright. I really resent what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Maloney thanked him for being forthright, but said it took three tries to get there. Sondland gave a closed-door deposition and then modified it before the transcript was released, before his testimony Wednesday. \u201cWe appreciate your candor,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be really clear about what it took to get it out of you.\u201d - Bart Jansen Sondland said he had talked with the president many times in response to a question from Rep. Jackie Speier about the number of times he had talked with the president. \u201cIt's probably in that range,\" he told Speier when she asked if the number of conversations he had with the president was \"less than 20.\" Earlier today, Trump said he did not know Sondland well. \"I don\u2019t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much,\" Trump told reporters. According to Sondland, he and Trump \u201care not close friends\u201d but \u201chave a professional, cordial working relationship.\u201d When asked if Trump knew who Sondland\u00a0was, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d - Nicholas Wu Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., asked about retaliation against a whistleblower who files a complaint, when she was interrupted by Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, asking if she would respond to a question. She refused to yield because she had only three minutes for questions. Conaway said the article based on her allegation got three Pinocchios, a measure of accuracy used by The Washington Post. \u201cThe president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let\u2019s not go there,\u201d Speier said to sustained applause in the audience. - Bart Jansen Sondland said he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker worked with \"Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States.\" \"We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani, \" he said. \"Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the President\u2019s orders.\" \"We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the President directed us to do so,\" he said again. The testimony from Sondland, a wealthy Portland, Oregon, hotelier and Trump donor,\u00a0is being closely watched because of his ability to offer a first hand account of his discussions with Trump on Ukraine. Sondland described raising worries\u00a0about a \"quid pro quo\" with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., a close Trump ally who served on a congressional task force on Ukraine. \"I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson,\" Sondland said, adding that he also raised concerns with Ukrainian officials. Sondland said he became aware in July and August that the White House suspended security aid, a move he opposed. He said he wasn\u2019t told why the aid was held up, but that he understood it\u2019s release would depend on Ukraine beginning investigations. \u201cI was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid, as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cI tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.\u201d Trump has attempted to put distance between himself and Sondland, telling reporters on Nov. 8, \"I hardly know the gentleman.\" -- Bart Jansen, William Cummings, Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu Sondland's opening statement:Read the full text of his opening statement in the impeachment hearing Witness testimonies:Who are the 17 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said? President Donald Trump zeroed in Wednesday on one portion of the bombshell impeachment testimony on Capitol Hill: Gordon Sondland's\u00a0testimony that the president did not directly tie Ukraine aid to investigations into his rival. Reading from hand-written notes on the South Lawn of the White House as he departed for Texas, Trump focused on the portion of Sondland\u2019s testimony in which he says the president told him there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine. \"That means it\u2019s all over,\" Trump told reporters. \"This is the final word from the president of the United States. I want nothing.\" Trump then walked off to Marine One without taking questions.\u00a0He ignored other, more damaging testimony, such as Sondland's understanding that a large number of officials understood that Ukraine would not receive nearly\u00a0$400 million in military aid until Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky announced his government would cooperate with the investigations. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, reinforced that Trump said, \u201cI want nothing\u201d and \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d in a Sept. 9 call with Sondland. \u201cAnything sinister or nefarious about any of that?\u201d Ratcliffe asked, which Sondland denied. \u201cThat is the truth, as you have presented it, correct. None of that is hearsay. None of that is speculation. That is direct evidence.\u201d - John Fritze The president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani defended himself against Sondland's allegations, in which the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. said Trump directed Giuliani to push for a quid pro quo in Ukraine on his behalf. \"I came into this at Volker\u2019s request. Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact. I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker,\" Giuliani tweeted, referring to Kurt Volker, a former envoy to Ukraine who testified on Tuesday. \"Volker testified I answered their questions and described them as my opinions, NOT demands. I.E., no quid pro quo!\" Giuliani said. Volker testified that he never considered Giuliani to be speaking on behalf of the president. During his closed-door deposition, Sondland testified that he did not recall meeting Giuliani in person during his time as ambassador. He said he \"only spoke with him a few times\" and Volker had introduced him electronically. He said he\u00a0believes he spoke to Giuliani no more than two or three times by phone, with the first time in early August of 2019. Under Republican questioning, Sondland said Trump never ordered him to work with Giuliani, but that if he and other U.S. officials such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and\u00a0Volker wanted to improve the relationship with Ukraine, Giuliani was key. \u201cRudy was the guy,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an order. It was if you want to work on this, this is the guy you gotta talk to.\u201d In a tweet, Giulani accused House Republican lawyer Steve Castor of \u201cpicking up Democrat lies\u201d by asking Sondland why he trusted Giuliani \u201cgiven his business dealings in the region.\u201d \u201cI have NO financial interests in Ukraine, NONE! I would appreciate his apology,\u201d Giuliani wrote. - Courtney Subramanian and Bart Jansen Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said Sondland testified that Trump never told him that military aid depended on an announcement of investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election. Sondland said it was his presumption that aid was tied to the investigations. \u201cNo one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to the investigations. Yes or no?\u201d Turner said. \u201cYes,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cYou really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations,\u201d Turner said. Sondland said he was presuming. Turner said the evidence wasn\u2019t even hearsay, it was made up. \u201cMade up testimony is when I just presume it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cYou\u2019re just assuming all of these things.\u201d - Bart Jansen Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said Sondland\u2019s credibility was an issue because he said he presumed that the administration was withholding military aid from Ukraine on condition of investigations, rather than being told that directly by President Donald Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem, when you\u2019re using words like speculation, presumption, guessing,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cYou have additional information that I think would be helpful for these questions and answers.\u201d Republicans have noted that Mark Sandy, an official from the Office of Management and Budget, gave a closed-door deposition on Saturday to three committees investigating Ukraine, but that the transcript hasn\u2019t been released yet. Zeldin said Sandy explained why the aid was withheld. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sandy was reviewing his transcript Wednesday before it is released. Sandy\u00a0is not a top official at the Office of Management and Budget responsible for the release of foreign aid, Schiff said. The acting OMB director and deputy director each defied subpoenas for their testimony. - Bart Jansen Rick Perry\u2019s office says Sondland misrepresented his contacts with Giuliani. The office of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Sondland \u201cmisrepresented both Secretary Perry's interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump.\u201d According to Perry\u2019s office, Perry only spoke to Giuliani once, at Trump\u2019s request. \u201cAt no point before, during or after that phone call did the words 'Biden' or 'Burisma' ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry,\u201d said DOE press secretary Shaylyn Hynes. - Nicholas Wu Sondland disputed the description by other diplomats that he and others were running an irregular channel of diplomacy with Ukraine because he was dealing directly with President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former National Security Adviser John Bolton. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how someone can characterize something as an irregular channel when you\u2019re counting the president of the United States, the secretary of State, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, secretary of Energy,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s irregular. A bunch of folks that are not in that channel are aggrieved for some reason for not being included. I don\u2019t know how they can consider us being the irregular channel, and they\u00a0being the regular channel, when it\u2019s the leadership making the decisions.\u201d The others never complained to him, Sondland said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone sounding any alarm,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s hair was on fire, but nobody decided to talk to us.\u201d - Bart Jansen Sondland said he was surprised to hear other U.S. officials were upset about a July 10 meeting at the White House where he discussed investigations with Ukraine officials\u00a0as a condition of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Other witnesses, including Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, have testified that former National Security Adviser John Bolton abruptly ended the meeting when investigations were mentioned. Hill said Bolton told her to report the incident to council lawyers and that he wasn\u2019t part of whatever\u00a0\u201cdrug deal\u201d that Sondland and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were \"cooking up.\" Under Republican questioning, Sondland said he was surprised to hear the complaints because he thought the meeting ended well, with pictures on the White House lawn on a sunny day. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Sondland said. - Bart Jansen Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, highlighted Trump\u2019s reason for skepticism about Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption efforts in requesting investigations. Nunes said Democratic operatives\u00a0tried\u00a0to discredit the 2016 Trump campaign with Ukrainian sources. \u201cWho were these Democratic operatives who were dirtying up the Trump campaign in 2016?\u201d Nunes asked. Sondland confirmed that he had told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition that Trump was skeptical about Ukraine during a May 23 meeting at the White House. \u201cI think he said: 'they tried to take me down.' He kept saying that over and over,\u201d Sondland said in the deposition. - Bart Jansen During a break in the hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201cgoes right to the heart\u201d of the investigation on Ukraine that House Democrats are pursuing. Schiff said\u00a0the ambassador's testimony was\u00a0\u201camong the most significant evidence to date.\u201d -- Nicholas Wu Gordon Sondland said Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were kept informed of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to open investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201cI mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,\u201d Sondland said Sept. 1 before a meeting between Pence and Zelensky. Sondland submitted to lawmakers\u00a0emails he had written to Pompeo and other Trump administration officials. A July 19 email from Sondland to Pompeo, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and other officials carried the subject line \u201cRe: I Talked to Zelensky just now.\u201d It said Zelensky was prepared to receive a call from Trump \u201cHe is prepared to receive Potus' call. Will assure him [Trump] that he [Zelensky] intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone,\u2019\u201d Sondland wrote. Sondland on Pence and Pompeo:'Everyone was in the loop,' ambassador says about high-level efforts to pressure Ukraine Both Perry and Mulvaney responded to Sondland\u2019s email. On Aug. 11, Sondland sent an email to State Department officials and addressed to Pompeo. \u201cMike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Ze[lensky] to be delivered for our review in a day or two,\u201d Sondland wrote \u201cThe contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Ze plans to have a big presser on the openness subject (including specifics) next week.\u201d Sondland said a top State Department official, Lisa Kenna, responded that she would pass the note to Pompeo. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said. -- Nicholas Wu Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, disputed Sondland\u2019s testimony about speaking with Pence in Warsaw on Sept. 1 about investigations, saying it never happened. \u201cThe Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,\u201d Short said. \u201cAmbassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland.\u00a0 This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.\u201d Short also noted that multiple witnesses had said Pence never mentioned Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden or Burisma before or after the Sept. 1 meeting. - Bart Jansen Sondland's key statements:Gordon Sondland's impeachment inquiry testimony Gordon Sondland confirmed he spoke with Trump on his cell phone on July 26, a day after the president had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. David Holmes, a State Department official at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition last week that he overheard Sondland's July 26 call with Trump and said the president asked whether Zelensky was going to open the investigation he sought. Sondland said he was at a Kyiv restaurant, as Holmes also said, and the call lasted five minutes. \"Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It is true that the President speaks loudly at times,\" he said Wednesday. \"It is true that the President likes to use colorful language,\" he added, referring to the expletives mentioned in Holmes' recall of the conversation. Sondland added though he did not remember the precise details of the conversation, noting the White House prohibited him from seeing any readouts of the call. He said that at the time, he did not think the conversation was significant. \"Actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president's concerns,\" he said. But he said he had no recollection of discussing Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter on the call or after it ended. Holmes told House investigators Sondland told him after the call that Trump only cared about \"big things\" that benefited him, like \"this Biden investigation that Giuliani is pushing.\" Asked by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff if he had anything to dispute in Holmes' recollection of the call, Sondland said he didn't, though he did not recall mentioning Biden. \u201cI do not recall mentioning the Bidens. It was Burisma and the 2016 election,\" he said. Asked about the July 26 call with Sondland, Trump said: \"I know\u00a0nothing about that.\u00a0First time I've heard\u00a0it.\u00a0The one thing I've seen that\u00a0Sondland said was that he did\u00a0speak to me with for a brief\u00a0moment and\u00a0I said 'no quid pro quo under any\u00a0circumstances.'\" \"And that's true.\u00a0But I've never heard this.\u00a0In any event, it is more\u00a0secondhand information, but I've\u00a0never heard it,\" Trump told reporters last week. -- Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Sondland\u2019s testimony, highlighting how Trump told the ambassador there was \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d \u201cNo quid pro quo ever occurred,\u201d she said, denying the conditioning of security assistance on the opening of investigations. \u201cDemocrats keep chasing ghosts,\u201d she concluded. - Nicholas Wu In response to a question from Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Gordon Sondland said Rudy Giuliani had conveyed to him that what mattered most to Donald Trump was the public announcement of the investigations, not the investigations themselves. \u201cHe had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them,\" Sondland said of the president\u2019s demands as expressed through Giuliani. - Nicholas Wu Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, compared the Ukraine outreach to George Washington\u2019s diplomacy with Great Britain in his opening statement. \u201cI would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president, George Washington, directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with Great Britain. If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794, they\u2019d probably want to impeach him, too,\u201d Nunes said. He also lashed out at \u201cpartisan extremists\u201d who transformed the Intelligence Committee into an \u201cImpeachment Committee.\u201d \u201cThe Democrats have exploited the Intelligence Committee for political purposes for three years, culminating in these impeachment hearings,\u201d he said. -- Nicholas Wu Schiff lays out Sondland's role in Ukraine saga House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, began his opening remarks by laying out the Democratic case of impeachment against President Donald Trump. \"Trump\u2019s scheme undermined military and diplomatic support for a key ally and undercut U.S. anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine,\" he said. Schiff recounted Sondland's role in the Ukrainian saga, placing him in key moments in the timeline and underscoring his importance as a witness to whether Trump abused his power. The top Democrat described Sondland as a \"skilled dealmaker\" who \"found himself increasingly embroiled in an effort to press the new Ukrainian President that deviated sharply from the norm, in terms of both policy and process.\" \"Now, it is up to Congress, as the people\u2019s representatives to determine what response is appropriate,\" he said after recalling the events in Ukraine. \"If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2013 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2013 it will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency,\" Schiff said. -- Courtney Subramanian In an addendum to\u00a0his original testimony, Sondland said he communicated a quid pro quo to a top Ukrainian presidential adviser, Andriy Yermak. \"I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak, where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland said. David Holmes, a State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that he overheard a call between Sondland and Trump in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations.\" According to Holmes,\u00a0Sondland assured Trump that Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your a--\u201d and would do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d about investigations. Holmes said, \"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\" How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage More:Aide testifies Sondland told Trump that Zelensky would 'do anything you ask him to' Holmes also told lawmakers that when he asked Sondland \"if it was true\u00a0that the President did not 'give a s--- about Ukraine,\"\u00a0Sondland replied that Trump only cared about \"big stuff\"\u00a0that worked to Trump's personal benefit like investigations into his political adversaries. Other testimony has indicated that Sondland was in contact with Trump as he waged a \"parallel\" campaign of diplomacy that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said was like a \"drug deal.\" National Security Council official Tim Morrison told members of Congress and staff behind closed doors that Sondland told him \"the President was giving him instruction\" related to the \"parallel\" campaign to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Trump's political adversaries. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the President was giving him instruction,\u201d Morrison said of a conversation with Sondland. And before the July 25 call, Sondland emailed Morrison and other White House staff to say \u201che had spoken to the President that morning to brief him on the call.\u201d Recounting a later conversation between Morrison and Sondland, Morrison said Trump told Sondland \u201cthere was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to do it and he should want to do it.\u201d The officials testifying in the afternoon are expected to shed further light on the campaign to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and the withholding of aid. Cooper oversees Ukrainian policy at the Pentagon and previously told lawmakers and staff in her closed-door testimony how it became clear after Trump's call with Zelensky how the nearly $400 million of security aid was being withheld as \u201cit relates to the President's concerns about corruption.\u201d Hale testified behind closed doors about Yovanovitch's ouster. When asked who would decide against releasing a statement in support of Yovanovitch in light of the \"smear\" campaign against her, he said it would have been \"someone more senior than me.\" \"Given my position in the State Department, it could only have been someone more senior to me. The Secretary most likely would have been the person.\" AMERIND Risk",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The way Ambassador Gordon Sondland tells it \u2013 under oath, no less \u2013 he and President Donald Trump are on such friendly terms that they communicate using colorful language and lots of naughty, four-letter words. But Sondland hadn\u2019t even finished his bombshell testimony during Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearing when Trump issued what has become his standard rebuttal. \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d Trump said of the Oregon hotel owner who donated $1 million to his inauguration and was rewarded with the U.S. ambassadorship to the European Union. Trump often argues he's not familiar with certain people who run afoul of the law or whose\u00a0words or actions cast him in a negative light. Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted barely more than a week as White House communications director? \u201cI barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence,\u201d Trump said. Stormy Daniels? \u00a0\u201cI had nothing to do with her,\u201d Trump said of the adult film star whom he paid $130,000 in hush money after she claimed the two had a sexual encounter. Here are 11 people Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know or never met \u2013 despite, at times, evidence to the contrary. The E.U. ambassador, Trump\u2019s go-to guy on Ukraine and a star witness in the House impeachment inquiry, testified that Trump directed him and others to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to publicly announce supposed anti-corruption investigations that Trump was seeking. Under oath, Sondland confirmed the existence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in which Ukraine was urged to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s political rivals. In exchange, Ukraine would get the U.S. military aid it\u00a0desperately wanted,\u00a0and\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would get a White House meeting. Asked if he used a vulgarity when telling Trump about Zelensky's desire to cooperate with the United States, Sondland said that sounded like something he would say. \"That's how President Trump and I communicate \u2013\u00a0a lot of four-letter words,\" he said. Trump's retort:\u00a0\u201cI have not spoken to him much,\u201d he\u00a0told reporters on the White House South Lawn. \u201cThis is not a man I know well.\u201d Million-dollar question:How well does Trump know $1 million donors like Gordon Sondland? Some now work for him Scaramucci \u2013 aka, \u201cthe Mooch\u201d \u2013 was a financier and one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters when Trump named him White House communications director on July 21, 2017. It didn\u2019t last. Trump fired Scaramucci less than two weeks later when the New Yorker called a reporter and trash-talked what he perceived to be the president\u2019s enemies, including some members of Trump\u2019s administration. Trump\u2019s take: \u201cAnthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable \u2018nut job\u2019\u2026,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cI barely knew him.\u201d Scaramucci on Trump:\u00a0'Very clear that it\u2019s impossible for him to win' Papadopoulos, a young aide, was tapped by Trump to serve on\u00a0his foreign policy team during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump lauded Papadopoulos as \u201can excellent guy\u201d during a meeting with The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board on March 21, 2016. Later that month, Trump tweeted a photo of him seated at a table with Papadopoulos during a national security meeting. But Trump\u2019s lofty praise cooled quickly when Papadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian contacts. \u201cFew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. And that photo of him seated next to Papadopoulos? \u201cI never even talked to the guy,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was.\u201d Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for five months, quickly fell out of his favor after he was convicted and sentenced to nearly four years in prison over financial fraud crimes related to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \"I didn't know Manafort well,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cHe wasn't with the campaign long.\u201d Trump denied knowing the two Ukrainian-born business partners, who were\u00a0associates of Giuliani, after they were indicted in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns. The problem? Several photos show the men with Trump or members of his family. Parnas posted one photo on Facebook showing himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, describing an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d Trump\u2019s explanation: \u201cIt's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody,\u201d he told reporters on the White House South Lawn. But, \"I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know about them. I don\u2019t know what they do.\u201d Testimony:Giuliani associate Lev Parnas must testify about GOP contributions at center of criminal case Trump loyalist Whitaker served a year as chief of staff to Trump\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions. But Trump had a frosty relationship with Sessions and fired him last November. He then named\u00a0Whitaker as acting attorney general. \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\u201d Trump said just two days after handing Whitaker the promotion. He did, however, know Whitaker\u2019s reputation, he said. Whitaker lasted in the job just three months and was replaced in February by William Barr, who remains attorney general. Conway, a conservative attorney who reportedly made Trump\u2019s short list to become U.S. solicitor general, is one of the president\u2019s most persistent critics, frequently Twitter-slamming him with insults like \u201cnarcissistic sociopath\u201d and \u201cdelusional demagogue.\u201d Conway also happens to be married to Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and currently serves as one of his senior advisers. In one Twitter take-down, Trump claimed Conway was jealous of his wife\u2019s success and angry that he didn\u2019t get the job he wanted. \u201cI barely know him,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cbut just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!\u201d Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d in a New York Magazine interview in 2002 and said he\u2019d known the multi-millionaire for 15 years. \u201cHe's a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d But Trump distanced himself from the \u201cterrific guy\u201d in July after Epstein was arrested on\u00a0charges of sex-trafficking girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes\" in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida. The \"terrific guy\" was suddenly not so terrific anymore. \u201cI knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"...He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don\u2019t think I have spoken with him for 15 years. I was not a fan.\" Epstein died in his New York jail cell in August. The New York medical examiner ruled his death as suicide by hanging. Suicide?:Private pathologist questions whether Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide; medical examiner stands by conclusion Stephanie Clifford, an adult film star who performs under the name Stormy Daniels, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Not true, Trump said. \u201cI had nothing to do with her,\u201d he\u00a0told The Associated Press on Oct. 16, 2018. \u201cSo she can lie and she can do whatever she wants to do.\u201d Trump initially denied knowing about the hush-money paid to Daniels but later acknowledged repaying his former lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to her that was made as part of a hush agreement. After a federal judge in California threw out Daniels\u2019 defamation lawsuit against Trump last year, he celebrated on Twitter. \u201cHorseface,\u201d Trump mocked\u00a0Daniels, adding: \u201cShe knows nothing about me.\" Regrets:Stormy Daniels says she regrets body shaming President Trump with graphic description The longtime advice columnist accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City in the mid-1990s. Carroll went public with the allegation against Trump in June before the release of her book, \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,\" which contains a description of the alleged assault. \u201cShe\u2019s not my type,\u201d Trump shot back, denying they\u2019d ever met.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Transcripts released Saturday\u00a0provided more evidence President Donald Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president caused concern throughout his administration, even causing one staffer to consult lawyers out of the fear it would be leaked to the media. The transcripts came\u00a0from a congressional panel's closed-door interviews with National Security Council official Timothy Morrison and Jennifer\u00a0Williams, a foreign policy\u00a0aide to Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which sparked the impeachment inquiry. Both aides are scheduled to testify publicly next week. \u201cThe testimony released today shows that President Trump\u2019s\u00a0July 25\u00a0phone call with\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0President Zelensky immediately set off alarm bells throughout the White House,\"\u00a0said the chairs of the House Oversight, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees, which conducted the depositions, in a statement. \"Both witnesses provided the Committees with first-hand accounts after personally listening to the call in the White House Situation Room.\" Here are the key takeaways from their testimonies. More:Trump goes to Walter Reed National Medical Center for 'portions' of annual physical exam Morrison told congressional members and staff he asked National Security Council lawyers to review Trump\u2019s July 25 call because he thought it \u201cwould be damaging\u201d if it \u201cleaked.\u201d \u201cI was concerned about whether or not they would agree that it would be damaging for the reasons I outlined in my statement if the call package...leaked,\u201d Morrison said. Trump is accused of withholding nearly $400 million of military assistance to Ukraine as well as a White House meeting with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0unless the Ukrainian government opened investigations into Trump's political adversaries, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\u00a0A whistleblower complaint filed about the\u00a0July 25 call, during which Trump\u00a0raised the issue of investigations into his political adversaries while also discussing security assistance to Ukraine, kicked off the impeachment inquiry. In his opening statement, he said he was concerned about the implications of a leak of the call with regards to how it would be viewed in \"Washington's polarized environment,\" its potential effects on the \"bipartisan support\" for Ukraine, and impacts on Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Read Morrison's transcript:Timothy Morrison's testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry Read Williams transcript:Read the full impeachment inquiry testimony of Pence aide Jennifer Williams Morrison: Aid withheld at 'the President\u2019s direction' Morrison said he first learned of the hold on aid during a July conversation with Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser who had failed to appear for his scheduled testimony. Kupperman told Morrison \u201cthe chief of staff\u2019s office had informed (the Office of Management and Budget) that it was the President\u2019s direction to hold the assistance.\u201d Democrats have sought evidence to directly link Trump to the withholding of aid.\u00a0Saturday's testimony with OMB official Mark Sandy, who signed one of the documents halting aid, is expected to shed more light on how aid was withheld. Morrison's testimony gave further context to the relationship between U.S. Ambassador to the\u00a0European Union Gordon Sondland and Trump. Trump attempted to distance himself from Sondland, telling\u00a0reporters \"I hardly know the gentleman,\" on Nov. 8 as he appeared to distance himself from the ambassador. Morrison's account of Sondland's contacts with Trump, however, suggests\u00a0close contact between Trump and Sondland on Ukraine. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the President was giving him instruction,\u201d Morrison said of a conversation with Sondland about the \"parallel\" pressure campaign on Ukraine. And before the July 25 call, Sondland emailed Morrison and other White House staff to say \u201che had spoken to the President that morning to brief him on the call.\u201d Recounting a later conversation between Morrison and Sondland, Morrison said Trump told Sondland \u201cthere was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to do it and he should want to do it.\u201d Trump physical:Trump receives 'portions' of annual physical exam, White House said he's 'healthy and energetic' Morrison recounted a conversation with fellow National Security Council official Fiona Hill, who is also scheduled to testify publicly next week, in which she told him he \"would be wise\" to stay away from engagement with Giuliani and the \"parallel\" pressure campaign on Ukraine. \"She\u00a0mentioned that Gordon talked with Rudy, and she mentioned that she stayed away from any conversation with Rudy and that I would be wise to do the same,\" Morrison said. Morrison added that he \"tried to stay away from\" any discussion of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board. \"I would say that it struck me as unusual and inappropriate,\" Williams said when asked what her own personal reaction to the call was. \"I guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,\" she added. Earlier in her interview, she said she found the \"specific references\" in the July 25 call to investigations to be part of Trump's \"personal political agenda\" as opposed to a \"broader...foreign policy objective.\"",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump made a previously unannounced visit Thursday to Dover Air Force Base to honor the remains of two returning Army officers  killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Chief Warrant Officer 2s David C. Knadle, 33, of Texas, and Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr., 25, of Hawaii, died Wednesday when their helicopter crashed as they provided cover to\u00a0ground troops in Eastern Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. The visit is\u00a0Trump\u2019s third to witness a dignified transfer ceremony at the Delaware base and it comes as he has been increasingly vocal in describing the emotional scenes\u00a0associated with meeting the parents of fallen soldiers. Trump has described those meetings in detail to explain his desire to withdraw troops from the Middle East. The president\u00a0stood silently and saluted as he watched service members carry the two transfer cases to a waiting vehicle.\u00a0The soldiers wore Army fatigues, white gloves and black berets. The ceremony, perhaps the most somber duty for any president,\u00a0was not on Trump's public schedule. The president did not take questions from reporters. As he boarded Marine One,\u00a0Trump was accompanied by actor\u00a0Jon Voight, who received a\u00a0National Medal of Arts earlier in the day at the White House. Voight was also seen by reporters at Dover who were traveling with the president. The visit comes as the president faces the threat of impeachment in the House, where Democrats are holding a series of hearings to assess whether he held up nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv into opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump last visited Dover in January to meet with relatives of four U.S. service members killed in an attack in Syria. In 2017, just days after taking office, Trump traveled to Dover to receive the remains of a U.S. Navy seal killed in Yemen. The president faced bipartisan backlash this fall for ordering the withdrawal of virtually all 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. At the same time, however, the president is sending tanks, armored vehicles and the soldiers attached to those weapons to Syrian oil fields. Trump described his impression\u00a0of the solemn service in a series of remarks last month in an effort to\u00a0underscore his call to reduce U.S. military engagement overseas. \u201cAnd that door came down, and there\u2019s five soldiers on each side \u2013 beautiful soldiers, beautiful \u2013 and a coffin with a flag on it,\u201d Trump said during a speech Oct. 14. \"And that door opened, and you would hear screams and cries like you've never heard before, actually.\u00a0Like we\u2019ve never heard \u2013 like I\u2019ve never heard before.\" Contributing: Tom Vanden Brook",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump sought to escape the deluge of negative headlines pouring out of impeachment hearings in Washington on Wednesday by heading to Texas to turn the spotlight on one of his favorite topics: the economy. Trump traveled to Austin, where he joined Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook on a tour of the plant where Apple produces its Mac Pro desktop computer. Trump\u2019s trip coincided with Apple\u2019s announcement that it is beginning construction on a new $1 billion campus in Austin and the company\u2019s decision last month to assemble the high-end Mac Pro in Austin. The company had reportedly been considering moving production to Asia but said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to waive tariffs on certain parts made in China as one of the reasons for its decision to keep producing the computer in Texas. Trump cast the trip as part of his effort to get people to build in the United States, not in other countries, particularly China. \u201cWhen you build in the United States, you don\u2019t have to worry about tariffs,\u201d he said, standing next to Cook. During the plant tour, Trump looked over an unfinished Mac Pro computer while Cook pointed out the device\u2019s different parts. A worker explained part of the assembly process then held up the bottom of a computer to show the inscription: \u201cAssembled in the USA.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we want,\u201d Trump said. More:Highlights from Sondland's testimony: 'Rudy was the guy' driving Trump's Ukraine aims Repeating one of his frequent talking points, Trump said the country is doing well, \u201cespecially from the standpoint of the economy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the strongest economy in the world right now,\u201d replied Cook, who has maintained a warm relationship with Trump while others in the tech industry have been quick to criticize the president. But the rapport between Trump and Cook has not always been smooth. Cook has publicly criticized Trump\u2019s stance on climate change and other issues. In October, Trump went on a Twitter rant against Cook over Apple\u2019s decision two years ago to scrap the home button on new models of the iPhone. Trump also was ridiculed when, at a White House roundtable in March, he referred to Cook as \u201cTim Apple.\u201d Trump later claimed on Twitter that he used the moniker \u201cas an easy way to save time & words.\u201d Before Trump\u2019s arrival in Texas on Wednesday, Apple announced the start of construction on its new campus in Austin. The campus will be 3 million square feet and will initially house 5,000 employees but will have the capacity to grow to 15,000. The facility is expected to open in 2020. Apple said in September it would assemble the Mac Pro at the Austin campus by using parts from American companies. The company had considered moving production to Asia because of difficulty getting parts. But the Trump administration granted the company tariff exclusions on some parts, which allowed the company to get the parts it needs to produce the computer without paying tariffs. Even so, Apple said the new Mac Pro will be made with more than twice as many American-made parts previous models of the computer. Apple has been making Mac Pro computers in Texas since 2013. The product, which starts at a hefty $5,999, isn't one of its best sellers. The new model is scheduled for release this fall. Michael Collins and David Jackson cover\u00a0the White House.

On Monday, Trump tweeted that he would \"strongly consider\" testifying \"even\u00a0though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax.\" Trump was responding to suggestions by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats that he come before the committee conducting the impeachment inquiry. House Democrats are investigating evidence Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, and threatened to withhold aid if the Ukraine government did not follow through. In her CBS interview, Bondi said she understands why Trump would want to testify \u2013 \"he did nothing wrong\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0but attorneys would advise against it. \"The president should not testify,\" she said. How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage The\u00a0new White House spokesperson also got off to a rough start in her interview by misstating the title of key impeachment witness Gordon Sondland. Bondi said that Sondland is the ambassador to Ukraine \u2013 in fact, he is U.S. ambassador to the European Union. The advice\u00a0not to testify did not surprise legal analysts who said the president could not control the narrative within a House hearing room the way he can when speaking in public. \"In a hearing, on the other hand, skilled and experienced committee counsel will ask probing questions and pin him down on inconsistencies,\" said Barb McQuade, a former federal prosecutor and now a law professor at the University of Michigan. \"In that\u00a0setting, lies are crimes or impeachable offenses.\"",

Check out the 5 things podcast below and\u00a0subscribe for free\u00a0on Apple Podcasts: Antonella Barba, who became a sensation on \"American Idol\" in 2007, is scheduled to be sentenced to federal prison Thursday after her July conviction on drug charges. Barba, now 32, made it to the top 16 of 'Idol' at age 19. But after the show, she suffered from bipolar disorder and other mental health problems, according to court records. In October 2018, authorities in Norfolk, Virginia, found nearly two pounds of the synthetic opioid fentanyl in her car. Prosecutors are seeking a prison term of between 57 and 71 months \u2013 nearly five years. Barba's attorneys are calling for a shorter sentence. A rare celestial treat awaits stargazers late Thursday evening as a full-fledged \"unicorn\" meteor storm could appear in the night sky, astronomers said.\u00a0Several meteors per minute are possible at the height of the storm,\u00a0around 11:50 p.m. EST Thursday, according to the meteor society. The best viewing conditions for the meteor shower are probably across the western and north-central USA, where there are\u00a0only patchy clouds in the forecast. There is no guarantee that such an event will unfold, but meteor scientists say\u00a0there is a \"good chance\" to see the first Alpha Monocerotids meteor storm since 1995, when there were\u00a0about 400 meteors per hour,\u00a0AccuWeather reported. It's certainly becoming clearer by the week. Thursday night's game (Fox and NFL Network, 8:25 p.m. ET) between the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans kicks off Week 12\u00a0and is huge for both teams that currently sit tied atop the AFC South. The Colts won Round 1 against the Texans in Week 7, so a victory in Houston on Thursday night would give Indy a huge edge for the division title. Also, don't forget to set your fantasy football lineup. Beginning Thursday, a Colorado school district dealing with an \"unprecedented spread of illness\" will close the doors to every one of its more than 40 schools. Mesa County Valley School District 51 announced\u00a0Wednesday all of its schools will be closed until after Thanksgiving break is over on Dec. 2. A statement quotes district nursing coordinator Tanya Marvin as saying a virus that is \"extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools.\" Later in the statement, Marvin spoke of \"a second, related virus that is affecting students.\" and\u00a0that \"the combination of the two has created an unprecedented spread of illness.\" The district, according to its website, serves more than 22,000 students and has 2,785 teachers and staff.
