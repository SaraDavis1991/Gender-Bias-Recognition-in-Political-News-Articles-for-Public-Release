      "content": "Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former first lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will attend Rep. Elijah Cummings' funeral in Baltimore on Friday. Cummings was a personal friend of Obama's and was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential run. The former president is expected to speak at the service, according to a Cummings spokesperson. Members of Congress paid tribute to Cummings on Thursday as his body lay in state at the U.S. Capitol. A Democrat whose district included large sections of Baltimore, Cummings died last week at age 68. Prefer to listen or get news via email?

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Even as support for his impeachment grows, President Donald Trump continues to be backed by a seemingly unshakable core of supporters who deny he has done anything wrong and agree he is the target of a political \"lynching,\" a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds. Americans are split in the survey about whether Trump should be convicted by the Senate in an impeachment trial and removed from office: 46% in favor and 47% against. Having close to half of registered voters support\u00a0his eviction from the White House is politically perilous territory for any president, of course. Despite damaging new testimony, however, 30% to 40% of those surveyed remain solidly on Trump\u2019s side. That is a significant asset for the president as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday to affirm the formal impeachment investigation. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the economy, wages, unemployment, foreign affairs, tariffs\u00a0and other things like that,\u201d said Steven Kay, 67, of Riverside County, California, a retiree and a Republican who was among those surveyed. \u201cHis rhetoric might be a little much, but he is making good policy.\u201d Hillary Clinton and impeachment:How is she connected to inquiries against three presidents? William Skelskey, 84, a Republican and retired real estate agent from Mission Viejo, California, blamed Democrats' \"negativity\"\u00a0for Trump's troubles and called him \"one of the top three presidents since Washington and Reagan.\" The president\u2019s solid core of supporters don\u2019t comprise a majority of the electorate, but they do provide a political foundation that energizes him \u2013 witness his speeches that stretch an hour and longer at raucous rallies \u2013 and helps limit defections from other GOP officials. Paleologos on the Poll:On Trump impeachment, watch the voters who haven't made up their minds In the poll, nearly four in 10 say his phone call pressuring the Ukrainian president\u00a0to\u00a0investigate possible interference in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0is itself an impeachable offense. But another 31% say there was nothing wrong with the conversation,\u00a0echoing Trump\u2019s insistence that it was \"perfect.\" Thirty-seven percent say the House should stop investigating the president and his administration entirely. \u201cIt seems like the inquiry is a tremendous waste of time and money,\u201d said George Roma, 55, a small-business owner from central Florida and a Republican. \u201cI\u2019m baffled why they continue to do this for three years.\u201d In contrast, some of Trump\u2019s critics are baffled why he hasn\u2019t been impeached already. \"He clearly violated the conduct that the president should hold in terms of using his power to increase his political and personal gain,\"\u00a0said Kate Pritchard, 63, a Democrat\u00a0and retired teacher from Durango, Colorado. She said Congress was \"doing a good job with the inquiry and following the rules.\" The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters Oct. 23-26 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Mitt Romney:A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Last week, even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of distancing himself from a tweet by Trump that likened his impeachment to \u201ca lynching.\u201d In the poll, though, 40% say they agree\u00a0with the racially charged tweet; 54% disagree. The language that caused wide consternation was seen by some supporters as just another sign of Trump's willingness to disrupt the status quo, a quality they embrace. \"That's why I voted for Trump,\" Roma said. \"I'm trying to get away from the same-old, same-old Washington.\" Unsurprisingly, they\u00a0are overwhelmingly Republican. Conservatives by more than 2-1 agree\u00a0with the president\u2019s assertion. These core backers are disproportionately white and male. His strongest support comes from those who don't have a four-year college degree. They also tend\u00a0to be older. Those 18 to 34 years old overwhelmingly disagree\u00a0with the tweet; those 65 and older narrowly agree\u00a0with it. That is the portrait of those the White House is counting on for the impeachment battle ahead\u00a0and for the reelection fight to follow. A word's power:Politicians have used 'lynching' as a metaphor for decades, but has time changed its impact? Trump\u2019s strongest support comes from those who say Fox News is the TV network they trusted most; 78% of Fox viewers say they agree that Trump\u2019s impeachment was like a \u201clynching.\u201d In contrast, just 2% of those who trust\u00a0MSNBC most and 10% of those who trust\u00a0CNN most agree with the statement. On one issue, the president\u2019s support sinks to just\u00a0one in\u00a0four, a sign of a potential vulnerability. Asked if the White House had an obligation to comply with subpoenas from the House committees demanding testimony and documents, 66% of those surveyed say yes, 26% say no. Those who think the White House should comply with congressional subpoenas include\u00a035% of Republicans. Who's been subpoenaed?:All the people subpoenaed in impeachment inquiry \u201cI do feel it is inappropriate for the executive branch to be stonewalling,\u201d said Michael Dunford, 35, a Democrat from Solana Beach, California. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is obstruction of justice, but it is obstruction.\u201d In the new USA TODAY/Suffolk survey, Americans of all stripes are inclined to think the House won\u2019t end up voting to impeach Trump, 56%-37%. Most Democrats and most Republicans agree he\u2019s not likely to be removed from office. Nearly three in four of all those surveyed, 73%, predict he won\u2019t be. \u201cHe should be impeached to discourage the awful behavior,\u201d said Andre Mendes, 60, an engineer from Baltimore who supports the Green Party. \"But Republicans would have to grow a spine in order for removal from office to occur.\u201d 2020 elections:Poll shows Iowa\u00a0'up for grabs' as Buttigieg surges into top tier Pelosi vs. Trump:Combatants in impeachment showdown that will test them, nation",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump, an avid sports fan who owns golf courses and once owned a franchise in the United States Football League, stays away from most sporting events. Now we know why. When his name was announced to the sellout crowd after the third inning of World Series Game 5 in the midst of the Washington Nationals\u2019 regular salute to veterans, Trump was met by a torrent of boos. The noise was intense and long-lasting, a wave of negativity that washed up to the Major League Baseball suite where the president was watching the final game of the Series to be held at Nationals Park. But the moment the big screen in center field switched from showing Trump to once again showing the veterans, the boos from the crowd immediately returned to cheers. This was a crowd that knew exactly what it was doing. And it knew it even before the game began. Spectators telegraphed how they would greet Trump when they welcomed renowned chef and vocal Trump critic Jose Andres, who threw out the game\u2019s honorary first pitch, with a particularly raucous standing ovation. I bumped into Andres in the press elevator an hour and a half after his pitch and asked him if he interpreted the crowd\u2019s reaction as a statement supporting his activism against Trump. He said he would prefer not to comment, except to say this: \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant. Today we celebrate immigrants on a field full of immigrants.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit made many people uncomfortable. He did not sit with the principal owners of the Nationals, the Lerner family, in their suite. Word was the Lerners didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him during his visit, a source who asked not to be named but was familiar with the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The president arrived after the start of Sunday night\u2019s game because he didn\u2019t want to become a disruption for the thousands of fans streaming to Nats Park. But he was disruptive nonetheless. He caused extra long security lines for fans entering the stadium, as any president does, and a portion of the main concourse was closed for several minutes for his entrance and exit from the game. HELLO:\u00a0Trump booed at Game 5 of World Series SECURITY DOGS:\u00a0Strasburg jokes about security for Trump's visit In addition to the robust booing thousands directed at Trump, fans exercised their right to freedom of speech in another way. As the fourth inning began, hundreds lustily chanted \u201cLock him up\u201d at Trump, mimicking the omnipresent chants Trump supporters directed at Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cLock him up\u201d broke out in the outfield seats and in the upper deck. It lingered for several minutes before fans returned their focus to the action on the field. Trump hasn\u2019t attended a major league baseball game since he took office in January 2017. Odds are, he won\u2019t come back any time soon. Sponsored by AMERIND Risk",

The commander in chief and the first lady watched D.C.'s\u00a0home team take on the Houston Astros at Nationals Park. In the fourth inning, some attendees began shouting \"lock him up,\" a reference to the\u00a0motto that Trump supporters directed at Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump was also booed.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Thursday on a Democratic\u00a0resolution mapping out rules for public hearings in the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, after weeks of Republicans criticizing the inquiry for holding closed-door meetings in the basement of the Capitol. Also on Thursday, the trio of committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine\u00a0have another private deposition with a National Security Council official. Timothy Morrison, whose departure from the\u00a0NSC as senior director for Europe and Russia was announced on the eve of his testimony, was described\u00a0by another witness in the House impeachment inquiry as having a \"sinking feeling\" after learning\u00a0the U.S. was withholding military aid for Ukraine while urging an investigation of Trump's political rival former Vice President Joe Biden. Morrison's testimony is expected to begin in the morning. The House is expected to debate the resolution in the morning and vote on it as part of a series beginning about 10:30 a.m. The vote will be the first of the full House under the formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0and will put moderate lawmakers from both parties under scrutiny heading into the 2020 election. The resolution formalizes the public phase of the investigation with hearings and evidence-sharing with the president\u2019s counsel, even as Republicans continue to criticize the process as a \u201csham.\u201d Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 amid reports Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Biden, while withholding military aid. Trump has called the inquiry a partisan \"witch hunt\" and White House counsel Pat Cipollone notified Pelosi Oct. 8 that the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate for lack of a full House vote. The resolution charts a public phase of the investigation.\u00a0Six committees have been investigating Trump for a variety of reasons, including possible abuse of power and obstruction of justice:\u00a0Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, and Ways and Means. Provisions in the resolution allow\u00a0Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the panel's top Republican, to each question witnesses for up to 90 minutes or delegate their time to staffers before rank-and-file lawmakers each ask questions for five minutes. Republicans on the Intelligence and Judiciary committees could subpoena witnesses and documents, and if the chairman\u00a0objected, Republicans could\u00a0ask for a committee vote. The resolution:House resolution outlines public phase of impeachment inquiry, gives GOP subpoena powers The Intelligence Committee and other panels would provide reports to the Judiciary Committee, which would draft possible articles of impeachment. At Judiciary hearings, the president's counsel would be able to participate by receiving evidence and staff reports, questioning witnesses, submitting additional evidence and being invited to offer a concluding presentation. But if the administration refuses to make witnesses or documents available to the committees, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler could deny requests from the president's counsel to call or question witnesses. \u201cThis is a serious moment for our nation,\" said Nadler, D-N.Y.\u00a0 \"This committee is committed to executing its part of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment investigation with the highest fealty to the Constitution.\u201d The provisions weren't enough\u00a0to appease concerns among Republicans, who worried about the lack of additional resources for committees participating in the inquiry and that the Intelligence Committee might not pass along all the confidential evidence it has gathered to the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe Soviet-style process that Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff have been conducting behind closed doors for weeks now has been rotten to the core,\" said Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican in the House. The White House denounced the measure in a statement by press secretary Stephanie Grisham, saying the resolution continues the impeachment \"scam\" without allowing \"any due process for the president.\" The Intelligence Committee has been taking depositions for weeks about Ukraine and Morrison, who is slated to testify Thursday,\u00a0was mentioned repeatedly in the House testimony Oct. 22 of Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine. Morrison is leaving\u00a0the NSC soon after more than a year of service, according to a senior administration official. Taylor described how NSC\u00a0and State Department officials learned bit by bit about the back-channel efforts of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Taylor said he asked Morrison during a call Aug. 22 whether U.S. policy toward Ukraine had changed.\u00a0Morrison replied \"it remains to be seen,\" but said the \"president doesn't want to provide any assistance at all,\" according to Taylor. \"That\u00a0was extremely troubling to me,\u201d said Taylor, who had warned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he would resign if the U.S. didn\u2019t strongly support Ukraine. The conversation with Morrison was sandwiched between Trump\u2019s July 25 call to\u00a0 Zelensky, when the president urged an investigation of the Bidens, and the White House release of a summary of the call Sept. 25, when Taylor learned of its details. 'You cannot make up my life':Hillary Clinton's ties to impeachment inquiries against three presidents Three key House committees\u00a0\u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform\u00a0\u2013 are investigating how Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid during the summer while also urging Zelensky to investigate Biden. Democrats contend the effort could be an impeachable abuse of power. But House Republicans have accused Democrats of selectively leaking snippets of testimony from the closed-door sessions to make the president look bad.\u00a0Trump has vigorously defended his authority to urge the investigation of corruption and called the inquiry a partisan \"witch hunt.\" Morrison succeeded\u00a0Fiona Hill, the former NSC senior director for Europe and Russia, who resigned during the summer. She told lawmakers Oct. 14 that National Security Adviser John Bolton said he wasn\u2019t part of \u201cwhatever drug deal\u201d that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were \u201ccooking up,\" according to reports about her testimony. Bolton reportedly referred to Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\" according to Hill. Bolton told her to notify NSC lawyer John Eisenberg about a July 10 White House meeting of officials dealing on Ukraine. Taylor picked up the thread with details about how national-security and diplomatic officials learned about the results of pressuring Ukraine to begin investigations. On Sept. 1, Zelensky met with Vice President Mike Pence in Warsaw. Sondland also met there with Andriy Yermak, an assistant to Zelensky, according to Taylor. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field Morrison described Sondland telling Yermak that the military aid wouldn\u2019t come until Zelensky committed to investigate Burisma, the Ukraine energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a board director, according to Taylor. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance \u2013 not just the White House meeting \u2013 was conditioned on the investigations,\u201d Taylor said. Taylor alerted Alexander Danyliuk, Ukraine\u2019s national security adviser, that the military assistance was \u201call or nothing\u201d because the funding would expire with the end of the U.S. fiscal year Sept. 30. On Sept. 2, Morrison met with Danyliuk in Warsaw and later told Taylor that the Ukrainian expressed concern about the losing U.S. support. On Sept. 7, Morrison said he had a \u201csinking feeling\u201d after a conversation with Sondland, according to Taylor. Trump told Sondland he wasn\u2019t asking for a \"quid pro quo,\" but insisted that \u201cZelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference,\u201d Taylor said.",

Supporters of Clinton have questioned Trump's mental stability for trafficking in conspiracy theories normally confined to the fringes of the political spectrum. \"Ridiculous, and of course not true \u2014 and Donald Trump knows it,\" said a weekend tweet from Angel Ure\u00f1a, a spokesman for former President Clinton. \"Has he triggered the 25th Amendment yet?\" After Trump defended the re-tweet on Tuesday,\u00a0Ure\u00f1a added: \"Might be hard to hear over Air Force One, but that\u2019s the sound of the President of the United States\u2019 credibility blowing in the wind.\" Keep up with this story:Get USA TODAY's Evening Briefing in your inbox Trump has frequently feuded with the Clinton family, particularly during the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 and others have blasted Trump for re-tweeting a no-evidence conspiracy theory somehow tying Epstein's death\u00a0to Clinton. \u201cThis is another example of\u00a0our President using this\u00a0position of public trust to\u00a0attack his political enemies\u00a0with unfounded conspiracy\u00a0theories,\" Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN. Another presidential candidate, Cory Booker, told CNN that Trump is \"whipping people up into anger and worse\" and added that \u201cthis is a very dangerous president that we have right\u00a0now.\" Asked Tuesday if he believes Clinton had anything to do with Epstein's death, Trump said he didn't know. Trump did mention that Epstein, the accused sex trafficker,\u00a0owned\u00a0a private island where \"bad things\" happened. \u201cDid Bill Clinton go to the island?\u201d Trump asked. There is no evidence at all linking Clinton to\u00a0Epstein's death Saturday by suicide, yet Trump on Saturday night re-tweeted the comments of a Twitter user named Terrence K. Williams: \"Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH? Yeah right! How does that happen #JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this! RT if you\u2019re not Surprised.\" Epstein, the financier who had been facing federal sex trafficking charges,\u00a0was not on suicide watch\u00a0when he was found dead\u00a0in his jail cell early Saturday, officials said. Other conspiracy theorists on the Internet are trying to link Epstein's death to Trump, but there is no evidence of that either. Like Clinton, Trump was once friends with Epstein. After his remarks on Epstein, Trump departed for\u00a0Monaca, Pa., about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, where he will tour\u00a0the soon-to-be completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. Trump plans to discuss his support for \"expanding domestic manufacturing and energy production,\" the White House said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Sunday dismissed polls that have found growing support for his impeachment as a new Fox News poll found that\u00a049% of registered voters think he should be removed from office. \"You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump told reporters when asked about the surveys outside the White House. \"I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\" Trump said \"the real polls\" that came out that same morning showed that \"people don't want anything to do with impeachment.\" But the president did not explain what polls he was referring to. Trump is currently facing an impeachment inquiry for allegedly using military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating potential interference in the U.S. 2016 election and allegations involving former Vice President Joe Biden. Despite several witnesses who have appeared to corroborate the allegations against Trump, the 49% who said they want the president\u00a0removed\u00a0from office\u00a0actually represented a two-point drop from the previous Fox News poll in early October. When asked if there was a chance that new evidence could sway their opinion on impeachment, 57% of those who opposed it said there was nothing that could get them to change their minds. Thirty-four percent said new evidence could make them support impeachment. Sixty percent of voters said they thought Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and 52% believed he held up military aid to add pressure for Ukraine to do it and 46% said the affair had worsened their opinion of Trump. Trump and his Republican defenders have dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" but a\u00a0majority (52%) of voters said it was legitimate. Thirty-nine percent said it was a \"bogus attempt to undermine Trump's presidency.\" Forty-three percent said it was better to leave Trump's fate up to the voters in 2020 even if the House decides it found enough evidence to impeach while 42% thought lawmakers should remove him. His job approval rating was 42%, his lowest mark in a Fox News poll since February 2018. Biden is still the Democrat who is most likely to defeat Trump in a head-to-head matchup, according to the poll. Fifty-one percent of registered voters said they would vote for Biden in that scenario\u00a0and 39% said they would vote for Trump. Biden's lead remained strong among registered independents, 33%-23%, but 20% of them preferred\u00a0\"other\" to him or Trump and 16% said they didn't know who they would pick. Trump trailed in almost every demographic except among white people, 46% of whom favored the president over Biden. Forty-four percent of white voters chose Biden. Forty-six percent of white women went for Biden while white men supported Trump\u00a0by an 11-point margin. His strongest support was among white men without a college degree.\u00a0Fifty percent of them favored Trump. Thirty-seven percent picked Biden.\u00a0White evangelicals chose Trump\u00a068%-24%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has\u00a0finished second in many recent primary polls, also bested Trump in a hypothetical matchup, but by a more modest 46%-41% margin. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont beat Trump 49%-41% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg tied him at 41%. The poll found former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not a candidate, with a two-point edge over Trump, 43%-41%. Biden was the strong favorite in the primary field among likely Democratic voters at 31%. Next was Warren at 21%, followed by Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Ninety-seven percent of those voters said it was important that the Democratic nominee be able to defeat Trump \u2013 80% said it was \"extremely important,\" 14% said it was \"very\" important and 4% said it was \"somewhat\" important. On the other hand, 42% said it was \"extremely\" important that the candidate share their views on major issues, while 40% said it was \"very\" important. Sixty-nine percent of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with their primary options, while 28% said they wished they had other choices. Former first lady Michelle Obama has been floated as a potential candidate despite her insistence that she would not run. The poll found that 50% of Democrats would \"definitely\" vote for her and an additional 39% would consider it. If Clinton were to get in the race, 27% said she had their vote but 30% said they would never vote for her. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hinted last month that he might enter the race if Biden struggles. Six percent of Democratic voters said they would definitely support him, while 32% said they would consider it and another 32% said he would never win their vote. Biden did not appear to be negatively impacted by Trump's accusations of impropriety surrounding his son, Hunter Biden, who held a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father was working to convince\u00a0that country to tackle corruption. Officials in Ukraine and the U.S. did not find the Bidens\u00a0were guilty of any wrongdoing. Nearly 60% of voters said it was not appropriate for the children of political leaders to have business dealings in other countries. But only 11% of Democratic voters said they were less likely to vote for Biden because of the allegations, while 65% said it made no difference and 21% said Trump's attacks had made them more likely to vote for Biden.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's former deputy national security adviser defied a subpoena Monday in the House impeachment inquiry, where he was expected to be asked\u00a0about withholding military aid for Ukraine while the president urged that country to investigate his political rival. An attorney for Charles Kupperman, who served as deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton before both men left the White House in September, sent a letter to the House Intelligence Committee's counsel Sunday that Kupperman would wait for a court ruling in a lawsuit he filed\u00a0before he would appear\u00a0before the congressional panels. The lawsuit, filed\u00a0Friday in U.S. District Court,\u00a0asked\u00a0a judge to decide whether he should testify\u00a0because he's\u00a0worried any decision he makes \"will inflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President.\" Kupperman\u00a0noted in the 17-page filing that if he defies Trump, he could hurt the president's ability to receive confidential advice from top aides. But if he defies the House subpoena, he could impede their constitutional duty to investigate potential impeachment and could be subject to criminal penalties for contempt. Kupperman said he didn't take a position on whether the executive or legislative branch should prevail, but that the judicial branch should resolve the dispute. \"We want to assure your clients, again, that it is not Dr. Kupperman who contests your clients' constitutional claim. It is President Trump,\" Kupperman's lawyer, Charles Cooper,\u00a0wrote in the letter. \"If your clients' position on the merits of this issue is correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the Court's judgement.\" Kupperman\u2019s testimony\u00a0could potentially provide lawmakers with more information about the debate over Ukraine policy that other witnesses have said was guided by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The chairmen of the three committees \u2013 Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y, of Foreign Affairs; Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of Intelligence; and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., of Oversight \u2013 wrote Kupperman a letter Saturday saying the lawsuit was meritless and warning that his defiance of the subpoena could be evidence of contempt. The three said the deposition would start on time and he should be there. \u201cDr. Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit \u2013 lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House \u2013 is an obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen wrote. On Monday, Schiff reiterated this point after Kupperman did not show up. \"The lawsuit that Dr. Kupperman filed in District Court has no basis in law. A private citizen cannot sue the Congress to try to avoid coming in when they're served with a lawful subpoena,\" Schiff\u00a0said, adding that they would \"not allow\" the White House and others to drag out the impeachment inquiry \u2014 rather, his absence has provided \"additional evidence of obstruction.\" But Republicans said the testimony has shown the president is innocent and impeachment unnecessary, in the words of Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we bring this charade to a close,\u201d he said. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight panel, accused Democrats of leaking selective materials to reporters after holding closed meetings. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\" Jordan said. \"We think this whole thing is a charade.\" Whistleblower:Watchdogs rebuke DOJ's handling of whistleblower letter at heart of Trump impeachment probe Three key committees\u00a0\u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence\u00a0and Oversight and Reform\u00a0\u2013 are investigating how Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid during the summer while also urging Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. An official impeachment inquiry of Trump began Sept. 24. Democrats contend the effort could be an impeachable abuse of power. But House Republicans have accused Democrats of selectively leaking snippets of testimony from the closed-door sessions to make the president look bad. Trump has vigorously defended his authority to urge the investigation of corruption and called the inquiry a partisan \"witch hunt.\" Kupperman left the White House days after Bolton, who either resigned, according to his own account, or was fired, according to Trump,\u00a0because he \"disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.\" GOP protest:Republicans say Trump impeachment probe is happening in 'secret,' but 47 GOP lawmakers have access Bolton, who may also be called to testify, opposed Giuliani's influence in pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukraine energy company. Bolton urged other officials to report their concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to witnesses in the House inquiry witnesses. Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council\u00a0senior director for Europe and Russia, who told lawmakers Oct. 14 that Bolton said he wasn\u2019t part of \u201cwhatever drug deal\u201d that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were \u201ccooking up,\" according to her testimony. And Bolton reportedly referred to Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\" according to Hill. Bolton told her to notify NSC lawyer John Eisenberg about a July 10 White House meeting of officials dealing on Ukraine. Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, also told lawmakers Oct. 22 that Bolton directed Hill to \u201cbrief the lawyers\u201d about the \u201cdrug deal\u201d he referenced in the July 10 meeting. Bolton became \u201cso irritated\u201d about the proposal to require Ukraine investigations\u00a0before agreeing to an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelensky that Bolton \u201cabruptly ended the meeting,\u201d according to Taylor. Bolton also opposed a call between Trump and Zelensky out of concern it \u201cwould be a disaster,\u201d Taylor said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Adding fuel to the fire in the highly controversial debate over free speech and politics on social media, the CEO of President Donald Trump's preferred outlet says the company will no longer accept political ads. \"We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in a tweetstorm Wednesday. \"A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money,\" Dorsey continued. The ban will go into place in November. Dorsey wrote, \"We\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\" Twitter's recent decision differentiates itself from other companies that have resisted the push to stop taking political ads.\u00a0Facebook is currently in a debate over\u00a0the spread of misinformation through ads from political campaigns. The social media company has reiterated it does not think it should be the gatekeeper of political speech. Several hundred Facebook employees have noted their disagreement with the decision\u00a0in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. When Zuckerberg was recently testifying on Capitol Hill, Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0asked him if she could \u201crun advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d \u201cProbably\u201d was one of Zuckerberg responses. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. Dorsey clarified\u00a0details about Twitter's thoughts behind the decision, stating that the company \"considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too.\" \"A final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address,\" Dorsey concluded. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in on Twitter, saying \"This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world.

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 It was more positive than the last sporting event he went to. President Donald Trump walked into Madison Square Garden and was received with a mix reaction Saturday night at UFC 244 in Madison Square Garden. Taking a break from an ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington, Trump visited New York to take in the mixed martial arts event headlined by a bout between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz. Many cheered his arrival and waved, pulling out their phones to take photos. Many, however, did boo his presence. While the President walked in, the PA system in the stadium loudly cranked out rock and roll music, drowning out much of the crowd\u2019s reaction. Trump smiled and waved at the crowd and took his seat on the floor right by the octagon, the ring where the fights take place. UFC president Dana White said after the event that the Secret Service wanted Trump to watch from a suite, but he said Trump \"never listens to them\u00a0anyway,\"\u00a0and insisted he watch from the floor. Trump sat in the second row. According to the White House pool report, Trump sat with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Mark Meadows, Rep. Peter King, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Trump became the first sitting president to ever attend a mixed martial arts event. He walked out onto the floor at 9:52 p.m. ET. Masdival won the main event\u00a0by a doctor's stoppage after the third round. Immediately after the fight ended, Trump was escorted out of the arena\u00a0at around 12:49 p.m. In addition to the loud music that played when Trump walked in, the video board inside the arena never showed Trump, though the pay-per-view broadcast did show him on screen. When asked if the decision to not show Trump on the video board was intentional to avoid a potential negative reaction from the crowd, White deflected and said he thought Trump's entrance in the arena sufficed to honor the President. \"Whoever you are ... this is America,\" White said in a press conference after the event. \"You believe what you want. If you want to boo, you boo. If you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t. As an American you can do whatever you want. You can choose whatever side you want to be on. I feel like these days, we live in a world where you can\u2019t say, 'I\u2019m a Trump guy,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Hillary guy,\u2019 or whatever your deal is. This is America, you do what you want. \"So I just felt that we were going to walk in and whatever happens, happens.\" Trump's attendance comes just days after he indicated that he was transferring his official residence from New York City to Palm Beach, Florida, at his Mar-a-Lago Club. On Friday, Trump posted a four-tweet thread in which he said he loved the city, but it \"can never be great again under the current leadership\" of Governor Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Bill de Blasio. There is a break in the impeachment proceedings after the House of Representatives adopted rules for how the Democrats will conduct the public phase of the investigation with a 232-196 vote that was almost entirely along party lines. Trump\u2019s reaction from the crowd was certainly more favorable than the one he received Sunday in Washington when he was introduced during Game 5 of the World Series between the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals. The crowd in Nationals Park pelted him with thundering boos and chants of \"lock him up,\" a reference to the motto he used against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during 2016. UFC, likely thanks to Trump's ties to White, is a much friendlier environment for the President. \"Shoutout to that boy, Donald Trump,\" heavyweight Derrick Lewis told UFC\u2019s Joe Rogan in his post-match interview after he defeated Blagoy Ivanov. \"I know everything ain\u2019t going good in the White House, but\u00a0(expletive), he gotta turn that (expletive) around in 2020.\" Outside of Madison Square Garden, there was a heightened police presence, with NYPD patrol stationed every half-block surrounding the arena. A stretch of steel barricades encased the arena. Helicopters circled overhead. At entrances, authorities of the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration and the U.S. Secret Service were identified by patches on their jackets and vests, helping screen attendees and other personnel. On the corner of 31st Street and 8th Avenue, a crowd of about 100 protesters gathered to demonstrate. One group held up a series of white poster boards. Each one had its own thick, black letter. Together, they spelled \"#OUTNOW!\" One protester shouted into a megaphone, \"Danger, danger, there\u2019s a fascist in the White House.\" Later, they resorted to a different call: \"Trump out now.\" Other protesters held orange signs that said \"Trump/Pence \u00a1FUERA YA!\u201d, Spanish for \"out now.\" A few held up ones that said: \"HEADLOCK HIM UP.\" The protesters assembled from two groups, Refuse Facism and Rise and Resist. The presidential motorcade sped past an 8th Avenue completely blocked off from regular traffic at around 8:55 p.m., well within sight of the protesters. As the cars rolled south, the crowd jeered. It wasn\u2019t only protesters, however, who greeted Trump at the Garden. A smaller group of supporters, many wearing red hats with Trump\u2019s slogan of \"Make America Great Again\" also gathered. Trump has long been connected to White, who has often publicly supported Trump and his presidential campaigns. On Feb. 23, 2001, Trump hosted \"UFC 30: Battle at the Boardwalk\" at a hotel he used to own, the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J. That came at a time when UFC was still a burgeoning sports franchise. White has credited Trump for helping to elevate the franchise to what it is today, for Trump\u2019s willingness to host events at a time when White said there was a \"stigma\" attached to the sport. He even spoke on behalf of Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. \"I was happy and proud that the crowd here in New York treated him with respect,\" White said. \"It just made the night so cool.\" Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.",

      "content": "CONCORD, N.H.\u00a0\u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders rallied hundreds of supporters outside the New Hampshire capital when the senator formally filed to compete in the state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary. A howling crowd cheered South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as he walked through the statehouse to file his paperwork. When it was Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's turn, he wound up with about a dozen supporters and a pep talk from Secretary of State Bill Gardner, the dean of the New Hampshire primary. \"Giving the little guy a chance, that's what it's about,\" Gardner assured Bennet, who sits at about 1% in most polls. Voters cast ballots in less than three months, and the Democratic primary is still crowded with little guys. Roughly a half-dozen candidates in the very bottom tier of the Democratic presidential primary are soldiering on, hoping that even after months of campaigning without catching fire that there's still a chance. Their resolve reflects, in part, some Democrats' insistence that the lineup of top contenders is deeply flawed and the race is primed for some late twists and turns. \"I truly believe that that person is as likely to be someone polling at 1% today as it is to be the people that are leading in the race today,\" Bennet told reporters after filing his paperwork. \"Stranger things have happened than that.\" Candidates like Bennet have some reason for optimism. Polls show many Democratic voters, even in early-voting states, have not made up their minds. In Iowa, the first state to weigh in, the front of the pack is crowded, another sign of ambiguity, some argue. Worries about the strength of the front-runners prompted Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, to move toward a bid, threatening to expand the field just as the party thought it would be winnowing. More:A visual guide to the candidates' views on health care The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide Some higher-profile aspirants, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand or former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, weren't able to stick it out, after months of poor polling and lackluster fundraising. Some middle-tier candidates, meanwhile, have had to scale back their operations. California Sen. Kamala Harris pulled staff from New Hampshire this past week, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro cut positions there and in early-voting South Carolina. But Bennet and others seemed to have prepared for a long, very slow burn. Bennet and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock never expected to raise much money and built small-scale operations that could carry them until the first part of February, when Iowa and then New Hampshire vote. \"Everybody goes up and down, and what I need to be is organizing and catching fire as voting starts,\" said Bullock, another candidate mired in the bottom tier who has announced an initial $500,000 advertising campaign in Iowa. Bennet and Bullock stand out in the crowded bottom tier as two well-regarded moderate politicians who got into the race late \u2014 in May \u2014 and appear to have the same strategy: wait for former Vice President Joe Biden's support to collapse and hope they're the best centrist standing. A Bloomberg bid would immediately add another contender \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 to the competition on that front, though the former mayor's team says he will likely stay out of early states. Other perennial 1% polling candidates have plans that are far less clear. They include spiritualist and best-selling author Marianne Williamson, who moved from Los Angeles to Iowa for the race; former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just concluded a walk across New Hampshire to attempt to draw attention to his campaign; and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, a wealthy businessman who is self-funding much of his race. Delaney explained his continued campaign with a \"why not?\" rationale. After millions spent and countless hours of time, \"it just seems kind of crazy for me to get out before the caucus,\" he said. Looking for hope, Bennet has clung to the example of Gary Hart, a U.S. senator from Colorado who was considered a longshot White House hopeful in 1984 when he stunned the political world by winning New Hampshire. Hart, whose picture is on the wall of Gardner's office, has endorsed Bennet and recently wrote an opinion piece for USA Today urging people not to write off his younger protege. Hart, however, was not shut out of most of the primary debates, as Bennet and Bullock have been this year. The Democratic National Committee's increasingly rigorous polling and fundraising criteria are a new attempt to shrink a historically large field. And Hart, in the end, found there were limits to what an underdog can achieve in a presidential primary. He ultimately lost his bid for the nomination to Walter Mondale, the party's former vice president and heir apparent. (Hart's 1988 campaign for the nomination was undone by a sex scandal.) Still, Bennet's team notes that there has been no dominating political presence in their party's primary, like Mondale or Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were in 2008. \"This is the most unsettled field ever,\" said Craig Hughes, a top Bennet strategist. \"The dynamics are unlike anything we've ever seen.\" Hughes proudly noted the one sign of movement in the race: The Bennet campaign is shopping for new office space as it expands in New Hampshire. One of the spots it toured last week had just been vacated by the formerly top-tier Harris campaign.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne The White House released photos\u00a0they said show President Donald Trump\u00a0watching the U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi unfold. Trump announced the U.S. operation on Sunday morning. Trump said Sunday that he watched as U.S. forces cornered al-Baghdadi in a dead-end tunnel, where the ISIS terrorist detonated a vest he was wearing, killing himself and several others. No U.S. forces were lost, Trump said. The photo shows national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper,\u00a0Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and Deputy Director for Special Operations on the Joint Staff Marcus Evans. They all face the direction of the camera, appearing to watch the raid. \"The U.S. personnel were incredible,\" Trump said. \"I got to watch \u00a0much of it.\" Trump said that his view from the Situation Room was \"as though you were watching a movie.\" Trump described al-Baghdadi running in the tunnel, \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\" The president said that al-Baghdadi \"died like a dog.\" Trump also suggested that the footage of al-Baghdadi's death should be released so that his followers can see how he died. It's not USA TODAY's policy to run White House hand out images. An exception was made in this case because of the newsworthiness of the image. Twitter users compared the White House photos to those taken during the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, ordered by former President Barack Obama. One iconic photo taken during that attack was taken by then-White House photographer Pete Souza. It shows Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with other members of the national security team. During his announcement, Trump suggested that al-Baghdadi's death was more significant than that of bin Laden. Son of Osama bin Laden \"Hamza bin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\" Trump said. \"This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country, a caliphate. And was trying to do it again.\" In 2012 Trump repeatedly tweeted that Obama should not be given credit for the operation against bin Laden.",

Before his account went private, USA TODAY Sports reviewed past tweets from Drake, which included\u00a0messages claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and a tweet to Hillary Clinton calling her an\u00a0\"(expletive) liar.\" The Major League\u00a0Umpires Association released a statement on its Facebook page acknowledging Drake's tweet: \"Rob is a passionate individual and an outstanding umpire. He chose the wrong way to convey his opinion about our great country.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The first votes will be cast in the 2020 Democratic primary in less than three\u00a0months, and the 10 candidates on the debate stage Wednesday night were all looking for a breakout moment. While the field has grown and shrunk repeatedly in the past few weeks, with candidates dropping out and jumping in, the candidates on stage in Atlanta have all been in this race for months. News moves fast:OnPolitics newsletter brings it all to your inbox Here's an early take on the winners and losers: The Minnesota senator was ready Wednesday night. She got laughs and cheers for her answer when asked to follow\u00a0up about her recent comments that a female candidate with Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s experience probably would not have made it to the debate stage. After clarifying that she believed\u00a0Buttigieg is indeed qualified, Klobuchar doubled down on her belief that women\u00a0are held to a different standard. \"Otherwise, we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,'\u00a0which we can't do because it has all been men,\" she quipped, adding that female candidates \u201chave to work harder, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d But if voters worry that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, she concluded, \u201cNancy Pelosi does it every single day.\" It landed with the audience. Buttigieg has rocketed\u00a0to lead\u00a0some polls in Iowa\u00a0and New Hampshire, and came into Wednesday night's event with a target on his back. But\u00a0he left the debate stage mostly unscathed;\u00a0Notably, none of\u00a0the other top-tier candidates went on the offensive against him. When Sen. Kamala Harris was asked about Buttigieg's campaign's use of a stock image of a Kenyan woman on a campaign site, she\u00a0simply said she believed he had apologized and moved on to talk about larger issues. He's out:Wayne Messam ends long-shot bid for presidency When rebutting\u00a0criticism that\u00a0he has dealt only with small issues as a mayor, Buttigieg stated that\u00a0\"Frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.\" In response to critiques of his experience from Klobuchar and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Buttigieg said, \"There\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\" Buttigieg certainly has an uphill climb in several states, and a long way to go in earning support from black voters, but the widespread attacks on him that were expected Wednesday didn't come\u00a0to fruition. Harris needed a strong night\u00a0\u2014\u00a0she has recently cut staff and shifted resources to Iowa, but still trails the front-runners there and nationally by double digits. The California senator had clear and concise answers, while also providing a few zingers. She\u00a0didn\u2019t mince words as she went on the attack over Trump\u2019s policy in North Korea following reports that Kim Jong Un has no interest in another summit with the president. \u201cDonald Trump got punked,\u201d Harris said to laughs in the crowd. \u201cHe has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d She had a strong moment later in the night, talking about politicians showing up for black people\u00a0not just during campaign season, and drawing\u00a0attention to the fact that black women in particular\u00a0have historically been the backbone of the Democratic Party. He's in:Deval Patrick, former Massachusetts governor, enters 2020 presidential race \"At some point, folks get tired of just saying, 'Oh, thank me for showing up' and say, 'Show up for me,'\" she said. Harris was ready when challenged by Gabbard, who has fundraised\u00a0off comments from Hillary Clinton that were initially\u00a0erroneously reported as her saying\u00a0Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard as a potential third-party candidate. Gabbard said Wednesday that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d More:2020 debate: Tulsi Gabbard prompts a brawl with Kamala Harris over dig at Democratic Party \u201cI think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on this stage that is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,\u201d Harris\u00a0shot back. The former Housing and Urban Development Secretary was a notable absence from the stage after participating in each previous debate. Castro is the only candidate still in the race who was on the debate stage in October, but not Wednesday. Castro also\u00a0has not hit either the donor threshold or poll threshold\u00a0needed to appear in the December debate, though he still has time. In the past month, Castro's\u00a0campaign had to to\u00a0lay\u00a0off staff in two early primary states, New Hampshire and South Carolina, to focus instead on Iowa. The news came after the\u00a0campaign asked\u00a0supporters to help him raise $800,000 in 10 days to stay in the race. With fewer than 80 days until the first votes are counted in Iowa, Castro is trailing many of his Democratic rivals in both national and early-state polls. The window for his campaign to make a splash is closing and missing out on the debate stage means fewer voters will get a chance to hear his message. Castro said Tuesday night that while he wasn't on the debate stage, he's \"shaped a lot of the debate already.\" His campaign also noted that his name was trending on Twitter, even without being on stage. Issues related to immigration and gun violence were largely ignored during Wednesday's debate. The issues have\u00a0been winners in previous debates, where there were substantive exchanges about\u00a0undocumented immigrants and issues at the southern border, and passionate discussions following a string of mass shootings. Sanders mentioned immigration in his closing statement, saying, \"I am the son of an immigrant. I will stand with the some 11 million undocumented immigrants of this country. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness of Trump, and will end hate in America.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked at\u00a0one point whether she would keep any parts of the border wall up if the Trump administration builds new sections. More:Democratic candidates traded barbs and attacks but agreed Trump should be impeached \"A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day,\" she said passionately. But in her closing statement, she pointed out there hadn't been any talk about gun violence and little talk about immigration. The lack of substantive conversation\u00a0around immigration and gun violence came during the first debate, where Castro, the only Latino candidate and a candidate who has shaped much of the discussion on immigration, wasn't on the stage. Also missing from the stage was former Rep. Beto O'Rourke,\u00a0who has been an outspoken advocate of gun control but who recently ended his presidential bid. In early August, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso\u00a0was the site of a mass shooting where\u00a022 people were killed. After the shooting, he took time away from the campaign trail. When he returned, he advocated a mandatory buyback program in which gun owners would be required to sell certain weapons back to the government. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said during the September debate, which came weeks after the\u00a0El Paso shooting. Three of the four candidates who haven't yet qualified for the December debate were also the three\u00a0candidates who spoke the least Wednesday. Businessmen Andrew Yang and\u00a0Tom Steyer, and Gabbard each spoke for less than 10 minutes, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. All three have so far failed to meet one or both of the thresholds for the December debate, and are looking for a breakout moment to gain momentum. Gabbard sparred with not only Harris,\u00a0but also\u00a0Buttigieg. The two veterans clashed after Gabbard implied Buttigieg wanted to use the U.S. military to combat the drug cartels in Mexico. He denied the\u00a0claim and called\u00a0it \u201coutlandish.\u201d Steyer made it clear that though much of his campaign is self-funded, he isn't going anywhere. He has met the polling requirements for the December debate, but not the donor threshold. Yang made good use of his time, speaking concisely about his vision, and also got a few laughs, like when he quipped that if he talked to Russian Vladimir Putin after he won, the first thing he'd say is, \"Sorry I beat your guy.\" But it's\u00a0a pivotal time in the race where candidates need to truly swim, and not just float. And the lack of speaking time could prove detrimental as the lower-polling candidates fight for attention. For just the\u00a0third time in U.S. history and the\u00a0first time in this election cycle, Wednesday's\u00a0debate was moderated by an all-female panel. The moderators were MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell and Rachel Maddow, NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker, and\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reporter Ashley Parker. The\u00a0panel asked questions about abortion, the #MeToo movement,\u00a0paid family leave and child care, white supremacy, and housing, several of which had been largely ignored at previous debates. The moderators also got love from fellow journalists and non-journalists alike on social media.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0Roger Stone,\u00a0an ally of President Donald Trump, was found guilty Friday of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation into Russia to protect Trump\u00a0and his presidential campaign. The jury's verdict came after about eight hours of deliberation.\u00a0Stone, a fixture in GOP politics\u00a0who worked on campaigns stretching back to Richard Nixon's, now faces the possibility of prison. He's the latest Trump ally to be found guilty in cases sprouting\u00a0from a\u00a0special counsel's investigation into\u00a0Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The verdict, reached by a jury of nine women and three men, comes amid an impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump sought to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating a political rival. Witnesses testified in closed-door sessions on Capitol Hill that the White House dangled critical military aid and an official visit in orderto get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for\u00a0the Democratic presidential nomination.\u00a0Those hearings went public this week, when witnesses testified\u00a0Wednesday and Friday. Impeachment hearing:Ambassador Yovanovitch says Trump's attacks on her 'intimidating' As the verdicts were read, Stone stood expressionless\u00a0with\u00a0his hands in his pockets. Shortly after, a petition started to circulate calling for Trump to pardon Stone. Trump took to Twitter, decrying a \"double standard\"\u00a0and said\u00a0law enforcement officials lied, including Robert Mueller, the special counsel who headed the Russia investigation. Stone's trial ends after\u00a0a week marked with Nixon quotes, references to the Mafia movie \"The Godfather\" and a colorful witness who offered to do a Bernie Sanders impression before an unamused federal judge. The proceedings attracted the attendance of controversial figures, including alt-right firebrands Milo Yiannopoulos and Jacob Wohl. Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser who attended the trial, said he was escorted out of the courtroom by a federal marshal for turning his back on the jurors as they walked out. \"Normal Americans don\u2019t stand a chance with an Obama judge and a Washington jury,\" he tweeted. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson allowed Stone to go home as he awaits his sentencing, scheduled for\u00a0Feb. 6. A gag order preventing him from talking about the case remains in effect.\u00a0He and his attorneys did not comment as they left the courthouse. The\u00a0proceedings revealed information about\u00a0the Trump campaign's efforts to seek advance knowledge of\u00a0emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, which hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton when Trump was trailing in the polls. Testimony\u00a0indicated\u00a0these efforts involved the candidate himself. Analysis:As public impeachment hearings open, the surprise was that there was a surprise Stone, 67,\u00a0stood trial on accusations that he repeatedly lied to Congress about his back-channel efforts to push for the release of those emails. He\u00a0was accused of urging a possible congressional witness to either lie or scuttle his testimony. \"Roger Stone lied \u2026 because the truth looked bad for the Trump campaign and the truth looked bad for Donald Trump,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aaron\u00a0Zelinsky told jurors. Defense attorneys urged jurors to focus on Stone's state of mind, arguing he did not willfully mislead Congress.\u00a0The claim that Stone lied to protect the Trump campaign was \"absolutely false,\" Bruce Rogow told jurors. \"It makes no sense,\" Rogow said, adding that the campaign was long over and Trump was already president when Stone testified before Congress in 2017. \"Why would Stone lie, why would he make stuff up? ... There is no purpose, there is no reason, there is no motive.\" Stone was found guilty of seven charges:\u00a0one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. The maximum penalty for all counts totals 50 years in prison, though first-time offenders generally receive significantly lower sentences. Jurors heard from five government witnesses and saw dozens of emails and text messages that prosecutors said proved\u00a0Stone lied. His defense attorneys\u00a0did not call any witnesses, and Stone, known for his flamboyance and combativeness, did not testify. Roger Stone:Prosecution says he lied to Congress to protect Trump; defense says there was no motive Defense attorneys sought to poke holes in the government's case by casting the emails and text messages as statements that, while at times crude,\u00a0lacked any \"malignant\" context. The charges stemmed from Stone's interactions with the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, around the time that WikiLeaks, an anti-secrecy group, began publishing troves of damaging emails about the Democratic National Committee and\u00a0Clinton. Prosecutors said Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee about his efforts to push for the release of those emails. They said he lied about the identity of the person who tipped him off about WikiLeaks' plans \u2013 his so-called intermediary. They said he falsely\u00a0denied talking to the Trump campaign about what he learned\u00a0and falsely told Congress he did not have text messages and emails in which he talked about WikiLeaks. Prosecutors said Stone sought to silence a witness who could expose these lies by using threatening references from \"The Godfather\" movie. Stone urged the witness in multiple emails to follow the steps of Frank Pentangeli, a character in \"The Godfather II\" who lied to Congress to avoid incriminating Mafia boss Michael Corleone. Defense attorneys sought to discredit that witness, a comedian and radio host who\u00a0Stone told the House committee\u00a0was his intermediary to WikiLeaks. They said Randy Credico, who said he was never the conduit\u00a0to the group,\u00a0\"played\" Stone and made him believe he had\u00a0back-channel capabilities with WikiLeaks. Movie nights, baseball, phone calls:How Trump is uniting the GOP to fight impeachment Rick Gates, another former campaign official, testified that he overheard then-candidate Trump talking to Stone on the phone in July 2016, shortly after WikiLeaks began publishing the DNC emails. \"More information is coming,\" Trump told Gates after hanging up, according to testimony.\u00a0In written responses to Mueller, Trump said\u00a0he did not recall being told about discussions of the hacked emails. Steve Bannon, the campaign's former chief executive, testified that he and other members of the campaign saw Stone as their \"access point\" to WikiLeaks. Defense attorneys said testimony\u00a0didn't point to a crime. Seeking information that would hurt the opposing party is a staple in political campaigns, they argued. Rogow\u00a0pointed out that Gates, who was\u00a0 charged in the Mueller probe, cooperated\u00a0with prosecutors to avoid prison time. In all, six Trump allies and former campaign aides\u00a0have been\u00a0convicted since 2017 as part of Mueller's Russia investigation. Gates, who\u00a0pleaded guilty to lying to investigators,\u00a0awaits\u00a0sentencing. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, is serving more than seven years in prison after he was convicted of\u00a0several charges, including defrauding banks and taxpayers out of millions of dollars amassed through illicit lobbying. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators about his contacts with a Russian ambassador. He has yet to be sentenced. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, is serving three years in prison after admitting he lied to Congress about plans to build a Trump Tower in Russia. Cohen admitted he was involved in schemes to buy the silence of two women who claimed to have had sexual relationships with Trump. Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who is running for Congress, served a two-week prison sentence\u00a0after admitting he lied to investigators about his contacts with Russians.",

      "content": "Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell received a bit of online attention Thursday during a memorial service for Rep. Elijah Cummings when a pallbearer appeared to refuse to shake the Kentucky Republican's hand. A video posted to Twitter captures the pallbearer walking down a line and shaking the hands of several lawmakers before ignoring an outstretched McConnell's hand. McConnell appears to look somewhat caught off guard and turns to\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer near the end of the 16-second video. McConnell, Schumer, Rep. Mark Meadows, Rep.\u00a0Jim Clyburn\u00a0and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were among several attendees who spoke Thursday as Cummings was\u00a0lying\u00a0in state inside the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who represented parts of Baltimore for 23 years in Congress, died Oct. 17 at the age of 68 due to health complications. Elijah Cummings funeral live updates:Barack Obama, Clintons to honor Maryland congressman He was the first black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol, according to the Congressional Black Caucus. A funeral for Cummings will be held Friday morning at\u00a0the New Psalmist Baptist Church in\u00a0Baltimore, where he worshiped for nearly 40 years. Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton\u00a0are among the dignitaries set to speak during the service. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also slated to speak. During his remarks Thursday, McConnell praised Cummings, who chaired the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \"He knew there was only one reason why a son of sharecroppers, a child who had literally had to bear the injuries of bigotry and segregation, could graduate from law school and eventually chair a powerful committee in Congress,\" McConnell said. \"Only one reason, because principled leaders had fought to give kids like him a chance. \"Chairman Cummings made it his life's work to continue that effort. He climbed the ranks here in the Capitol, not because he outgrew his hometown but because he was so committed to it.\" Cummings lying in state:Elijah Cummings lies in state at Capitol as Congress bids farewell to a 'master of the House' McConnell also noted how Cummings tirelessly worked in 2015 to bring people together in his native Baltimore, where protests raged\u00a0following the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal injury while in police custody. \"By day, the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power,\" McConnell said. \"But every night, he rode the train back home\u00a0and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace.\" McConnell said Cummings had a simple message for the\u00a0angry protesters\u00a0on Baltimore's streets after Gray's death: \"Let's go home. Let's all go home.\" \"Now, our distinguished colleague truly has gone home,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"Home to his father's house.\" Reach Billy Kobin at bkobin@courierjournal.com",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who embraced a reputation as a dirty trickster,\u00a0will stand trial this week\u00a0on accusations\u00a0that he lied about his role as a middleman\u00a0between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential race. Stone, who has maintained his innocence,\u00a0is among the most prominent allies of President Donald Trump\u00a0to be charged\u00a0as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's\u00a0investigation\u00a0into Russia's interference in the presidential\u00a0election. And he's the latest\u00a0to face trial. The spectacle of Stone's trial, which begins with jury selection\u00a0 Tuesday, could reinvigorate the Trump-Russia controversy as the president faces accusations that he sought to have another country, Ukraine, interfere in the 2020 election. Stone will face a jury at a federal courthouse across the street from the Capitol,\u00a0where an\u00a0impeachment inquiry has\u00a0yielded testimony\u00a0about the Trump administration's efforts to pressure\u00a0Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The 67-year-old flamboyant Trump ally faces\u00a0seven charges:\u00a0one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements\u00a0and one count of witness tampering. The maximum penalty for all the charges totals\u00a050 years in prison, though first-time offenders usually are sentenced to much less. The government's evidence against Stone includes emails and text messages that show his efforts\u00a0to learn about WikiLeaks' plan to release damaging emails about Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election.\u00a0Prosecutors said they have messages in which Stone pressured a witness to scuttle his congressional testimony. Prosecutors contend\u00a0Stone knew WikiLeaks had damaging information about Clinton's campaign before the anti-secrecy group released\u00a0a trove of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Stone told senior Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016, according to prosecutors. After the group published the DNC emails in late July,\u00a0a campaign official\u00a0was directed to contact Stone and ask about additional releases, according to court records. Prosecutors have not said\u00a0who directed that official. Mueller's two-year investigation found that Russian intelligence stole the emails and passed them to WikiLeaks. Gag order:'What am I supposed to do with you?' Judge bars Roger Stone from social media The indictment\u00a0cites\u00a0several emails and text messages between Stone and two associates: Jerome Corsi, a right-wing political commentator, and Randy Credico, a radio host who interviewed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\u00a0Prosecutors allege Stone\u00a0asked the two men, neither of whom have been charged with a crime, to pass messages to Assange. Prosecutors say Corsi\u00a0alerted Stone in August 2016 that WikiLeaks planned\u00a0to release more emails. \"Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps,\" Corsi said in an email, referring to Assange's\u00a0self-imposed exile at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. \"Impact planned to be very damaging.\" Stone \u00a0said privately and publicly that\u00a0he had been in contact with WikiLeaks, though the group denied it. He\u00a0claimed he communicated with WikiLeaks through Credico, whom Stone described as an intermediary\u00a0to Assange, according to court records. In early October 2016, Credico texted Stone: \"big news Wednesday ... now pretend u don't know me ... Hillary's campaign will die this week.\" A high-ranking Trump campaign official\u00a0emailed Stone days later, asking about the status of future email dumps from WikiLeaks, according to court records. Stone said WikiLeaks would release \"a load every week going forward.\" The group published the first set of emails stolen from Clinton\u00a0campaign chairman John Podesta. An\u00a0associate of the high-ranking Trump campaign official texted Stone:\u00a0\"well done.\" Prosecutors say Stone tried to obstruct investigations\u00a0into Russia's interference by lying to Congress and the FBI about his interactions with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. Stone told members of the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that\u00a0he did not have advance knowledge of the hacking of Podesta's emails.\u00a0Stone denied talking to people about the stolen documents, though prosecutors point to \"numerous emails and text messages\" showing otherwise, according to court records. Prosecutors allege Stone\u00a0tried to convince Credico to lie. \"Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan,\" Stone texted, referring to the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Roger Stone indicted:Charges shed new light on Trump campaign\u2019s link to WikiLeaks He\u00a0told Credico to follow the lead of Frank Pentangeli, a mob leader in \"The Godfather\" trilogy who lied to Congress to avoid incriminating Mafia boss Michael Corleone. \"Start practicing your Pantagele [sic],\" Stone said in a text message in early December 2017, shortly after Credico was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee.\u00a0\"And if you turned over anything to the FBI you're a fool.\" Credico, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right, texted Stone later that month:\u00a0\"You should be honest w fbi.\" The two men kept in touch. Their messages became increasingly combative and, in Stone's case, threatening, according to court records. \"You are a rat. A stoolie,\" says an April 2018 email in which Stone threatened to take Credico's dog from him.\u00a0On the same day, he allegedly wrote, \"I am so ready. Let's get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\" Credico emailed Stone in\u00a0May 2018, saying, \"You've opened yourself to perjury charges like an idiot.\" Stone replied,\u00a0\"You are so full of [expletive]. You got nothing.\" Stone was arrested at his Florida home in January. Prosecutors wanted\u00a0to\u00a0play a video clip from \"The Godfather\" at Stone's trial,\u00a0but\u00a0U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the government's request, ruling\u00a0the clip would be prejudicial against Stone. The four-minute clip shows\u00a0Pentangeli looking at Corleone and telling lawmakers\u00a0he didn't know of the Mafia boss's role in\u00a0organized crime. Prosecutors will be allowed\u00a0to show jurors a transcript of the scene. Stone was barred from using social media after Instagram posts in which he attacked the Russia investigation and accused former officials of treason. One controversial post showed a picture of Jackson next to what appeared to be a gun's crosshairs. Who is Roger Stone?\u00a0Longtime Republican operative worked on campaigns from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump Stone has been a long-standing force in GOP politics, working on\u00a0Republican campaigns from Richard Nixon's \u2013 whose face he had tattooed on his back\u00a0\u2013 to Trump's. He left the Trump campaign in August 2015, though he remained an informal adviser. Five other former Trump campaign allies and aides have been indicted or convicted since 2017 as part of Mueller's Russia investigation. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman,\u00a0is serving more than seven years\u00a0in prison after he was convicted on\u00a0several charges, including defrauding banks and taxpayers out of millions of dollars amassed through illicit lobbying. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn awaits\u00a0sentencing after he pleaded guilty to making false statements\u00a0to investigators about his contacts with a Russian ambassador. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, is serving three years in prison\u00a0after admitting he lied to Congress about plans to build a Trump Tower in Russia.\u00a0Cohen admitted he was involved\u00a0in schemes to buy\u00a0the silence of\u00a0two women who claimed to have had sexual relationships with Trump. Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who is running for Congress,\u00a0served a two-week prison sentence\u00a0last year after admitting he lied to investigators about his contacts with Russians. Another former campaign aide, Rick Gates, pleaded guilty\u00a0to lying to investigators. His sentencing has been put on hold as he cooperates in other cases, including Stone's. He may testify at Stone's trial. Contributing: Bart Jansen, Kevin Johnson and David Jackson",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The anonymous official who has written a scathing account of\u00a0the presidency of Donald Trump suggests the president might refuse to leave office even if convicted in impeachment hearings or defeated narrowly in the 2020 election \u2013 and says Trump\u00a0is preparing his followers to see either outcome as a \u201ccoup\u201d that could warrant resistance. \u201cHe will not exit quietly \u2013 or easily,\u201d the author, self-described as a senior administration official, writes in A Warning, a book that builds on an explosive op-ed by the same unnamed author last year. USA TODAY obtained an early copy of the book. \u201cIt is why at many turns he suggests \u2018coups\u2019 are afoot and a \u2018civil war\u2019 is in the offing. He is already seeding the narrative for his followers \u2013 a narrative that could end tragically.\u201d From 'Anonymous':Read key excerpts from inside Trump White House on Putin, Pence, Hillary As the House of Representatives prepares to open public impeachment hearings Wednesday, the book also says that Trump ordered aides more than a year ago to pursue a \u201cdeliberate and coordinated campaign\u201d to obstruct an impeachment inquiry and other congressional investigations. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has said he is considering obstruction of Congress as a possible\u00a0Article of Impeachment. The book's author is identified only as \u201ca senior official in the Trump administration,\u201d and its forthcoming\u00a0publication has created a firestorm\u00a0over both its\u00a0depiction of a dysfunctional president and\u00a0the decision by the writer to remain anonymous. \"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Many of the disclosures echo news stories that have portrayed the president as\u00a0impulsive, sometimes uninformed and regularly willing to defy established norms. There is already no shortage of books by Trump critics, including former FBI director James Comey and others who have served in his administration, that raise questions about the president's fitness for office. But The\u00a0New York Times op-ed in 2018 and the new book, being published next Tuesday by Twelve, have commanded enormous attention because the author had an inside view, often participating in small White House meetings where crucial decisions were made. The author portrays himself or herself as sharing some policy views with Trump\u00a0and initially having a positive if wary view of the possibilities of his presidency. The author says the intended audience for A Warning isn\u2019t those who closely follow politics but rather those who don't, particularly voters from across the country who were drawn in 2016 to Trump's promise to shake up the establishment. The book says that Trump \"on more than one occasion\" discussed with staffers the possibility of dropping Vice President Mike Pence before the 2020 election. \"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley was under active consideration to step in as vice president, which she did not discourage at first,\" the author writes, saying some advisers argued that putting Haley on the ticket would help the president bolster his support among female voters. In an interview Friday with USA TODAY, Nikki Haley dismissed out of hand the suggestion that she might replace Pence. In her new book, With All Due Respect, Haley offers\u00a0a generally positive portrait of Trump, and the president rewarded her with a friendly tweet urging his millions of followers to buy a copy. Pathway of impeachment:How it works, where we are \"Anonymous\" depicts Trump as impatient, immoral, cruel, even dangerous as he rejects the\u00a0limits placed on presidents by Congress and the courts. As the 2018 midterm elections approached, the book says, the White House counsel\u2019s office began to develop a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d to shield the administration if Democrats gained control of Congress, and with that the ability to launch investigations and issue subpoenas. New lawyers were hired and internal procedures revamped, the author writes. \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t just to prepare for a barrage of legislative requests,\u201d the book says. \u201cIt was a concerted attempt to fend off congressional oversight. When Democrats finally took the House, the unspoken administration policy toward Capitol Hill became: Give as little as possible, wait as long as possible. Even routine inquiries are now routed to the lawyers, who have found unique ways to say \u201cWe can\u2019t right now,\u201d \u201cGive us a few months,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to put\u00a0you on hold,\u201d \u201cProbably not,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cNot a chance in hell.\u201d Trump impeachment inquiry:Early findings and how Republicans are opposing them The author says the administration's refusal to comply with congressional requests and even subpoenas \"go beyond standard practice and have turned into a full block-and-tackle exercise against congressional investigators across an array of Trump administration controversies.\" On the president's actions with Ukraine, now the heart of the impeachment inquiry, the author writes that the idea Trump was trying to battle corruption abroad \u2013 rather than gain some partisan political advantage at home\u00a0\u2013 was \"barely believable to anyone around him.\" But the book provides no\u00a0significant new information or insights into that episode. 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards The author's agent, Matt Latimer, said the author didn't take an advance payment for the book and plans to donate a substantial amount of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that encourage government accountability and an independent press.

      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 The Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration offers\u00a0the biggest launching pad for Democratic presidential candidates hoping to electrify their campaigns in the final sprint to the Iowa caucuses. With just three months to go before Feb. 3, the time for a breakout moment is dwindling, and campaigns will be looking for a boost\u00a0at the state party\u2019s signature fundraiser Friday night. They\u2019ll be hosting block parties, staging\u00a0thousand-person marches and flying in celebrity endorsers to try to signal to\u00a0caucusgoers, donors and pundits that they've got momentum and enthusiasm with them. And those big shows will come even before they take the stage at Wells Fargo Arena in downtown Des Moines, where the Democrats will\u00a0try to wow a 13,000-person crowd and create the kind of moment that helped propel Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy. Obama\u2019s speech at the 2007\u00a0event \u2014 then called the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner \u2014 was\u00a0a clear turning point in his campaign, paving the way to a caucus night win and his eventual nomination and inauguration. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect\u00a0as 14 presidential campaigns descend at once on downtown Des Moines. Since at least 1975, the Iowa Democratic Party has held a fall fundraising dinner. An informal straw poll\u00a0that year\u00a0showed Georgia\u00a0Gov. Jimmy Carter in the lead among Iowa Democrats, launching him into the national news and driving his campaign toward the nomination. Since then, the dinner has been a destination for Democratic presidential candidates seeking that same bump. The\u00a0event\u00a0grew in importance and pageantry\u00a0with each election cycle. Candidates\u00a0brought endorsers, celebrities and politicians to show their electoral might. Hillary Clinton was a\u00a0master of the Jefferson-Jackson pageantry. She hosted the event in\u00a02003 as the former First Lady\u00a0and stole headlines from the presidential candidates. During her own campaign for president in 2007, Clinton brought Grammy Award-winning producer Quincy Jones to the event. Pop star Katy Perry performed a 20-minute concert for the\u00a0senator and her supporters outside the event in 2015. But\u00a0beyond\u00a0the\u00a0glittering fa\u00e7ade of fame, the speeches matter, too. Obama seized the opportunity in 2007 to display his popularity and hammer home his message. He brought in a drum corps to march through downtown, held a rally with an estimated 4,000 supporters, as well as\u00a0musician John Legend, and gave a speech that reverberated through the hall \u2014 and echoed for the rest of his campaign. \u201cI run for the presidency of the United States of America because that's the party America needs us to be right now\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership; a\u00a0party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should; a\u00a0party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change \u2014 change that America can believe in,\u201d Obama said. The Des Moines Register\u2019s political columnist called it a great speech and one of the best of Obama\u2019s campaign. David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s 2008\u00a0campaign manager, told the Register later that \u201cfrom that point on, we had inexorable momentum in Iowa.\" This year\u2019s dinner will be the largest in caucus\u00a0history. With 14 candidates scheduled to attend, the Liberty and Justice Celebration will be twice as large as the biggest Jefferson-Jackson dinners, which topped out at seven\u00a0candidates. To accommodate the large field, the Iowa Democratic Party plans to give each candidate\u00a010 minutes to speak. In 2007, Clinton and Obama both had at least 20 minutes. The crowd of Democratic activists will also be\u00a0larger\u00a0than ever before, said Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Jonah Hermann.\u00a0He estimates there will be \u201cupwards of 13,000\u201d people in attendance. The largest crowd to date came in 2007, when 9,000 attendees turned out. Another major change this year is the new name. The Jefferson-Jackson Dinner was named after two of the party\u2019s most prominent U.S. presidents,\u00a0Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. But in recent years, more and more\u00a0Democrats have steered away from honoring the two men\u00a0because both were slave owners and because of Jackson\u2019s policy of forcibly relocating\u00a0Native\u00a0Americans. Since 2012, nearly a dozen\u00a0state Democratic parties have renamed events previously celebrating the\u00a0two party\u00a0leaders. The Iowa Democratic Party's State\u00a0Central Committee passed a resolution in 2015 to change the name of the annual event.\u00a0This will be the first dinner to bear the new name, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, that the party settled on\u00a0in September. Before the main event begins, some candidates are planning to put on a show \u2014 literally. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, activist Tom Steyer, former housing secretary Julian Castro and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet\u00a0have\u00a0not released their specific pre-party plans to the Des Moines Register. After the Liberty and Justice Celebration, candidates will scatter across Iowa for a\u00a0variety of weekend forums and events. There\u00a0are three\u00a0additional multi-candidate events Saturday \u2014 one in Des\u00a0Moines with NAACP and media organizations;\u00a0and two in\u00a0Cedar Rapids:\u00a0an Abby Finkenauer Fish Fry and a forum with disability activists. In addition to those appearances, there\u00a0are over 40 events scheduled around the state between Saturday and\u00a0Tuesday.",

      "content": "We did it, everyone. We made it to Friday. This is OnPolitics. As the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump entered its fifth\u00a0week, the former top diplomat to Ukraine offered some of the most compelling testimony yet. Bill Taylor, who led diplomatic relations in Ukraine, said it was made clear to the Eastern European country that the release of military aid would be contingent on whether it opened an investigation into an energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son. Taylor said he was told that directly on the phone by U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, who gave his own testimony in the inquiry last week. Another key takeaway from Taylor's testimony was his assessment that the U.S. had two diplomatic channels operating in Ukraine: One that was official, and helmed by the State Department, and a second, unofficial channel\u00a0\"which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, Ambassador (Gordon) Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I subsequently learned, Mr. (Rudy) Giuliani,\" Taylor told congressional members and staff. But the week got really contentious when about three dozen Republicans decided they'd had enough, and pushed\u00a0their way into the secure room where a Defense official was giving testimony. They were upset about what they called a \"secret\" impeachment investigation, but there are still 47 Republicans who have access to the closed-door depositions. Either way, the\u00a0audience of at least one was pleased:\u00a0\"Thank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,\" Trump later tweeted. In political news\u00a0unrelated\u00a0to the impeachment inquiry, the Justice Department's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation has shifted from an administrative review to a criminal probe, a person familiar with the matter said late Thursday.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr\u00a0launched the inquiry in April into whether federal investigators abused their surveillance authority as they\u00a0sought to understand Russia's interference during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has called the investigation a \"witch hunt.\" Rep. Elijah Cummings' legacy and life\u00a0will continue\u00a0to be\u00a0honored Friday morning, as former Presidents\u00a0Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u00a0are set to speak at the late congressman's funeral. Cummings\u00a0laid in state in Statuary Hall Thursday, making him the\u00a0the first black lawmaker to do so in the Capitol, according to the Congressional Black Caucus.

      "content": "Republican Daniel Cameron was elected Kentucky's next attorney general Tuesday \u2014the first African American to ever win a race for the office and the first Republican to do so in over 70 years. Cameron, a 33-year old first-time candidate from Louisville, had about 57%\u00a0of the vote when the Associated Press called the race in his favor, beating Democratic nominee Greg Stumbo \u2014 the former speaker of the House attempting a political comeback after losing his seat three years ago. The Republican will replace Democrat Andy Beshear as attorney general, who was still locked in a tight race\u00a0for\u00a0governor against incumbent Matt Bevin. The former general counsel for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Cameron has worked as an attorney for Frost Brown Todd over the past two years. Cameron said in the campaign that his priorities as attorney general would be to tackle\u00a0Kentucky's opioid epidemic and\u00a0crimes against children, in addition to ensuring Kentucky does not become a so-called \"sanctuary state\" for undocumented immigrants. His campaign's push against illegal immigration tied into Cameron's efforts to nationalize the race, using conservative social issues like abortion and portraying\u00a0himself in ads as a defender of President Donald Trump's agenda. Kentucky Freedom Fund, a PAC affiliated with the Republican Attorneys General Association, spent the most of any group\u00a0in the race on television ads, launching attacks on Stumbo's character, calling him a \"despicable deadbeat\" and referring to him as \"Greg SCUMBO.\" Stumbo, who had previously served for one term as attorney general, attempted to make the race about Cameron's relative lack of legal experience, as he had never prosecuted a case in a courtroom. Cameron's campaign countered that attack by using Stumbo's long career against him, with one ad calling him a \"Frankfort swamp creature.\" Another Cameron ad claimed that\u00a0Stumbo wanted to make Kentucky a sanctuary state because he once supported undocumented immigrants being eligible to receive provisional driver's licenses, which he said would subject the state\u00a0to the import of \"Mexican meth.\" Republicans' efforts to nationalize the race were boosted late in the campaign by highlighting a\u00a0fundraising email written for Stumbo by Hillary Clinton, as well as Trump holding a large rally in Lexington on the eve of the election. Cameron was able to win the Republican nomination in May with the support of his former boss McConnell and the senator's political allies, knocking off a Republican state Sen. Wil\u00a0Schroder. Once sworn into office, Cameron will become just the second African American to ever hold a statewide elected office in Kentucky. Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton, also a Republican, was the first to do so in 2015. Reach reporter Joe Sonka at jsonka@courierjournal.com or 502-582-4472\u00a0and follow him on Twitter at @joesonka.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump's approval rating may be underwater, and about half of the country may want him impeached, but he still has shot to win in the half-dozen\u00a0battleground states that could secure his reelection next year, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College. The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan. Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the\u00a0Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election. The Times said the results of the poll \"suggest that the president\u2019s\u00a0advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole\u00a0remains intact or has even grown\u00a0since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could \u2013 for the third time in the past six elections \u2013 win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\" And The Times\u00a0said the results showed \"little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward\u00a0winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016.\" Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42%\u00a0\u2013 his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018\u00a0\u2013 and his disapproval at 57%. And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%. Forty-nine percent of registered voters said they thought he should be impeached and convicted in the Senate in Sunday's Fox News poll. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president?

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As an impeachment inquiry that threatens Donald Trump's presidency gains steam in the U.S. Capitol, jurors in a trial happening just across the street will soon decide if Roger Stone, the president's ally, lied to Congress to help and protect him. Jurors will start deliberating Thursday after hearing testimonies over the past week. A guilty verdict could send the longtime GOP operative to prison and will make him the latest Trump ally to be convicted of a crime as a result of the special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. An acquittal could reinforce Trump and his allies'\u00a0longstanding claim that the Russia probe\u00a0was a \"witch hunt\" meant to hurt him politically. During closing arguments Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis told jurors that Stone obstructed a congressional investigation to help Trump and his campaign. Stone lied\u00a0to lawmakers repeatedly, depriving them of evidence they needed as they pursued their own investigation into Russia and possible ties to the Trump campaign, Kravis said in a packed federal courtroom. \"A person who is acting in good faith would not say and do the things that Roger Stone said and did ... It shows you exactly what was in his head all along: to obstruct the committee\u2019s investigation,\" Kravis told jurors. Trump:Trump says he's 'too busy' to watch impeachment inquiry hearing, but he's tweeting about it Defense attorney Bruce Rogow\u00a0said the government's assertion that Stone lied to protect the Trump campaign is \"absolutely false.\" \"It makes no sense,\" Rogow told jurors, adding that the campaign was long over and Trump was already president when Stone testified before Congress in 2017. \"Why would Stone lie, why would he make stuff up? ... There is no purpose, there is no reason, there is no motive.\" Stone\u00a0faces seven charges: one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. The allegations stem from Stone's interactions with the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, around the time that WikiLeaks, an anti-secrecy group, began publishing troves of damaging emails about the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton, Trump's presidential rival. Prosecutors said Stone, a fixture in GOP politics known for his flamboyance and combativeness, lied to the House Intelligence Committee about his back-channel efforts to push for the release of those emails. They said\u00a0Stone lied about the identity of the person who first tipped him off about WikiLeaks' plans. They said Stone denied that he passed\u00a0on what he learned to the Trump campaign. And they said Stone\u00a0denied the existence of text messages and emails in which he talked about WikiLeaks. \"After he told these lies, Stone engaged in a relentless campaign to silence the person who could expose the lies,\" Kravis told jurors. Steve Bannon:Trump campaign saw Roger Stone as its 'access point' to WikiLeaks The trial presented the first clear picture\u00a0of how the Trump campaign sought to learn about WikiLeaks' plans to publish emails that would hurt Clinton and help Trump. Testimonies from government witnesses portrayed\u00a0the campaign as an eager beneficiary of WikiLeaks' email dumps, and Stone as the conduit who boasted about his connections to the group. Prosecutors presented jurors with dozens of emails and text messages \u2014 many with crude language \u2014 showing Stone communicating with senior members of the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks and threatening a possible congressional witness. They displayed charts showing the numbers of phone calls Stone had with the campaign, including with the candidate himself, around the time DNC emails were released. Steve Bannon, the campaign's former chief executive, testified that the campaign saw Stone as its \"access point\" to WikiLeaks. Rick Gates, another former campaign official, testified about a phone call between Stone and Trump in July 2016, shortly after WikiLeaks began publishing DNC emails. Gates said he was in the car with Trump when he heard him talking to Stone. After Trump hung up, he told Gates, \"More information is coming.\" Trump told former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators that he did not recall being told that Stone or anyone in his campaign discussed the release of hacked emails. Randy Credico, a comedian and radio host Stone claimed was the person who told him about WikiLeaks' plans, testified that he was never the backchannel to the group. Prosecutors said Stone invoked Mafia references from \"The Godfather\"\u00a0to urge Credico to either lie or not testify before Congress. '5 categories of lies':Prosecutors tie Roger Stone's alleged crimes to Trump and his campaign Defense attorneys sought to discredit Credico,\u00a0telling jurors that he \"played\" Stone and made him believe he had\u00a0back-channel capabilities with WikiLeaks. \"There\u2019s no question that Randy Credico mislead Roger Stone,\" Rogow told jurors. Rogow said prosecutors are asking jurors to draw inferences from emails and text messages that lacked context and did not show anything \"illegal\" or\u00a0\"malignant.\" And while Stone and Trump talked on the phone multiple times in the summer of 2016, there's no evidence on what the two talked about. \"How can you draw an inference ... when you have no idea on what was said in these calls?\" Rogow said. Rogow also said the government's case relied on actions that are not criminal. \"There was nothing illegal about the campaign being interested in what WikiLeaks was going to be sending out \u2026 This is what happens in campaigns. They look for opposition information,\" Rogow told jurors.\u00a0\"In fact, so much of this case deals with that question that you need to ask, 'So what?'\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Marando took offense in that assertion. \"Well if that\u2019s the state of affairs that we\u2019re in, I\u2019m pretty shocked. Truth matters. Truth still matters,\" Marando told jurors. \"We live in a world nowadays with Twitter, tweets, social media, where you can find any view, any political view you want. You can find your own truth.\" Stone lied to obstruct an investigation and tampered with a witness, Marando repeated.\u00a0\"That matters, and you don't look at that and say, 'So what?'\" Stone's trial attracted conservative figures, such as Milo Yiannopoulos, the controversial, far-right provocateur, and Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's campaign saw Roger Stone as an informal channel to WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential race, when the anti-secrecy group published troves of damaging emails about rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, this according to Steve Bannon. Bannon, the Trump campaign's chief executive at the time, testified Friday that he perceived Stone to be the \"access point\" to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. He said that was based on Stone's claims\u00a0that he had connections to Assange and that he had advance\u00a0knowledge that WikiLeaks possessed stolen emails that would hurt Clinton and help Trump. \"Did he ever brag to you about his relationship with Assange?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney\u00a0 Michael Marando asked Bannon. \"I wouldn\u2019t call it bragging. Maybe boasting,\" Bannon, former executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News, said. '5 categories of lies':Prosecutors tie Roger Stone's alleged crimes to Trump and his campaign Stone's alleged back-channel efforts with WikiLeaks are at the center of his criminal trial, which began earlier this week. The longtime GOP operative and Trump ally is\u00a0accused of lying to the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0in 2017 about his\u00a0efforts to learn of WikiLeaks' plans to release DNC emails. Stone is\u00a0also accused of lying to the committee about his communications with the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, and\u00a0trying to force a witness to lie. Defense attorneys say Stone did not intentionally mislead the committee. The committee, at the time, was investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller's separate Russia investigation found that\u00a0Russian intelligence stole damaging emails from the DNC and Clinton's campaign chairman, and passed them to WikiLeaks. Stone is among the most prominent Trump allies to be indicted as a result of Mueller's investigation.\u00a0He\u00a0faces seven charges: one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. The trial comes amid a fast-moving\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00a0that has yielded damning testimony about the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the president's potential 2020 Democratic rival. Bannon, who reiterated\u00a0that he was not testifying willingly, is one of four witnesses who testified on behalf of the government during the first week of Stone's trial. At the center of the charges against Stone is his interaction\u00a0with a man whom he claimed was his link to Assange. Prosecutors allege that Stone falsely told Congress\u00a0that Randy Credico, a comedian and radio host who had interviewed Assange on his show, was his source of information about WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016, when the group first published stolen DNC emails.\u00a0Prosecutors also allege that Stone tried to force Credico to either lie to Congress or not testify by asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Roger Stone indicted:Charges shed new light on Trump campaign\u2019s link to WikiLeaks But Credico, who was the government's key witness,\u00a0testified that he never had\u00a0back-channel communications\u00a0with WikiLeaks. He also said\u00a0he did not have interactions with Assange until August 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder was\u00a0a guest on his radio show. Even during that interview, Credico said, he never gained advance\u00a0knowledge about WikiLeaks' plans to release DNC emails. \"I never asked him about his business,\" Credico testified. \"Julian Assange is not going to tell me about future releases \u2026 I wasn\u2019t ever going to ask him that.\" Credico and Stone met in 2002. Based on Credico's testimony, the\u00a0relationship seemed tumultuous \u2014 one that, at least in recent years, was punctuated with squabbles and hostile, expletive-laden emails and text messages \u2014 many of which were displayed to jurors. \"You are a rat. A stoolie,\" says an April 2018 email from Stone\u00a0in which he threatened to take Credico's dog from him. The same day, he allegedly wrote, \"I am so ready. Let's get it on.\u00a0Prepare to die [expletive].\" Defense attorneys did not dispute that Credico was never an intermediary to WikiLeaks, though they sought to discredit Credico. Who is Roger Stone?\u00a0Longtime Republican operative worked on campaigns from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump \"You are not an intermediary\u00a0\u2026 even though you led Stone to believe that you were one,\" defense attorney Robert Buschel said. \"I disagree,\" Credico responded. Credico also acknowledged having lied to Stone. \"There were exaggerations. There were lies. There were ripoffs, yes,\" he said. At times, Credico said, he\u00a0blustered about his connections to Assange in order to one-up Stone. Other times,\u00a0he did so\u00a0to get Stone off his back because he was \"pounding\" him with questions about WikiLeaks, Credico said. The cross-examination immediately became hostile, with a visibly frustrated Credico interjecting, offering meandering\u00a0answers, and arguing with the defense attorney. Toward the end of his testimony, Credico maintained that Stone forced him into the situation he is in now. \"I didn\u2019t ask for this. I\u2019m the bystander. He\u2019s driving the car. I got hit on the side of the road,\" Credico said.",

After the release Monday of transcripts for\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and Michael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more transcripts are expected to be released throughout the week. The requests for testimony from high-profile officials including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Bolton come as the inquiry shifts from weeks of collecting evidence in private to holding public hearings in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees. The public hearings are expected to begin later this month, although no firm schedule is set, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But witnesses, which include top aides to Trump, aren't expected to appear because the White House has said it wouldn't cooperate with the investigation. More transcripts are expected to be released during the week, with two on Tuesday from Kurt Volker, who was a special U.S. envoy to Ukraine,\u00a0and Gordon Sondland, who is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Each testified about how Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was guiding Ukraine policy. But while Volker said requiring Ukraine to investigate Trump's rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, would have been \"crazy,\" Sondland said he wasn't aware of any quid pro quo for an investigation in exchange for military aid. GOP embraces impeachment fight:In 2020 ads, Republicans betting Trump inquiry will backfire on Democrats Trump, for his part, held a political rally Monday in Kentucky and will hold another\u00a0Wednesday in Louisiana. Here is a summary of what\u2019s expected this week: Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Hillary Clinton's impeachment connection:Clinton's ties to impeachment inquiries against three presidents Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Acting OMB Director Russ Vought, State Department counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl and David Hale, the under secretary of State for political affairs, comprise the top-level slate of witnesses scheduled for Wednesday. But a spokeswoman for Perry, who has already announced his resignation, said Friday that he wouldn't participate in a \"secret star chamber inquisition,\"\u00a0although he might consider testifying at a public hearing.\u00a0Vought has previously tweeted that neither he nor Duffey would participate. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has already missed document deadlines and accused House Democrats of harassing department workers by requesting their testimony. Also on Wednesday,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0rally supporters in Monroe, Louisiana, for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone, who is campaigning against Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Bolton could provide a perspective Thursday from a top administration official critical of the Ukraine policy. Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director on Europe and Russia, testified that Bolton told her to contact Eisenberg after a July 10 meeting about Ukraine policy. Bolton said he wasn\u2019t part of whatever deal was sought by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Mulvaney. Sondland and other witnesses have said Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, guided Ukraine policy, and Hill said Bolton referred to Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Bolton\u2019s attorney, Charles Cooper, has said his client would not appear without a subpoena. Another witness summoned for Thursday is Jennifer Williams, a State Department staffer reporting to Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser for\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence. John Bolton:Former national security adviser John Bolton scheduled to testify in impeachment inquiry The inquiry summoned Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to testify Friday. Mulvaney acknowledged during an Oct. 17 news conference at the White House that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in part to encourage an investigation of U.S. domestic politics, a trade-off that Mulvaney said was common in diplomacy. But he later issued a statement saying there was no quid pro quo to provide aid in exchange for an investigation of the 2016 election. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Mulvaney\u00a0won't\u00a0\u201cparticipate in such a ridiculous, partisan, illegitimate proceeding.\u201d The inquiry also summoned Mark Sandy, the White House Office of Management and Budget's associate director for national security programs, for testimony Friday.\u00a0But Acting OMB Director Russ Vought has said his office won't be cooperating with the investigation.

      "content": "CHICAGO\u00a0\u2014 Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she and other top female presidential candidates wouldn't be on the debate stage if they had the same experience as Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Minnesota Democrat said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that she believes the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is qualified but that she's the better candidate. \"I'm the one from the Midwest that has actually won in a statewide race over and over again,\" the three-term senator said, adding that she can bring in voters like those in Kentucky and Virginia who supported Democrats in last week's election. \"Those are the kind of voters I have won. And that's not true of Mayor Pete. That's just a fact.\" Klobuchar isn't the first to raise the issue of sexism in an election that features a historic number of female candidates. Many voters are still wary after the nation's first female presidential nominee, Democrat Hillary Clinton, a woman with decades of experience in public office, lost the 2016 election to Republican Donald Trump, a man with no political experience. The question of who is best positioned to defeat Trump has been a main concern of Democrats in the 2020 election cycle. Buttigieg has been one of the surprises of the Democratic presidential primary, rising from an unknown to a top candidate who has raised more money than almost all his rivals. He is a Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and military veteran who is openly gay and married to his husband. He's won over voters who say that he's intelligent and that they appreciate his calm demeanor, his oratory skills and his message of generational change. \"I think, obviously, sexism is a force in politics. I also believe that I've gotten to where we've gotten to by having the right message, the right organization, reaching out to voters and convincing more and more of them to join this vision,\" Buttigieg said Monday. \"And if I can continue to do that, then we'll win, and if I can't, well, that's what we've got to do.\" Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a visiting practitioner at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University and co-founder of Higher Heights, which supports black women in politics, said Klobuchar's comments were about more than Buttigieg. She said there's an expectation of what people in leadership, particularly the presidency, should look like in this country, and pointed to female mayors of cities that are similarly sized to South Bend who likely wouldn't be taken seriously as presidential candidates. That's particularly true for black women, she said. More:2020 election: Amy Klobuchar shares her views on current issues \"It is more of a call out of the electorate and the powerbrokers and media and how they're covering people than on Mayor Pete himself,\" Peeler-Allen said. Buttigieg's own sex could also wind up hurting him if a man wins the nomination, she said, because a male Democratic nominee will almost certainly choose a woman, likely a woman of color, as a running mate. Buttigieg has run for statewide office once, in 2010, when he was the Democratic nominee for treasurer in the red state of Indiana. He lost to the Republican by more than 400,000 votes, winning about 38%. He easily won his second term as mayor of South Bend, a community of about 100,000 people, with just over 8,500 ballots cast for him. Klobuchar has never lost a campaign, dating back to her bid to be the top prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county and her first Senate race in 2006, when she became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Minnesota. She won her third term last year with 60% of the vote in Minnesota, which went for Clinton in 2016 but which Trump hopes to make a play for in 2020. Buttigieg said performance in previous elections may not be the best test of a candidate's electability. Trump had never held public office before he won in 2016. \"If the measure of whether somebody can become president is how many votes they've gotten in previous elections, we wouldn't be here,\" Buttigieg said during a bus tour through New Hampshire. \"We're living under the Donald Trump presidency right now.\" He also has faced bias over his sexual orientation, which some people see as a barrier to his being elected, particularly among African American voters. Buttigieg has encountered anti-gay protesters at stops on the campaign trail. The other female candidates who have met the Democratic National Committee qualifications for at least one debate are Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, author Marianne Willliamson and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race in August. During the CNN interview, Klobuchar focus on the candidacies of Warren, Harris and herself. \"Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that (Buttigieg) had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard.\" Associated Press writers Hunter Woodall in Rochester, N.H., and Michelle R. Smith in Concord, N.H., contributed to this report.",

Would you do it? The Short List newsletter is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup.\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0here! Fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, husband of actress Lori Loughlin, told his accountant that he had to \"work the system\" to get his older daughter accepted into the University of Southern California as a fake crew recruit, prosecutors alleged in a new indictment this week. \"Good news my daughter... is in (U)SC ... bad is I had to work the system,\" Giannulli wrote in a 2017 email to his accountant in which he forwarded a $200,000 invoice from Rick Singer, the mastermind of a college admissions scheme. According to the indictment, Singer also asked Giannulli for a photo of his daughter on a rowing machine \u201clike a real athlete.\u201d Giannulli replied back. \"Will get all.\" The new evidence brought additional bribery charges against the celebrity couple. Almost 200,000 homes and businesses across California were without power Thursday and utility companies\u00a0warned that\u00a0hundreds of thousands more could be in the dark soon\u00a0as high winds fueled fast-growing wildfires.\u00a0In Sonoma County, the fast-growing Kincade Fire flared up Thursday and within hours covered more than 15 square miles, prompting evacuations.

Containment was at zero but no injuries had been reported. Hillary Clinton caused quite the\u00a0political firestorm last week after talking\u00a0about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign on a\u00a0podcast. Clinton's comments were initially incorrectly\u00a0reported\u00a0(emphasis on incorrectly) as her saying\u00a0Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard as a potential third-party presidential candidate. But Clinton had actually suggested that it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard.\u00a0Several outlets picked up on the story with the incorrect quote, prompting a feisty response from Gabbard and other candidates on Twitter.\u00a0The problem is, however, that most of the drama comes from\u00a0the misquote of Clinton's remarks.\u00a0And that\u2019s the tea. The 39 people found dead in the back of a truck in England were Chinese nationals,\u00a0police said Thursday.\u00a0The truck and its trailer, which are believed to have entered the country separately,\u00a0were discovered in\u00a0Grays\u00a0on Wednesday.\u00a0Eight of the dead are women, including a young woman police initially said was a teenager,\u00a0and 31 are men, police said.

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne ATLANTA \u2014 When political pundits talk about swing states in the 2020 election, they generally mention Florida, several states in the Midwest, and maybe a couple states in the West or on the Atlantic coast. Georgia isn\u2019t often on that list. But a changing population, strong performances from Democrats in U.S. House, statehouse and statewide races, and increased attention from national voter groups has Democrats hopeful they can flip the traditionally red state blue in 2020. A Democrat hasn't won Georgia since former President Bill Clinton in 1992. \"There is no denying that Georgia is poised as a swing state and will play an important role in the upcoming election,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a September letter to Democratic National Committee Chairman\u00a0Tom Perez. \"With people of color being the cornerstone of the Democratic party, Atlanta remains set to provide a large portion of votes for our eventual nominee.\" In a clear sign of confidence in that assertion, Democrats chose Atlanta to host the fifth presidential debate of the cycle. Ten Democrats will take the stage Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios, a film and production facility founded by the black actor and filmmaker at the site of a former Confederate Army base in heavily Democratic southwest Atlanta. Atlanta leaders, Bottoms\u00a0said in the letter,\u00a0have long been tied to the Democratic party, and the city has a rich civil rights history as home to icons including Martin Luther King Jr. and U.S. Rep. John Lewis. \"I can\u2019t think of a better place to showcase the Democratic field in one of the most diverse cities in this critical battleground state,\" Perez said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. You can\u2019t talk about Georgia politics without talking about Stacey Abrams. Abrams\u2019 narrow defeat in the 2018 gubernatorial election was a clear sign to some that the state was no longer a sure thing for Republicans. She won the most votes of any Democratic candidate in Georgia history, but lost the\u00a0bitterly fought election\u00a0to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp by 1.39 percentage points. Speaking at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington, D.C., last week, Abrams acknowledged that Georgia was now a battleground state. \"If you look at the 2018 election, I received the highest number of votes for any Democrat in Georgia history,\" Abrams said.\u00a0\"I spent a fraction of what is spent in a presidential campaign. And so if I can get here based on what I had, a presidential nominee can win the state of Georgia if they're a Democrat and willing to make the investment.\" Abrams was successful in part because she engaged voters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly young people and people of color\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who weren't previously registered or hadn\u2019t voted in previous\u00a0elections, said Emory University political scientist\u00a0Andra Gillespie. Gillespie noted that Abrams used the New Georgia Project, a nonprofit she launched in 2014, to register tens of thousands of voters from communities of color. The nonprofit also worked to educate voters about the voting process and voting rights. \u201cShe's\u00a0been doing it for years and growing the electorate,\" Gillespie said. The Democratic nominee for president\u00a0will need to use that same strategy to win Georgia,\u00a0Gillespie said. \u201cA\u00a0Democratic candidate in a state that is newly competitive can\u2019t take voter mobilization for granted,\" Gillespie said. \"It's\u00a0not doing passive stuff like putting ads on TV or sending out robotic\u00a0calls. You have to do the hard work of engaging people in a personal way.\" Georgia's expanding liberal base and the fast-growing black\u00a0population of metropolitan Atlanta\u00a0have already flipped some\u00a0Republican-held House districts near the city and are positive trends for Democrats, political experts say. In 2018, Democrats flipped 14 state\u00a0House seats in the Atlanta area\u00a0but lost three elsewhere for a net gain of 11 seats. In the state Senate, Democrats gained two Atlanta-area seats. In 2016, black voters supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump 89% to 8% nationally, according to exit polls. And in 2018, black voters made up 30\u00a0percent of Georgia voters, up slightly from 29 percent\u00a0in 2014, Gillespie said. At the same time, the state's majority white voting base is shrinking, said\u00a0Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political scientist. In 2018, 59 percent of Georgia voters were white, down from 1996 when 78 percent were white, he said. Bottoms lobbied for Wednesday's debate to take place in the heart of Atlanta instead of the suburb Sandy Springs, which\u00a0organizers were also\u00a0considering. Sandy Springs is part of the long held Republican district that was flipped by Democratic U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath last year. McBath won the 6th congressional district by about 3,200 votes, a significant shift from 2014, when Republican former U.S. Rep. Tom\u00a0Price won by\u00a0210,500 votes. Gillespie said the changing political landscape is likely a result of the northern Atlanta suburbs becoming more diverse, and college-educated white women moving away from Republicans, which is also a national trend. \"Some\u00a0well-educated,\u00a0affluent enclaves are becoming less conservative,\" Gillespie said. After Abrams' strong showing and McBath's election in the Atlanta suburbs, political advocacy groups also are focusing more attention on Georgia. A\u2019shanti F. Gholar, political director of Emerge America, a national organization that supports Democratic women candidates, recently launched a state affiliate in Georgia. The group has been expanding its efforts across southern states due to the influx of people of color, Gholar said. \u201cYou cannot take any place for granted, even the South,\u2019\u2019 Gholar said. \u201cWe wanted to make investments early on\u00a0because we knew\u00a0that the South was changing \u2026 we wanted to be on the ground and ready for those changes as they took impact.\u201d Groups are also lobbying to protect voting rights in Georgia. State elections officials have come under fire\u00a0for purging voter rolls and closing hundreds of\u00a0voting precincts in black neighborhoods in recent years. The Leadership Conference Education Fund\u00a0is calling on\u00a0lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore the Department of Justice's mandate to approve local\u00a0voting practice changes. Many Democratic candidates\u00a0have skipped heavy campaigning in Georgia in the past\u00a0because it was considered\u00a0reliably Republican, Bullock said. He said he expects the debate to create enthusiasm around the Democratic party in Georgia, and candidates should use their time in the city to get out and shake hands with voters. \"If Democrats want to carry the state,\u201d Bullock said, \u201cthey need to put (Georgia) in the 10-12 states that they view as being decisive.\" Contributing: Rebecca Morin and Deborah Barfield Berry.",

In turn, Trump aides viewed the potential meeting as leverage to pressure Kyiv to go after the president's political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Holmes said. Holmes, a career diplomat\u00a0stationed in Kyiv,\u00a0laid out the competing priorities in Ukraine\u00a0during the fifth day of public hearings held as part of the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry. Fiona Hill,\u00a0a former National Security Council official, also testified in the inquiry. Critics allege that the White House meeting with Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodomyr\u00a0Zelensky, which never happened, \u00a0was part of\u00a0a\u00a0pressure campaign on Ukraine led by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. Aides to Trump said Ukraine would have to announce an investigation into the president's rivals before he would agree to meet with Zelensky, according to several officials,\u00a0including Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union whose portfolio included Ukraine. \"A\u00a0White House visit was critical to President Zelensky\u00a0(because he) needed to show U.S. support at the highest levels in order to demonstrate to Russian President (Vladimir) Putin that he had U.S. backing, as well as to advance his ambitious anti-corruption reforms at home,\" Holmes said. \"We at the embassy also believed that a meeting was critical ... and we worked hard to get it arranged.\" It didn't take long to realize that the White House \"was not prepared to show the level of support for the Zelensky\u00a0administration that we had originally anticipated,\" Holmes told lawmakers Thursday. Complicating matters, he said,\u00a0was\u00a0Trump's decision to meet with Putin on June 28 at the G20 Summit in Japan, \"sending a further signal of lack of support for Ukraine.\" Impeachment jurors:Trump meets with Romney, Collins, other Republican senators at White House during impeachment hearing For the next month, the White House meeting became \"a focus of our activities,\" Holmes said.\u00a0\"To that end, we were working with the Ukrainians to deliver things we\u00a0thought President Trump might care about, such as commercial deals benefiting the United States, which might convince President Trump to agree to a meeting with President Zelensky.\u201d Trump soured on helping Ukraine, in part\u00a0because Giuliani\u00a0portrayed Zelensky\u00a0as someone\u00a0\u201csurrounded by enemies\" of Trump, Holmes testified. Hill admonished lawmakers for promoting a \"fictional narrative\" that it was Ukraine\u00a0\u2013 not Russia\u00a0\u2013 that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \"In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,\" she said. Republicans on the panel, including ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif.,\u00a0have argued that Ukraine colluded with the Democrats to hurt Trump in the election. \"It\u00a0is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time, and Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries, regardless of which campaign is the target,\" he said at Thursday's hearing\u00a0in response to Hill. Stay informed:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage The intelligence community and U.S. allies concluded that Russia interfered to boost Trump's chances over Hillary Clinton. \"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country \u2013 and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\" Hill said without calling out specific lawmakers. \"This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\" Hill's comments were the harshest of any witness regarding the\u00a0 Ukrainian interference theory.\u00a0She warned the\u00a0muddying was a distraction with severe\u00a0consequences. \"Right now, Russia\u2019s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election,\" she said. \"We are running out of time to stop them.\" Holmes described how Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, began taking over U.S. policy toward Ukraine around March. Holmes said Giuliani worked to smear Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled to Washington. He\u00a0recounted how the former mayor pushed\u00a0Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 U.S. election and issues related to Ukraine gas company\u00a0Burisma, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter, who sat on Burisma's board. In early May, shortly after Zelensky won the\u00a0election,\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0publicly alleged\u00a0the incoming president\u00a0was \u201csurrounded by enemies\" of Trump. Within days,\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence canceled plans to attend Zelensky's inauguration. \"Over the following months, it became apparent that Mr. Giuliani was having a direct influence on the foreign policy agenda ... in Ukraine,\" Holmes said, adding that it seemed to frustrate Trump aides such as national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton and\u00a0Sondland. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said he disagreed with \u201cthis sort of bumbling foreign policy\u201d executed by the Trump administration in Ukraine. The events described\u00a0by witnesses, Hurd said, \u201cundermined our national security and undercut Ukraine.\u201d Hurd said Trump\u2019s mentioning of the Bidens and Burisma on a phone call July 25 with Zelensky was \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cmisguided.\u201d In the call, Trump asks for \"a favor\" while\u00a0discussing investigations of the Bidens and Burisma. Star witness:Jocular and unflappable, Sondland makes splash as star witness in impeachment inquiry But\u00a0Hurd said\u00a0he had \u201cnot heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion.\u201d Hill and Holmes cap off the dozen witnesses called\u00a0to testify publicly in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Democrats do not plan to hold any hearings during the week of Thanksgiving, though they could add closed-door interviews or hearings to the calendar. Congress does not return to Washington until the week of Dec. 2. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was noncommittal when asked during her weekly news conference Thursday whether there might be a vote soon on impeachment. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decision yet,\u201d she said. The House Intelligence Committee will draft a report of its findings that will be presented to the House Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with drafting and deliberating on articles of impeachment. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate will hold a trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office. It would take 67 of the 100 senators to convict the president.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is opening the door to a 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, signaling his dissatisfaction with the current crop of candidates vying to take on President Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who initially ruled out a 2020 run, has not made a final decision on whether to jump into the race less than three months before primary voting begins, according to advisers. But he is taking steps toward a campaign, including filing to get on the ballot in Alabama's presidential primary. Alabama has an early filing deadline and is among the states that vote on Super Tuesday, named for the large number of state contests that day. In a statement on Thursday, Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said the former mayor is worried that the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates is \"not well positioned\" to defeat Trump. With immense personal wealth, Bloomberg could quickly build out a robust campaign operation across the country. The 77-year-old would pose an immediate ideological challenge to former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running as a moderate and hopes to appeal to independents and Republicans who have soured on Trump. But the billionaire media mogul with deep Wall Street ties could also energize supporters of liberal candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have railed against income inequality and have vowed to ratchet up taxes on the wealthiest Americans. \"He's a literal billionaire entering the race to keep the progressives from winning,\" said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based liberal Democratic strategist. \"He is the foil.\" The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide Bloomberg is a former Republican-turned independent who registered as a Democrat last year. He actively supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and blasted Trump, his fellow New Yorker, as a con man who overinflates his business success. Bloomberg has long flirted with a presidential run but never launched a campaign. He seriously considered a 2020 campaign, traveling to early voting states and conducting extensive polling, but ultimately passed in part because of Biden's expected strength in the field. Aides said they did not see room for two moderate contenders in the\u00a0crowded Democratic primary field. Bloomberg's decision to reconsider suggests he shares the concerns of other Democrats who are increasingly worried about the former vice president's fundraising and messaging, particularly as Warren's popularity has risen. Although Warren is a favorite of liberals, some Democrats worry that she would struggle to appeal to moderates and Republicans who may be seeking an alternative to Trump. \"There are smart and influential people in the Democratic Party who think a candidate like Bloomberg is needed,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Clinton. \"But there is zero evidence that rank-and-file voters in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire feel the same. Absent a desire from voters for a Bloomberg candidacy, it can be hard to get off the ground.\" Bloomberg would have to swiftly make up ground to compete with candidates like Biden, Warren and others, who have spent months traveling the country meeting voters. Warren on Thursday tweeted: \"Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg!\" and linked to her campaign website, saying he would find there \"policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular.\" Bloomberg appeared to be taking the first step by moving to file in Alabama, which votes on March 3. A spokesman for the Arkansas Democratic Party said a person representing a \"mystery candidate\" reached out Thursday afternoon asking about the requirements to join the ballot in the state. Reed Brewer, communications director for the Arkansas Democrats, said he walked the individual through the process \u2014 which simply requires filing documentation with both the state party and secretary of state, as well as paying a $2,500 fee \u2014 and was assured that the fee would be \"no problem\" for the mystery candidate. There is no filing requirement for a candidate to run in the Iowa caucuses, which are a series of Democratic Party meetings, not state-run elections. It means a candidate can enter the race for the Feb. 3 leadoff contest at any time. Associated Press writers Alexandra Jaffe and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, and Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Several national polls in recent months have shown President Donald Trump trailing or virtually tied in hypothetical matchups with the leading candidates in the Democratic presidential primary. Those polls indicate the president could face an uphill battle in his fight for reelection\u00a0\u2013 though Trump has dismissed them as \"fake. A new poll from The Atlanta-Journal Constitution finds Trump\u00a0is trailing the five leading Democrats\u00a0in Georgia, a Republican stronghold where he\u00a0beat Hillary Clinton by five points.

      "subtitle": "As public impeachment hearings open, the surprise was that there was a surprise: Analysis",
      "author": "",
      "content": "To the surprise of nearly everyone, there was a surprise. The opening of the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was expected to be an effort to tell a narrative, to put into compelling context the private testimony that already has\u00a0been released by the Intelligence Committee. The theory was that having the witnesses' words said out loud \u2013 their accounts of whether Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals \u2013 might engage Americans in a way their words on paper never could. That storytelling effort was in evidence during the daylong hearing Wednesday, but as it turned out, news also erupted, and\u00a0during the first 90 minutes. Bill Taylor, a veteran ambassador with an unflappable demeanor and deep voice out of central casting, revealed that he had learned just last Friday that a staffer from the U.S. Embassy in Kiev had overheard a\u00a0phone conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland, a political donor the president had appointed U.S. ambassador to the European Union. In the account relayed by Taylor, Trump was\u00a0talking so loudly that he could be overheard in the restaurant on the cellphone. He reportedly asked about \"investigations;\" Sondland told him that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. It was July 26, the day after the now-infamous call in which\u00a0Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do \"a favor.\" After the call was over, the staffer asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine. \"Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\" Taylor quoted the staffer as saying. That exchange represented\u00a0an important piece of evidence bolstering the Democrats' case that Trump pushed Ukraine to launch investigations\u00a0into the business dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and into the 2016 campaign,\u00a0holding as leverage the promise of a White House meeting and the release of millions in military aid. It showed the influence of a rogue foreign policy operation being led by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, now the president's personal attorney.\u00a0It raised questions about the distance Trump last week tried to put between Sondland and himself.\u00a0\"I hardly know the gentleman,\" he said then. And it started\u00a0the drum roll for Sondland's testimony before the committee, scheduled for next week. Rule One of investigations: You can never be entirely sure where they are going to lead. The committee quickly scheduled a closed deposition on Friday with David Holmes, an aide to Taylor. Steve Bannon:Nancy Pelosi's impeachment strategy 'actually quite brilliant' At the White House, where he was meeting with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump dismissed the proceedings taking place at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \"I'm too busy to watch it,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. That said, he did manage to post a series of tweets deriding the hearing as nothing more than a \"circus\" and a \"fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory.\" On Capitol Hill, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff described high stakes in exploring the president's behavior. \"Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency,\u00a0but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief,\" the California Democrat said in the vaulted hearing room on Capitol Hill. He referred repeatedly to the Constitution and the Founders. Democrats had described their goal as explaining to Americans who may not have been paying much attention up to now what they believe happened between the Trump administration and Ukraine, and why it matters. The deliberate pace, with extended opening statements and then 45 minutes of uninterrupted questioning by each side, was\u00a0unusual for Congress. Republicans, meanwhile, portrayed the whole inquiry as a sham pursued by Democrats bent on overturning the results of the 2016 election. They\u00a0noted that neither Taylor nor deputy assistant secretary of State George Kent\u00a0had firsthand knowledge of what Trump had done; they said that made their testimony hearsay. California Rep. Devin Nunes, the committee's ranking Republican, sarcastically congratulated\u00a0the two witnesses \"for passing the Democrats' Star Chamber auditions held for the last six weeks in the basement of the Capitol.\" They didn't respond to that, though both denied they had a partisan agenda. They said \"no\" when asked specifically if they were \"never-Trumpers,\" those opposed to Trump from the beginning of his political climb. Impeachments are by definition momentous and historic events.\u00a0An early effort to remove the forgettable Andrew Johnson in 1868 failed. More than a century later, Richard Nixon chose to resign under fire when it became clear he was going to be leaving the Oval Office, one way or another. Bill Clinton survived an impeachment trial in 1999. But the impeachment of Trump is different from those that have gone before in some fundamental ways. For the first time, a president in the midst of running for a second term is facing the Constitution's most serious penalty. The allegation involves not personal misbehavior, as it did with Clinton, but an abuse of power that allegedly involved threatening an allied government and encouraging foreign\u00a0interference in a U.S. election. Movie nights, baseball, phone calls:How Trump is uniting the GOP to fight impeachment And the hearings are\u00a0taking place when the nation\u2019s politics are so bitterly divided that even the polarized Clinton era seems less fierce, and the time of Nixon a virtual golden age of bipartisanship. Americans\u00a0now seem divided into warring tribes, resistant to persuasion.\u00a0An average of the latest national polling by FiveThirtyEight.com calculates that 48% of Americans\u00a0support impeachment; 44% oppose it. That's not significantly different from the returns\u00a0in 2016, the election that put Trump in the White House. Then, 48% voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, 46% for Trump. Whether the testimony Wednesday and the hearings that follow will change anybody's mind isn't yet clear. Next up: Marie Yovanovitch,\u00a0the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine who was unceremoniously dismissed after being targeted by\u00a0Giuliani, is scheduled to testify Friday. Will there be more surprises? It's possible. AMERIND Risk",

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Democrats clashed over taxes, health care and the direction of the party during a fast-paced debate in Atlanta on Wednesday, but the candidates agreed on the need to impeach President Donald Trump. Airing after an hours-long public impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill, the candidates were immediately asked about the president and the bombshell testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that Trump had created a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d scenario with Ukraine. \u201cWe have a criminal in the White House,\u201d Kalama Harris said. \u201cThe president felt free to break the law again and again and again and that is what has happened with Ukraine,\u201d Elizabeth Warren argued. \u201cWe have to establish the principle (that) no one is above the law.\u201d Trump has always cast a long shadow over the debates, but it was particularly true Wednesday as Americans continued to process hours of lengthy testimony delving into the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. That rub was clearly on display as the candidates attempted to break through wall-to-wall impeachment hearings coverage to elevate their own proposals. \u201cWe cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election,\u201d Bernie Sanders said. A Biden moment:Biden said you have to 'keep punching' to address domestic violence Is Tulsi a Democrat?:Gabbard prompts a brawl with Kamala Harris The debate came during what is potentially a reshuffling of the field, as Pete Buttigieg has surged in Iowa polling and the candidates have confronted the possibility of new challengers. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, is in the race but was not on stage. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid and is ready to spend millions. The debate was the first since Buttigieg has zoomed ahead in polling, but there was little sign initially that his higher status put a target on his back. There were few direct attacks on him during the first hour, and, at one point, Harris declined an opportunity to weigh into a controversy involving a stock image of a Kenyan woman on his website promoting a plan to address racial inequality. That changed as the debate neared its conclusion as Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar questioned his experience for the job. Buttigieg, whose rise has reportedly unnerved his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said that South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d On taxes, Warren began by touting her two-cent on the dollar tax on assets over $50 million. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. Booker criticized the plan, calling it \"cumbersome.\u201d Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. The next debate will take place Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. Biden touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was endorsed by the only African-American woman that has ever been elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself. Biden was likely referring to Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the Senate. The Illinois woman served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. As the stage erupted, Biden corrected himself to say the \u201cfirst\u201d African American woman. Things got testy between Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg during a lengthy exchange about what kind of experience is needed to be president. When Buttigieg suggested his military service prepared him to be commander in chief, the Hawaii congresswoman slammed him for saying this week he was open to sending troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels under certain circumstances. Buttigieg said Gabbard was taking his remarks out of context and then swiped back at her for meeting in 2017 with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in the country\u2019s civil war. \"If you're talking about experience, let's talk about judgment,\" Buttigieg said. \u201cI would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.\u201d Gabbard fired back, saying Buttigieg lacks the \u201ccourage\u201d to sit down with the nation\u2019s adversaries. -Michael Collins and John Fritze Two days after an association of Democratic\u00a0state\u00a0attorneys general became\u00a0the first national party committee\u00a0to impose an explicit abortion litmus test on its candidates,\u00a0Warren was asked whether there\u2019s room in the party for those who oppose abortion. Saying abortion rights are human rights and economic rights, Warren said they\u2019re fundamental to what the party stands for. She was pressed on whether the party should exclude recently-re-elected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards who has signed anti-abortion legislation. \u201cI have made clear what I think the party stands for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of the party.\u201d Klobuchar said she can\u2019t wait to be in a debate with Trump and tell him that 70% of the public support Roe v. Wade. \u201cHe is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said. Booker related abortion rights to voter suppression, saying it was voter suppression in Georgia that led to the election of a governor who supported anti-abortion legislation. - Maureen Groppe Cory Booker slammed Joe Biden for saying this week that he would not support legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. That view has put him at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties,\u00a0polls\u00a0show. - John Fritze Biden\u2019s response to how he would address domestic violence drew laughter for his unfortunate choice of words at the end of his response. The former vice president was on firm ground when he began his answer by reminding the audience that he authored legislation to address violence against women. He then argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said. \u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d - Maureen Groppe Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d -Michael Collins Biden and Sanders took issue with Steyer\u2019s claim to be the only candidate who would make addressing climate change his No. 1 as president. Steyer said he would declare a state of emergency over the issue on Day One and would also make it the top priority of his foreign policy. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Priority One,\u201d Steyer said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to get done.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from my friend,\u201d Biden interjected. He said that while he was working in the Obama administration on efforts to address climate change, Steyer was introducing more coal mines around the world. \u201cI welcome him back in the fold here,\u201d Biden said. Sanders said he\u2019s introduced legislation to declare climate change a national emergency and the government may also have to prosecute the fossil fuel industry for lying about how their product affects the planet. - Maureen Groppe Kamala Harris didn\u2019t mince words as she went on the attack over Donald Trump\u2019s policy in North Korea following reports that Kim Jong Un has no interest in another summit with the president. \u201cDonald Trump got punked,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d Would she make additional concessions to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table? No, Harris responded. Noting that Trump inherited North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons\u00a0program from the Obama administration \u2013 and other past administrations \u2013 Biden was asked how he would handle the issue differently from Obama. Biden pivoted to compare his approach to Trump\u2019s, saying he would work to rebuild U.S. alliances with allies in the region. -\u00a0John Fritze Cory Booker used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Pete Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in firsts place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. The New York Times recently reported that some candidates resent the attention and the campaign donations that have flowed Mayor Pete\u2019s way. - Michael Collins Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden offered subtly different answers over whether they believe Donald Trump should be prosecuted after his time in the White House is over. Sanders argued that no one is above the law and that, in his view, the president had obstructed justice and had committed other crimes. Biden said he would leave that decision to his Justice Department and that Democrats shouldn\u2019t go down the path of chanting \u201clock him up,\u201d a reference to a refrain often sounded at Trump campaign rallies about Hillary Clinton.\u00a0That chant has been heard at Sanders rallies, Maddow said. \u201cI would not direct my Justice Department like this president does,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI would not dictate who would be prosecuted.\u201d Sanders said he agreed with that part. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Sanders said, but then added: \u201cWhat I am of the opinion of is that the American people now do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d - John Fritze Buttigieg, whose recent surged in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has reportedly annoyed his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d He argued that he can go toe-to-toe with Trump because he comes from the kind of Rust Belt community that Trump is appealing to, his military experience and knows how to bring people together to get things done. A moderator followed up by asking Klobuchar about her recent comment that a female candidate with Buttigieg\u2019s experience probably would not have made it to the debate stage. First saying that she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be at the debate, she reiterated her belief that women candidates are held to a different standard. Otherwise, she quipped, people would be able to play the game \u201cName Your Favorite Woman President.\u201d \u201cWhich we can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, adding that female candidates, \u201chave to work harder, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d But if voters worry that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, she concluded, \u201cNancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d - Maureen Groppe It started with Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Tulsi claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from Kamala Harris, who accused Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and inuendoes because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\" What started it? Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard and that Gabbard was a \"favorite of the Russians.\" On Oct. 18, Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" -- John Fritze and Nicholas Wu Sen. Bernie Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during a discussion on health care. After Elizabeth Warren talked about the need to reform the nation\u2019s health care system and touted the benefits of Medicare for All, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his healthcare plan. - Michael Collins Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. President Barack Obama recently warned fellow Democrats that \u201cthis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.\u201d Asked about that in the context of Medicare for All, Sanders said Obama is right that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to tear down the system.\u201d But Washington does need to deliver on what the public wants, and people understand the health care system is \u201cnot only cruel, but dysfunctional,\u201d he said. - Maureen Groppe In past debates, Democrats opened with a lengthy exchange on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Elizabeth Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. What's Warren's plan?:Elizabeth Warren willing to show Bill Gates how much she'd tax him: 'I promise it's not $100 billion' \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" she said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome.' Saying that all the Democrats on stage support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" -\u00a0John Fritze Elizabeth Warren said she hoped ambassadorships would no longer be handed out \"to the highest bidder,\" a swipe at Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who spent much of Wednesday testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Appointing donors as ambassadors is nothing new \u2013 Democratic presidents did it, too. But Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about 30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Sondland gave $1 million to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen. \"These kinds of donations were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" - John Fritze The first question dived into the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with Warren being asked how she will try to convince her Republican colleagues to remove President Donald Trump if he is impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, `First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. Then Warren quickly pivoted to a key campaign theme of hers, corruption. \u201cHow did Ambassador (Gordon) Sondland get there?\u201d she asked of Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union whose dramatic testimony today of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d implicated top White House officials. Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said Sondland is an example of how money buys its way into Washington and, as president, she won\u2019t give away ambassadorships \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201d - Maureen Groppe The Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta is under way. Ten candidates will be seeking to differentiate themselves and break through hours of impeachment inquiry hearings earlier Wednesday. And that is the first question going to the candidates. -- John Fritze After October\u2019s three-hour debate, tonight\u2019s two-hour version may fly by. The candidates won\u2019t be giving opening statements and will have only about one minute at the end to make a final pitch. Tonight\u2019s questioners are an all-female panel of journalists: MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell join forces with Kristen Welker, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour are sponsoring the next debate on Dec. 19.\u00a0The Democratic National Committee has been ratcheting up the fundraising and polling levels that candidates must achieve to participate. - Maureen Groppe Although there are 10 candidates on stage, only three had a major presence outside Tyler Perry Studios. At least two dozen supporters of Pete Buttigieg held pickets with his campaign sign, at times chanting \u201cPETE FOR PRES.\u201d The Yang Gang was also out in full force. A huge fluorescent \u201cMATH\u201d sign was posted up and a man on stilts was walking around holding two large fans that said \u201cANDREW YANG.\u201d At times the group of supporters would chant some of Yang\u2019s signature phrases like \u201cPOWERPOINT.\u201d A group of Joe Biden supporters also represented the former Vice President. They would wave signs as cars passed by to enter Tyler Perry Studios. The largest groups outside the studios though were not for candidates, they were advocating for two different policies. A large group of advocates protested against family separation at the border and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. The demonstrators held banners that send \u201cEnd Deportations\u201d and \u201cChinga la migra.\u201d There were also demonstrators, who were mostly people color, advocating for charter schools. A marching band for KIPP Academy, a local charter school, marched in front of the gates of Tyler Perry Studios to advocate for charter schools. - Rebecca Morin Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is likely to get extra attention from both moderators and his fellow competitors because of his recent rise in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He\u2019s leading the field in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren can expect to be quizzed on her recent backing of a glide path into Medicare for All, a step she took after attacks from Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden that people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. Biden, who entered the race as the frontrunner, will be under pressure to show he can live up to that expectation. Unease about his performance so far is one reason why former Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval recently entered the race and why former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering it. - Maureen Groppe One candidate has been popping up on the television screens of early voting states a lot more than the others: Billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The $13 million he spent on advertising in the past month accounts for more than 50% of the total amount of advertising from all the candidates \u2013 including President Donald Trump, according to an analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project released Wednesday. \u201cResidents of early voting states are seeing many more television ads from presidential candidates this cycle than they did in the 2016 presidential race, and the reason can be summed up in one word: Steyer,\u201d said Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. What Steyer says:Tom Steyer shares his views on current issues Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock made their first ad buys in the past month. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also recently ramped up their spending. Buttigieg\u2019s recent surge in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire corresponds with his increased spending on both TV and digital ads, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not possible to attribute the surge entirely to his ad spending, it has certainly played some role in his recent success,\u201d Ridout said. \u201cA strong debate performance tonight, combined with continued heavy ad spending, could help cement his place in the top tier of Democratic candidates.\u201d The number of ads that have run is way up from a comparable point in the 2016 presidential race. One difference, however, is fewer ads are being paid for by outside groups. Candidates may have done so well at raising money from small-dollar donors that they haven\u2019t needed the support of political action committees that can collect large sums from wealthy donors, said Michael Franz, another co-director of the project. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he said, \u201cmany large-dollar donors may still be waiting out this race to see which horse to bet on.\u201d - Maureen Groppe",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg missed oral argument Wednesday because of\u00a0 a stomach illness, less than three months after completing treatment for her fourth bout with cancer. Ginsburg, 86, was \"indisposed,\" Chief Justice John Roberts announced from the bench. But he said she would participate in deciding the two cases\u00a0argued Wednesday by reading briefs and the transcript of the oral argument. The leader of the court's liberal wing, Ginsburg has become a cultural icon during her third decade on the high court. She has kept up a rigorous travel schedule around oral arguments, most recently appearing at Georgetown University Law Center alongside the president who nominated her in 1993, Bill Clinton, and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. More:After cancer, Supreme Court's Ruth Bader Ginsburg hits the road to prove her vitality \u2013 and longevity Ginsburg missed two weeks of oral arguments in January following surgery for lung cancer, marking the first time in her 26-year Supreme Court career she had been absent. Then in August, she underwent three weeks of radiation for pancreatic cancer. The lone statement issued by the court after her latest bout was upbeat. \"The tumor was treated definitively and there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body,\" it said. \"Justice Ginsburg will continue to have periodic blood tests and scans. No further treatment is needed at this time.\" The justice's first encounters with cancer came in 1999, when she had colon cancer, and in 2009, when she had her first bout with pancreatic cancer, a particularly deadly form. \"As cancer survivors know, that dread disease is a challenge, and it helps to know that people are rooting for you,\" Ginsburg said in September during an appearance at the famed 92nd Street Y in New York City. She vowed to stay on the job \"as long as I'm healthy and mentally agile.\" Even if Democrats win the White House next fall, Ginsburg would have to\u00a0remain on the court at least until\u00a0January 2021 to avoid giving President Donald Trump and a\u00a0Republican-controlled Senate the opportunity\u00a0to replace her. Such a scenario could give conservatives a 6-3 hold on the high court,\u00a0solidifying their majority \u2013 perhaps\u00a0for decades to come. Ironically, one of the lawyers arguing before the court Wednesday was University of California, Berkeley Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, who wrote in 2014 that Ginsburg should step down so that President Barack Obama could nominate her successor. The justice did not follow that advice\u00a0\u2013 but she did make an appearance at Berkeley Law last month.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to allege in a voluminous report\u00a0that a former FBI lawyer altered a document related to the surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, according to people familiar with the matter. But Horowitz is expected to conclude that the lawyer's conduct did not change the legal basis for the request to wiretap\u00a0Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, one of the sources said. The long-awaited review is\u00a0set for release on Dec. 9.\u00a0Horowitz is scheduled to testify\u00a0about his findings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11. Among the most politically charged areas of the review is\u00a0whether the FBI abused its\u00a0surveillance authority due to bias against the president. While the report is expected to be sharply critical of the bureau, The New York Times reported Friday that the inspector general is not expected to conclude that top FBI leaders acted out of bias. Anticipation of the report has long animated Trump and his Republican allies. The president has repeatedly asserted\u00a0that the inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election was a \"witch hunt\" orchestrated by political enemies. In a\u00a0Friday morning interview on \"Fox and Friends,\" Trump kept up the attack, accusing the FBI of \"spying on my campaign.\" \"We're dealing at the highest levels of government,\" the president said following reports of the FBI lawyer's alleged conduct,\u00a0first reported by CNN. Horowitz's report will be made public amid a fast-moving impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure its government to open an investigation\u00a0into the family of\u00a0Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden. And it comes\u00a0amid criticism\u00a0from Democrats that the Justice Department, under Attorney General William Barr, has become a tool against the president's political enemies. Release of the inspector general's report\u00a0follows revelations\u00a0last month\u00a0that\u00a0a related\u00a0\u2013 and equally politically charged \u2013 examination of the origins of the Russia investigation has\u00a0shifted\u00a0to a criminal probe. The allegation against the former FBI lawyer is at least part of the reason for that change, according to a person familiar with the matter. The FBI and the inspector general's office declined to comment. Russia probe:DOJ inquiry into origins of investigation has shifted to criminal probe Spying, treason and politics:President Trump ups the stakes in Russia probe battle despite scant evidence The inspector general's review centered on the FBI's surveillance of\u00a0Page\u00a0during the early stages of its investigation into Russian interference and\u00a0possible ties to the Trump campaign. Horowitz launched his\u00a0review in March 2018 in response to requests from lawmakers and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u00a0The inspector general looked into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought a judge's permission to wiretap Page. Page, who had longstanding connections to\u00a0Russia, admitted meeting with Kremlin officials in July 2016, when he was the Trump campaign's foreign policy adviser. Horowitz also examined the FBI's relationship and communication\u00a0with\u00a0Christopher Steele,\u00a0a former British intelligence officer. He\u00a0was hired by a research firm working for the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Hillary Clinton, and he compiled a now-infamous \"dossier\" alleging links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Republicans have complained that the FBI, in its applications to seek and renew surveillance on\u00a0Page, concealed\u00a0its reliance\u00a0on\u00a0Steele's findings.\u00a0But copies of those applications\u00a0released\u00a0after USA TODAY and others sued showed FBI investigators did disclose\u00a0to judges that Steele sought\u00a0information to \"discredit\" Trump, and investigators had broader suspicions about Page's ties to the Russian government. The counterintelligence investigation was launched in the summer of 2016, after the FBI learned that another campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had offered the Trump campaign\u00a0damaging information about Clinton. Investigators also\u00a0determined that Russian intelligence had stolen troves of emails from the Democratic National Committee. Papadopoulos' boast came before the Russian intrusions were publicly known. Like what you're reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u00a0took over the FBI's investigation in May 2017 and indicted three dozen individuals and entities, including six former\u00a0Trump associates and campaign aides -- all of whom have either pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury. Mueller's\u00a0report\u00a0detailed a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort by the Russian government to intercede in the election to help Trump win, but concluded\u00a0neither the president nor his campaign conspired with Russians. The report, however, portrayed the campaign as an eager beneficiary of Russian efforts. In April, shortly before the Justice Department released a redacted version of Mueller's report, Barr\u00a0told lawmakers he would conduct a separate examination of how the Russia investigation began and whether the government\u00a0improperly \"spied\" on the Trump campaign. Barr's announcement came amid Trump's escalating battle against the law enforcement and intelligence agencies that investigated him and his campaign. The president and his allies have long alleged that FBI officials were\u00a0biased against him and\u00a0spied\u00a0on his campaign to damage\u00a0him\u00a0politically. Trump\u00a0has also accused law enforcement and intelligence officials of treason. Barr\u00a0tapped Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead that\u00a0inquiry. Durham\u00a0has led high-profile special investigations, such as an examination of the FBI's handling of criminal informants in Boston during the Clinton administration. Barr\u00a0has personally overseen the inquiry,\u00a0seeking assistance from law enforcement partners around the globe. Former law enforcement officials have dismissed accusations of spying and treason, saying the surveillance of Page wasn't unusual. \"There was no conspiracy to unseat Mr. Trump or defeat him. There was no treason. There was no sedition,\" James Baker said in May. He's the FBI's former general counsel and oversaw the launch of the Russia investigation. Carter Page:Who is he and why is he at the center of the Nunes memo? Former FBI director James Comey has echoed this sentiment. In a Washington Post op-ed, he wrote\u00a0that the FBI properly investigated whether Americans associated with the Trump campaign conspired with Russians. In a separate report released in August, the\u00a0inspector general concluded that Comey, whom Trump abruptly fired two years ago, broke Justice Department policy by disclosing the contents of confidential memos\u00a0detailing\u00a0his interactions with Trump. Last year, Horowitz released a scathing review of the FBI investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The 568-page report\u00a0rebuked Comey's handling of the investigation and acknowledged \"troubling\"\u00a0text messages between two former FBI officials that disparaged Trump, then a presidential candidate. But Horowitz said his examination did not find evidence that political bias affected the investigators' actions. Contributing: Bart Jansen and Brad Heath",

      "content": "Whoopi Goldberg is putting her foot down on \"The View.\" The EGOT winner\u00a0intervened during a heated exchange between Meghan McCain and\u00a0Joy Behar on Tuesday, arguing that\u00a0her co-hosts need to\u00a0\"exhibit respect.\" McCain passionately discussed\u00a0the treatment of\u00a0U.S. veterans, including\u00a0Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman,\u00a0the White House's\u00a0top expert on Ukraine, after Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham called\u00a0Vindman's loyalty into question for testifying about President Donald Trump's July call with\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"There is this trend in American politics where we are criticizing veterans,\" said McCain, who also called out Hillary Clinton\u00a0for saying the Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as a potential third-party presidential candidate. 'It\u2019s a very, very sad story':Barbara Walters, 'View' hosts grieve former employee \"People who put their life on the line for America and freedom, their loyalty to America should not be questioned,\" McCain added. \"I don\u2019t like it when Laura Ingraham did it last night, I don\u2019t like it when Hillary Clinton does it to Tulsi Gabbard. I think it sets a very, very bizarre precedent.\" Behar challenged McCain, arguing, \"Just because somebody served does not ipso facto make them above reproach.\"\u00a0McCain fired back, \"For me and where I come from, it does.\" More:\u00a0What's the dispute between Hillary Clinton and Tulsi Gabbard about? As the co-hosts started to speak over each other, Goldberg stepped in, asking everyone to \"just take a breath.\" She added, \"Everybody has something to say at the table, we really do want to hear from everybody, but we\u2019re starting to do that thing.\" McCain said, \"I don\u2019t know what that means, 'that thing.'\" Goldberg explained that it means talking over each other, to which McCain bluntly replied, \"Well, it\u2019s 'The View.'\" \"It is 'The View,'\"\u00a0Goldberg said. \"This show has always had the ability to have different points of view, which we respect around the table. And when we talk to each other, we also exhibit respect. So when I\u2019m saying to you, 'Hold up, because we\u2019re not hearing each other,'\u00a0I\u2019m not trying to cut you off \u2014 I\u2019m trying to get you heard.\" A frustrated Goldberg then cut to commercial break as McCain proceeded to interrupt her again.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Signaling that a pending review of the FBI's Russia inquiry is likely to be critical, the Justice Department's inspector general Wednesday cited the management of surveillance and other sensitive investigative tactics\u00a0as one of the department's most \"pressing concerns.\" \"Recent and past (inspector general) reviews have found that the department faces challenges in using these sensitive authorities consistent with its policies, and in a manner that safeguards individuals\u2019 statutory and constitutional privacy rights,\" the inspector general concluded in its annual review of top issues facing the department. \"The actual or perceived misuse of such authorities can undermine the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the department, impact the department\u2019s standing with the judiciary, threaten the success of prosecutions, and lead to the amendment or revocation of certain authorities.\" The reference to investigative management was highlighted by the inspector general as the only one of the eight areas of review that was not included in last year's report. Since March 2018, Inspector General Michael Horowitz has been examining whether the FBI\u00a0violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought a judge\u2019s permission to wiretap former Trump campaign aide Carter Page as part of its counterintelligence investigation into Russia and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Horowitz also has been reviewing the FBI's relationship and communication with Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was hired by a research firm working for the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and compiled a now-infamous \"dossier\" alleging links between Russia and the Trump campaign. FBI Surveillance:\u00a0FBI releases FISA records on Carter Page surveillance Republicans have complained that the FBI, in its applications to seek and renew surveillance on Page, concealed its reliance on Steele's findings. And it has fueled unrelenting criticism from President Donald Trump that the Russia inquiry was a \"hoax\" driven by his political rivals, the FBI and the broader intelligence community. But copies of those surveillance applications released after USA TODAY and others sued showed FBI investigators did disclose to judges that Steele sought information to \"discredit\" Trump, and investigators had broader suspicions about Page's ties to the Russian government. The FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation was launched in the summer of 2016, after the FBI learned that another campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had offered the Trump campaign damaging information about Clinton. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over the FBI\u2019s investigation in May 2017 and indicted three dozen individuals and entities, including half a dozen former Trump campaign aides and associates \u2013 all of whom have either pleaded guilty or were convicted by a jury. Mueller's report detailed a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort by the Russian government to intercede in the election to help Trump win, but concluded neither the president nor his campaign conspired with Russians. The report, however, portrayed the campaign as an eager beneficiary of Russian efforts. Steele Dossier:Trump attorneys seek special counsel to look into Justice Department links to firm behind dossier Attorney General William Barr has been personally overseeing a separate examination of how the Russia investigation began and whether the government improperly \u201cspied\u201d on the Trump campaign. That probe has since shifted from an administrative inquiry into a criminal investigation. Barr has indicated that release of the Horowitz report is \"imminent,\" and the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled the inspector general to testify about his findings Dec. 11. In Wednesday's review, the inspector general acknowledged the ongoing FBI surveillance review, indicating that authorities are examining whether Justice and the FBI complied with legal requirements \"in applications...to conduct FISA surveillance of a certain U.S. person.\" Sponsored by AMERIND Risk",

A national USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll asked likely Democratic voters whom among the party's past presidential nominees would have the most influence on their vote today. Two-thirds named former president Obama, who moved out of the White House almost three years ago. Obama hasn't endorsed anyone so far, including his former vice president, Joe Biden. Kate Pritchard, 63, a retired teacher from Durango, Colorado, is supporting New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at the moment, but she's not sure he can go the distance. If Obama were to endorse a candidate, she would back that person. \"That would be very powerful,\" she said in a follow-up interview after being called in the survey. In the poll, 11% cited former president Jimmy Carter, who at age 95 is\u00a0still building houses and doing other good works, as influential with them. But all the other former nominees registered in single digits. The only other nominee to win the White House, Bill Clinton, was named by just 6%. Hillary Clinton, the party's standardbearer the last time around, also was cited by 6%. Al Gore, the 2000 nominee, was named by 3%, and Michael Dukakis (1988), John Kerry (2004)\u00a0and Walter Mondale (1984) by 1% each. Asked whom would have the least influence on their vote, Dukakis ranked first, at 23%, and Hillary Clinton was second, at 18%.

      "content": "\"Pharma Bro\" Martin Shkreli has lost his legal bid to have the U.S. Supreme Court review his 2017 federal convictions on securities fraud charges. The high court included Shkreli's petition with a group of potential appeals that it denied without comment on Monday. The decision ends the appeal process for the businessman\u00a0notorious for driving a 5000% price hike on a drug used to treat an illness that attacks those with the HIV virus and others with weakened immune systems. \"We are disappointed by the court's decision and continue to maintain that Martin was never\u00a0treated fairly by any of the courts that have reviewed his case,\" said Benjamin Brafman, Shkreli's lead defense attorney. \"Unfortunately, there is often a price to pay for notoriety. It is never helpful.\" The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment on the decision. Shkreli, 36, is currently serving a seven-year sentence at the low-security federal correction center in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be released in September 2023, a federal inmate registry shows. Worried about a recession?:Here\u2019s how to prepare your retirement nest egg Holiday shopping:Paying for the holidays in six easy payments. Here's what to consider The U.S. Bureau of Prisons transferred him there following a March report by The Wall Street Journal that said Shkreli used\u00a0a contraband smartphone to continue steering his former pharmaceutical company from behind bars in a Fort Dix, New Jersey prison. Shkreli was found guilty of defrauding investors in two healthcare-focused hedge funds he administered. The Brooklyn federal court jury that heard evidence in the case also found him guilty of conspiring to manipulate shares in another drug company, called Retrophin. However, the jury found Shkreli not\u00a0guilty on five other charges, an outcome that Brafman said represented a victory of sorts in the defense battle with the federal justice system. After the conviction, U.S. District Court Judge Kiyo Matsumoto revoked Shkreli's release bond because\u00a0the supporter of President Donald Trump offered\u00a0a $5,000 bounty via social media for anyone who could \"grab\" him a\u00a0lock of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair. Matsumoto called the incident\u00a0\"a solicitation of an assault in exchange for money that is not protected by the First Amendment\" right of freedom of speech and expression. Shkreli\u00a0is best known to the American public for his leadership of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company that has since changed its name to\u00a0Phoenixus. In 2015, the company hiked the dosage price of Daraprim from $13.50\u00a0to $750. The medication is used to treat parasitic infections typically found in infants, pregnant women, and HIV patients. The decision made Shkreli\u00a0a lightning rod\u00a0for discontent and anger over soaring U.S. drug costs. He publicly defended the pricing decision before invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he appeared before a congressional committee that examined the issue in 2016. He made his feelings about his congressional questioners clear via Twitter after the hearing by tweeting:\u00a0\"Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government.\"",

      "author": "",
      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 First-place finishers for the past four Iowa caucus cycles \u2014\u00a0with the\u00a0exception of\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all surged ahead sometime in the final months before the caucus, from November through\u00a0January. That\u2019s good news for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who jumped 16 percentage points\u00a0from September to lead the pack in November\u2019s Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, conducted by Selzer & Co. He is the first choice of 25% of\u00a0likely Democratic caucusgoers. That jump is an even more pronounced surge than Barack Obama\u2019s in 2007, when the Illinois senator jumped 6\u00a0percentage points\u00a0from October to November, then another 4 points\u00a0in December. Buttigieg has been drawing\u00a0parallels between himself and Obama. But a November surge also doesn't assure a victory. In\u00a0caucus cycles since 2004, only three candidates who were first in the November Iowa Poll\u00a0\u2014 Clinton, Obama and Mike Huckabee\u00a0\u2014 won their party's\u00a0caucus a few months later. The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins. Ted Cruz was in third place in October 2016, and John Kerry was\u00a0in third in November\u00a02004. Rick Santorum was tied for sixth in November 2011. \u25ba More: Iowa Caucuses Results History: 1972 to 2016 Former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said a last-minute surge is the\u00a0key to a successful caucus campaign. It\u2019s a maxim that\u2019s become known in Iowa politics as the \u201cNagle Rule.\u201d \u201cThere are three rules to success in Iowa,\u201d Nagle said in a phone interview. \u201cRule No. 1 is: Organize. Rule No. 2 is: Organize. Rule No. 3 is:\u00a0You get hot at the end.\u201d With two and a half months left before the Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses, Democratic presidential hopefuls\u00a0have plenty of time to \u201cget hot\u201d and move up, even within a shifting\u00a0field. Buttigieg\u2019s trajectory in Iowa so far resembles the path U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz took to win the 2016 Republican caucus. Cruz was polling comfortably near the rest\u00a0of the pack in the summer of 2015, though he\u00a0lagged significantly behind\u00a0early favorites Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon, and businessman Donald Trump. In the October 2015 Iowa Poll, 10%\u00a0of likely Republican caucusgoers\u00a0chose Cruz as their first choice, ranking him third. Buttigieg started this autumn in a similar place. In the September Iowa Poll, he was fourth, with 9% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming him as their first choice for president. Buttigieg was 13 percentage points behind the poll leader, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at 22%. Both Cruz and Buttigieg leaped over previously leading candidates in a single poll.\u00a0 Cruz\u2019s support skyrocketed to 31% in the 2015 December poll, overtaking both Trump and Carson. From the early December poll through the February caucus, Cruz struggled somewhat to keep his momentum. In early January, his support had fallen to 25% and then to 23% in a poll right before the caucuses, when\u00a0he trailed Trump by 5 points. Cruz won the Republican 2016 Iowa caucuses, with 27.6% of the vote. But sometimes a mid-fall surge\u00a0dissipates as quickly as it\u00a0began. In the 2012\u00a0race, former House Speaker\u00a0Newt Gingrich shot to 25% and first place in a November poll of likely Republican caucusgoers, after polling at fifth place with 7% in October. The lead disappeared by the end of December, when he fell back to 12%. Gingrich was a distant fourth on caucus night. \"The caucuses are replete with stories (of candidates) who've gotten out early and then came under closer public scrutiny and couldn't maintain their position as the front-runner,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cI think, if I were, for example, looking at Mayor Buttigieg right now, I'd be a little worried. It's November. You don't want to be hot in November because then you become a target,\" he said. \"What you want to do is become hot in the last two weeks of January.\" As Gingrich enjoyed his moment on top of the polls, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania lay in wait. In that same November 2011 poll, Santorum garnered just 6% of the vote, tied with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in sixth place. Santorum\u00a0languished in early Iowa Polls. In June, October and November 2011, he gained only 2\u00a0percentage points, moving up from 4%. He was not\u00a0leading among any demographic groups.\u00a0He did not poll highest on any questions of positive or negative attributes. \u201cConservatives have kept talking up the chances of the former Pennsylvania senator, who has spent more time in the state than any other candidate,\u201d former Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich\u00a0wrote one month before the 2012 caucus. \u201cHe\u2019s just not a factor, and there\u2019s not much time left.\u201d Santorum and his family had moved temporarily to Iowa over the summer of 2011. While he didn\u2019t seem to be gaining traction among voters, he had campaigned in all 99 counties in Iowa. In the final Iowa Poll, published just days before the caucus, Santorum found his stride: He shot up to third place, with 15% of the respondents ranking him as their first choice. \u201cThe former Pennsylvania senator embodies the old political saw: Work like hell and get lucky at the end,\u201d Obradovich wrote in a column published two days before the 2012 caucuses. \u201cHe\u2019s logged over 100 days in Iowa, more than any other candidate, toiling in virtual obscurity.\u201d Santorum and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who had been a strong contender since the summer before, were nearly tied in returns on caucus night. Initially the caucuses were\u00a0called in favor of Romney by 8 votes, but two weeks and a recount later, the Iowa Republican Party announced that Santorum had a 34-vote advantage. \"If you're in this race, until the second week of January, it's not late,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cThe second week of January is when you want to start looking to who's moving up and who's falling back.\" One factor that might make a late surge more difficult this cycle:\u00a0The race is more stratified at this point than most.\u00a0After Buttigieg comes a tight pack of Warren\u00a0at 16% and\u00a0U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, both at 15%. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of\u00a0Minnesota is at\u00a06%. Everyone else is at 3% or under. Still, candidates in previous cycles have picked up well over a dozen percentage points from\u00a0November polls to caucus night. Santorum\u2019s jump from the November poll to the actual result\u00a0was nearly 19 percentage points. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, climbed 22 percentage points\u00a0from\u00a0a November poll to\u00a0his caucus results. If a struggling 2020 candidate picks up just 10 percentage points\u00a0over the next two months, that candidate\u00a0could be in the running for one of the three\u00a0coveted tickets out of Iowa. Since\u00a0the modern Iowa presidential caucuses began in 1972, with just one exception,\u00a0no candidate in either party has gone on to win the\u00a0nomination without placing first, second or third when\u00a0Iowa has held\u00a0contested caucuses. The exception: In\u00a02008, eventual nominee John McCain\u00a0was barely edged into fourth place in Iowa. \"There's still time,\u201d Nagle said of low-polling candidates. \u201cIs it likely? No. But it's not unprecedented.\" Katie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at kakin@registermedia.com or at 515-284-8041. Follow her on Twitter at @katie_akin.",

      "content": "Ten Democrats took the stage in Atlanta Wednesday for the fifth primary debate, featuring a fresh round of attacks on President Donald Trump amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry and public hearings. Candidates were asked right off the bat to weigh in on impeachment, and as in previous debates, discussion on top Democratic policy priorities was punctuated by candidates offering sharp criticisms of fellow rivals. Here are some of the top moments from the debate: The debate stage was set shortly after the closing of a full day of impeachment testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and moderators asked the candidates to dive in on the topic. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked how she would convince her Republican colleagues to vote to remove the president should he be impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, 'First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. More:Catch up on USA TODAY's coverage of Wednesday's impeachment hearings In light of today's testimony from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Warren took a stab at what she says is corruption in politics, dinging Trump for appointing Sondland to his post after \"he wrote a check.\"\u00a0Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said she would not appoint donors to ambassadorships, though the practice is longstanding in administrations from both sides of the aisle. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar called for holding Trump accountable. He is accused of improperly pressuring the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into domestic politics, including into 2020 frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that while Trump is \"likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America,\" his campaign cannot only focus on it. \"We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u2019re going to lose the election,\" Sanders said. In past debates, Democrats opened with lengthy exchanges on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said, but also noted that \"doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.\" Rather, she says, it's about asking those at the top to contribute to others. \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" Warren said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome\" and difficult to evaluate. Saying that all the Democrats on stage\u00a0support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Warren's wealth tax is also part of her plan to fund Medicare for All. After taking heat from 2020 rivals at previous debates for dodging the question of how she would fund for the policy, Warren released a plan that she says would not raise taxes on the middle class. Sanders and Warren defended their Medicare for All\u00a0approaches while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during the health care discussion. After Warren talked about the need for reform, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his health care plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. Biden supports a Medicare option that builds on the Affordable Care Act, and says that people don't want to lose their current health insurance plans. \u201cI trust the American people to make a judgement that they believe is in their interest,\" Biden said. Gabbard prompts brawl with dig at Democratic Party Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the\u00a0November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a\u00a0Twitter firestorm\u00a0between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Quick wit served several candidates on stage as they sparred with each other over policy issues, prompting laughter and applause from audience members and spreading widely on social media. And as Trump's rapid response team fired off emails to counter Democrats' points, they also fired off quips aimed at the president. Booker slammed Biden for saying this week that he was not prepared to support\u00a0legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said to Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. His earlier comments included that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug.\" That view has puts Biden at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties, according to polls. Booker also used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates in the polls for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in first\u00a0place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said, taking a stab at Trump. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d Before the debate even began, the Biden campaign mistakenly sent an email to supporters that was meant to go out after the debate had ended. \"I hope I made you proud out there,\" the email said. But that wasn't the end of it, as Biden turned some heads with comments he made on stage, after a respite in his notorious verbal flubs in public appearances. Biden\u2019s response to how he would address sexual violence drew laughter for an unfortunate choice of words. He started\u00a0by reminding the audience\u00a0he authored legislation to address violence against women. He argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said, but then added.\u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d The former vice president also\u00a0touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, then saying that he was endorsed by \"the only African American woman who'd ever been elected to the United States Senate,\" likely referring to\u00a0Carol Moseley Braun. The Illinois woman, the first black woman elected to the Senate,\u00a0served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself, incredulously, as the stage erupted and Biden quickly tried to correct by saying he meant to say \"the first,\" black woman elected.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a four-time cancer survivor, is back in the hospital after experiencing chills and fever Friday night. Ginsburg, 86, was first admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for treatment of any possible infection, the court's press office announced Saturday evening. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluids and thereafter improved, the court said. She hopes to be released as early as Sunday morning. Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal minority, missed a day of oral argument last week because of a stomach illness, less than three months after completing treatment for her\u00a0fourth bout with cancer. The justice also missed two weeks of oral arguments in January following\u00a0surgery for lung cancer, marking the first time in her 26-year Supreme Court career she had been absent. Then in August, she underwent three weeks of radiation for\u00a0pancreatic cancer. The justice's first encounters with cancer came in 1999, when she had colon cancer, and in 2009, when she had her first bout with pancreatic cancer, a particularly deadly form. Ginsburg has become a cultural icon during her third decade on the high court. She has kept up a rigorous travel schedule around oral arguments, most recently appearing at Georgetown University Law Center alongside the president who nominated her in 1993, Bill Clinton, and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. Had Hillary Clinton won that\u00a0election, Ginsburg likely would have retired by this year, content to be replaced by another liberal associate justice. But with President Donald Trump in the White House, she needs to remain on the court for at least another 14 months\u00a0\u2013 and hope a Democrat defeats him in 2020\u00a0\u2013 in order deny\u00a0Trump a third nomination and conservatives a 6-3 majority on the nation's highest court. Trump named Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in his first two years in office. Ginsburg has vowed to stay on the job \"as long as I'm healthy and mentally agile.\" She remains an active participant during oral arguments, often asking the first question. In recent years, she also has been one of the quickest among her colleagues to finish writing opinions. But her health took a turn late last year after she fell in her office and cracked several ribs. The hospitalization that followed led to the discovery of lung cancer, which in turn led to her absence from the court in January while recovering from surgery. Her bout with pancreatic cancer this summer was her second with that particularly deadly form.\u00a0The average five-year survival rate is 9%, lowest of all cancers. Ginsburg has lived 10 years since her first bout. \"As cancer survivors know, that dread disease is a challenge, and it helps to know that people are rooting for you,\" she said during a visit to the famed 92nd Street Y in New York City in September. Before her latest cancer was diagnosed, Ginsburg said\u00a0she\u00a0hoped to stay on the bench\u00a0for at least five more years, noting that\u00a0Associate Justice John Paul Stevens\u00a0served until age 90. Stevens died in July at 99. Ginsburg's predicament is similar to that faced by the court's last civil rights pioneer, Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, in 1991. With his health declining as he approached his 83rd birthday, he\u00a0retired during the third year of Republican George H.W. Bush's presidency. Marshall\u00a0ultimately lived four days into the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton. But by then\u00a0his seat was held by\u00a0Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, still the court's most conservative member. AMERIND Risk",

Trump had said on Twitter that because of Google's misdeeds, \"Google must be sued\" and added that his electoral victory should have been larger. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, rated Trump's claim \"false.\" The site noted that Trump appeared to be referring to a 2017 research paper by psychologists Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson. The paper had claimed that users' search results were biased in favor of Clinton, which could have possibly shifted votes to her. The paper's methodology and findings have been\u00a0questioned by other academics. who said the paper had failed to adequately explain its methodology or even define what \"bias\" was.

Epstein and Robertson had hedged their findings in their paper, too. \"We don\u2019t know what caused these patterns of bias,\" wrote Epstein and his co-author in the paper. Trump has frequently vented about his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. Trump won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to Clinton by several million votes, and Trump has claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally for Clinton.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Roger Stone\u00a0spun a web of lies to hide his back-channel efforts to push for the release of stolen emails that would damage then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help his longtime ally, then-Republican candidate Donald Trump, win the presidency,\u00a0a federal prosecutor told a jury Wednesday. And these back-channel efforts\u00a0reached senior\u00a0members of the Trump campaign, including the candidate himself,\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Aaron Zelinsky said during his opening arguments, tying\u00a0Stone's alleged crimes directly to Trump. \"Roger Stone lied \u2026 because the truth looked bad for the Trump campaign and the truth looked bad\u00a0for Donald Trump,\" Zelinsky said. Stone, a fixture in GOP politics known for his flamboyance and combativeness, is on trial this week on accusations he lied to Congress about his interactions with the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, an international anti-secrecy group,\u00a0during the 2016 presidential race. He also is accused of trying to force a witness to\u00a0lie. His defense attorney, Bruce Rogow, told jurors that\u00a0Stone did not \"intentionally\" or \"willfully\" mislead Congress. He said Stone testified voluntarily \u2013\u00a0and not because of a subpoena \u2013\u00a0before the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 during its investigation into Russian meddling in the previous election\u00a0and possible links to the Trump campaign. \"The evidence will show that\u2019s not the usual way that people go to a committee hearing \u2026 especially if they are intending to lie,\" Rogow said. Stone, 67, is among the most prominent Trump allies to be charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference. The spectacle of his\u00a0trial\u00a0could reinvigorate the Trump-Russia controversy as the president faces accusations he sought to have another country, Ukraine, interfere to damage a political opponent. Trump impeachment inquiry:Read all the transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry The trial, which could last about two weeks, comes amid a fast-moving\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00a0that has yielded damning testimony about the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the president's potential 2020 Democratic rival. Stone, who has maintained his innocence,\u00a0faces seven charges: one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. Wearing a dark gray suit, Stone appeared at his trial accompanied by his wife and daughter. During opening arguments Wednesday, Zelinsky outlined the \"five categories of lies\" that Stone told the House Intelligence Committee. First, Zelinsky said, Stone denied the existence of hundreds of written communications in which he talked about WikiLeaks,\u00a0its founder Julian Assange\u00a0and damaging emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. Second, Stone lied about having multiple intermediaries \u2013\u00a0two\u00a0people\u00a0he relied on to pass information to and from WikiLeaks, Zelinsky told jurors. Mitt Romney:a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party Third, Stone denied asking these intermediaries\u00a0to be his conduit to WikiLeaks. Zelinsky said that Stone, in fact, requested one of these former associates, right-wing political commentator Jerome Corsi, to go to\u00a0London and \"get pending Wikileaks emails\" from Assange. Assange, at the\u00a0time, was on a self-imposed exile at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Stone\u00a0also asked the other associate, radio host Randy Credico, to confer with Assange about potentially damaging emails about Libya and Clinton, who was then secretary of state, Zelinksy said. Stone also told the House Intelligence Committee that he never had written communications with Credico and Corsi about their back-channel efforts \u2014 despite the existence of \"hundreds and hundreds and hundreds\" of text messages and emails, Zelinsky said. Finally, Stone told the committee he never discussed his efforts with the Trump campaign \u2014 the last set of lies he told Congress, Zelinsky said. Prosecutors point to phone records showing Stone and Trump spoke multiple times in the summer of 2016, though they do not know what the two talked about. Stone \"dispatched\" Corsi to make contact with WikiLeaks that July, an hour after Stone and Trump talked on the phone. In August 2016, around the time that Stone was publicly acknowledging he was communicating with WikiLeaks through an intermediary, he told former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u00a0in an email that he knew how to help Trump win. McConnell:Mitch McConnell claims Senate trial 'would not lead to a removal' of Trump if held today \"But it ain't pretty,\" he said in another email that month to Steve Bannon, who was the campaign's chief executive. In early October 2016,\u00a0WikiLeaks began releasing a massive amount of hacked emails stolen from John Podesta, Clinton's former campaign chairman. The email dumps continued until Election Day. \"Roger Stone could easily have told the truth ... But Roger Stone didn\u2019t do that. He didn\u2019t even come close. Instead, he repeatedly lied to the House Intelligence Committee. He did it because if he told the truth, as he said before, it wasn\u2019t pretty. It would look bad,\" Zelinsky said. Stone's defense attorney acknowledged the existence of text messages and emails. But \"what isn\u2019t there for you to see is Mr. Stone\u2019s state of mind\" when he testified before the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017, Rogow told jurors. Rogow said the scope of the committee's investigation was not what WikiLeaks or Assange did, but what Russia did. Mueller's two-year investigation found that Russian intelligence stole the DNC emails and passed them to WikiLeaks. Stone's \"belief, his state of mind, is that the Russians did not collude with the Trump campaign,\" Rogow said.\u00a0\"His state of mind undermines any argument that he did this in a conscious, evil, purposeful way to mislead the committee.\" He said prosecutors \"plucked out\" only a few questions out of\u00a0the hundreds that Stone answered during his three-hour congressional testimony. Any knowledge Stone had about WikiLeaks' plans\u00a0was from publicly available sources, Rogow added. Stone is also accused of trying to force Credico, who was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, to lie, invoking Mafia references from \"The Godfather\" trilogy and threatening Credico's dog. Trump impeachment inquiry:Read all the transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry Stone's defense team portrayed Credico \u2014 and Corsi \u2014 as opportunists who used Stone and engaged in \"political machinations\" to make themselves look important. \"These people were playing Mr. Stone, and Mr. Stone took the bait ...\u00a0There was no intermediary between Roger Stone and Julian Assange. It\u2019s made-up stuff,\" Rogow told jurors. Rogow also said Stone\u2019s communications with members of the Trump campaign were part of \"a joint effort to get Trump elected. \"That is not a crime,\" he said. Five other former Trump campaign allies and aides have been indicted or convicted since 2017 as part of Mueller's Russia investigation. Manafort\u00a0is serving more than seven years\u00a0in prison after he was convicted on\u00a0several charges, including defrauding banks and taxpayers out of millions of dollars amassed through illicit lobbying. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn awaits\u00a0sentencing\u00a0pleaded guilty to making false statements\u00a0to investigators about his contacts with a Russian ambassador. He has not been sentenced. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney,\u00a0is serving three years\u00a0in prison\u00a0after admitting he lied to Congress about plans to build a Trump Tower in Russia.\u00a0Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who is\u00a0running\u00a0for Congress,\u00a0served a two-week prison sentence\u00a0last year after admitting he lied to investigators about his contacts with Russians. Another former campaign aide, Rick Gates,\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to lying to investigators. His sentencing has been put on hold as he cooperates in other cases, including Stone's. He may testify at Stone's trial.",

      "subtitle": "Obama at Elijah Cummings funeral: 'It falls on us to continue his work'",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Obama: 'It falls on us to continue his work' Delivering the final tribute of the service, former President Barack Obama recounted the boost Cummings gave him during his presidency, especially during the tougher times. \u201cThere is something about his voice that just made you feel better,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat deep baritone. A prophetic voice.\u201d More than once during his presidency, when the economy was struggling to pull out of a recession, or when health care legislation seemed dead in Congress, Obama said he would watch Cummings rally his colleagues. Cummings would tell them that the cost of doing nothing isn\u2019t nothing, and folks would remember why they entered public service. \u201cHe would remind all of us that our time is too short not to fight for what\u2019s good, and what is true and what is best in America,\u00a0Obama said. \u201cAnd now it falls on us to continue his work.\u201d Listening to Cummings\u2019 daughters talk about their father reminded Obama that he wants his own daughters to know that being a strong man includes being kind. \u201cYou\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect,\u201d he said. While the title \u201chonorable\u201d is conferred on \u201call kinds of people\u201d who get elected to public office, Obama said, the difference in Cummings\u2019 case was that he \u201cwas honorable before he was elected.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a difference. There\u2019s a difference if you were honorable and treated others honorably outside the limelight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAs president, I knew I could always count on Elijah being honorable and doing the right thing.\u201d The four-hour service ended with a prayer and a hymn led by the choir that spoke of leaning on God in times of grief and pain. The thousands in the audience held hands with those beside them, even strangers who they\u2019d just met, and sang along before watching Cummings\u2019 flag-draped casket carried out. Bill Clinton: 'How did he do that?' Former President Bill Clinton, who was impeached by a Republican House and saw his wife Hillary regularly slammed by GOP lawmakers, praised Cummings for being able to reach across the aisle when many in Congress do not. \u201cHe actually made, in one of the most partisan periods in our country\u2019s history, a lot of Republican friends,\u201d he said, speaking to a crowd that included Cummings\u2019 pal, North Carolina conservative Rep. Mark Meadows. \u201cWhy did he do that? How did he do that?\u201d \u201cI think he did it because everybody could see the real deal,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cHis heart was in it. No matter how hard he fought and how passionately he argued, he tried to treat everybody the way he wanted to be treated, the way he thought Americans should be treated.\u201d Cummings, Clinton\u00a0said, offered the country a lesson in these hyper-partisan times: \u201cYou know you can\u2019t run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with.\u201d It was Cummings during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing he was chairing earlier this year that helped calm a potentially explosive moment involving Meadows and\u00a0Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.. At a February hearing that featured testimony from President Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen,\u00a0Tlaib accused Meadows of a \u201cracist\u201d act by bringing a black Trump administration official to the\u00a0hearing. Cummings, trying to diffuse the situation, thanked Meadows and called him one of his best friends on the committee. \"I\u00a0know that shocks a lot of people,\" he said while adding that he did not think\u00a0Tlaib meant to call Meadows racist. \"I can see and feel your pain. I feel it. And I don't think Ms. Tlaib\u00a0intended to cause you that, that kind of pain and that kind of frustration,\" Cummings told Meadows. Clinton seemed to bring that moment up during his remarks Friday, recalling that Cummings was \u201cso proud\u201d that he could help resolve the personal spat.\u201d Eiljah Cummings' wife: 'He was a man of soul and spirit' Describing her husband\u2019s final days, when he was in a lot of pain, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said her husband kept saying he was tired and ready to go. The staff at Johns Hopkins wanted to give him \u201csunshine therapy.\u201d They rolled his bed to the roof of the hospital, where helicopters land, and he looked out over the inner harbor, his beloved south Baltimore where he grew up, and other parts of the city. \u201cBoy, have I come a long way,\u2019\u2019 he said. Cummings said her husband\u2019s fights for what he believed in weren\u2019t easy, especially in his final months when Trump repeatedly attacked him and his district. While Rep. Elijah Cummings already carried himself with grace and dignity in public settings, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said, the attacks hurt him. \u201cHe was a man of soul and spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cHe felt very deeply.\u201d Cummings said her husband would\u2019ve objected to lying in state at the Capitol yesterday, the first African American to do so. But, she added, that was a necessary part of his funeral. \u201cWe needed to make sure that he went out with the respect and the dignity that he deserved,\u201d she said, eliciting a standing ovation from the gathering as her voice rose. \u201cThis was a man of the utmost integrity. Do you hear me?....He wanted to make sure that we left a society worthy of our children.\u201d 'An ordinary man doing an extraordinary job' Joe Alexander, a former aide who called Cummings his mentor, said Cummings straddled two worlds \u2013 inner Baltimore and the halls of Congress. \u201cHe always said he was an ordinary man doing and extraordinary job,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cHowever, he was not an ordinary man. He was a brilliant man. He was born to lead and he served for all the right reasons.\u201d Another mentee, Lean Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said the city needed Cummings\u2019 moral authority to overcome the stigma of opioid addiction so it could be treated like the disease that it is. Wen named her now 2-year-old son after Cummings, a tribute that made him cry. During their last conversation, Wen told him how blessed she was to have had his mentorship. He replied that he was the blessed one, \u201cbecause you are part of my destiny as I am a part of yours.\u201d \u201cHe challenged us to be better and we are all better for knowing him,\u201d Wen said. \u201cMay we be worthy of you and may you rest in peace.\u201d 'You can call my dad and ask him' Jennifer Cummings thanked her father for giving her pride and confidence in being black \u2013 and for teaching her how to stand up to bullies. Being told by him that she was beautiful may sound basic and \u201clike a no-brainer,\u201d she said. But her dad, who insisted on buying her brown dolls, wanted her to know that rich, brown skin was just as beautiful as alabaster or any shade of the rainbow. She recounted a time when she was called ugly by another kid on the elementary school playground. \u201cMy daddy says I\u2019m beautiful,\u201d she responded. Then she pulled out of her small purse that was otherwise filled with rocks a business card. \u201cYou can call my dad and ask him,\u201d she added. Cummings, her daughter said, did not suffer fools. \u201cAnd you taught me not to either,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton: 'He kept reminding us, life is no dress rehearsal' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it\u2019s no coincidence that the late\u00a0Rep. Elijah Cummings shared a name with the Old Testament prophet Elijah, who used the power and wisdom God gave him \u201cto uphold the moral law that all people are subject to.\u201d In remarks that seemed a thinly veiled reference to President Donald Trump, Clinton got a huge applause from the mourners when she said that Cummings, like that Old Testament prophet, \u201cstood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\u201d \u201cAnd he kept reminding us, life is no dress rehearsal,\u201d she said. Clinton said Cummings\u00a0had the simple philosophy that no matter how daunting a problem seems, there\u2019s always something each person can do, even if it seems small. Toward the end of his life, Cummings begged the American people to pay attention to what was going, Clinton said. \"'When we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked,'\u00a0he said, in 2019, 'what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?,'\"\u00a0Clinton said. She ended with paraphrase of a poem Cummings recited in his first speech to Congress and would repeat to himself as many as 20 times a day as a reminder to make the most of every moment on Earth. \u201cI have only just a minute. Only sixty seconds in it,\u201d the poem begins. \u201cJust a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it.\u201d Pelosi: Cummings was our 'North Star' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had plenty of nicknames for Rep. Elijah Cummings: Mentor. Master of the House. North Star. Mr. Chairman. Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke about the late Maryland Democrat's role as a mentor to incoming lawmakers. \u201cAs we know from the Old Testament, there is a tradition to leave a seat at the table for Elijah. He might show up,\u201d she said. \u201cOur Elijah always made a seat at the table for others. He made a seat at the table for children who need education, for even new members of Congress so he could mentor them. For all who wanted to be part of the American Dream. Elijah himself personally lived the American Dream and he wanted everyone else to have that opportunity and many seats at the table.\u201d Cummings was a close advisor, someone she said she looked to for direction and whose candor was always welcome \u201cwhether we asked him or not.\u201d \u201cHe held himself to a high standard,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I called him the North Star of Congress, our guiding light.\u201d An all-star audience of mourners Elijah Cummings can still draw a powerful crowd. Two ex-presidents, a former first lady, presidential candidates, former cabinet members\u00a0and countless members of Congress - of both parties - showed up to pay their respects. Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton headlined the group but here are some of the others who came: 'He was a good man' Thousands stood outside for hours in\u00a0brisk, 50-degree weather, waiting to pay respects to Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died Oct. 17 at age 68. The line snaked\u00a0throughout\u00a0the front of New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where Cummings' funeral was held Friday. The church holds a maximum of 4,000 people, and employees warned that many would not be able to get inside. The ceremony, which will include remembrances by former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, started at 10 a.m. EST. Mary Roary told her friend Carla Fennell that she hoped she had enough tissues as the pair waited to say goodbye to Cummings, who represented parts of Baltimore in Congress for 23 years. The women both had fond memories of the longtime congressman, including once when Fennell says Cummings helped her, a single mother, find a job. \u201cHe was a good man. It\u2019s clear from looks at this line,\u201d she said motioning toward the massive number of people in line. 'Enough is enough':The moments that defined the career of Rep. Elijah Cummings His death, both women said, is bringing together people during a moment in history where Americans and politicians couldn\u2019t be more divided. \u201cHe has always had this way of bringing people together and he\u2019s doing it even after death,\u201d Roary said. \u201cThis shows us we all don\u2019t have an endless amount of time on this earth.\u201d Outside the church, a massive American flag was hoisted up by two fire truck ladders. Visitors walking into the Baptist church we\u2019re greeted by church elders and pastors welcoming each person. Many took photos of a large blanket with Cummings\u2019 face and an American flag that was hung up just outside the hall. Many swayed or sang along with their arms\u00a0raised in the air to Baptist worship music and traditional hymns. As a video played documenting Cummings\u2019 life, from his time as young boy to his career in Washington, many grabbed tissues to wipe their eyes. Original story: WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Elijah Cummings' legacy and life will continue\u00a0to be\u00a0honored Friday morning, as former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton\u00a0and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are set to speak at the late-congressman's funeral. Cummings\u00a0laid in state in Statuary Hall Thursday, making him the\u00a0the first black lawmaker to do so in the Capitol. Cummings, who represented portions of Baltimore,\u00a0died last week\u00a0at\u00a068 due to\u00a0complications related to longstanding health issues. In addition to Obama and the Clintons,\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0and former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who Cummings succeeded in a special election in 1996, will give\u00a0remarks at Cummings'\u00a0funeral. The funeral will be held\u00a0at the New Psalmist Baptist Church, where the late-congressman worshiped for nearly 40 years.\u00a0A public viewing will take place at 8 a.m. ET and the funeral will take place at 10 a.m. Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill said in a tweet Wednesday night\u00a0that the former president was asked by Cummings' widow,\u00a0Maya Rockeymoore Cummings,\u00a0to \"deliver remarks about the remarkable life and legacy of one of this country\u2019s finest public servants.\" Cummings was an early supporter of Obama's 2008 presidential run and was personal friends with the former president. Obama said in a statement following Cummings death last week that the Maryland Democrat showed the \"necessity of good people stewarding\" the checks and balances within the United States' democracy. \"Steely yet compassionate, principled yet open to new perspectives, Chairman Cummings remained steadfast in his pursuit of truth, justice and reconciliation,\" Obama said in the statement.\u00a0\"It's a tribute to his native Baltimore that one of its own brought such character, tact and resolve into the halls of power every day.\" Bill Clinton in a statement last week said\u00a0Cummings \"was a resounding voice of moral courage who fought the good fights for the people of Baltimore.\" In a statement last week, Hillary Clinton said Cummings was \"a man of principle who championed truth, justice and kindness. He fiercely loved his country and the people he served.\" Friday's funeral follows several days of memorials for Cummings. Mourners paid respects to Cummings on Wednesday as his body lay in repose at Morgan State University, a historically black college in Cummings' district. He\u00a0served on the school's Board of Regents for 19 years. On Thursday morning, family, friends and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle gathered on Capitol Hill to pay tribute. Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Mark Meadows\u00a0were among several attendees who\u00a0made remarks Thursday. Meadows, R-N.C., passionately described\u00a0his friendship with Cummings, his eyes glistening as he held back tears. \"Some had classified it as an unexpected friendship,\"\u00a0Meadows said of their bipartisan relationship in a highly partisan era. \"But for those of that know Elijah, it\u2019s not unexpected.\" Cummings casket was open to the public to view following the memorial service. Hundreds lined up Thursday afternoon to say their final goodbyes to the late-congressman. Contributing: William Cummings",

      "content": "Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" More:Follow USA TODAY's live coverage of the November debate",

      "content": "Clarifications and corrections:\u00a0The Associated Press corrected\u00a0an Oct. 18 story, used by USA TODAY, about Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton, which reported erroneously that Hillary Clinton said she believes the Russians have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d She was referring to Republicans, not Russians, according to an aide. This story has been updated to reflect that correction. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has added his name to the list of lawmakers defending fellow 2020 presidential candidate, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, after 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton suggested she was a \"favorite\" of the Russian government.. \"Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\" Sanders said in a tweet Monday. \"People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\" Gabbard has seen an outpouring of support from both sides of the political aisle after Clinton made her remarks on a podcast last week. Though Clinton did not use Gabbard's name, the comments appeared to be directed at the veteran. She said she believes Republicans are \"grooming\" Gabbard. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and they\u2019re grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\" Clinton said. \"She's the\u00a0favorite of the Russians.\" More:U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says Hillary Clinton 'knows she can't control me' Gabbard responded to the former secretary of state on Twitter, accusing Clinton\u00a0of being behind an effort to tarnish her campaign and reputation. \"You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,\" Gabbard tweeted. Gabbard\u00a0brought up her endorsement of Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary, which came after she quit as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. \"They said Clinton will never forget. That she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media will make sure you\u2019re destroyed,\" Gabbard said. Clinton also called President Donald Trump \"Vladimir Putin's dream\" and referred to 2016 Green Party opponent Jill Stein as a \"Russian asset.\" Stein received about 1% of the vote in 2016. Trump, too, defended Gabbard on Monday. \"She\u2019s accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,\" the president said. \"I don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\" Several 2020 Democratic candidates, including author Marianne Williamson, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke. \"Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,\" O'Rourke said.\u00a0\"Obviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.\" Recognizing their \"very different views,\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said that he doesn't know what the basis is for the accusation against Gabbard. \"I'd prefer to have the conversation be about policy,\" Buttigieg said\u00a0of attacks on his opponents, speaking to CNN.",

      "content": "Nica Sy felt\u00a0devastated as she stared at her laptop screen.\u00a0How could the\u00a0church that had baptized her, raised her,\u00a0nurtured her\u00a0and encouraged her to explore ordained ministry\u00a0say she was unworthy, just because of her sexuality? Sy, 20, a Filipino American college student who identifies as a lesbian, had watched\u00a0a livestream of a global\u00a0gathering of the\u00a0United Methodist Church\u00a0where\u00a0church leaders voted to continue a\u00a0ban on same-sex marriages and\u00a0openly LGBTQ people from serving as clergy. Liberal leaders\u00a0within the church had\u00a0pushed for giving individual churches and clergy autonomy over such issues\u00a0but were narrowly outvoted. \u201cThat was a really monumental moment, the rejection of who I am,\u201d Sy said. \u201cBut I also had this feeling of, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let this happen to my church.\u2019 \u201d Her reaction wasn\u2019t unique \u2013 and it might be a preview of what\u2019s to come. After years of debating gay rights, the United Methodist Church is probably headed for a big split. Months after global Methodist leaders voted against LGBTQ rights this year, five bishops representing the Western Jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church released a statement\u00a0Nov. 6\u00a0in support of LGBTQ clergy. Church leaders are debating whether to fracture into two organizations \u2013 one liberal and one conservative\u00a0\u2013\u00a0before the denomination's next annual gathering in 2020. \u201cUnity is a high priority for many of us, and we watched it fall apart in front of our very eyes,\" said the Rev. Erin Martin, the Columbia District superintendent\u00a0who oversees more than 40 Methodist clergy in the Portland, Oregon, metro area, of the vote against LGBTQ rights in February. She took a deep breath to steady herself. \"It felt as though something died that day within the United Methodist communion,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.\u00a0\u201cWe may not be able to hold together.\u201d What happens after a transgender woman is murdered?\u00a0For family and friends, a long and agonizing search for closure After Southern Baptists, Methodists make up the nation\u2019s second-largest Protestant denomination, totaling more than 6.8 million members, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Beyonc\u00e9. Baby boomers make up the majority (38%) of the congregants, and 94% of them are white, according to the Pew Research Center. At the denomination's\u00a0annual\u00a0convention in 2016, Martin said,\u00a0everyone could\u00a0sense\u00a0fissures\u00a0over the subject of sexuality. The church, she said, was \u201cstruggling for a consensus.\" She worried\u00a0that the Methodist movement\u00a0might be on the brink of a tipping point.\u00a0February's vote confirmed it. \u201cFor those who aren\u2019t part of the church, this confirms their worst suspicions\u00a0that Christians are narrow, critical and full of hate and condemnation,\u201d Martin said. Threatening to split isn't new for the United Methodist Church. At the conference in 2004, delegates voted overwhelmingly (869-41) to remain united despite disagreements\u00a0over human sexuality. But leaders on both sides said\u00a0the situation has become untenable, and separation is probably the only way forward. Legislation in favor of splitting the denomination has been submitted before next year's global gathering, including a proposal calling for\u00a0\"an amicable separation\" that\u00a0would divide the United Methodist Church in two. The Wesleyan Covenant Association, headquartered in Reynoldsburg, Ohio,\u00a0is a\u00a0group within the Methodist church that subscribes to what the Rev. Keith Boyette, president of the organization, calls a commitment to the \"historic Christian faith,\" or a more traditional take on Methodism. At the meeting in February, the Wesleyan Covenant Association endorsed the ban\u00a0on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage. Boyette, 66, said he's sad to think about a Methodist church split, but\u00a0\"it would be sadder to me if we remained mired in continual escalating conflict, which prevents the church from focusing on its primary mission, which is to make disciples of Jesus Christ.\" \"We're distracted from that in many ways because we're consumed by this conflict,\" Boyette said. He said he believes the church will divide\u00a0in spring 2020: Either it'll be a soft split, the result of an agreed plan of separation, or a hard split, in which some churches and pastors decide they've had enough\u00a0and no longer want to be part of the United Methodist Church. Boyette roots for an amicable separation. \"We're done fighting,\" he said. \"Let's find a way to release each other and go forward, and pursue the vision we each have.\" There\u2019s been an outpouring of support for the LGBTQ community since the adoption of the ban in February. Immediately after the vote at the conference, the Rev. Donna Pritchard, one of the lead delegates from Oregon, took a microphone and told everyone that Methodist churches in the\u00a0West\u00a0would \u201ccontinue to be a home for all of God\u2019s people.\u201d That night, leaders opposed to the ban gathered in a St. Louis hotel ballroom to assure each other they had no intention of excluding the LGBTQ community. The loudest support came\u00a0when bishops of the Western Jurisdiction\u00a0\u2013 which covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming \u2013 released their letter Nov. 6. Bishop Elaine Stanovsky, one of the five bishops who signed the letter,\u00a0attended the convention in February. For her, the vote, and its potential long-term implications, are heartbreaking. \u201cFor many of us, there was a sense that the church that raised us and formed us and gave us our identity and our vocations abandoned us,\u201d said Stanovsky, who has been ordained in the Methodist church\u00a0since 1983. Stanovsky\u00a0has essentially put her career on the line.\u00a0By refusing to adhere to the ban on same-sex marriage and LGBQT clergy\u00a0\u2013 which includes Stanovsky declining\u00a0to process complaints against LGBTQ clergy \u2013 Stanovsky could be put on trial within the church. It\u2019s a risk she\u2019s \u201cabsolutely willing\u201d to take \u201cwithout a moment\u2019s hesitation,\u201d Stanovksy said. \u201cThe [LGBTQ] people at risk, many of them I\u2019ve known for decades. Some of them I\u2019ve ordained, I\u2019ve appointed them to their churches,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are not nameless, faceless people, they are in my community. I often ask them to do hard work under persecution, so I better have their back.\u201d There\u2019s been no response from the church at large. A spokesperson for the United Methodists declined to comment, saying the General Conference is the only body that can speak officially for the church. The majority of Methodists support same-sex marriage, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. In a survey in 2017, PRRI found that 54% of all Methodists \u201cfavor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally.\u201d More:\u00a0They were accused of sexually abusing children, now they're the priest next door For Sy, a University of Washington junior, acknowledging her full\u00a0identity has been a long process. After starting to question her sexuality around 13, she said she \u201creally came out to myself\u201d at 16. For the past four years, she\u2019s been slowly coming out to family and friends. Sy was raised United Methodist\u00a0and has attended Beacon United Methodist Church in south Seattle since birth. She works on campus at The Wesley Club (named after John Wesley, the English cleric who founded Methodism), a student-run, LGBTQ-affirming Christian community. She\u2019s considering a career in ordained ministry, a vocation that hadn't felt off-limits because of\u00a0her sexuality. \u201cEspecially in the Northwest, I\u2019ve always felt UMC is supportive and protective of queer people in the church,\u201d Sy said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I had previously known.\u201d An hour south of Portland in Salem, Oregon, the Rev. Wendy Woodworth has been the pastor at Morningside United Methodist Churchsince 2013. Woodworth, 56, who identifies as part of the LGBTQ community, spentmost of her life closeted, a walking, talking example of a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d lifestyle. Though Woodworth has been with her wife, Lori Alton, since 1993 \u2013 the same year she got ordained\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Woodworth was once \u201cextremely cautious in terms of sharing within the United Methodist community.\u201d For years, Woodworth introduced Alton\u00a0as her friend or roommate. But being married is not a private matter, Woodworth said, so shortly after she and Alton tied the knot in 2016, she shared the news in a letter signed by other Methodist LGBTQ clergy. She didn\u2019t worry about her job so much as the vulnerability she displayed in finally revealing the truth of her identity. Her honesty, she said, deepened her relationship with her congregation. She received no hate mail or pushback. \u201cRather than my sexual orientation being a hindrance,\" Woodworth said,\u00a0\"what I\u2019ve been asking is, what does it mean for this to be an asset in my ministry?\u201d Woodworth, who was in St. Louis during the vote in February, said\u00a0it was difficult to watch her peers vote against inclusion,\u00a0but she\u2019s\u00a0undeterred, based on the bishops\u2019 letter and decades of support from her fellow Methodists. More Americans than ever are leaving the Catholic Church after the sex abuse scandal \"It\u2019s not about whether the church rejects me. For me, it\u2019s about\u00a0God loves me, God has called me into ministry. Nothing the church says can change that,\u201d she said. She has no intention of returning to a life of secrecy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a marriage certificate in the closet.\u201d When the Rev. Valerie Jackson left the Southern Baptist church, she vowed to never be part of an oppressive structure again. In 2009, Jackson started at\u00a0Iliff School of Theology, a graduate Methodist program in Denver. Drawn to the\u00a0faith\u00a0after filling out a welcome card left in a pew at Park Hill United Methodist Church, Jackson said she remembers being struck\u00a0by a\u00a0question on the card:\u00a0Did the visitor have a partner, and what was his or her name? \u201cThat blew my mind,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cUsually it\u2019s asking if you have a husband or a wife. On top of that, this place was intercultural \u2013 there were whites, blacks, Latinx, Asians. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, this is church, everybody is here!\u2019 \u201d When she\u00a0began the church\u00a0clergy ordination process,\u00a0she found \u201ca hiccup of a phrase\u201d in the Book of Discipline, a text of rules and regulations for Methodist\u00a0clergy. Jackson read that homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching. She was dumbfounded. \u201cIt actually shocked me to discover that we still had this fight to fight, because I joined UMC because inclusion was already happening,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was stunned to discover that denominationally, we had not overcome this issue.\u201d Jews, outraged by restrictive abortion laws, invoke\u00a0the Hebrew Bible in the debate Jackson complained to God in her prayers, asking why she\u2019d been led to another oppressive structure. She pressed on, certain that\u00a0God had called her toa lifein ministry. She declined to introduce her partner as such, but \u201ceverybody knew we were together,\u201d she said. After February's\u00a0vote, everything changed. \u201cI went back to Denver and openly, verbally declared the truth that I am a triple threat: I am woman, I am black and I am queer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was almost like a new birth. It created this amazing synergy in my faith community.\u201d Jackson, 58, said\u00a0she's not that upset that a denominational split is likely. She wondered if it\u2019s because she\u2019s not a \u201ccradle Methodist,\u201d someone who was born into the faith. She said her experience with breakups \u2013 Jackson has been married twice \u2013 allows her to imagine life on the other side. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cdivorce is necessary.\u201d Sy, the college student, expressed similar feelings. Yes, there was an initial ache over the vote. She felt it deeply, as did her mother, Cecille Corsilles-Sy, who raised her daughter to be Methodist. When the news hit, there were a lot of tears in their\u00a0home. \u201cThis is the church that raised and nourished me,\u201d Sy\u00a0said. \u201cThat that same community could also do this thing that so clearly hurts and rejects me, yes, that\u2019s painful. But I also know this church made me who I am. And I know what this church is and can be.\u201d She imagines a new Methodist church, where everyone feels welcome and liberated. A church that represents the intersectionality she experiences every day as an LGBTQ woman of color. A church that can engage with a younger generation less inclined to identify as religious but still hungry for spiritual connection. There have been times Sy\u2019s wondered if it\u2019s worth staying and fighting. She said\u00a0those questions and doubts are good, because they push her deeper into her faith and reinforce that she does want to be part of the Methodist community. \u201cQueer people are not responsible for making that change in the church,\u201d Sy said. \u201cBut we can reclaim what it means to be Methodist. \u201cIt\u2019s a breaking up, yes. But it\u2019s also a breaking open. And there\u2019s a lot of potential there.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON-- Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, spent time Tuesday leafing through her emails that were on display at an art exhibit in Italy. Clinton, whose 2016 campaign was shadowed\u00a0by lingering questions after an\u00a0FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while leading the State Department, sat at a replica of the Oval Office Resolute Desk and thumbed\u00a0through thousands of emails during a\u00a0visit to an\u00a0art exhibit in Venice\u00a0titled \"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails.\" According to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects, the exhibit makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some\u00a060,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails which, according to WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013.\u201d \"Hillary Clinton spent an hour yesterday reading her emails at my exhibition of all 62,000 pages of them in Venice,\" Artist Kenneth Goldsmith tweeted. The former Democratic presidential candidate and first lady was \u201cguided on a closed-door visit\u201d of the exhibition, the curators say in a statement. \"I think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first,\" the show's curator, Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, told the Huffington Post. Clinton posted a picture of herself at the exhibit\u00a0Instagram, saying that she \"found\" the emails, so someone needed to \"alert the House GOP.\" Answering reporters questions outside the exhibit, Clinton told Italian news outlet TGR Veneto, \"It was and is still one of the strangest, most absurd events in American political history.\" \"And anyone can go in and look at them -- there's nothing there,\" Clinton says. \"It's an artistic way of making the same point that I made in the book I wrote, 'What Happened,' and that is, there was nothing wrong, there was nothing that should have been so controversial.\" On Twitter on Thursday morning, she said: \"Found my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP.\" During the 2016 White House race, then-candidate Donald Trump highlighted the long-simmering controversy surrounding\u00a0Clinton\u2019s usage of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State,\u00a0and chants of \u201clock her up\u201d would often break out at his campaign rallies. Then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0penned a letter to lawmakers after the\u00a0investigation that stated the FBI stood\u00a0by its original findings, made in July of 2016, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email while\u00a0secretary of State. The often-derided refrain of \"but her emails\"\u00a0was\u00a0heard on the trail and on social media during the 2016 campaign to justify support for Donald Trump over Clinton. The remark was often attributed to Clinton opposers who were searching for a way to offset\u00a0the latest negative news about Trump. Clinton was reportedly already in Italy to attend an economic forum. In a statement provided to the Hill, the curatorial\u00a0team said\u00a0\u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary Clinton has been part of this image full of possibilities. \"The exhibition is indeed the portrait of a powerful woman, but also the portrait of a historical change in our understanding of notions such as transparency, propaganda, public and private space,\u201d they also said.

      "content": "Chelsea Clinton ended speculation that she might\u00a0run for Congress next year during an appearance on the talk show \"The View\" on Wednesday. Clinton, 39, emerged as a\u00a0possible candidate\u00a0immediately following 30-year Rep. Nita Lowey's announcement on Thursday she\u00a0wouldn't seek reelection in 2020. She was considered a frontrunner in what is expected to be a crowded field, even though Clinton herself never said she was considering entering the race. On Wednesday, she directly addressed the rumors. \"I'm not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey's seat,\" Clinton said in response to a question from co-host Whoopi Goldberg. Chelsea Clinton:Could Chelsea Clinton run for a New York House seat? Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\u00a0said she understood why people asked her about running. \"Someone has asked me some version of this question literally as long as I can remember,\" she said before recounting that she remembers being asked if she'd run for governor of Arkansas at age 3 or 4. \"I share that because I think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\" she said, referring to co-host Abby Huntsman, the daughter of former Utah governor and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Hunstman. \"It\u2019s a question we should be asking kids, like, 'Do you think about running for office one day?'\" she said. \"I hope that if the answer to\u00a0that question is, 'Yes, I'm considering it,' that you'll really think about doing it and go to run for something.\" She said she wasn't sure if she'd run for office one day, but \"right now, the answer's no.\" October debate:Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate Lowey, 82, is a longtime fixture in New York's 17th Congressional District, which includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County. Clinton's parents have lived in the ritzy hamlet of Chappaqua in the Westchester part of the district since leaving the White House at the turn of the century. Chelsea Clinton lives outside of the district in New York City, but the U.S. Constitution doesn't require a House member to live within the district he or she represents. Lowey, chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, is the first woman to head the committee. Since the district is reliably blue and overwhelmingly Democratic, her retirement has sparked interest from a number of local Democrats. 'To me it will always be Columbus Day.':Trump dismisses criticism of Christopher Columbus But the Clinton name\u00a0propelled her to the front of the pack\u00a0without so much as a public statement from the would-be candidate, and drew comparisons to Lowey's own abandoned\u00a0U.S. Senate race in 2000. The congresswoman, a Harrison resident, had eyed a run for the Senate seat that year but stepped aside to allow Hillary Clinton a clear path to the nomination. Hillary Clinton went on to win election against Republican Rick Lazio. In 2006, she won reelection to the Senate against former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News host and friend of President Donald Trump. Clinton left the Senate in 2009 after running unsuccessfully for president to become President Barack Obama's Secretary of State. With Chelsea Clinton out of the running for the seat, there are two Democrats who are officially seeking the party nomination:\u00a0David Buchwald, a state Assemblyman from White Plains\u00a0who once interned for Lowey, and\u00a0Mondaire Jones,\u00a0who launched a primary challenge from the left in July well before Lowey's announcement she wouldn't seek reelection. Debate:CNN slammed for asking about Ellen, but not climate change, at Democratic debate Jones, 38, grew up in Spring Valley and attended Harvard Law School, raised $218,000 since launching his candidacy with the goal of becoming the first gay black man elected to Congress. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in the 17th district, according to state Board of Elections figures. Registered voters without party affiliation also outnumber Republicans in the district, 110,000-103,000, according to state active voter numbers.

      "content": "The internet was abuzz with speculation this week on whether Chelsea Clinton would throw her hat in the political ring after\u00a0longtime Rep.\u00a0Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., announced\u00a0Thursday that she would not seek re-election in 2020. After all, rumors of Clinton, 39, being groomed for New York's 17th Congressional District, have long been circulating. The district represents Rockland County and part\u00a0of Westchester County, including Chappaqua, where her parents, former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, live. In an interview with The Journal News/lohud.com last year, Chelsea Clinton said she would consider a political run under certain circumstances. \u201cI think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it\u00a0matched my talents, I\u2019d have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me,\u201d she said. While she didn\u2019t have any immediate plans to run for office, she told the paper,\u00a0it was something she thought about. \u201cIf you care about what\u2019s happening in the world, you have to care about running for and holding elected office,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI hope it\u2019s a question that we ask ourselves.\u201d Chelsea Clinton's spokeswoman did not respond to an email this week about her plans, but whether she'll run is a question many are asking. On Twitter, PopularismUpdates\u00a0posted a side-by-side photo of Chelsea and Hillary Clinton (who\u00a0recently caused a Twitter storm of her own with her \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d response to President Donald Trump tweet urging her to run) tweeting:\u00a0\u201cToday Nita Lowey the Democratic representative for NY 17th Congressional District announced she is retiring. Chelsea Clinton has been speculated to run for this seat. America, it's not too late. Come 2020 we could have them BOTH in office at the same time.\u201d Chelsea Clinton does not live in the district, but unlike her mother, who had to establish residency in New York when she ran for a Senate seat in 2000, she would\u00a0not have to engage the services of a real estate agent any time soon. Members of the House of Representatives are not required to live in the district they represent; they are required\u00a0to be at least 25 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and live in the state they represent. Chelsea Clinton\u00a0lives in Manhattan with her husband and three children, but could easily relocate\u00a0to the 17th District by moving\u00a0next door to her parents in Chappaqua. The Clintonsbought the\u00a0neighboring 3,600-square-foot home at 33 Old\u00a0House\u00a0Lane for $1.16 million in August 2016. Referring to reports it would be used as a getaway home for the couple's daughter and her family, Roni Jacobson, who has lived on Old House Lane since 1984, said when the Clintons bought the house:\u00a0\"It's a perfect house for (their daughter) Chelsea. Perfect mother-daughter situation. The neighbors are delighted for them.\" What does Lowey, the first woman to lead the powerful House Appropriations Committee, think about a possible Clinton run? \"She can do whatever she wants. She\u2019s an adult,\" said Lowey in an interview with The Journal News/lohud last November. \"When I decide to retire, I am sure the list will be very long (of people interested in the seat).\u201d More:Here are the lawmakers who aren't running again in 2020 On Sunday, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will be in Hyde Park\u00a0where Chelsea is set to receive the\u00a0Eleanor Roosevelt\u00a0Val-Kill\u00a0Medal \u2014\u00a0which honors\u00a0the legacy of the late first lady \u2014\u00a0at the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park. She'll be presented the medal by\u00a0her mother, a former honoree. The mother-daughter duo have also been\u00a0hitting the talk show circuit and making\u00a0public appearances to promote their new book, \"The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience.\" On Dec.\u00a02, they will speak at the Chappaqua Performing\u00a0Arts Center for an event sponsored by the Chappaqua Public Library.

More:Read Nancy Pelosi's full remarks as she called for an impeachment inquiry of President Trump \"The president must be held accountable.

Trump tweeted after Pelosi\u2019s announcement that the inquiry was \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d\u00a0and a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed claims for months that Biden as vice president sought the\u00a0ouster in 2016 of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0served on the board of directors. The push by the vice president came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from European diplomats and the U.S. State Department\u00a0because international leaders said Shokin did too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. The Ukrainian Parliament voted Shokin out. Ukrainian officials have found no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\u201d The former First Lady, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, has been married to former President Bill Clinton for more than 40 years. While Bill Clinton was president, he engaged in a\u00a0sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was eventually\u00a0impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of the extramarital affair. However, the Senate acquitted him of both charges, and Clinton went on to serve the remainder of his second term in office. Chelsea Clinton, when asked the same question after her mother, said\u00a0she was \u201coverwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words.\u201d Clinton also told ABC that she had not been questioned in relation to recent reports\u00a0that the Trump administration is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former State Department officials who sent emails\u00a0to her private email address. \u201cI think it's an unfortunate diversion,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou go and you talk to people who've been experienced diplomats for many years, and then you retroactively classify what they said 10 years ago? I think it's really a shame that they're doing that, and hopefully people will not be distracted.\u201d On Tuesday, Clinton also sarcastically responded to\u00a0Rudy Guiliani,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer,\u00a0who invoked the Clinton Foundation while defending his involvement in the Ukraine controversy\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \u201cWP [Washington Post], NBC, and CNN are going after me because I\u2019m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption,\u201d Giuliani tweeted. \u201cMeanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!\u201d Clinton quote-tweeted his statement and quipped, \u201cYes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u201d",
