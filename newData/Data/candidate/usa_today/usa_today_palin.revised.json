      "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2013 Court documents say Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges related to domestic violence again. He was arraigned Sunday morning on three counts of felony burglary, misdemeanor reckless assault and misdemeanor criminal mischief. He remained jailed in Palmer, Alaska, as of Sunday afternoon. Track Palin previously faced domestic violence charges in 2016. Court records say he was suspected of punching his girlfriend, who then became concerned that Palin was going to shoot himself with a rifle. He took a plea deal that resulted in some of the charges being dismissed and he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possessing a firearm while intoxicated. Attorney John Tiemessen, who said he represents Sarah Palin, acknowledged the arrest Sunday and asked for privacy. No attorney was listed for Track Palin.",

Police were called to the home Saturday night by Sarah Palin, where\u00a0her husband was found to be bleeding from cuts on his head, according to an affidavit by Wasilla Police Officer Adam LaPointe. Todd Palin\u00a0told police the dispute began when his son, Track Palin, 28, called to retrieve his truck. Palin, 53, said he told his son not to come over but was told that he would come anyway to \u201cbeat his ass,\u201d LaPointe wrote, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The elder Palin said he fetched a pistol to protect his family. Track Palin told police he broke a window, disarmed his father and put him on the ground and hit him around the head, the newspaper reported. LaPointe wrote that the senior Palins had left the home when police arrived and that Sarah Palin was visibly upset. According to the Los Angeles Times, Sarah Palin called police at 8:30 p.m. and said her son was \"freaking out and was on some type of medication.\" Track Palin yelled at officers, calling them \u201cpeasants,\u201d and \u201cmoved around in a strange manner\u201d for about 15 or 20 minutes before being arrested without incident, the affidavit states. He said he had \u201cconsumed a few beers.\u201d He was arraigned Sunday and\u00a0charged with felony first-degree burglary and misdemeanor fourth-degree assault. He was still jailed at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility as of Monday evening, according to the Times.

We're fine.\" On Sunday, the Palins' attorney, John Tiemessen, released a statement saying: \"Given the nature of actions addressed last night by law enforcement and the charges involved, the Palins are unable to comment further. They ask that the family's privacy is respected during this challenging situation just as others dealing with a struggling family member would also request.\" The Associated Press contributed to this story.",

      "content": "Bristol Palin's husband of less than two years has filed for divorce, according to People and TMZ. Dakota Meyer, a\u00a0former U.S. Marine and Medal of Honor recipient, attempted to keep the media glare at bay by using only his and Palin\u2019s initials in the court documents, which People\u00a0obtained and posted\u00a0Wednesday. The reason for their separation? \"Discord or conflict of personalities ... that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation,\u201d the documents state. The paperwork was filed\u00a0on Jan. 29 in a Travis County court in Austin. Meyer, 29, and Palin, 27,\u00a0married in\u00a0June 2016\u00a0and have two young daughters together,\u00a0Atlee Bay, 9 months,\u00a0and\u00a0Sailor Grace,\u00a02. After initially calling off their wedding, Palin and Meyer\u00a0married six\u00a0months after Sailor's birth, following public arguing over the collapse of their\u00a0engagement in 2015, plus paternity and child-support issues. Meyer is still featured in a family photo on Palin's website, and one day ago Palin appeared cheery on her Instagram account, wishing her mother, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, a happy birthday. On Jan. 7, Meyer posted a family photo on his Instagram\u00a0with the caption, \"What matters.\" But in recent pictures on the couple's Instagram accounts, neither is wearing a wedding ring. Palin also has a 9-year-old son, Tripp, from her\u00a0relationship with Levi Johnston. Since\u00a0announcing her teenage pregnancy during her mother's 2008 vice presidential run, Palin has fashioned herself as a voice of conservative Christian values. On her website, she describes herself as \"Pro Life, Pro God, and Pro Guns.\" A recent post railed against the cancellation of a father-daughter dance in New York City over a new gender-neutral policy. \"Again and again, liberalism actually hurts girls,\" she wrote. A rep for Palin had no comment when reached by USA TODAY.",

      "content": "MEMPHIS \u2014 David Kernell, the University of Tennessee-Knoxville student who guessed his way into Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s personal email account in 2008, died last week in California. He was 30. Kernell, son of\u00a0Shelby County Schools board member and former Democratic state representative Mike Kernell, died of\u00a0complications related to progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) late Friday or early Saturday, his family confirmed in a statement Thursday. David Kernell,\u00a0once ranked in the top 10%\u00a0of chess players in the U.S., was a 20-year-old economics major at UT\u00a0when he guessed the security answers to enter Palin's Yahoo! account, changed the password to \"popcorn,\" and then posted\u00a0the new password, family photographs and\u00a0some emails on the online message board 4chan under the pseudonym\u00a0\"Rubico.\" More:Judge rejects Sarah Palin lawsuit against The New York Times More:Sarah Palin, Ted Nugent and Kid Rock visit the White House Kernell, who read that Palin may have conducted official business as governor of Alaska on her personal account, failed to find politically damaging information about Palin, who was Sen. John McCain's running mate at the time of the hacking. The case\u00a0earned the younger Kernell searing criticism from Palin and her fans, with Palin comparing the hacking to Watergate, the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee that gradually led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. At the trial, Palin described the hacking as \"the most disruptive and discouraging\" moment of the campaign. But federal jurors and a judge took a softer view of the infiltration. In 2010, after all but one of the felony charges were dropped, he served\u00a010 months in a\u00a0minimum-security prison\u00a0for obstruction of justice after destroying evidence from his computer. He also was convicted of a misdemeanor for illegally accessing\u00a0Palin's email. Between all the charges, Kernell had faced a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years probation. After exiting\u00a0prison in 2011, Kernell was released from\u00a0U.S. Probation Office supervision\u00a0in 2013. In a\u00a0page-long statement regarding his death, the family said Kernell was diagnosed with MS in 2014 and\u00a0participated in clinical research trials at the Cedars-Sinai Neurosciences Research Center in Los Angeles to help develop cures and treatments for other victims of MS. \"David did not let (the Palin)\u00a0incident define him,\" the family said. \"He returned to UT Knoxville to complete his economics degree and further refined his programming skills by helping his local community. He first volunteered his expertise to Tennessee Voices for Children,\u00a0a child advocacy non-profit group. Later, he moved to California and worked to develop facial recognition software that could identify children at risk of abuse.\" Wade Davies, a Knoxville attorney who represented Kernell in the case, declined to comment, saying he wanted to speak to Kernell's mother first. Davies argued during the trial that what Kernell\u00a0did was closer to a prank \u2014 and one that wouldn't have been prosecuted as zealously if the victim hadn't been a rising Republican star. Allan Bogle, host of the program Into the Deep on radio station WEVL-FM, said he knew Kernell through the Memphis Chess Club and that he\u00a0grew up to be a \"very smart guy.\" Bogle said Kernell used the same \"Rubico\" pseudonym to post Palin's information on 4chan\u00a0as he used to play Bogle in online chess. \"For a brief period of time he was the most famous chess player in the country,\" Bogle said of the coverage of the Palin scandal. Before stepping into the national spotlight, Kernell\u00a0graduated in 2006 from Germantown High School in the Memphis suburb of\u00a0Germantown, where two years earlier he won the Tennessee Open Scholastic Chess Championship. Besides chess, Kernell enjoyed spearfishing, free diving, rock climbing, and wilderness exploration and online gaming, the statement reads. Rep. Jim Coley, Barlett Republican and\u00a0family friend, said David was a good man, like his father and grandfather, Sam Kernell, who fought in both World War II and the Korean War. \"David picked up his good virtues from his father and his grandfather,\" Coley said. \"I was very sorry to learn about David's death.\" Services are being planned in Newport Beach, Calif.,\u00a0and in Germantown. Endowments in David\u2019s honor are being set up at the Memphis Chess Club, Cedars-Sinai Neurosciences Research Center, and the Tennessee Voices for Children.

      "content": "Former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin says she was hurt hearing Sen. John McCain regretted choosing her as his running mate in the 2008\u00a0presidential\u00a0election but doesn't fully believe the claim. Speaking with NBC News and the Daily Mail,\u00a0Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate, talked about her relationship with the Arizona Republican who is battling terminal brain cancer. McCain's new book, which chronicles his career and bid for president in 2008, reportedly includes his regret with not choosing\u00a0Joe Lieberman, then an independent senator from Connecticut, as his running mate in the 2008 race, which he lost to Barack Obama. McCain writes in the book that advisers counseled him against choosing Lieberman because of his past as a\u00a0Democrat. Palin said she doesn't believe the claim and thinks ghostwriters were behind it. \"I attribute a lot of what we're hearing and reading regarding McCain's statements to his ghostwriter or ghostwriters,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"I don't know all the details of his condition right now.

And I hope that he finds that kind of peace and contentment also to be able to look back on decisions and realize, really, things work out the way that they\u2019re supposed to work out.\" Palin's comments come as reports that a White House aide joked about McCain's death, igniting a firestorm of criticism across on both sides of the aisle. \"It doesn't matter, he's dying anyway,\" press aide\u00a0Kelly Sadler said about\u00a0McCain's opposition to CIA nominee Gina Haspel\u00a0at a meeting of White House communications staffers, according to an unnamed source cited by\u00a0The Hill's Jordan Fabian. Other outlets later confirmed the remarks. Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter and a host on ABC's\u00a0The View,\u00a0said on the show Friday that she didn't understand\u00a0how the White House could be an environment where someone could make a comment like that and \u00a0\"can come to work the next day and still have a job.\" Follow Christal Hayes on Twitter: Journo_Christal ",

(Proceeds may be hard to pinpoint; Showtime is a pay channel that does not air commercials.) \"Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country,\" she wrote. \"Truly sick.\" Palin also accused Cohen's production team of \"purposefully\" dropping\u00a0them off at the wrong Washington airport, \"knowing we\u2019d miss all flights back home to Alaska.\" Showtime had no comment.

The former Alaska governor, campaign manager Steve Schmidt, adviser Nicolle Wallace and strategist John Weaver were all left off the guest lists for\u00a0 McCain's memorial services, Politico reported, citing three unnamed sources. \"Out of respect for Sen.

Weaver, the man behind McCain's \"Straight Talk Express,\"\u00a0left the campaign in 2007 when McCain's primary run appeared doomed. The move not to invite Palin did not sit well with some conservatives. \"I don\u2019t get that,\" said \"Fox & Friends\" host Brian Kilmeade Thursday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \"If she\u2019s good enough to be VP, she\u2019s good enough to be at the funeral,\" one former aide told Politico.

      "content": "Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a\u00a0crucial Republican swing vote in Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, received a playful prodding from the former governor of Alaska on Twitter. \"I can see 2022 from my house,\" Sarah Palin tweeted on Friday afternoon, mentioning\u00a0Murkowski. The\u00a0tweet was widely viewed as a thinly-veiled threat to challenge\u00a0Murkowski in her 2022 reelection campaign to the Senate. \"From my house\" references\u00a0a 2008 Saturday Night Live sketch mocking Palin, then John McCain's running mate. To this day, many Americans believe it was Palin that\u00a0said \"I can see Russia from my house\" when\u00a0in fact the line was delivered by Tina\u00a0Fey. Earlier this year, Palin expressed a willingness to run for public office again, according to The Hill. The publication reported that she told\u00a0Fox News host Mark Levin in April that she was glad she joined the McCain ticket and would do it again \"in a heartbeat.\" On Friday Morning,\u00a0Murkowski was the only Republican to vote against a procedural move advancing Kavanaugh's nomination. More:Sen. Susan Collins a 'yes' on Brett Kavanaugh, giving Republicans enough votes \"I believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man, I believe he is a good man. But it just may be that in my view he\u2019s not the right man for the court at this time,\" she said Friday after the vote. \u201cThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I\u2019ve ever had to make and I\u2019ve\u00a0made some interesting ones in my political career.\u201d This isn't the first time Murkowski has faced the potential consequences of her votes. She lost the Republican primary to\u00a0a Tea Party challenger\u00a0in 2010, winning re-election with\u00a0a write-in campaign instead.

      "content": "Progressive Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is quickly becoming the most recognizable face among Congress' incoming freshman class. From participating in a climate change protest at\u00a0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office to being mistaken for an intern and wondering if she can afford an apartment in Washington,\u00a0the incoming New York representative has been getting a level of media attention that could make veteran lawmakers green with envy. On Monday, the self-described democratic socialist drew some attention of the negative sort when conservative critics pounced on a video in which she refers to the \"three chambers of Congress\" and the \"three chambers of government,\" which she says are the \"presidency, the Senate and the House.\" It was unclear if she meant to refer to the three branches of government, which would be the executive, legislative and judicial.\u00a0One of the conservatives who piled on Ocasio-Cortez was the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin. \"YIKES: Ocasio-Cortez Fumbles Basic Civics TWICE In 1 Statement,\"\u00a0the former Alaska governor tweeted, along with a link to a story on her website about Ocasio-Cortez's gaffe. But Twitter users were quick to say that Palin had little right to be critical given her own well-documented history of\u00a0mistakes,\u00a0misstatements and misunderstandings, which includes a claim that she had foreign policy credentials because Russia was near Alaska and a reference to our \"North Korean allies.\" In response, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that Republicans should focus on her argument rather than \"waiting to chop up word slips that I correct in real-tomd,\" adding a typo to her woes. In another tweet, she said two \"fallen GOP Vice Pres candidates\" had now gone after her. (She later clarified the other was Al Gore's running mate, Joe Lieberman, whom she considers a Republican.) and she compared Palin's tweet to \"grandpa emails\" from 2008.  This weekend, Ocasio-Cortez also drew some more media attention with a tweet proposing to swap the Columbus Day federal holiday for one on Election Day. On Saturday, the woman is about to become the youngest person serving in Congress at 29 wondered, \"How is Columbus Day a holiday but Election Day not?\" Daily Mail editor\u00a0David Martosko quipped that Ocasio-Cortez \"hasn't even started the job yet and she's already angling for more vacation days.\" In response, she\u00a0tweeted that she disagreed \"that Americans get too much vacation time\" and said Americans get less time off than people in most other developed nations.\" \"I am willing to compromise by eliminating Columbus Day to give Election Day off,\" she said. \"See? I can be pliant.\" \"One of the requirements of public service should be a sense of humor,\"\u00a0Martosko tweeted back.

      "content": "Sarah Palin called it a \"gut punch\" to be \"publicly disinvited\" to Sen. John McCain's funeral last year. Palin, the former Alaska governor, was McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election\u00a0and was the first woman nominated by the Republican Party to be vice president. In a\u00a0television\u00a0interview on \"Good Morning Britain\"on Monday, Palin said she was surprised to find she was on the list of people who had been close with McCain\u00a0who didn't get an invite\u00a0to the funeral. \"They didn't have to embarrass me and embarrass others,\" she said. \"And it wasn't just me, it was other good people in our campaign back in 2008 who were very, very loyal to Senator McCain.\" Cindy McCain:Late senator's wife tweets aggressive message she received about husband, Meghan McCain McCain-Trump feud:What's driving the feud? War record, Obamacare among the themes In \"The Restless Wave,\" his final memoir, out\u00a0in April 2018, McCain, R-Ariz., said he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate. He said he wished he had gone with his friend\u00a0former Sen. Joseph\u00a0Lieberman, I-Conn. But in the same book, McCain defended Palin. \"She stumbled in some interviews, and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight and unblinking cameras,\" McCain wrote. \"Those missteps, too, are on me. She didn't put herself on the ticket. I did. I asked her to go through an experience that was wearing me down, that wears every candidate down. I made mistakes and misjudgments, too.\" Palin attributes the ridicule she faced during and after the 2008 race to a poorly run presidential campaign. The GOP ticket lost to Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. \"They were looking for someone to blame for the really crappy type of campaign they ran,\" she said. \"And I was a scapegoat. So that's just in the past, though. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn, and I certainly learned through that.\" Palin said she and the six-term senator had \"a perfectly fine relationship,\" and their families got along. She said she corresponded with Meghan McCain, McCain's daughter, expressing her condolences about McCain's illness, a deadly form of brain cancer. McCain died Aug. 25. \"I heard it from the media \u2013 I didn't hear it from him \u2013 that he was disappointed,\" Palin said. While he was alive, McCain was\u00a0always complimentary of Palin in his public remarks. \"Sarah and I have maintained a very close and warm relationship,\" he told The Arizona Republic in 2014.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the lawsuit Tuesday, saying Palin must be allowed to collect evidence to support her claims. Still, it said Palin's burden of proof was high to show the Times acted with actual malice when it published an editorial titled \"America's Lethal Politics\" in 2017. The onetime Republican vice presidential nominee sued over the editorial published after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers in Virginia, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise. The Times' editorial was corrected twice when readers complained it appeared to blame a political action committee belonging to Palin for \"political incitement.\" A Times' spokesperson says the newspaper is disappointed and will vigorously fight the lawsuit.

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- It appears Todd Palin, the husband of former Alaska Gov. and 2008 Republican VP\u00a0nominee Sarah Palin, is filing for divorce, the Associated Press and the Anchorage Daily News\u00a0reported Monday. The court documents\u00a0appear\u00a0to show that Todd Palin asked to dissolve the 31-year-marriage, citing \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife,\u201d according to the Anchorage Daily News. The documents use\u00a0their initials instead of full names: T.M.P against S.L.P, respectively, as Todd\u2019s middle name is Mitchell and Sarah\u2019s is Louise, the AP reported. The documents accurately cite the Palins' marriage date as August 29, 1988, and the birthdates for the couple correspond as well, the AP also reported. The documents also list a child under initials T.P.V.P born April 18, 2008, also according to the AP.\u00a0The youngest Palin child, Trig Paxson Van Palin, was born that day. The rest of the couple's children are over the age of 18. Sarah Palin rose overnight to national prominence when John McCain tapped her to run as his VP in 2008 on the GOP ticket against Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The divorce filing was first reported by Anchorage blogger Craig Medred and the Anchorage Daily News.",
