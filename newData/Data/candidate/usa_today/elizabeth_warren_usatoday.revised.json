      "content": "\u00a9 Copyright 2019, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. Likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0are divided on what they want when it comes to health care, according to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. The poll\u00a0shows more than half of respondents prefer a plan other than \"Medicare for All,\"\u00a0underscoring\u00a0conflicts\u00a0over the best course of action on health care. The poll finds 36% of likely caucusgoers support a Medicare for All\u00a0plan that would eliminate private health insurance and cover everyone through a government-run health system similar to Medicare.\u00a0Close to the same share, 34%, back creation of a public option, a\u00a0health insurance program run by the government that people can choose to buy into. Another 20% say they want to restore provisions lost from\u00a0the Affordable Care Act and work incrementally from there. The 2010 law, known as Obamacare, expanded health care coverage to millions of Americans but has long been derided by Republicans. The poll\u00a0of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0was conducted Nov. 8-13. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Health care has been a dominant topic in the 2020 presidential election cycle among Democrats. On the campaign trail, Iowa crowds ask more questions about health care than any other topic, and the candidates have discussed health care extensively during televised presidential\u00a0debates. Harmony Kennis, a poll respondent and 25-year-old waitress in Ames, said she supports improving the Affordable Care Act. But she also likes the idea of a Medicare for All\u00a0plan that eliminates private insurance. Election\u00a02020:Majority of young voters want Trump impeached, removed from office, poll finds Kennis names Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as her first choice for president, and\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as her second choice. Klobuchar supports creating a public option, while Sanders backs Medicare for All. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the solution is,\u201d Kennis said. \u201cI\u2019m really open to a solution that the majority of the American people can get behind.\u201d Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both support Medicare for All. The poll shows 68% of\u00a0Warren's\u00a0supporters\u00a0and 77% of\u00a0Sanders' supporters prefer Medicare for All. Andy Monphei, a poll respondent and 37-year-old software engineer in Jefferson, backs Medicare for All. He names Sanders as his first choice for president and Warren as his second choice. \u201cThere just needs to be a safety net for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other plans that I\u2019ve heard \u2026 some people still might not be able to afford that. And I just don\u2019t think that, being the richest country in the world, that should really be something that happens.\u201d Monphei said he feels like he understands the health care debate in the Democratic presidential race because he consumes \"quite a bit\" of news daily. He\u2019s also talked several times with the Sanders campaign about Medicare for All. \u201cWhen people talk about improving the ACA, I don\u2019t always know exactly what they mean, and I don\u2019t really know how they think that\u2019s going to help,\u201d he said. 'Medicare for All':Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Other top-polling\u00a0candidates, including\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, support a public option that keeps private insurance. Forty-eight percent\u00a0of\u00a0Buttigieg supporters\u00a0and 42% of\u00a0Biden\u00a0supporters prefer a public option. But nearly a quarter or more of their supporters favor\u00a0making improvements to the Affordable Care Act (24% of Buttigieg's supporters and 29% of Biden's). Added together, 72% of Buttigieg supporters and 71% of Biden supporters opt for a choice other than Medicare for All. The division among likely Democratic caucusgoers on\u00a0health care policy relates to another split examined in the poll: whether they want their party's\u00a0nominee to advocate for big changes or\u00a0for more modest ones that have a better chance to pass. Impeachment coverage:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage A\u00a0majority of likely caucusgoers, 52%, say they would rather see the party's nominee advocate for proposals that have a good chance of\u00a0becoming\u00a0law, even if the\u00a0changes aren't as big.\u00a0That\u2019s more than the 36% who prefer a candidate who will back big ideas, even if there is a lower\u00a0chance\u00a0they would become law. Warren and Sanders have focused their campaigns on big changes, and majorities of their supporters want that from a nominee (58% of Warren supporters and 54% of Sanders supporters). Majorities of\u00a0Biden\u00a0supporters (60%) and\u00a0Buttigieg\u00a0supporters (62%) want changes that have a good chance of becoming law. The Iowa Poll, conducted November 8-13, 2019, for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 500 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses and 502 registered Republicans who are not planning to participate in the Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 2,012 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. For the registered Republican sample, responses for the 533 registered Republican contacts were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active registered Republicans in the voter registration list. Questions based on the sample of 500 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, as does the sample of 502 registered Republicans. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne WASHINGTON \u2014 The 2020 Democratic field in Iowa is led by four candidates for president, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg gaining ground in the last few months, according to a poll released Tuesday. The Monmouth University poll\u00a0found that Buttigieg is the favored candidate of 22% of respondents, putting him in the lead for the first time in Iowa. Former Vice President Joe Biden was backed by 19%, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 18% and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 13%.\u00a0All other Democratic candidates received single-digit support in the survey. But, the survey results suggest that the race is still fluid; less than one-third of respondents said they are firmly set on their choice. Buttigieg bus tour:2020 candidate talks stress dreams, misconceptions, \u2018just in case\u2019 letter to parents More:Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg shares his views on current issues Buttigieg's support has grown since Monmouth's August survey, where he\u00a0was at 8%. Biden, meanwhile, has ticked down since the summer, when he was the pick of 26% of Monmouth respondents. The Monmouth survey's\u00a0margin of error was plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. The results are based on\u00a0results among 451 Iowans likely to participate in the state's Democratic caucus. Monmouth also asked respondents about former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has recently signaled intentions to run. He was the top pick of a single voter out of 361 surveyed after he was added to the lineup, and when asked about his favorability, he came out with\u00a0a net negative 31 points. Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said that when voting begins in February, voters are more likely to turn a candidate that has been in the field longer if the race still seems wide open. \"It makes more sense to pay attention to someone like Amy Klobuchar in this scenario than look for a white knight to come riding to the rescue,\" Murray said. Klobuchar stood at 5% in this poll. Buttigieg has recently performed well in early state polling. A Quinnipiac poll in New Hampshire had the Democratic hopeful\u00a0with 15% of support, within striking distance of Biden at 20% and\u00a0Warren at 16%. Sanders stood at 14%. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll conducted nationally also found him holding his own against\u00a0Biden, Warren and Sanders. More:Who is running for president in 2020?

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 After a day of playing defense on impeachment,\u00a0President Donald Trump and his allies spent Wednesday night attacking the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0and their views\u00a0\u2013 including support for impeachment. \"Democrats Have Been Obsessed With Impeachment from Day 1,\" said a statement from the \"rapid response\" arm of Trump's re-election campaign, one of a string of\u00a0emails, tweets, and texts sent by the president's supporters during the Democratic debate. At the end,\u00a0Trump campaign spokeswoman\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany said the \"2020 Democrats were short on solutions and heavy on their unhealthy obsession with taking down President Trump via an illegitimate coup.\" In the middle of the proceedings, Trump himself tweeted out his version of the highlights from a critical impeachment hearing earlier in the day, testimony that he said exonerates him. \"That means it's all over,\" Trump said in the video. Prior to the debate, Trump tweeted out a news story about poll numbers in Wisconsin. During the debate in Atlanta, the Democratic candidates for Trump's job cited evidence that he abused power by asking another country, Ukraine, to investigate one of their colleagues, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"We have to establish the principle no one is above the law,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0\"We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.\" Biden said he has learned one thing from the impeachment hearings: \"Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear.\" Throughout the day and the evening,\u00a0Trump and his supporters pushed back on testimony from a blockbuster impeachment witness. Ambassador Gordon Sondland said Trump appeared to support the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the country. Trump said he did not know Sondland \"very well,\" and cited the ambassador's\u00a0testimony that the president told him he did not want a \"quid quo pro\" from Ukraine over investigating the Bidens. Trump's campaign stayed busy throughout the debate, emailing and tweeting responses to the various candidates while arguing that the Democratic Party as a whole is backing impeachment for political reasons. \"The Democrat candidates continue to push the Ukraine scam in a desperate attempt to impeach President Donald Trump before he wins reelection in 2020,\" said a statement from the Republican National Committee. As for other issues,\u00a0Trump and the Republicans said Democrats want to raise taxes, increase government regulations, open the nation's borders, promote unlimited abortion rights, and impose climate change controls that will cost U.S. jobs. At one point, the campaign unit known as the\u00a0\"Trump War Room\" tweeted out video of Democratic candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticizing some party colleagues. \"Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,\" Gabbard said. The Trump-ites paid particular\u00a0attention to long-standing Democratic frontrunners Biden, Sen.Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. They also played up attacks on a new contender: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose poll numbers have shot up in the early contest states of Iowa and New Hampshire. \"Crime is rising, schools are suffering, and police are demoralized in the city Pete Buttigieg has managed for nearly eight years,\" said an email from the Trump campaign. For their part, the 2020 Democrats largely defined themselves in opposition to Trump. \"We can deal with Trump's\u00a0corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country,\" said Sanders, the Vermont senator. Trump's presidency, particularly the impeachment drive, hovered over the debate. \"It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate,\" tweeted David Axelrod, a political adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Kind of low energy.\" Hours before the event, during a tour of an\u00a0Apple manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, Trump said he\u00a0believes impeachment is an effort to defeat him in the 2020 election by Democrats who are angry over his 2016 victory. \"They are trying to take it away because they can't do it fairly,\" Trump said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0In March, when\u00a0thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers in Los Angeles went on strike\u00a0over low pay and lack of benefits,\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to slam\u00a0the companies and accuse them of \"squeezing\" workers while executives cashed in. \"The drivers are fighting for living wages and better working conditions, and I stand with them,\u201d the U.S. senator from Massachusetts\u00a0wrote. That same day, her campaign\u00a0entered\u00a0expense reports for seven Lyft and 54 Uber charges totaling more than $850. Warren condemned the companies again in May for using a \u201cbusiness model [that] depends, in part, on low wages for their drivers.\u201d But between January and June, her campaign paid nearly $12,000 to the companies, according to public Federal Election Commission filings. The only candidate to top Warren on ride-sharing expenses was Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who\u00a0spent\u00a0almost $15,000. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is general counsel of Uber, though Harris also voiced support for striking drivers. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, who like Warren has frequently promised on the campaign trail to rein in big corporations,\u00a0has also complained about the ride-sharing companies. His message for the companies? \u201cThe greed has got to end.\u201d His campaign still spent over $9,000 on Ubers and Lyfts in the first half of 2019. Sanders and Warren were also among the top spenders at a few other large technology companies, a class of businesses they have railed against repeatedly. In total, the progressive senators paid almost two million dollars to Uber, Lyft, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Their criticisms range from the companies'\u00a0practices on labor to their policies on privacy. The candidates have objected to the working conditions at Amazon warehouses, which Sanders called \u201cunconscionable.\u201d Sanders also introduced legislation \u2013 the \u201cStop BEZOS Act\u201d \u2013 in\u00a0the Senate proposing a tax on Amazon over the public benefits its employees receive. The duo even wrote to CEO Jeff Bezos warning him to stop the company\u2019s \u201cpotentially illegal anti-union behavior\u201d after a video leaked last fall that warned managers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores of the consequences of unionizing. They have also been vocal critics of what they see as monopolistic tendencies at the company. Sanders singled out Amazon for \u201cmoving very rapidly to be a monopoly\u201d at a Washington Post event in July. Sanders also frequently remarks that Amazon \u201cdid not pay one nickel\u201d in federal income taxes, despite raking in billions in profits. Earlier this month, at a New Hampshire campaign event, Sanders noted that he talks about this \u201call of the time.\u201d \u201cAnd then I wonder why The Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, doesn\u2019t write particularly good articles about me. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Sanders in remarks that drew comparisons to the criticisms President Donald Trump regularly lobs at Bezos and the Post. Trump has tweeted or retweeted criticism of The Washington Post more than 50 times since running for president. He has repeatedly accused The Post of being a \"lobbyist newspaper\" that Bezos uses\u00a0\"as protection against antitrust claims\"\u00a0against Amazon, despite assurances from top editors that Bezos allows the newsroom \"to operate with full independence.\" Like Sanders, Trump has also criticized Amazon for not paying taxes, writing on Twitter in 2015 that they are a \"big tax shelter\" with the \"power to screw public.\" He has said he is looking into antitrust policy regarding Amazon as well as\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and Google \u2013\u00a0both of\u00a0which he has also accused of anti-conservative bias. Despite his qualms, the Trump campaign paid Amazon about $17,500 in six months. In contrast, the Sanders camp spent almost $140,000 on office supplies, event supplies, and technology from Amazon in the first two quarters, while Warren spent more than $80,000 on the same goods and services. No other candidate spent even close to that amount, with Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker, D-N.J.,\u00a0coming in third at $31,000. For her part, Warren sums up her concerns about Amazon by suggesting it is acting as both \u201cthe umpire\u201d and \u201cthe player\u201d in online retail by running both the sales platform and selling its own goods. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be an umpire and have a team in the game,\u201d she says. Amazon's ability to collect data and information on all its users gives it an unfair advantage in the marketplace, Warren has said. Amazon has pushed back on this narrative. In April, the corporate Amazon News Twitter account retweeted video from a town hall where Warren discussed why she wanted to break\u00a0up big tech. \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual sellers\u2019 data to launch private label products (which account for only about 1% of sales). And sellers aren\u2019t being \u201cknocked out\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re seeing record sales every year,\u201d the tweet said. Warren responded by accusing Amazon of \u201cintentionally\" misconstruing the facts. Both Sanders and Warren have pledged that, if elected, they will seek to break up Facebook, Google\u00a0and Amazon. Warren published a plan\u00a0on the subject on Medium, vowing to make \u201cbig, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\u201d She wants regulators to roll back\u00a0big tech mergers, like Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and online retail company Zappos; Google buying navigation app Waze and smart home products maker Nest; as well as Facebook purchasing messaging platform WhatsApp and photo-driven social media site Instagram. Warren was also a top spender on Google and Facebook, which do\u00a0business during presidential campaign cycles with internet advertising, digital media\u00a0and subscriptions. She spent over $440,000 on Google, second to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg who almost hit $500,000. And she purchased over $1.17 million of Facebook advertising, more than any other candidate. Yet she accused Google and Facebook of having \u201cscooped up\u201d content from other creators, and admonished companies that \u201chave a ton of our data\u201d when consumers ought to have \u201cmore control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.\u201d Other big spenders on Google and Facebook, such as\u00a0Buttigieg, have their own proposals for the companies. Buttigieg, for example,\u00a0believes it\u2019s too soon to contemplate breaking up any of the companies. Instead, he wants to empower the enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission with more staff, funding or authority. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including\u00a0blocking or reversing merges in cases where there\u2019s anti-competitive behavior by tech companies,\u201d he said during a townhall on CNN in April. Angie Kronenberg, chief advocate and general counsel of INCOMPAS \u2013 a trade association whose members include Facebook, Amazon, Google Fiber, Netflix and Twitter \u2013\u00a0said she was hardly surprised by the money Sanders and Warren were spending on companies they criticize. \u201cIn our experience, Americans have embraced tech innovations and services because it makes their lives easier and better,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to us that the campaigns also would be using these services because they\u2019re convenient and affordable.\u201d Kronenberg encouraged the candidates to \u201cembrace the experience\u201d that their campaign staffers and supporters are having with technology, including its \u201cconvenience,\u201d \u201caffordability,\u201d and positive impact on the economy. \u201cI do think that they need to embrace that experience as they consider potential implications for policy positions they may have in the campaigns and certainly if they\u2019re elected president,\u201d Kronenberg said. \u201cThe potential threat to the positive consumer experience could be very troubling to voters.\u201d The Federal Election Commission\u00a0only records direct disbursements from candidates\u2019 accounts. However, candidates can also buy Google and Facebook advertisements through third-party consultants or strategists. The two tech giants\u00a0have published transparency reports since May 2018 offering their most up-to-date totals for ad buys, and they show that Sanders and Warren have not withheld their funds. Warren topped the list at Google, per its transparency report, totaling $1.74\u00a0million. Buttigieg was just behind her at $1.7\u00a0million. Sanders' number totaled just over $750,000, which\u00a0placed him midway through the Democratic field, in seventh place, behind other candidates including\u00a0Harris and Vice President Joe Biden. But Sanders topped the list of Facebook ad buy totals since May 2018 on its transparency report, totaling over $2.5\u00a0million for the purchase of 34,000 ads. Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand and Biden spent similarly, at $2.48 million and $2.16\u00a0million respectively. Warren was not too far behind at just over $2\u00a0million. The only candidate spending more than any of the Democrats, according to Google and Facebook, was Trump. The Make America Great Again Committee spent $6 million on Google ads and nearly $11.5 million on Facebook ads since May 2018. Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.,\u00a0spent an additional $2 and $5 million dollars on Google and Facebook, respectively.",

      "content": "Taylor Swift can officially perform her old songs at the 2019 American Music Awards, according to a joint statement from Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions. The statement, obtained by USA TODAY,\u00a0comes after\u00a0a days-long public battle between Swift and Big Machine, the record label that now owns Swift's catalog of music preceding her latest album \"Lover,\"\u00a0which was released\u00a0under her new label, Universal Music Group. \"The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists' performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms,\" the statement reads. \"This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances for Thomas Rhett and former Big Machine Records recording artist Taylor Swift. \"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media,\" the statement says.\u00a0\"Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.\" Taylor Swift hits back\u00a0at Big Machine after label denied her claim she is blocked from performing old songs The drama began\u00a0Thursday when Swift\u00a0took to Twitter, claiming Big Machine gave her a demanding set of conditions to meet if she wants to play a medley of her\u00a0old hits at the American Music Awards show on Nov. 24, where she's being presented with the\u00a0artist of the decade award. Swift says\u00a0Scott\u00a0Borchetta\u00a0and\u00a0music tycoon Scooter\u00a0Braun, who purchased her extensive back catalog in June, are blocking her from performing her old songs on television because \"they claim that would be re-recording my music\u00a0before I'm allowed to next year.\" Big Machine responded in a statement to USA TODAY,\u00a0saying\u00a0it was \"shocked\" to see Swift's statements \"based on false information.\" \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere,\" the statement read. \"Since Taylor\u2019s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\" Later, Swift's\u00a0spokeswoman, Tree Paine, shared an updated statement with USA TODAY, insisting that Borchetta and Big Machine \"flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix.\" Taylor Swift's fight with Big Machine\u00a0is getting support from Elizabeth Warren, AOC and Cher Celebrities and politicians weighed in on ongoing drama over the weekend. \"Unfortunately,\u00a0@TaylorSwift13\u00a0is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm,\" Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren tweeted.\u00a0\"They're gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries. It's time to rein in private equity firms \u2014 and I've got a plan for that.\" Selena Gomez, a self-described best friend to Swift, also commented in a lengthy post to her Instagram story, saying her heart is \"so heavy right now.\" \"It\u00a0makes me sick and extremely angry,\" she wrote.\"...It's greed, manipulation and power. You've robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.\" Taylor Swift's attorney\u00a0says the singer never had the chance to buy her catalog 'outright' Contributing:\u00a0Andrea Mandell, Sara\u00a0Moniuszko",

      "content": "WASHINGTON -- Democrats clashed over taxes, health care and the direction of the party during a fast-paced debate in Atlanta on Wednesday, but the candidates agreed on the need to impeach President Donald Trump. Airing after an hours-long public impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill, the candidates were immediately asked about the president and the bombshell testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that Trump had created a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d scenario with Ukraine. \u201cWe have a criminal in the White House,\u201d Kalama Harris said. \u201cThe president felt free to break the law again and again and again and that is what has happened with Ukraine,\u201d Elizabeth Warren argued. \u201cWe have to establish the principle (that) no one is above the law.\u201d Trump has always cast a long shadow over the debates, but it was particularly true Wednesday as Americans continued to process hours of lengthy testimony delving into the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. That rub was clearly on display as the candidates attempted to break through wall-to-wall impeachment hearings coverage to elevate their own proposals. \u201cWe cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election,\u201d Bernie Sanders said. A Biden moment:Biden said you have to 'keep punching' to address domestic violence Is Tulsi a Democrat?:Gabbard prompts a brawl with Kamala Harris The debate came during what is potentially a reshuffling of the field, as Pete Buttigieg has surged in Iowa polling and the candidates have confronted the possibility of new challengers. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, is in the race but was not on stage. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid and is ready to spend millions. The debate was the first since Buttigieg has zoomed ahead in polling, but there was little sign initially that his higher status put a target on his back. There were few direct attacks on him during the first hour, and, at one point, Harris declined an opportunity to weigh into a controversy involving a stock image of a Kenyan woman on his website promoting a plan to address racial inequality. That changed as the debate neared its conclusion as Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar questioned his experience for the job. Buttigieg, whose rise has reportedly unnerved his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said that South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d On taxes, Warren began by touting her two-cent on the dollar tax on assets over $50 million. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. Booker criticized the plan, calling it \"cumbersome.\u201d Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. The next debate will take place Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. Biden touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was endorsed by the only African-American woman that has ever been elected to the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself. Biden was likely referring to Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the Senate. The Illinois woman served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. As the stage erupted, Biden corrected himself to say the \u201cfirst\u201d African American woman. Things got testy between Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg during a lengthy exchange about what kind of experience is needed to be president. When Buttigieg suggested his military service prepared him to be commander in chief, the Hawaii congresswoman slammed him for saying this week he was open to sending troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels under certain circumstances. Buttigieg said Gabbard was taking his remarks out of context and then swiped back at her for meeting in 2017 with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in the country\u2019s civil war. \"If you're talking about experience, let's talk about judgment,\" Buttigieg said. \u201cI would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.\u201d Gabbard fired back, saying Buttigieg lacks the \u201ccourage\u201d to sit down with the nation\u2019s adversaries. -Michael Collins and John Fritze Two days after an association of Democratic\u00a0state\u00a0attorneys general became\u00a0the first national party committee\u00a0to impose an explicit abortion litmus test on its candidates,\u00a0Warren was asked whether there\u2019s room in the party for those who oppose abortion. Saying abortion rights are human rights and economic rights, Warren said they\u2019re fundamental to what the party stands for. She was pressed on whether the party should exclude recently-re-elected Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards who has signed anti-abortion legislation. \u201cI have made clear what I think the party stands for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of the party.\u201d Klobuchar said she can\u2019t wait to be in a debate with Trump and tell him that 70% of the public support Roe v. Wade. \u201cHe is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said. Booker related abortion rights to voter suppression, saying it was voter suppression in Georgia that led to the election of a governor who supported anti-abortion legislation. - Maureen Groppe Cory Booker slammed Joe Biden for saying this week that he would not support legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. That view has put him at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties,\u00a0polls\u00a0show. - John Fritze Biden\u2019s response to how he would address domestic violence drew laughter for his unfortunate choice of words at the end of his response. The former vice president was on firm ground when he began his answer by reminding the audience that he authored legislation to address violence against women. He then argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said. \u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d - Maureen Groppe Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d -Michael Collins Biden and Sanders took issue with Steyer\u2019s claim to be the only candidate who would make addressing climate change his No. 1 as president. Steyer said he would declare a state of emergency over the issue on Day One and would also make it the top priority of his foreign policy. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Priority One,\u201d Steyer said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to get done.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from my friend,\u201d Biden interjected. He said that while he was working in the Obama administration on efforts to address climate change, Steyer was introducing more coal mines around the world. \u201cI welcome him back in the fold here,\u201d Biden said. Sanders said he\u2019s introduced legislation to declare climate change a national emergency and the government may also have to prosecute the fossil fuel industry for lying about how their product affects the planet. - Maureen Groppe Kamala Harris didn\u2019t mince words as she went on the attack over Donald Trump\u2019s policy in North Korea following reports that Kim Jong Un has no interest in another summit with the president. \u201cDonald Trump got punked,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d Would she make additional concessions to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table? No, Harris responded. Noting that Trump inherited North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons\u00a0program from the Obama administration \u2013 and other past administrations \u2013 Biden was asked how he would handle the issue differently from Obama. Biden pivoted to compare his approach to Trump\u2019s, saying he would work to rebuild U.S. alliances with allies in the region. -\u00a0John Fritze Cory Booker used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Pete Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in firsts place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. The New York Times recently reported that some candidates resent the attention and the campaign donations that have flowed Mayor Pete\u2019s way. - Michael Collins Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden offered subtly different answers over whether they believe Donald Trump should be prosecuted after his time in the White House is over. Sanders argued that no one is above the law and that, in his view, the president had obstructed justice and had committed other crimes. Biden said he would leave that decision to his Justice Department and that Democrats shouldn\u2019t go down the path of chanting \u201clock him up,\u201d a reference to a refrain often sounded at Trump campaign rallies about Hillary Clinton.\u00a0That chant has been heard at Sanders rallies, Maddow said. \u201cI would not direct my Justice Department like this president does,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI would not dictate who would be prosecuted.\u201d Sanders said he agreed with that part. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Sanders said, but then added: \u201cWhat I am of the opinion of is that the American people now do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d - John Fritze Buttigieg, whose recent surged in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has reportedly annoyed his more experienced rivals, was asked why Democrats should take a risk on someone who has only been elected to a small city. Buttigieg said South Bend, Ind., might not look big to people in Washington. But, he added, \u201cwhere we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill looks small.\u201d He argued that he can go toe-to-toe with Trump because he comes from the kind of Rust Belt community that Trump is appealing to, his military experience and knows how to bring people together to get things done. A moderator followed up by asking Klobuchar about her recent comment that a female candidate with Buttigieg\u2019s experience probably would not have made it to the debate stage. First saying that she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be at the debate, she reiterated her belief that women candidates are held to a different standard. Otherwise, she quipped, people would be able to play the game \u201cName Your Favorite Woman President.\u201d \u201cWhich we can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, adding that female candidates, \u201chave to work harder, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d But if voters worry that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, she concluded, \u201cNancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d - Maureen Groppe It started with Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Tulsi claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from Kamala Harris, who accused Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and inuendoes because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\" What started it? Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard and that Gabbard was a \"favorite of the Russians.\" On Oct. 18, Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" -- John Fritze and Nicholas Wu Sen. Bernie Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during a discussion on health care. After Elizabeth Warren talked about the need to reform the nation\u2019s health care system and touted the benefits of Medicare for All, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his healthcare plan. - Michael Collins Health care, an issue that has divided the field, was once again an early debate topic. Sanders and Warren defended their \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. President Barack Obama recently warned fellow Democrats that \u201cthis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.\u201d Asked about that in the context of Medicare for All, Sanders said Obama is right that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to tear down the system.\u201d But Washington does need to deliver on what the public wants, and people understand the health care system is \u201cnot only cruel, but dysfunctional,\u201d he said. - Maureen Groppe In past debates, Democrats opened with a lengthy exchange on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Elizabeth Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said. What's Warren's plan?:Elizabeth Warren willing to show Bill Gates how much she'd tax him: 'I promise it's not $100 billion' \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" she said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome.' Saying that all the Democrats on stage support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" -\u00a0John Fritze Elizabeth Warren said she hoped ambassadorships would no longer be handed out \"to the highest bidder,\" a swipe at Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who spent much of Wednesday testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Appointing donors as ambassadors is nothing new \u2013 Democratic presidents did it, too. But Trump has expanded the practice. Roughly 44% of Trump's foreign service appointments are people with political ties, typically\u00a0donors, compared with about 30%\u00a0for President Barack Obama, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Sondland gave $1 million to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. \"What you get probably varies based on what you want,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen. \"These kinds of donations were absolutely intended to pave the way to get an ambassadorship.\" - John Fritze The first question dived into the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with Warren being asked how she will try to convince her Republican colleagues to remove President Donald Trump if he is impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, `First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. Then Warren quickly pivoted to a key campaign theme of hers, corruption. \u201cHow did Ambassador (Gordon) Sondland get there?\u201d she asked of Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union whose dramatic testimony today of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d implicated top White House officials. Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said Sondland is an example of how money buys its way into Washington and, as president, she won\u2019t give away ambassadorships \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201d - Maureen Groppe The Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta is under way. Ten candidates will be seeking to differentiate themselves and break through hours of impeachment inquiry hearings earlier Wednesday. And that is the first question going to the candidates. -- John Fritze After October\u2019s three-hour debate, tonight\u2019s two-hour version may fly by. The candidates won\u2019t be giving opening statements and will have only about one minute at the end to make a final pitch. Tonight\u2019s questioners are an all-female panel of journalists: MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell join forces with Kristen Welker, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour are sponsoring the next debate on Dec. 19.\u00a0The Democratic National Committee has been ratcheting up the fundraising and polling levels that candidates must achieve to participate. - Maureen Groppe Although there are 10 candidates on stage, only three had a major presence outside Tyler Perry Studios. At least two dozen supporters of Pete Buttigieg held pickets with his campaign sign, at times chanting \u201cPETE FOR PRES.\u201d The Yang Gang was also out in full force. A huge fluorescent \u201cMATH\u201d sign was posted up and a man on stilts was walking around holding two large fans that said \u201cANDREW YANG.\u201d At times the group of supporters would chant some of Yang\u2019s signature phrases like \u201cPOWERPOINT.\u201d A group of Joe Biden supporters also represented the former Vice President. They would wave signs as cars passed by to enter Tyler Perry Studios. The largest groups outside the studios though were not for candidates, they were advocating for two different policies. A large group of advocates protested against family separation at the border and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. The demonstrators held banners that send \u201cEnd Deportations\u201d and \u201cChinga la migra.\u201d There were also demonstrators, who were mostly people color, advocating for charter schools. A marching band for KIPP Academy, a local charter school, marched in front of the gates of Tyler Perry Studios to advocate for charter schools. - Rebecca Morin Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is likely to get extra attention from both moderators and his fellow competitors because of his recent rise in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He\u2019s leading the field in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren can expect to be quizzed on her recent backing of a glide path into Medicare for All, a step she took after attacks from Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden that people shouldn\u2019t be forced onto one government-run plan. Biden, who entered the race as the frontrunner, will be under pressure to show he can live up to that expectation. Unease about his performance so far is one reason why former Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval recently entered the race and why former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering it. - Maureen Groppe One candidate has been popping up on the television screens of early voting states a lot more than the others: Billionaire activist Tom Steyer. The $13 million he spent on advertising in the past month accounts for more than 50% of the total amount of advertising from all the candidates \u2013 including President Donald Trump, according to an analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project released Wednesday. \u201cResidents of early voting states are seeing many more television ads from presidential candidates this cycle than they did in the 2016 presidential race, and the reason can be summed up in one word: Steyer,\u201d said Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. What Steyer says:Tom Steyer shares his views on current issues Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock made their first ad buys in the past month. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also recently ramped up their spending. Buttigieg\u2019s recent surge in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire corresponds with his increased spending on both TV and digital ads, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not possible to attribute the surge entirely to his ad spending, it has certainly played some role in his recent success,\u201d Ridout said. \u201cA strong debate performance tonight, combined with continued heavy ad spending, could help cement his place in the top tier of Democratic candidates.\u201d The number of ads that have run is way up from a comparable point in the 2016 presidential race. One difference, however, is fewer ads are being paid for by outside groups. Candidates may have done so well at raising money from small-dollar donors that they haven\u2019t needed the support of political action committees that can collect large sums from wealthy donors, said Michael Franz, another co-director of the project. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he said, \u201cmany large-dollar donors may still be waiting out this race to see which horse to bet on.\u201d - Maureen Groppe",

      "content": "Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a Twitter firestorm between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" More:Follow USA TODAY's live coverage of the November debate",

      "author": "",
      "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 For the first time, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg\u00a0will\u00a0have a target on his back when he walks onto the debate stage Wednesday in Atlanta. Buttigieg has surged into the lead in recent polls in Iowa after hitting Sen. Elizabeth Warren hard on how she would pay for her massive\u00a0Medicare expansion. At the same time,\u00a0he's navigating troubling accusations in South Carolina that his campaign grossly overstated black support for his sweeping platform for African Americans. The three other frontrunners \u2014 Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 can no longer afford to mostly ignore him as little more than a smooth-talking Midwestern curiosity, pundits say.\u00a0And for the long term, if he emerges from the debate politically unscathed, he's going to have to find a way to convince voters of color that he has their backs. \"In the past debates, he's come out swinging and he's landed some punches,\" said\u00a0Chad Kinsella, assistant professor of political science at Ball State. \"As his popularity has grown, I don't think they're going to let him go. I think a couple of people will come after him and bring him back down to Earth.\" New frontrunner?\u00a0Buttigieg shoots to the top of the 2020 field in Iowa poll A campaign spokesman for Buttigieg declined to comment on debate strategy, other than to say the mayor will be prepared. Buttigieg's record on race clearly remains his greatest vulnerability.\u00a0When a white South Bend police officer shot a black man wielding a knife in June, the mayor's bumpy relationship with African Americans was exposed. Things haven't much improved. African Americans make up a significant portion of the Democratic base and as long as he's polling at near zero percent with black voters, his path to the nomination remains murky at best. He clearly\u00a0knows he has to make up ground, recently announcing a $2 million advertising purchase in South Carolina, where the campaign has been heavily promoting his Douglass Plan, named after\u00a0abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and where he remains\u00a0mired in fifth. Things are\u00a0not going well. Prominent African Americans in South Carolina are\u00a0accusing\u00a0his campaign of embellishing\u00a0black support for the\u00a0Douglass Plan. Their criticism stems from an open letter\u00a0published Nov. 15 in the HBCU Times,\u00a0purportedly written by 400 South Carolinian\u00a0supporters of the Douglass Plan, including several elected officials, pastors, business owners and students. \"Together, we endorse his Douglass Plan for Black America, the most comprehensive roadmap for tackling systemic racism offered by a 2020 presidential candidate,\u201d the letter states. The trouble started soon after publication. Several elected leaders denied they had endorsed the plan, according to The Intercept, a\u00a0digital news publication.\u00a0A review by the publication showed many of the 400 supporters were white and some lived out of state.\u00a0The Intercept also reported a woman in a photo used to promote the platform lives in Kenya, and had never heard of the plan. According to the campaign, some leaders withdrew previously made endorsements and their names were removed.\u00a0The list of 400 people was intended to show biracial support, the campaign said,\u00a0not just endorsements from African Americans. And the photo\u00a0is a stock image, the campaign said. \u201cOur campaign is working to build a multi-racial coalition, and we sought and received input from numerous black policy experts and advisers to create a comprehensive plan to dismantle systemic racism: the Douglass Plan,\" the campaign said in a prepared statement. \"We asked a number of black South Carolinians, as well as South Carolinians from many backgrounds, to support the Douglass Plan, and we are proud and grateful that hundreds agreed to do so.\" Buttigieg scored by hitting Warren on spending. But how will he pay for his own plans? Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics\u00a0at the University of Virginia, said the rollout has been sloppy but it's not a campaign killer. Still, he said Buttigieg will have to weather a barrage of criticism. The more important question, he thinks, is whether Buttigieg can win over voters of color. In addition to the polls of African Americans, Sabato referenced\u00a0a survey\u00a0in California where the mayor had little support among Latinos. \"He doesn't just have a black problem,\" Sabato said. \"He has a brown problem.\" At Wednesday's debate, Buttigieg's response to the controversy might reveal his strategy with African American voters moving forward. In the June debate, he took responsibility for the ongoing tensions between his police department and black citizens, saying, \"I couldn't get\u00a0it done.\" That moment aside, Buttigieg has had it pretty easy at the debates so far. He's taken on the frontrunners, made his points on policy, while easily swatting away\u00a0attacks from lower-tier candidates such as\u00a0Eric Swalwell,\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Beto O'Rourke and\u00a0Amy\u00a0Klobuchar. But Wednesday, pundits don't think\u00a0Warren and Sanders, in particular, can stay on the defensive as he continues to hammer away at their more progressive positions, most notably on health care. Elizabeth Bennion,\u00a0a politics professor at Indiana University-South Bend, said there's some risk that attacking Buttigieg could simply raise his profile even higher. But she thinks the frontrunners will want to slow down his rise heading into Iowa and New Hampshire. \"As Warren, Sanders, and Biden compete with Pete Buttigieg to win the first-in-the-nation caucus in Iowa, I expect that the three national frontrunners will be more forceful in drawing distinctions between themselves and Mayor Pete,\" she said.\u00a0\"The candidates head into the November debate with many Iowa, and national, voters undecided.\" Biden might be the least likely to target Buttigieg. In fact, pundits think the former vice president would prefer Buttigieg win Iowa over Warren, who had been leading. Biden's support among African Americans remains strong, positioning him for a comeback in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, when several southern states vote. From that perspective, Warren is Biden's more significant long-term threat. Then again, Biden might be tired of Buttigieg's strategy to replace him as the moderate candidate. \"Somebody will go after Buttigieg,\" Sabato said. \"I don't know which one, maybe all of them. Warren seems the most anxious to do so.\" Warren and Buttigieg have clashed on Medicare for All. She released a $20.5 trillion funding proposal after Buttigieg and others criticized the lack of details in her proposed expansion. Meanwhile, progressive groups have dismissed Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It counterproposal as not bold enough. There's cause to think Buttigieg would win that fight. Sabato said he recently commissioned a study that showed Medicare for All was a loser among voters in Congressional races in 2018. Warren notably didn't talk much about her plan to expand Medicare at a recent trip through Iowa, which might be a sign she knows it's troubling for some Democrats. Unions, in particular, remain a strong force in the Democratic base, and they fought for health-care benefits as part of their salaries. Progressive groups have taken another tactic that might foreshadow what happens at the debate. Pointing to past tweets and statements, they accuse\u00a0Buttigieg of\u00a0flip flopping, once supporting but now opposing Medicare for All. While Buttigieg's campaign pushes\u00a0back on that, being saddled with the flip-flopper moniker has hurt others, perhaps most notably\u00a0Al Gore\u00a0in 2000. It's also possible Biden, Sanders and Warren continue to ignore Buttigieg, for the most part. If that happens, Sabato said\u00a0it's a sure sign that their internal information says he's still not much of a threat beyond Iowa. If that's the case, Buttigieg\u00a0might be positioned to continue to attack the leaders while fending off the rest of the field. And be sure, the rest of the field is likely to continue to target him. \"We'll have to see what their internal calculations are,\" Sabato said of the frontrunners. \"For the second-tier candidates, there is a lot of jealously and resentment of Buttigieg. They\u00a0see him as arrogant and inexperienced.\" In that scenario, his biggest vulnerability remains his first:\u00a0He remains the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend.

      "content": "You know Jonathan Van Ness (or \"JVN\")\u00a0as the sassiest, silliest groomer\u00a0on Netflix's\u00a0\"Queer Eye.\"\u00a0After you read his memoir \"Over the Top\" (HarperOne) out Sept. 24,\u00a0you're going to appreciate and understand his gutsy glam even more. \"Over the Top\" is full of anecdotes, detailing everything from romantic relationship struggles to the death of his stepfather\u00a0to skating on ice with Olympian Michelle Kwan. But there are two key elements to Van Ness' life that stand out the most. \"At the beginning (of 'Queer Eye')\u00a0I was really kind of nervous to talk about my HIV status and not sure if I wanted to and how I wanted to,\" Van Ness tells USA TODAY.\u00a0\"And as I\u2019ve continued to experience the world as I always have, it just became more clear to me that I wanted to be totally open with my story and be able to talk about it especially in the face of (the Trump)\u00a0administration.\" Van Ness feels it's more important than ever to speak about these issues because it disproportionately affects the LGBTQ+ community. Though the Trump administration has indeed supported grants to help end the HIV epidemic, it's been criticized by LGBTQ advocates for failing to meaningfully protect the community. The Trump administration included\u00a0$291 million in its annual budget for efforts to end the U.S. HIV epidemic. However, HIV experts pointed out other points in the budget could be detrimental to curbing the spread of the virus around the world, specifically citing a\u00a0$1.35 billion cut in the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief,\u00a0according to Kaiser Health News. Gay and bisexual men are most affected by HIV, per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures. They made up for 66% (25,748) of total HIV diagnoses in the U.S. and 82% of diagnoses in men. Van Ness uses the memoir as an opportunity to educate people on what having HIV means, what it's like to date and how you're treated in the U.S. and across the world. For starters: Once he went on an antiretroviral prescription, he was undetectable in two weeks. \"People who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner,\" Van Ness writes (and the CDC agrees). For the first time publicly, the former \"Gay of Thrones\" host\u00a0opens up about being sexually abused at a young age at church. \"There was an older boy who taught me to play a game called 'Doctor,'\" Van Ness writes. \"I would usually end up in a closet missing some of my clothes and not quite sure of exactly what happened\u00a0\u2013 but I felt a heartbeat that\u00a0I wasn't used to feeling in my chest, and a nauseating excitement inside that left me feeling a shame that I'd never experienced before.\" The trauma from this abuse would follow him into adulthood and land him in rehab for both sex and drug addiction. When it comes to his addiction recovery, he says he feels he was able to do work around his underlying issues and that he no longer takes his trauma and puts it against himself like he used to. \"I just feel like I have a very integrated and healthy sex life and my relationship to weed is gorgeous. And I don\u2019t do drugs that aren\u2019t weed,\" he says (save for a \"gorgeous little sippy-sip of alcohol\" occasionally). \"I feel really good about where I am in my life,\" he says. He meditates in the mornings and enjoys figure skating and gymnastics \u2013 the latter of which he did when he was a child. Van Ness' Instagram is full of his progress. He alsoenjoys quiet time with his cats,\u00a0family and friends. Van Ness is currently in therapy. Given all his athletics: Does he want to compete in the Olympics? Maybe the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing? One can dream. He'd like to go as a spectator or to carry bags for Team USA, noting\u00a0he doesn't \"want to be delusional\" when it comes to competing himself. Van Ness also has his hands full between this book, \"Queer Eye\" (\"I certainly want to do it as long as they'll have me,\" he says), his \"Getting Curious\" podcast and his stand-up comedy. He also intends on campaigning for one of the 2020 candidates, though remained coy about any kind of endorsement  (he ultimately endorsed Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Sept. 25 on Twitter). But as \"Over the Top\" shows, Van Ness will know when he's ready to tell his story.

      "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013\u00a0The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality, according to Census Bureau figures. Income inequality in the United States expanded from 2017 to 2018, with several heartland states among the leaders of the increase, even though several wealthy coastal states still had the most inequality overall, according to figures released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The nation\u2019s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau\u2019s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \u201c0\u2033 indicates perfect equality, while a score of \u201c1\u2033 indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income. Social Security not enough for some:Either for passion or for money, more seniors keep working The increase in income inequality comes as two Democratic presidential candidates, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are pitching a\u00a0\u201cwealth tax\u201d\u00a0on the nation\u2019s richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities. The inequality expansion last year took place at the same time median household income nationwide increased to almost $62,000 last year, the highest ever measured by the American Community Survey. But the 0.8% income increase from 2017 to 2018 was much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years, according to the bureau. Even though household income increased, it was distributed unevenly, with the wealthiest helped out possibly by a tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, said Hector Sandoval, an economist at the University of Florida. \u201cIn 2018 the unemployment rate was already low, and the labor market was getting tight, resulting in higher wages. This can explain the increase in the median household income,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cHowever, the increase in the Gini index shows that the distribution became more unequal. That is, top income earners got even larger increases in their income, and one of the reasons for that might well be the tax cut.\u201d Personal finance:2 in 3 Americans are procrastinating on this smart money move EBay CEO Devin Wenig steps down:Company seeks to sell assets A big factor in the increase in inequality has to do with two large population groups on either end of the economic spectrum, according to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida. On one side, at the peak of their earnings, are baby boomers who are nearing retirement, if they haven\u2019t already retired. On the other side are millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are in the early stages of their work life and have lower salaries, Snaith said. \u201cI would say probably the biggest factor is demographics,\u201d he said. \u201cA wealth tax isn\u2019t going to fix demographics.\u201d The areas with the most income inequality last year were coastal places with large amounts of wealth \u2013 the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut, as well as areas with great poverty \u2013 Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality. Three of the states with biggest gains in inequality from 2017 to 2018 were places with large pockets of wealth \u2013 California, Texas and Virginia. But the other six states were primarily in the heartland \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and New Mexico. A variety of factors were at play, from a slowdown in agricultural trade and manufacturing to wages that haven\u2019t caught up with other forms of income, economists say. The best-liked personal computer brand?:Apple, according to this customer satisfaction index While some states have raised the minimum wage, other states like Kansas haven\u2019t. At the same time, the sustained economic growth from the recession a decade ago has enriched people who own stocks, property and other assets, and have sources of income other than wages, said Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a period of sustained economic growth, and there are winners and losers. The winners tend to be at the top,\u201d Ginther said. \u201cEven though we are at full employment, wages really haven\u2019t gone up much in the recovery.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign events. \"They do stories so big on ... Warren\u2019s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!\" Trump tweeted. An estimated\u00a015,000 people attended a Warren\u00a0rally in Seattle on Sunday, according to a report by Bloomberg News. It is also reported that she drew an estimated 12,000 people in St. Paul, Minn.,\u00a0just a week before. Trump's\u00a0latest dissatisfaction with the media's crowd size coverage comes as polls show\u00a0the Massachusetts senator is on the rise in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Both Warren and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have jumped to a virtual tie with front-runner former Vice President Biden in a new poll released Monday by Monmouth University. More:Poll: Sanders, Warren, Biden in virtual tie for top spot among 2020 Democratic candidates However, focusing on crowd size is nothing new for Trump as he has a history of boasting about the attendance at his campaign rallies and speeches. Footage and images of Trump's\u00a0inauguration in 2017 showed that the National Mall was partially empty during the ceremony. One expert cited by the New York Times estimated that Trump drew an audience about a third the size of President Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009. Immediately after Trump's\u00a0inauguration then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u00a0insisted that Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\u201d\u00a0Then, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway famously defended Spicer\u2019s claims by referring to\u00a0them as \u201calternative facts.\u201d Additionally, it was later reported\u00a0that a government photographer edited images\u00a0of\u00a0Trump\u2019s inauguration to make the crowd size appear larger than it actually was after the president was unhappy with how the event looked in photos. Recently, after critics pushed the hashtag \"#emptyseatmagatour\" to the top of Twitter\u2019s trending topics\u00a0following footage\u00a0showing some empty seats at a New Hampshire event, the president shared photos of the event later that night and pointed\u00a0out the audience size in a series of tweets. Offline, Trump has also remarked about the size of his crowds at various events. While in Texas after Tropical Storm Harvey in August 2017, Trump stood on a platform and exclaimed, \u201cWhat a crowd, what a turnout.\u201d More\u00a0recently, when visiting a hospital treating victims of the El Paso mass shooting, Trump used the opportunity to talk about how much larger his crowd had been\u00a0during a rally in in the Texas city\u00a0months earlier compared to the crowd at a competing rally held at the same time by Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O\u2019Rourke.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 During a busy night of Republican response to debating Democrats, President Donald Trump first took a low-key approach by saying he respected his opponents \u2013 but later mocked frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren with scathing nicknames. \"I\u00a0hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said, referring to Warren while speaking to a group of House Republicans. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden). ...

Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke described Trump as a \"white supremacist\" who poses a \"mortal threat\" to the country, particularly minorities. Trump's\u00a0trip to the House Republican retreat in Maryland forced him to miss most of the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\" Trump told reporters as he left the White House.\u00a0\"I look forward to going home. We're going to have to watch it as a rerun.\" Taking a more low-key approach before his speech, Trump said the 10 Democrats on the stage in Houston \"all have their weaknesses and strengths.\" While Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders are moving up in the polls, Trump said he still sees Biden as the favorite for the nomination. \"I would imagine Biden would be able to make it if he doesn't make any major mistakes,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens.\" More:Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront In contrast to his frequent attacks on the Democrats who want to replace him, Trump said earlier Thursday he respects \"every one\" of them. \"It takes a lot of courage to run for office,\" he said. Trump then joked:\u00a0\"See that? I'm getting to\u00a0be much better as a politician.\u00a0You never thought you'd hear that answer.\" During the debate, as Trump spoke to the House Republicans, his campaign tweeted out and emailed criticisms of various Democratic statements on issues like health care, border security, gun rights\u00a0and race relations. \"Thanks to President Trump, black Americans are making historic progress and enjoying growing opportunities,\" the Trump campaign said in one email. After the debate, Trump aides declared themselves the victors. \"You know what the Democrats have barely touched?\" said Andrew Clark, the campaign's director of rapid response. \"The Trump economy. Because the Trump economy is awesome.\" Republicans prepped for their debate response throughout the day, taking to the pages of\u00a0Texas newspapers as well as the skies above Houston, where the debate is being held. The Trump campaign sponsored planes carrying banners with messages like:\u00a0\u201cSOCIALISM WILL KILL HOUSTON\u2019S ECONOMY! VOTE TRUMP 2020.\" It also took out ads in Houston and San Antonio newspapers assailing the Democrats in general. \u201cEvery single Democrat candidate has job killing, economy crushing policies that won\u2019t work for America,\u201d said Erin Perrine, Trump campaign deputy communications director. Trump and aides made their views known during earlier debates among the Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0in Miami and Detroit. The Democrats criticized Trump's leadership on those occasions, and did so again Thursday. In a pre-debate tweet, Biden cited the administration's plan to take money from the military budget to finance an anti-migration wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \"President Trump\u2019s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power,\" Biden said. \"It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children \u2013\u00a0all to score political points.\"",

      "content": "OK, but who can win? In a marathon day, congressional Democrats\u00a0led explosive hearings to consider\u00a0whether the House should impeach President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 with almost no expectation that the Republican-controlled Senate would then vote to remove him from office. During a slow-starting Democratic debate in the evening, 10 presidential hopefuls finally got animated when they argued about how they would defeat Trump\u00a0\u2014 amid nervousness among many in the party that they could hand the president a second term by making the wrong choice. \"The issue isn't what is the fight; the issue is, how are we going to win?\" Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, suggesting that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, wouldn't be able to generate strong turnout among\u00a0African Americans, the party's most loyal voters. \"We have to rebuild the Obama coalition.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg's tenure as mayor of a small, Democratic-leaning city meant he could win in red and purple districts, as she has in Minnesota. \"He said the right words, but I have the experience,\" she said.\u00a0\"I think experience should matter.\" Buttigieg was ready for that charge. \"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small,\" he said. \"But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.\"\u00a0The focus on Buttigieg reflected his remarkable rise to the front\u00a0of the field in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire since the last debate,\u00a0in October. That made him a target. 'I thought you might have been high':Quips from candidates and other top moments from the November Democratic debate But the tone of the debate, sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post,\u00a0was largely civil, and the candidates'\u00a0efforts to draw sharp distinctions with one another more subdued than in previous forums. That may have reflected the sobering effect of the impeachment hearings, which have convinced many Democrats of two things: that Trump committed impeachable offenses, and impeachment is not likely to remove him from office. That is more likely to depend on the 2020 election. The evening was an object lesson in the way Trump and the impeachment debate are defining the moment, a reality likely to continue through the end of this year and into the\u00a0next. The House investigation of the president, and the Senate trial that would follow passage of Articles of Impeachment, are\u00a0taking the spotlight from and heightening the stakes for the Democrats who want to succeed him. All that has overshadowed the ideological divides in the sprawling field. Perhaps most notably,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorse Medicare for All, a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system that former Vice President Joe Biden called too radical to sell to swing voters or pass in Congress. But Democratic voters say their top concern isn't policy; it's\u00a0politics. In poll after poll, most say they care more about nominating a candidate who can win than they do about nominating one who agrees with them on issues. Scorecard:Here are the winners and losers from the Democratic debate On that front, there were some disquieting signs for Democrats in surveys released Wednesday before the debate.\u00a0A Marquette University Law School Poll\u00a0showed Trump for the first time surging ahead of the top four\u00a0Democrats in hypothetical head-to-head matchups in the crucial state of Wisconsin. And the Gallup Poll\u00a0showed Trump's national approval rating actually ticked up a bit as the impeachment hearings began, albeit to an anemic 43%. At the debate, Biden\u00a0argued he could not only win back the White House, but also help win back a Democratic majority in the Senate to make it possible to get things done. He noted his strong support among African Americans, though he stumbled in saying he has\u00a0been endorsed by \"the only black woman elected to the United States Senate.\" That was news to Harris, who is black. \"I'm right here!\" she interjected to laughter. Biden corrected himself, saying he had been endorsed by the first black woman elected to the Senate:\u00a0former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois. It was an unwelcome reminder of his tendency to stumble verbally. November debate:Donald Trump and allies attack Democratic candidates over impeachment drive The forum in Atlanta\u00a0opened about an hour\u00a0after the House Intelligence Committee concluded an impeachment hearing at which\u00a0Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor-turned-diplomat, testified\u00a0there had been a quid pro quo \u2014\u00a0a demand by the Trump team that nearly $400 million in military aid wouldn't be released until Ukraine announced investigations into unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden, the frontrunner, tried to spin even that\u00a0as a sign of his strength.\u00a0\"I learned that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee, that's pretty clear,\" he said. The presidential hopefuls fielded questions on addressing climate change, providing paid child care, protecting abortion rights, dealing with North Korea. But in a sign of how difficult it may be to command attention on the campaign trail while the impeachment proceedings continue on Capitol Hill,\u00a0the discussions seemed a little flat compared to the bombshells that had exploded during the day's hearings. Because the real question for Democrats is: Who can win?",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The\u00a0candidates vying for the Democratic nomination will face off Tuesday night during the party\u2019s October primary debate on the biggest stage yet. Having 12 candidates appearing on one stage together makes Tuesday\u2019s debate the biggest presidential primary debate in recorded political history, The New York Times reports. Here are four questions answered about Tuesday's democratic debate: This will be the Democratic National Committee's fourth debate. It will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times, airing live at 8 p.m. EST. Viewers can watch the debate on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and it can be streamed through both CNN\u2019s and the New York Times' websites. It will additionally\u00a0be available across mobile devices via CNN\u00a0and The New York Timess apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV;\u00a0SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio. CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the New York Times' Marc Lacey\u00a0will moderate. Opinion:Age, health and impeachment: What to watch for in this week's Democratic debate The following candidates will appear on stage together in this order: More:Democratic debate No. 4: What you need to know More:How do Democrats win in 2020? These battleground state leaders have some advice. The stage placement represents how candidates are polling.\u00a0It has become a three-way race leading into the October match-up as Biden, Warren, and Sanders are consistently polling in the top three, and they will be center stage for the second debate in a row. Gabbard and Steyer are additions\u00a0to this stage from the September debate, where 10 candidates faced off. Gabbard also said Monday\u00a0that she does plan\u00a0to attend the debate after she had previously\u00a0considered boycotting\u00a0what she claimed was \"a serious threat to our democracy\" by the Democratic National Committee\u00a0and the media. Sanders is also planning on appearing after canceling several campaign events following a heart attack and procedure a few weeks ago. The senator had two stents inserted, but recently said that he's \"going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\" Democratic debate:Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers This will be the first time the top democratic candidates have been together on one stage since the impeachment inquiry\u00a0against President Donald Trump was announced in late September by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that\u00a0subject could dominate some of the discussion as every candidate has now supported the inquiry. This comes at the same time Steyer will be looking to make waves during\u00a0his first appearance on the debate stage, and he has been making the case for impeachment for years. It may also add pressure to Biden, who has been a consistent front-runner for the nomination, as the inquiry puts his family at the center of the investigation into the president's dealings with Ukraine. The candidates may also address\u00a0Trump's decision to pull back U.S. forces from\u00a0northern Syria. This move\u00a0potentially enables\u00a0a resurgence of the Islamic State as\u00a0Turkey prepares a military assault against\u00a0Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. battle\u00a0the Islamic State. The president faces widespread backlash\u00a0for \"abandoning\" a U.S. ally. Other topics that could dominate the night include gun control and safety, immigration, LGBTQ rights\u00a0and health care. More:Democratic debate: Time for 2020 presidential candidates to get real on health care For October, candidates needed to reach 2% in at least four recognized polls and receive donations from at least 130,000 individuals. And despite this being the largest primary debate, there are still a few\u00a0candidates who will not\u00a0be gracing the stage. These include: The DNC recently released more difficult requirements\u00a0candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the\u00a0October match-up,\u00a0potentially ending some campaigns.

      "content": "WASHINGTON-- Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a jab at fellow candidate Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for being \u201cevasive\u201d in\u00a0not saying whether her health care plan would raise middle-class taxes. Warren had appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u00a0on Tuesday where she sidestepped clearly answering a\u00a0question about whether middle-class taxes would increase under her health care plan. Warren repeatedly\u00a0refers\u00a0to overall \u201ccosts\u201d and Colbert interrupts to say, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you\u2019re not mentioning in your sentence: Isn\u2019t Medicare-for-All like public school?\u201d \u201cI accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that\u2019s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,\u201d Warren answered, not responding directly\u00a0on middle-class tax increases when she continues speaking. Warren has consistently been polling in the top three in the 2020 Democratic primary field along with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Warren\u00a0supports the Medicare for All legislation\u00a0authored by Sanders. \"Sen.\u00a0Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly,\u201d\u00a0Buttigieg said during an interview on CNN\u00a0Thursday, \"I think that if you are proud of your plan and it's the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\" he continued. \"And I think it's puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Sen.\u00a0Sanders's plan will raise middle-class taxes is 'yes.' Why you wouldn't just say so, and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?\" Buttigieg also tweeted Thursday that anyone \u201cwho lets the words \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 escape their lips should be honest and straightforward about the details.\u201d And Buttigieg penned an op-ed in the Washington Post\u00a0publishedThursday ahead of his interview on CNN, laying out his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" health care plan. His plan, which he says would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, is aimed at universal coverage by providing insurance in a variety of ways, depending on an individual's insured status and income, but allows people to keep their private insurance if they like it. \"For years, Washington politicians have allowed the pharmaceutical industry, giant insurance companies, and powerful hospital systems to profit off of people when they are at their sickest and most vulnerable,\" Buttigieg's campaign website says before outlining his health care plan.",

The race has narrowed to 10 candidates who qualified for the debate, which is hosted by ABC News and Univision in Houston, Texas. The debate will start at 8 p.m. ET\u00a0on Thursday, Sept. 12 and take place at the historically black Texas Southern University. It is expected to end at 11 p.m. Notably, it will also be the first time that former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the highest polling presidential hopefuls, will take the stage in a debate. Previous debates split up the candidates over two nights because of the crowded field.

Candidates will be arranged on the debate stage based on polling with the highest ranking\u00a0in the center. The following candidates will appear, in order from left to right: To qualify for the debate, candidates had to receive donations from at least 130,000 unique individuals, consisting of at least 400 individuals in at least 25 different states. They also had to reach a threshold of 2% or higher in at least four polls designated by the Democratic National Committee. More:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide ABC's anchor George Stephanopoulos, \"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir and correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos will moderate the debate. After candidates give opening remarks, they will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, with an additional 45 seconds allowed for rebuttals. They will not give closing statements. It will be the first time that front runners Biden, Warren and Sanders\u00a0share the same debate stage. Previously, Warren and Biden have appeared on alternate nights, though Sanders and Biden have faced off before.\u00a0Biden is polling at an average of 29.8%, Warren is at 18.7% and Sanders is not far behind with 18%, according to aggregated data from RealClearPolitics. They represent a split between more moderate, traditional Democratic values with Biden, and more left-leaning, progressive ideals with Warren and Sanders.\u00a0Pundits will have their eyes on how that dynamic plays out, but talking points to watch for where these tensions\u00a0may come up include health care\u00a0and\u00a0climate change. As in previous debates, concerns about Biden's record as an elected official and the numerous flubs he has had in public speaking events are likely to come up. Biden has in the past focused on his relationship with former President Barack Obama and his electability. Gun violence prevention will also surely come up, as Texas saw two recent mass shootings and is also the home state of both Castro and O'Rourke. More:Can Democrats win Texas?

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Doubts among Democratic voters about whether a woman can win the White House pose hurdles for Elizabeth Warren even as she has gained ground against 2020 primary rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos poll. Half of likely Democratic voters\u00a0said a woman would have a harder time than a man running against President Donald Trump next year, the poll said. And while nearly nine in 10 of those voters said they would be comfortable with a female president, a smaller number, 76%, said their spouse or immediate family members were amenable to the idea. And a mere 44% of voters likely to cast ballots in Democratic primaries thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a female commander-in-chief, according to the online survey conducted Aug. 28-30.\u00a0Among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters, just 37% said they thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a woman president. The survey was based on responses from 2,012 adults, including 923 Democrats and independents who say they \"are probably or certainly\" going to participate in the 2020 Democratic primaries. The poll's\u00a0credibility interval was 2.5 percentage points for all respondents and 2.9 percentage points for likely Democratic voters. A credibility interval is similar to a margin of error. Warren, 70, has been drawing enthusiastic crowds in early voting states over the past several weeks, including last weekend\u00a0when she got a standing ovation in New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 11. Polls of voters nationwide and in early states showed that the Massachusetts senator solidified her place in the top tier of Democratic candidates over the summer. Former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, has maintained a sizable lead in the crowded field with Warren\u00a0and Sanders, 78,\u00a0consistently emerging as his nearest competitors. Yet the question of whether gender could play a role in electability \u00a0looms over the race nearly three years after Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton. Many voters see gender as an obstacle, not just for Warren but also for 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, 54, and Amy Klobuchar, 59. \"This country likes to go with tried-and-true and a white man is what they want, an older white man,\"\u00a0said Democrat Natalie Hughes, who is African American. The 55-year-old TSA screener from Landover, Maryland, said she is backing Biden because she believes he has the best chance to beat Trump. Hughes said she would vote for Warren if she is nominated but is concerned that \"the American public won\u2019t care that she\u2019ll be more presidential, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll care that she\u2019s more level headed or sane or more financially responsible than Trump.\" \"At this point in time, I don\u2019t think this country is ready for a woman,\"\u00a0said Hughes, who participated in the Ipsos poll. Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson said many Democratic voters worry that independents and moderate Republicans might be less likely to back a female candidate in an election against Trump, although there may also be some \"who have a measure of discomfort on their own and they\u2019re just reluctant to voice it.\" On the other hand, comfort with the idea of\u00a0a woman in the White House has grown in recent months. The Ipsos poll found 83% of adults who identified themselves as Democrats and independents were \"comfortable\" with a female president \u2013 an increase of nine percentage points since June when Ipsos asked the same question. Some Democratic primary voters who are wary of Warren as the nominee say their issue with her isn\u2019t gender but that her progressive policies on health care, college debt and other issues could alienate swing voters in key states. Warren declined a request to be interviewed on question of gender issues in the 2020 race. But her campaign referred USA TODAY to her remarks during a July 30 Democratic presidential debate on CNN where she reminded viewers she unseated GOP incumbent Sen. Scott Brown in 2012. \"I get it. There is a lot at stake, and people are scared,\"\u00a0she said. \"But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.\" Warren echoed those sentiments when she was asked more directly about her electability\u00a0at a New Hampshire rally Monday. \"I know how to fight, and I know how to win,\"\u00a0she said. \"But here\u2019s another key part at last as I see it: I think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe.\" Electability key:Joe Biden is a self-described 'gaffe machine.' So far, Democratic voters don't seem to mind. There were some signs of potential upside for Warren in the Ipsos data. Because Warren is not as well-known as Biden and Sanders, she has room to grow her support as voters get to know her more,\u00a0Ipsos' Jackson said. The poll found that as Democrats get better acquainted with her, they view her more favorably on traits traditionally seen as important to a nominee. For example, when all likely Democratic voters were asked to compare Biden and Warren\u00a0on their ability to stand up to Trump, 33% rated Biden as better, 27% rated Warren as better and 40% rated the two evenly. But when only the responses of voters familiar with all three were counted, 31% gave Warren the edge, while 26% said Biden was better and 43% rated them evenly. When all these voters were asked to make the same head-to-head comparison between Sanders and Warren, 33% rated the Vermont senator better, compared with 24% who chose Warren and 44% who said they were even. Among more familiar voters, Sanders (26%) and Warren (27%) were rated virtually the same with 47% calling it a draw. But the opposite theory \u2013 that less-engaged voters automatically ascribe qualities of toughness and decisiveness to the male candidates \u2013 is a red flag too,\u00a0Jackson said. \u201cSexism matters among the people who are less knowledgeable because, even up to the day of the election, we\u2019re going to have people who go out and vote who don\u2019t really know a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if sexism is moving those people then it can still matter, especially if the election\u2019s close like it was in 2016 when 70,000 votes made the difference between Trump and Clinton.\u201d Trump won three states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 by a combined 77,744 votes, giving him the electoral votes necessary to win the election. Many Democratic strategists say Clinton's flaws as a candidate were the main cause of her loss, not an unwillingness of voters to elect a woman. Clinton\u00a0struggled\u00a0to connect with blue-collar voters and was dogged by questions about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. And party activists say\u00a0the ascent of more female office holders in Congress and state offices across the country since 2016 \u2013 including in places Trump won \u2013 has\u00a0improved the prospects for a female presidential candidate in 2020. But\u00a0some worry that not much has changed in the three years since a majority of white female voters helped the country elect a president who boasted about grabbing women\u2019s genitals. \u201cWe are making great strides as a nation when it comes to sexism, but I still think there are plenty of older men, in both parties frankly, who still think it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s time to be president,\u201d said Grace Carrington, 53, a Democratic National Committee member from Coral Gables, Fla., who owns a home health care company. Warren rising:Joe Biden atop Democratic rivals in new Iowa poll, but Elizabeth Warren is catching up Carrington and others who gathered at the DNC\u2019s\u00a0summer meeting in San Francisco last month said the party needs a ticket that includes at least one woman. \u201cWomen are voting in such large numbers that if there isn\u2019t one on the ticket, there will be hell to pay,\u201d said Carrington, who is black. \u201cIt cannot be two men, and it certainly can\u2019t be two white men.\u201d That sentiment was echoed by Susan Eastlake, 73, a DNC member and national committeewoman from Boise, Idaho, who is optimistic that younger voters \u2013 who may\u00a0 be less likely to buy into gender stereotypes\u00a0\u2013 could help elect the nation\u2019s first female president. \u201cWe\u2019re in a totally different time (from 2016) when you have not just many female candidates but also many fresh faces,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know Kamala Harris or even Elizabeth Warren except for maybe her policies. So it\u2019s a chance to see people for who they are and not what their longstanding public image is.\u201d Overall, only 63% of all\u00a0respondents said the country is ready to send a woman to the Oval Office,\u00a0about the same level as 2008 when Barack Obama beat Clinton for the nomination, according to the Ipsos poll. Warren supporter Tanae McLean, 48, of Mooresville, N.C., has\u00a0doubts about whether voters are\u00a0ready to nominate a woman for president. The communications officer for a local school district thinks it's likelier today than it was at the beginning of the summer,\u00a0given the\u00a0momentum that's growing for Warren.\u00a0But she worries gender is still an issue for some. \"I hate that.\u00a0I think it\u2019s ridiculous (in) this day and age that, that is even a question,\" said McLean, an independent. \"We had a very qualified woman on the ticket in 2016 and\u00a0I get the whole likability issue with Hillary Clinton, I get the baggage that came with Hillary Clinton, but I don\u2019t think there was anybody on either side, right or left, that could say she wasn\u2019t qualified and she wasn\u2019t smart and she\u00a0didn\u2019t have what it takes to be a good president.\" Clinton broke an important barrier by becoming the first female nominee of a major party, said Robby Mook, who managed Clinton's 2016 campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the idea of a woman running for president, the idea of a woman being nominated is novel anymore,\" he told USA TODAY. \u201cI think that any woman running for office, particular executive office, faces a special set of challenges that are hopefully going to be overcome at some point but are still very much there,\" Mook said. \"For thousands and thousands of years, women were not always seen as the natural choice to take on an executive leadership role like this and a lot of that is still baked into our psychology.\" The 2020 Democratic field included six women at one point.\u00a0It's down to five after New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 52, dropped out in August. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the difficulty of envisioning a \u00a0woman in the White House is based on the simple fact that it hasn\u2019t happened yet. \u201cWe will cross this ultimate electability hurdle when a woman is elected and then we won\u2019t have to question all the time whether a woman can be elected.\u201d Margaret Rand, 64, an\u00a0ardent Warren\u00a0supporter, has no qualms about the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0ability to take on the president. \u201cI think she can beat Donald Trump because, first of all, she\u2019s head and shoulders smarter than he is,\u201d the\u00a0retiree from Oskaloosa, Iowa, said during a recent\u00a0interview. \"He uses intimidation and she doesn\u2019t have any problem standing up to people. She isn\u2019t a shrinking violet. \u2026 She\u2019s like the Energizer Bunny.\u201d Contributing: Kimberly Norvell, Des Moines Register",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A new poll conducted for Fox News shows President Donald Trump nine percentage points behind former Vice President Joe Biden in the key swing state of Wisconsin. Biden polled\u00a0at 48%, and Trump polled\u00a0at 39% in the poll' head-to-head matchups. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also held leads over Trump, though their leads were within the margin of error for the poll. Warren bested Trump 45%-41%, and Sanders led 45%-40%. Trump won Wisconsin by a narrow margin in 2016 \u2013 meaning that early polling could spell trouble for Trump going into the 2020 elections.

Asked about the current controversy surrounding Trump's pressuring of the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into Biden's son Hunter Biden, 62% of voters found it \"extremely,\" \"very,\" or \"somewhat\" concerning, and 30% were not concerned. Forty-two percent of voters said Trump needed to be impeached and removed from office, and 48% said he should not be impeached and removed. Reflecting partisan divisions, though, both the question about Ukraine and the question about impeachment split among party lines. Most Democrats found the Ukraine controversy concerning, whereas a majority of Republicans did not. Eighty-two percent of Democrats thought Trump needed to be impeached and removed from office, in contrast with only 4% of Republicans. The poll was conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 2 among 1,512\u00a0Wisconsin voters, with a sampling margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden as the leading Democratic presidential candidates, though the poll also shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection to be unchanged since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry. Among registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, 28% preferred Warren, and 25% preferred Biden as the Democratic nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., came in third place at 15%. Shortly before the poll's release, Sanders was hospitalized after suffering chest discomfort at a campaign event in Las Vegas. \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d said campaign adviser Jeff Weaver. The poll shows support for President Donald Trump's reelection among registered voters at 39%, an identical finding to Monmouth's August poll. His approval rating was 43%, and his unfavorable rating was 56%. Both South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., polled at 5%. Author and activist Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang polled at 2%. All other candidates polled at 1% or less. This poll, one of the qualifying polls for the fifth Democratic presidential debate in November, does not change the makeup of the debate stage. Sen.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The Supreme Court agreed Friday\u00a0to decide if the consumer protection agency that regulates banks and credit institutions should lose its independence. The dispute pits the Trump administration against proponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren when she was a Harvard law professor. The bureau was created as a response to the 2007-08 financial and mortgage-lending crisis Passed over by President Barack Obama to lead the bureau in 2010, Warren\u00a0went on to win election to the Senate from Massachusetts and is now leading the field for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination. Beyond those political overtones, the case represents a classic separation of powers battle between the White House and Congress. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created the bureau with a single director who can be removed during five-year terms only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" The Justice Department argues that President Donald Trump should have free rein to hire and fire at will. \"A\u00a0single director can decisively implement his own views and exercise discretion without those structural constraints,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in court papers. \"Vesting such power in a single person not answerable to the president represents a stark departure from the Constitution\u2019s framework.\" Two federal appeals courts have upheld the structure of the bureau. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did so last year,\u00a0but with the dissent of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"Independent agencies collectively constitute, in effect, a headless fourth branch of the U.S. government,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"Because of their massive power and the absence of presidential supervision and direction, independent agencies pose a significant threat to individual liberty and to the constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances.\" The Supreme Court originally upheld the constitutionality of independent agencies in 1935, but critics contend that\u00a0precedent only protects those with multiple commissioners or board members, not single directors. The Obama administration and the board's first director, Richard Cordray, opposed any change in the agency's structure. But Trump and the board's current director, Kathleen Kraninger, disagree. \"A\u00a0single-headed independent agency presents a greater risk than a multi-member independent commission of taking actions or adopting policies inconsistent with the president\u2019s executive policy,\" Francisco said. The Justice Department is urging the court to declare the single-director structure unconstitutional. The private company that initiated the case following a CFPB investigation wants the entire board invalidated. \"The need for review is beyond urgent,\" Kannon Shanmugam, the attorney representing Seila Law, which helps consumers in debt,\u00a0told the court. \"By the government\u2019s own admission,\u00a0the lingering legal doubt over the CFPB\u2019s constitutionality casts a cloud over every action that the bureau takes.\" Because the company and the government are on the same side, the justices will need to appoint someone to defend the agency's structure. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has volunteered. \"This case presents an issue of significant importance to the House: the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection that Congress enacted to provide the CFPB director with a measure of independence,\"\u00a0general counsel Douglas Letter wrote the court.",

A German company, Erzgebirgische Holzkunst Gahlenz, handmade the intricate pieces of the 30-foot-tall pyramid, The Cullman Times reported. Then it shipped them to Cullman from the small village of Gahlenz. Three of the company\u2019s workers traveled to Alabama to help erect the pyramid near the Cullman County Museum. The company is known for building large ones in Germany and around the world. Carpenter Tobias Fritzsch said the Alabama pyramid is only the third one to be built in the United States. The others were built in Texas and Colorado. The Cullman pyramid has six tiers. Most feature traditional Christmas imagery such as the nativity, nutcrackers and Santa Claus, The Times reported. Cullman\u2019s pyramid also has some specially crafted figures. They include a figure of city founder John Cullmann, who is joined by figures representing the German heritage of the city. City officials first discussed the idea of constructing a pyramid about a year ago, and much of the past year was spent organizing its construction and picking out some of its features, the newspaper reported. Juneau: Federal officials have approved changing the name of a southeast Alaska bay following a petition from tribal leaders over its association with military aggression. CoastAlaska reported the U.S. Board on Geographic Names approved changing the name of Saginaw Bay to Skanax Bay last week. The Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Historical Commission endorsed the name change earlier this year. The change was requested by the Organized Village of Kake, the area\u2019s tribal government. Three villages were targeted by the U.S.S. Saginaw warship in 1869. Tribal accounts said villagers evacuated in advance of the attacks but soldiers burned winter food stores, leading to widespread starvation and suffering. The period known as the Kake War is linked to other southeast Alaska names, including Murder Cove, Surprise Harbor and Retaliation Point. Page:A coal-fired power plant in the Navajo Nation has shut down after operating for nearly 50 years. The Navajo Generating Station near the northern Arizona community of Page stopped producing electricity on Monday. The 2,250-megawatt plant was one of the largest in the West and a longstanding target of environmentalists. They argued it polluted the air and contributed to health problems in nearby communities. The plant\u2019s owners in 2017 decided to shutter it in favor of cheaper power produced by natural gas. The closure had been expected by year\u2019s end, but the exact day wasn\u2019t certain as the plant depleted a coal stockpile. The plant employed mostly Native American workers who were offered transfers to other sites in Phoenix. The coal mine that feeds the plant also closed. Mountain Home:Harmon, the Mountain Home Police Department\u2019s K-9 officer, has received a bullet- and stab-protective vest after a charitable donation from nonprofit organization Vested Interest in K-9s, Inc. The vest was embroidered with the sentiment \u201cIn memory of K-9 Benga, Mountain Home, AR Police Department.\u201d Vested Interest in K-9s, Inc. is located in East Taunton, Mass., and its mission is to provide bullet- and stab-protective vests and other assistance to dogs of law enforcement and related agencies throughout the U.S.. The nonprofit was established in 2009 to assist law enforcement agencies with this potentially lifesaving body armor for their K-9 officers. The donation to provide one protective vest for a law enforcement K-9 is $950. Each vest has a value between $1,744-$2,283, a five-year warranty and an average weight of 4 to 5 pounds. There are an estimated 30,000 law enforcement K-9s throughout the U.S. Riverside: Repairs have been completed on a major Los Angeles-area freeway that was closed 15 weekends in a row over the past four months. The California Department of Transportation said that a $134 million pavement repair project on State Route 60 was finished early Monday. The eastbound lanes were closed starting in July for eight weekends, followed by westbound closures the next seven weekends. Caltrans will undertake another project this fall to replace bridge structures. The combination of the two along with other interchange projects has been dubbed the \u201c60 swarm.\u201d The closures sparked comparisons to \u201cCarmageddon,\u201d a 2011 freeway bridge demolition that many feared would be a traffic nightmare. Carmageddon blocked vital Interstate 405 for 55 hours. Denver: Marie Greenwood, a pioneering Denver teacher who devoted decades to fighting segregation in city institutions, has died. She was 106. Greenwood died on Friday at her Denver residence, said Elder Shane Stringfellow of Caldwell Kirk Mortuary. Greenwood was one of the first black teachers to be hired by Denver Public Schools, which would later name an elementary school after her. In the 1940s, Greenwood was a member of an interracial group that used lawsuits and other means to force restaurants and shops to serve blacks. In the 1960s, she served on a Denver Public Schools committee that studied racial inequalities in school funding and staffing in the district. As a high school student in Denver in the 1920s, the girls\u2019 dean told Greenwood she shouldn\u2019t waste her parents\u2019 money on college because she could never aspire to be more than a maid. Greenwood went on to graduate No. 3 in her class, go on to what is now the University of Northern Colorado to earn a teaching degree and return to Denver Public Schools. Greenwood was born Nov. 24, 1912, in Los Angeles. An only child, she moved with her parents to Denver in 1925. Greenwood and her late husband, William, an accountant who once ran the budget office at Denver\u2019s now-defunct Lowry Air Force Base, had four children. Funeral services were pending. New Haven: A Veterans Day protest in which a Yale University student placed red-painted latex gloves around a display of American flags has stirred some controversy at a school that has been trying to improve its image among military students. Senior Casey Odesser said her act was meant as a reminder of the death associated with U.S. military conflicts, not to disrespect members of the armed services. The Yale Daily News reported the display was removed by an Army veteran. Another student who served as a medic in Afghanistan criticized the protest in an opinion piece in the newspaper. Yale has a growing military community. The school said that as recently as 2010, there were no undergraduate veterans there. Dover:Jessica Scarane plans to run against U.S. Senator Chris Coons in the state\u2019s Democratic primary, The Delaware State News reported. Scarane is a Wilmington-based digital strategist who serves as the board president of the nonprofit Girls Inc. The 34-year-old is running on a progressive platform that includes universal health care and tuition-free college. Her platform is similar to those of more left-leaning Democrats in the Senate, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Coons said in a statement that he\u2019s proud to challenge President Trump. But he also said that he\u2019s someone who works across the aisle to \u201cget done what we can in this environment to make our state and our community stronger.\u201d Washington: The D.C. Board of Elections has received a petition asking for the recall of a district councilman accused of violating ethics rules. News outlets reported the petition was submitted Monday by the grassroots Committee to Hold Jack Evans Accountable. A council-hired law firm recently released the results of its investigation into allegations of ethics violations by Evans. It found he repeatedly violated ethics rules and used his office to benefit private clients whose payments he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest. The allegations have cost Evans his role as chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board and are under federal investigation. Enough valid signatures might trigger a special election for the seat. The elections board has 30 days to certify the petition. Daytona Beach: Sheriff\u2019s investigators said a \u201csuspicious package\u201d flagged during the screening process at Daytona Beach International Airport turned out to be a bottle of lotion. The incident forced about 200 passengers and workers to evacuate the airport at about 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday. Airport officials gave an all-clear more than an hour later, resuming normal operations. The Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office posted a statement online thanking people for their patience and saying \u201cthe object of concern was a bottle of lotion.\u201d Sheriff Mike Chitwood said during a news conference that the item was described as a possible detonator during the screening process. The bomb squad was called. Chitwood described the incident as \u201cbetter safe than sorry.\u201d Officials said two flights were delayed because of the evacuation. Atlanta: State health officials said a family of five is the likely source of a measles outbreak in a metro Atlanta county that has sickened 11 people. The Georgia Department of Public Health said the family\u2019s cases appear to have originated during travel out of the state. Two other families in Cobb County have been affected, and all 11 people were either not vaccinated or did not have a clear vaccination status. Health officials said they are continuing to notify people who might have been exposed and could face an increased risk of contracting the virus. Measles is highly contagious. The U.S. has experienced a resurgence of the illness that\u2019s fueled by outbreaks in unvaccinated communities. Honolulu: New marine life has formed in pools at a black sand beach created by the Kilauea volcano eruption, according to researchers. Hawaiian red shrimp are beginning to thrive at the site of a former boat ramp on Hawaii Island\u2019s Pohoiki shoreline, Hawaii Public Radio reported Monday. More than 700 homes were destroyed after Kilauea erupted in May 2018. State Department of Land and Natural Resources researchers observed the activity in newly formed anchialine pools, which are land-locked and filled with brackish water. The pools that formed 14 months after Kilauea\u2019s lava stopped flowing are connected to the ocean and the area\u2019s groundwater and flow with the tide. New coastlines such as the one formed by the eruption can be difficult to observe, state biologist Troy Sakihara said. He encouraged people to enjoy the sight of the pools without disturbing them, noting that sunscreen and body oil can harm wildlife. Boise: Environmental groups said the U.S. Forest Service is ignoring a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling by restarting a giant forest project in Idaho and have filed another lawsuit seeking to stop the project a second time. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other groups filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in Idaho challenging the 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest. The Forest Service and Alliance for the Wild Rockies agree the project is precisely the same as the one halted by the 9th Circuit Court\u2019s ruling against the Forest Service in August 2018. But the Forest Service said it has added wording to an environmental review to clarify technical inconsistencies and other problems that caused the court to stop the project. Naperville: A suburban Chicago high school said it has disciplined a group of students for a racially insensitive ad posted on Craigslist. Naperville Central High School Principal Bill Wiebrook sent an email to parents Monday saying administrators became \u201caware of a racially insensitive electronic post and worked as quickly as possible to investigate and address this with the students involved.\u201d The ad showed a photo of an African American student under the words \u201cSlave for sale (Naperville).\u201d Details of the discipline weren\u2019t disclosed. The ad follows an Oct. 26 incident at a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant in Naperville in which some customers said they were asked by restaurant employees to change tables because a regular customer nearby didn\u2019t want to sit next to black people. The restaurant fired two employees involved. Angola: A fire station in northeastern Indiana is the latest place for parents to safely drop off a newborn child. A Safe Haven Baby Box was unveiled Monday in Angola. The fire station is just minutes from the Michigan border, which was a factor in the location. Before leaving office, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder last year vetoed a bill that would have allowed baby boxes. The boxes allow someone to drop off a baby without fear of criminal prosecution. The box has an alarm that immediately alerts a local hospital or emergency responders.The Steuben County Community Foundation helped pay for the box, and others donated their services for the installation. When Snyder vetoed the Michigan bill, he said it was better to hand a baby to a person. That option is available under state law. Des Moines:A jury awarded $1.4million to a Burmese immigrant who wanted a circumcision but instead got a vasectomy. The Des Moines Register reported that the jury last week leveled a $2 million judgment against Dr. Kevin Birusingh, who performed the vasectomy. But jurors decided the man who filed the lawsuit, Zaw Zaw, was 30% responsible. Zaw is a 41-year-old refugee from Myanmar. He sued in November 2017, nearly two years after the errant procedure. Birusingh\u2019s attorney said Zaw, who is not fluent in English, signed two informed consents that were translated into Burmese and completed four consultations before undergoing the procedure. The lawsuit said there\u2019s no word for \u201cvasectomy\u201d in Burmese. Zaw\u2019s attorney, Marc Harding, said a doctor\u2019s referral documents showed Zaw was seeking a circumcision. Olathe: A gay rights activist said a City Council member should resign after she complained to his employer about his efforts to persuade the council to adopt an ordinance providing protections for LBGTQ residents. Brett Hoedl, chairman of the Equality Kansas Metro Kansas City chapter, said in a Facebook post that Councilwoman Karin Brownlee complained to his employer, Black & Veatch, about his advocacy for the ordinance. He said Black & Veatch supported him but others might hesitate to testify before the council if they believe they could be targeted. The Kansas City Star reported Brownlee said she meant no harm when she discussed Hoedl\u2019s frequent appearances before the council with an acquaintance from Black & Veatch at a social event. Hoedl and others planned to call for Brownlee\u2019s resignation at the council\u2019s meeting Tuesday. Frankfort: A report by Kentucky Auditor Mike Harmon showed the pension system for teachers is on more solid ground. Harmon said the financial statement audit of the Kentucky Teachers\u2019 Retirement Systems showed that its fiduciary net position increased by some $600 million. The review showed the amount rose to $21.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended in June. The amount was $21.3 billion the prior fiscal year. Harmon said the audit allows taxpayers, educators and policymakers to be aware of how the system has performed. In recent years, Gov. Matt Bevin and the GOP-led legislature committed to full pension funding. TRS management said in the new audit that assuming the state\u2019s contributions meet the actuarily recommended amount, TRS should have sufficient assets to provide all benefits due to its members. Livingston: A liquor prohibition is over for two towns in a Louisiana parish after an ordinance was overwhelmingly approved, allowing the sales of more than just beer and wine coolers. The Advocate reported Albany and Livingston in Livingston Parish approved liquor sales Saturday, ending a decades-old prohibition. Supporters of the ordinance said the restrictive rules deterred businesses from the area, especially restaurants relying on alcohol sales. Opponents were concerned that the loosened liquor laws could potentially increase the number of impaired drivers. But supporters said people would drive outside of the city to buy liquor anyway. Livingston Alderman Wade Wilson championed the ordinance and said he was confident the ordinance would pass. Both towns have to approve local rules for businesses selling alcohol. Those ordinances are expected to pass next year. Bath: Central Maine Power has begun its political campaign to save its proposed 145-mile transmission line project in Maine. The Bangor Daily News reported the opposition to the line has more to do with the company proposing it than the line itself. The company is under investigation by Maine energy regulators for reports of high bills and poor customer service. The utility company launched a political committee called Clean Energy Matters and aired its first TV ad, which urged viewers to \u201cget the facts\u201d about the job creation and carbon reduction the project offers. Opponents of the line said they have collected nearly half of the 63,000 signatures required to get a referendum on the 2020 ballot to stop the line. The proposed line is awaiting state and federal permits. Ellicott City: Howard County official said it has acquired nine of 10 buildings damaged by flooding in historic Ellicott City and at least a portion of them will be preserved. County Executive Calvin Ball gave an update Monday on recovery and planning. He said only four of the 10 buildings on lower Main Street will be demolished, rather than all 10. Ball said sound speakers for a temporary emergency alert system for flash flooding have been added, making it four times as loud. Last year, floodwaters gutted shops and swept a visitor to his death. It happened less than two years after another flood ravaged the town, killing two people. Ball said 25 businesses have either opened or reopened since he took office in December. Boston: Highway exit numbers in Massachusetts are changing over the next few years in cooperation with a federal mandate for exits to signify distance from the beginning of the route. Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced the switch is projected to begin next summer and be completed by the start of 2022 and will affect most interstates and state highways. The department said the system is designed to make navigation simpler by giving drivers an indication of how far they have traveled. The state plans to launch a website to inform the public of new mileage-based exits and plans to install \u201cOld Exit\u201d signs at renamed exits. Because of the tight spacing of their exits, Route 213, Interstate 291, Interstate 391 and the Lowell Connector will not be renumbered. Ann Arbor: The city council approved a plan to kill up to 150 deer that are living in parks and natural areas and on some private land. Nearly 400 have been killed since hunters were hired in 2016. The Ann Arbor News reported the next hunt will start in January after a 9-2 vote Monday. A critic, council member Jeff Hayner, questioned the practice and said it\u2019s a waste of $150,000. The Humane Society of Huron Valley said the hunt \u201cfurther traumatizes a generation of children already facing too much violence.\u201d But council member Jack Eaton said deer \u201cwill overwhelm every natural feature\u201d in Ann Arbor without proper management. St. Paul: Wildlife officials said three ruffed grouse in Itasca County have tested positive for a mosquito-borne virus. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said Monday it is the first time the virus called eastern equine encephalitis has been confirmed to cause illness in a Minnesota wild animal. The hunters who harvested the grouse brought them to DNR staff in late October after noticing abnormal behavior in the birds. Tests confirmed two of the grouse and possibly a third were infected with the EEE virus. All the birds tested negative for West Nile virus. The EEE virus typically is found in the eastern U.S. and along the Gulf Coast but has been found in Michigan and Wisconsin. The DNR will continue to monitor Minnesota\u2019s grouse population for signs of the disease. Jackson: A new federal lawsuit challenges a Jim Crow-era state law that requires naturalized U.S. citizens to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. The lawsuit was filed Monday by the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance. A Mississippi law enacted in 1924 requires naturalized citizens to show a certificate of naturalization or another similar document that proves citizenship when they register to vote. Mississippi residents born in the U.S. must only check a box on a voter-registration form to say they are citizens. The lawsuit said the system is unconstitutional because it treats one group of citizens differently from others. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice are among the groups representing the plaintiffs. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee said in a news release that Mississippi is the only state that requires naturalized citizens to prove citizenship before registering to vote. The lawsuit is filed against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, who is the state\u2019s chief elections officer. Hosemann declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday, spokeswoman Anna Moak said. Cassville: Authorities said deer hunters in Missouri found the skeletal remains of an Oklahoma man who had been missing for nearly a year. The Barry County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the remains of Ritchie Vaughn Ellis, of Wyandotte, Oklahoma, were discovered Sunday southwest of Roaring River State Park in the Mark Twain National Forest in southwest Missouri. Ellis was 27 when he was last seen alive on Jan. 21. He was reported missing five days later after his car was found on a highway near the state park. Authorities conducted several searches of the area without finding anything. The sheriff\u2019s office said there are no signs of foul play. Billings: Officials are marshaling their resources and enlisting the public\u2019s help to keep encroaching feral hogs from Canada at bay with a program called \u201cSqueal on Pigs.\u201d The campaign to prevent wild hogs from going hog wild in Montana was outlined at a conference hosted Friday by the Montana Invasive Species Council. It encourages people to report feral hog sightings to the state Department of Livestock, reporting that officials said is crucial to preventing an invasion. The \u201cSqueal on Pigs\u201d campaign mirrors a previous effort in the Pacific Northwest, according to the Billings Gazette. The hogs can spread disease and cause widespread property and crop damage. The most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate put swine damages at $1.5 billion annually. It\u2019s probably closer $2.5 billion now, said Dale Nolte, who leads a USDA feral swine damage program. There has been a population boom of feral hogs in Canada, and photographs taken last year showed the swine within 5 miles of the U.S. border. University of Saskatchewan researcher Ryan Brooks said the hogs can be difficult to spot from the air because they bury themselves in mud and also burrow into the snow to make \u201cpigloos.\u201d Montana law prohibits the hunting of feral swine and requires people to report a sighting of the animals within 24 hours. Officials are hoping the \u201cSqueal on Pigs\u201d campaign will create enthusiasm among residents for reporting. The pigs consume 3% to 5% of their body weight each day, from high-dollar crops like watermelons or lettuce, to fawns and songbirds. Offutt Air Force Base: The new, $1.3 billion headquarters for the command unit that controls the nation\u2019s nuclear-armed forces has been dedicated at an Air Force Base south of Omaha. Officers and enlisted men joined civilian dignitaries for ceremonies Monday at Offutt Air Force Base. The facility is named the Gen. Curtis E. LeMay Building. LeMay headed what was then known as the Air Force\u2019s Strategic Air Command until 1957 when he left to take a Pentagon post. Strategic Air Command eventually became a multiservice unit under a new name: the U.S. Strategic Command, or StratCom. Work on the 916,000-square-foot command and control center began in October 2012. Contractors worked through several setbacks, including floods and persistent mold. About 2,000 of StratCom\u2019s 3,200 employees have moved in. Carson City:The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said Nevada has reached the point of \u201ccritical mass\u201d or the breaking point when it comes to the problem of water scarcity. When asked on Nevada Newsmakers if the development of a proposed relief airport in Ivanpah Valley would push Southern Nevada to the point of critical mass of its water supply, Director Brad Crowell said, \u201cTo be blunt, I think we are already at that point, quite honestly.\u201d Crowell questioned if a proposed pipeline to bring water from rural Eastern Nevada to the Las Vegas Valley is the best solution for Southern Nevada\u2019s water scarcity. Crowell, son of Carson City Mayor Robert Crowell, said other solutions should be considered, especially with the expense of building a 300-mile pipeline from White Pine County to Las Vegas. Nevada\u2019s top water regulator, State Engineer Jason King, in August stopped the Southern Nevada Water Authority\u2019s application to pump groundwater from White Pine County to Las Vegas. Yet, that decision did not settle the issue. Multiple court challenges have yet to be determined, Crowell said. Las Vegas water officials have considered plans to pipe groundwater into Las Vegas since 1989, according to reports. The current plan, however, has drawn opposition from Utah and Nevada counties, ranchers, Native-American tribes, recreation enthusiasts and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The legal fight will probably continue for 12 to 24 months and will have a strong impact on Nevada water law, Crowell said. Crowell noted the Las Vegas Valley gets 90% of its water from the Colorado River, with the rest coming from existing ground-water. That plan, however, might not be sustainable. Concord: Merrimack Valley High School has brought back images of its former Native American mascot, as well as some controversy. The high school got rid of the Native American man in a headdress 15 years ago in response to concerns that the image was offensive. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the mascot has returned in the past two years on banners, walls and the gym floor as the school marked its 50th anniversary. Banners designed for a Hall of Fame induction ceremony include the image of a Native American man in headdress along with the current lion mascot. Administrators and some board members said the mascot was included to honor alumni who identify with the original mascot and motto of \u201cIndian Pride.\u201d Carissa Corrow, an alumna, parent and former teacher at the school, said the image is \u201cat best ignorant, and at worst racist and immoral.\u201d She\u2019s organizing a petition to remove the image and create a policy ensuring the mascot will not be used in the future. The chair of the New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs, Kathleen Blake, signed the petition. She wrote that the district\u2019s decision was \u201coffensive and ill-advised.\u201d The school board is expected to discuss the petition and the role of the former mascot at its meeting in December. East Orange: Police killed a fox that they said attacked five people in a northern New Jersey community and also tried to attack an officer. Glen Ridge police said the first attack was reported around 9:15 a.m. Friday. As officers from that department and the Bloomfield Animal Control agency searched for the fox, authorities learned that two other people had also been bitten. Those three people were treated at hospitals for bite wounds. Officers found the fox about two hours later near the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks. Authorities said the fox was euthanized after it attempted to attack one of the officers. The two other people attacked by the fox apparently were not bitten by it. State wildlife officials will test the animal to see if it had rabies. Milan: A dozen Cuban asylum-seekers detained in New Mexico said they have repeatedly been placed in solitary confinement for going on hunger strikes. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported two asylum-seekers in federal immigration custody said they and 10 others were put in solitary confinement twice as punishment for protesting their lengthy stay in prison. The men are being held at the privately run Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan. Juan Carlos Pe\u00f1a Pavon told the newspaper he spent nine days in solitary confinement. Pavon, 51, is part of a group of detained asylum-seekers that last month staged sit-ins at Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico. A spokeswoman at Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s El Paso, Texas, field office did not respond to an email. Ithaca: An animal shelter in central New York is teeming with rats, mice, gerbils and guinea pigs after humane officers found more than 300 of the small mammals abandoned along roads. The SPCA of Tompkins County said the rodents were found Sunday huddled on the ground beside two roads in the towns of Danby and Dryden, near Ithaca. Many had died of exposure or from ailments related to overcrowded cages and lack of water. Joe Hoffer, an SPCA investigator, said the animals were probably being bred as \u201cfeeder\u201d animals for reptiles, to be sold to pet stores. He said the person who dumped them will face several hundred charges if caught. About 200 surviving animals are being cared for by the SPCA, which is reaching out to rescue groups for help. Raleigh: A movement is growing to prevent the act of \u201copossum dropping.\u201d The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year\u2019s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group said it\u2019s continuing its legislative efforts. Williston: The Williams County Commission will soon decide whether to allow a landfill near Williston to accept radioactive oilfield waste. Secure Energy Services needs approval from the county and the state in order to accept the waste at its 13-Mile Landfill. The waste is generated when materials like soil, water and rocks, with low levels of radiation that occur naturally, are brought above ground during oil production and concentrated in well pipes. The Bismarck Tribune reported the company\u2019s request has prompted questions and safety concerns from some county residents. Secure Energy said the landfill would operate safety within \u201cstringent\u201d regulations. If the commission grants permission at its meeting Tuesday, the landfill would also need a radioactive materials license and a solid waste permit from the state. Cincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has lost a family member. Kimba, a 12-year-old giraffe, died of complications following a recent surgical procedure, according to officials. The father of six other giraffes underwent a procedure to fix his hooves last week. The Zoo Volunteer Observer team has been monitoring the giraffe barn for several weeks. Around 1 a.m. Sunday, the team saw Kimba fall to the ground. Zoo officials are devastated by the loss, said Christina Gorsuch, the zoo\u2019s curator of mammals. Gorsuch said they will know more once the veterinarians complete a necropsy. Kimba came to the zoo in 2008 from the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, on a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 Species Survival Plan. One of his calves, 3-year-old Cora, lives there now. Oklahoma City: Authorities said a teenager broke his legs after leaping from a Will Rogers World Airport terminal roof while being chased by officers. An Oklahoma City police statement said the 16-year-old male was exiting a Houston-to-Oklahoma City flight when police approached with a felony burglary warrant. Police said he slipped out a side door on the jet bridge, ran across the terminal apron and climbed to the terminal roof in a bid to elude capture. As officers continued their pursuit across the roof, police said the teen jumped to the apron below, breaking his legs. He was taken to a hospital for treatment. Salem: Climate activists said they will call on Gov. Kate Brown to use her executive authority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide if the Legislature does not pass significant climate policy next year. It\u2019s the second volley in a campaign to pressure opponents to get on board with the legislation, which failed during the last week of the 2019 session. The groups also have proposed three clean-energy measures, which would go even further than last year\u2019s proposal, for the November 2020 ballot. They\u2019re awaiting ballot titles from the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s office before collecting signatures. The 2019 legislation would have placed an economy-wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon. It passed the House of Representatives and was expected to pass the Senate. But Republican senators staged a walkout, forcing Democrats to kill the bill in order to finish the session. Brown will work with Legislative leadership to pass a clean energy bill before considering executive action, her spokeswoman, Kate Kondayen, said Monday. Honesdale: A bagel shop manager in New York drove to Pennsylvania to return a key fob that a customer had left in his shop on Long Island. Diana Chong drove off from Bagels 101 on Saturday with her family for a pre-Thanksgiving celebration in Honesdale. After parking in Pennsylvania, she realized she had left the fob needed to restart her car at the store 185 miles away. Manager Vinny Proscia offered to ship the fob, but they couldn\u2019t find a service. So Proscia decided to deliver it. Chong told Newsday she insisted he accept $200 for gas and tolls and a gift card. Proscia said he got stopped for speeding on the return trip, but the officer let him go after he showed a thank-you card from Chong. Woonsocket: The city\u2019s first Roman Catholic church has been granted permission to close by the Diocese of Providence. The Diocese said Bishop Thomas Tobin granted the request by St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church and sent his prayerful support to members of the parish. Officials said attendance dropped from 230 people in 2012 to 90 for weekend Masses. The diocese estimated that the building also needs more than $570,000 in repairs for a new roof, a renovated heating system and new stained-glass windows. The last Masses are scheduled for Jan. 11 and 12. St. Helena Island: A horse that died this month tested positive for a mosquito-borne virus that can be deadly to humans. The Island Packet reported the 5-year-old gelding\u2019s body was found near a herd of wild ponies on Nov. 8 on St. Helena Island. The state veterinarian office said this was Beaufort County\u2019s first case of eastern equine encephalitis. Symptoms include brain swelling and seizures. There is no human vaccine for the disease, which is deadly in about a third of human cases. Beaufort County Mosquito Control sprayed the area and captured mosquitoes that didn\u2019t carry the virus. State and federal agencies said there have been fewer than 160 human cases over the past 35 years. Rapid City: A coalition suggested to the State-Tribal Relations Committee that it pass legislation allowing Native Americans to create charter schools rooted in Oceti Sakowin language, culture and knowledge. The South Dakota Education Equity Coalition recently presented the idea to the committee at the state Capitol in Pierre with hopes of getting legislative backing to create charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated by a group such as a nonprofit or university. Sarah Pierce, one of the group leaders, said the schools would be a space where students can be \u201cunapologetically Indian.\u201d South Dakota, along with North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and Vermont, does not have legislation for such schools. The coalition was formed in August, aimed at making charter schools that strike a balance between offering indigenous culture and academic rigor. But it\u2019s not just culture that Native Americans are looking to create space for in schools. They want better education. Native American students, who comprise about 11% of the public school student population in South Dakota, perform worse on exams than white students, according to the 2018-19 school report cards. The data shows that although 61% of white students in South Dakota met or exceeded the English language arts test score goal, only 23% of Native American students did. Native American students also did worse in science; 14% of them passed, compared to 53% of white students. Nashville: The state education commissioner said the law enforcement presence in schools is increasing, but 450 schools still lack a resource officer. Commissioner Penny Schwinn told lawmakers Monday that grants totaling $7.2 million this year have added 206 new school resource officers statewide, totaling 1,378 officers. Schwinn said school safety funding includes $20 million recurring and $20 million over two years. In February 2018, the Tennessee Sheriffs\u2019 Association said there were 910 school resource officers statewide, representing 40% coverage of schools. Schwinn told reporters requiring officers at schools would be a big-budget request, but added that nothing is more important than children\u2019s safety and health. Schwinn said more people would need to be recruited and trained as officers, saying there aren\u2019t enough ready officers for each school. Houston: Education advocates are challenging a plan to replace their elected school board with a state-appointed one. Lawmakers decided in 2015 to require state education officials to either close a school that failed for over four years or select a board to run the district. Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath chose the latter and announced his plans last week for the Houston Independent School District. The decision follows the release of a report detailing Wheatley High School\u2019s poor performance and the board\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. Houston ISD is suing the state, arguing that the takeover would disenfranchise black and Hispanic voters. Houston Federation of Teachers President Zeph Capo said the union is considering whether to join the lawsuit, which claims Texas Education Agency officials have no authority to replace the board. Logan: The remains of Sgt. Max Wendell Lower, who was reported missing in action during World War II, will soon be returned to his family. Helen Lower Simmons of Logan said she expects to receive the remains of her older brother this week, The Deseret News reported. Lower was 23 when he was killed during an attack by U.S. Army Air Force bombers on oil refineries in Romania in August 1943, Simmons said. DNA testing identified Lower\u2019s remains last month and he is expected to be honored at a memorial ceremony in the same Lewiston cemetery where his parents are buried. After the raid, residents buried Lower\u2019s body and others. The U.S. military later moved the bodies to Belgium, where they remained in storage until 2017, when a genealogist began searching for the families of the soldiers. Simmons and her younger brother submitted DNA samples and last month the testing provided a positive match. The remains of U.S. Marine Robert James Hatch also will be returned to Utah for a planned burial in Bountiful. Hatch died in the Battle of Tarawa in the Pacific Theater. Dover: About 200 people had to be evacuated from a malfunctioning chair lift at Mount Snow in southern Vermont during its opening weekend. Mynbc5 reported that the hourlong malfunction happened on Saturday. Ski patrol helped riders off the Challenger lift. No injuries were reported. Mount Snow said it\u2019s sorry for any inconvenience guests experienced. Richmond: Officials said the state is seeing an alarming uptick in the number of motorcycle deaths where the rider wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet. The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles said in a press release Tuesday that seven motorcyclists who weren\u2019t wearing helmets died this year. The department said the number is the highest in a decade. The state said that helmets are about 29% effective in preventing motorcyclist deaths and about 67% effective in preventing brain injuries. The state said a rider without a helmet is 40% more likely to suffer a fatal head injury. The state also said that motorcycle-related deaths are slightly higher this year. As of Nov. 15, 87 people have died compared to 83 last year. Mount Vernon: Officials from a spill response team have announced that cleanup of refinery oil was completed Sunday. The Skagit-Valley Herald reported Monday that the Shell Puget Sound Refinery spill was reported Friday during the transfer of crude oil from Alaska\u2019s Northern Slope from a barge to the refinery. The response team said Saturday that about 20 gallons of oil spilled because of problems with a pressure release valve. Officials said the barge was carrying 5million gallons of oil. Officials say about 5 gallons made it into Fidalgo Bay but were removed from the water. Officials said the response team included the refinery, Coast Guard, state Department of Ecology, Skagit County, Lummi Nation and the barge company Crowley Maritime. Charleston: The state Department of Education said high school graduation rates have reached the highest level recorded for the state. The department said the rates represent the percent of ninth-grade students who graduate with a regular diploma in four or five years. Data from the 2018-2019 school year showed an increase in the four-year rate to 91.4%, up from 90.2%, and an increase in the five-year rate to 90.7%, up from 90%. There has also been an increase of approximately 10% over five years in the graduation rate among students with disabilities, to 78.8%. The West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission said 52.6% of students enrolled in higher education institutions last fall, and 41% who continued education for advanced credentials, joined the workforce or enrolled in the military after graduation. Madison: The state\u2019s nine-day gun deer hunting season starts Saturday. The season begins just before dawn and will run until just after sunset on Dec. 1. Hunters will be allowed to kill does in every county for the first time in a decade, a sign that the herd is robust across the state. The state Department of Natural Resources is encouraging hunters to dispose of carcasses in landfills or in trash bins the agency has placed across the state to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease. Hunters will be allowed to move deer killed in CWD-affected areas only to another county within the CWD-affected area, an adjacent county, a meat processor or a taxidermist. The department also is asking hunters to turn in deer heads for CWD testing Rock Springs: The Wyoming Game and Fish Department said someone poached a mule deer buck in Sweetwater County. Rock Springs game warden Andy Roosa said the deer was illegally killed about 2 miles east of Superior and was found off a county road. Roosa said the head and antlers were removed and all edible portions of the deer were left to waste. It\u2019s believed that the deer might have been shot late last week, around Thursday or Friday. The incident remains under investigation.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Monday endorsed two liberal candidates who have launched primary challenges against incumbent House Democrats. The endorsements of immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros in southern Texas and marketing consultant Marie Newman in the Chicagoland district offer\u00a0Warren, a Massachusetts senator, an opportunity to underscore her alliance with the more liberal wing of the Democratic party as she battles with Sen. Bernie Sanders for the progressive mantle in 2020 Democratic presidential contest. Cisneros and Newman have the backing of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., last year. \u00a0They are among eight Democratic candidates who have launched 2020 primary challenges against sitting House Democrats and that are backed by Justice Democrats. Newman had previously received endorsements from 2020 Democratic presidential contenders Sanders, New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Gillibrand and Inslee both dropped out of the presidential race in recent weeks, while Sanders is neck-and-neck with Warren in many early voting state and national polls, trailing Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cAt a time when women\u2019s reproductive rights are under attack daily from Republican lawmakers across America, Illinoisans deserve a leader with an unwavering commitment to fighting for women\u2019s access to reproductive health care,\u201d Warren said.\u00a0\"Marie Newman is that leader. She understands that this isn\u2019t a moment to back down \u2013 it\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d Warren on Monday also endorsed two candidates, Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, running for Philadelphia\u2019s city council. The two are aligned with the liberal group Working Families Party. Cisneros is challenging Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was elected in 2004, while Newman is taking on Rep. Dan Lipinski, who has served since 2004 and followed his father Rep. William Lipinski into Illinois' 3rd District seat. Cuellar and Lipinski are two of the most conservative Democrats serving in the House. Lipinski, who fended off a Newman in a\u00a0close primary race in 2018, opposes abortion rights and was the only Democrat in the Illinois congressional delegation to\u00a0vote against President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, because it required organizations to provide employees with contraception even if that clashed with a religious group's beliefs. \"Warren has moved from independent fact-based thinking to ideological orthodoxy,\" Lipinski said in response to the endorsement. \"My opponent has always been an ideologue. She has never focused on how she might serve the people of IL3, but has only parroted the talking points of radicals who would take away everyone\u2019s private health care, eliminate Medicare, and raise the taxes of hard working middle-class families by tens of thousands of dollars.\" Cuellar is one of only three Democrats in Congress with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. The Texas lawmaker also holds a 15% pro-choice rating from the abortion rights advocacy group NARAL. \u201cThe people of Texas\u2019 28th district are ready for systematic change and deserve a Democrat that will be on the side of working people; not the side of big money and obstructionist Republicans,\u201d Warren said in a statement about\u00a0Cisneros, who once served as an intern for Cuellar. \u201cI believe Jessica Cisneros is that fighter. As an immigration lawyer and daughter of small business owners growing up on the border, Jessica knows our diversity is our strength and that when progressives are unapologetic about our values and who we\u2019re in this battle for, we win. It\u2019s time Texans had a champion in Congress who does just that.\u201d Cuellar punched back at Warren for backing his opponent. \u201cWe told you the outside special interests were coming to take away local jobs,\u201d Cuellar posted on Twitter. \u201cElizabeth Warren and our opponent share an agenda that would kill over 108,000 jobs in our region. I'm fighting back. Will you join me?\u201d Justice Democrats welcomed Warren\u2019s support for Cisneros and Newman. The group has criticized the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which earlier this year warned campaign vendors that the party\u00a0wouldn't award contracts to political firms working for primary challengers. \u201cWe are so proud that Jessica Cisneros and Marie Newman are being endorsed by Senator Warren, a strong fighter for working families,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cAt a time when the DCCC is rallying around pro-NRA and anti-choice Democrats like Cuellar and Lipinski, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have candidates for president who remember what the Democratic Party should stand for.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Elizabeth Warren plans to hike Social Security benefit $200 per month by taxing rich",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month for roughly 64 million recipients by raising taxes on the top 2% of earners in the country. Warren, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, announced her plan ahead of Thursday evening\u2019s third presidential debate. She says her proposal would pull some 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and extend solvency of the perennially underfunded Social Security trust fund by 19 years. The proposal, Warren said, would lead to a nearly 25% increase in benefits for the bottom half of earners and a less than 5% increase for people in the top 10% of income distribution in the U.S. \u201cWe need to get our priorities straight,\u201d said Warren, touting her plan in a Medium post as the biggest boost to Social Security in nearly 50 years. \u201cWe should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program.\u201d Warren has laid out a series of proposals including ones to end college debt, create\u00a0universal child care and fight the opioid epidemic that she says she\u2019d fund by taxing the mega wealthy through a $2.75 trillion tax on American households making more than $50 million annually. But this plan to bolster Social Security, which will pay out more than\u00a0$1 trillion in 2019,\u00a0would also impact Americans who are wealthy, but are far from mega-millionaires. She unveiled the plan hours before she hits the stage in Houston for the third round of Democratic presidential debates. The proposal comes at a moment where she and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are neck-and-neck in many polls, but behind former Vice President Joe Biden, as they battle for support from the progressive wing of the Democratic party. Like the other plans Warren\u2019s floated, the proposal would likely face long odds in making its way through the Republican-controlled Senate. Social Security, which provides 90% of income for 21% of married recipients and 45% unmarried recipients, is funded by mandatory contributions to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or \u201cFICA,\u201d collected from workers\u2019 paychecks. The FICA contribution is 12.4% of wages, with employers and employees splitting those contributions equally at 6.2% each. (Self-employed workers contribute the full 12.4%.) If you\u2019re a wage employee, you contribute 6.2% of your very first dollar of wages to Social Security, and 6.2% of every dollar after that -- up to an annual cap, which is set at $132,900 in 2019. Warren says if she wins the White House she\u2019ll push to impose a 14.8% Social Security contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000 -- affecting less than the top 2% of earners -- split equally between employees and employers. She would also require a 14.8% contribution on individuals making at least $250,000, or $400,000 for married couples, in net investment income annually. \u201cWhile most American workers contribute to Social Security with every dollar they earn, CEOs and other very high earners contribute to Social Security on only a fraction of their pay,\u201d Warren writes of her plan. She has plans:Elizabeth Warren: Send executives to jail for their role in the opioid epidemic Texas in play?\u00a0Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, concurred with Warren that the extra revenue from wealthier taxpayers should keep Social Security solvent until 2054 and would also reduce the deficit. Social Security is currently projected to be solvent until\u00a02035. \u201cThe net macroeconomic impacts of the reform are small but positive in the long run; the economic benefit of smaller federal government deficits and debt load is largely offset as high-income people reduce their own work hours,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe plan results in a much more progressive Social Security system, as high-income people shoulder the financial burden of the plan, while low- and middle income people benefit substantially. \u201c",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When the grand vacation homes of Newport Beach were empty on a beautiful Memorial Day weekend, Molly Munger decided it was time for the U.S. to consider taxing wealth. As her family\u2019s boat moved through the harbor a few years ago, Munger, whose father is a billionaire investor, saw that many of her neighbors\u2019 houses were sitting dark and vacant. She knew why: The owners now controlled enough money to holiday at one of their several other luxury homes. It didn\u2019t sit right, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much to watch that happen at the top and see what is happening at the bottom,\u201d said Munger, 71, a California civil rights lawyer whose father, Charlie, built his fortune as vice chairman of Warren Buffett\u2019s firm Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a waste when beautiful homes on the beach are empty for most of the summer?\u201d Munger is now among a handful of billionaires and multimillionaires making a renewed push for the government to raise their taxes and siphon away some of their holdings. As\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0debate a new tax on wealth rather than on incomes, this group of uber-rich people is urging them on. \u201cI believe in free markets. I\u2019m the daughter of a capitalist. But not Darwin-like free, unregulated and red in tooth and claw,\u201d Munger said. Faux or fun:Are those fake Lamborghinis and Bugattis sold online just about fun? Or is it fraud? The chief argument from these tycoons, financiers and scions is that the government could spend their money more effectively than they could on their own by improving schools, upgrading infrastructure and protecting the environment. It challenges a long-standing belief among many politicians and economists that lower taxes on corporations and investment incomes are the most efficient way to deliver growth and spread wealth down the income ladder. The idea also is a direct challenge to the reputed billionaire in the White House, Donald Trump, who once backed a wealth tax but in 2017 enacted\u00a0a dramatic tax cut\u00a0that favored the rich. Twenty people, including one who remained anonymous, signed on to a letter this summer essentially asking to be taxed more. The group included financier George Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and heiress Abigail Disney, and others often involved in liberal causes. Bill Gates, the world\u2019s second-richest person, didn\u2019t sign it but has since said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be against a wealth tax\u201d on a net worth that roughly exceeds $100 billion. While Democrats have long pushed for higher taxes on the top income tiers, the current debate goes further \u2013 whether to impose annual taxes on what people own, not just on what they earn. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has endorsed a wealth tax on holdings above $50 million that could potentially raise as much as $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 tax would start at $32 million. At\u00a0last week\u2019s presidential debate,\u00a0South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, expressed openness to levying a wealth tax, while Tom Steyer argued for higher taxes on his own $1.6 billion fortune. There were some detractors: Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang argues wealth taxes in other nations have failed to raise enough revenue. It's the consumer, stupid?\u00a0What the consumer sentiment index tells us about the 2020 elections Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized the Warren and Sanders plans as \u201cdemonizing wealth\u201d and argued instead for focusing on income taxes and raising the rates charged on earnings from investments. Biden\u2019s view is backed by many in the economic establishment, even those who say they support using the tax code to counter income inequality. Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president, argues that a wealth tax is essentially unworkable. The richest Americans would find ways to avoid it, making it difficult to implement and unlikely to break the hold on politics by powerful companies and rich donors, he said Friday at a panel on wealth taxes at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Summers estimates that changes to the income tax could raise more than $2 trillion over 10 years from the top earners, but he doubts that a wealth tax would curb the influence of the richest Americans. Kevin Plank:Under Armour CEO steps down as turnaround effort continues But the economists who developed the idea dispute the notion that tax avoidance is an unbreakable law of nature. Wealthier Americans paid taxes in the past when tax avoidance was viewed as freeloading, said Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley whose work has drawn attention to the wealth tax as a fix for worsening inequality. \u201cThe tax system reflects the values of society,\u201d he said. The top 1% of Americans hold nearly 40% of the country\u2019s wealth, while the bottom 50% of Americans effectively control none of it, according to the World Inequality Database, an index Saez helped develop. Many in the wealthiest sliver of that top 1% pay lower rates than most Americans because of how their income gets taxed, according to his calculations. Ian Simmons is among the well-off declaring they\u2019re ready to pay more. Simmons runs an investment fund called the Blue Haven Initiative with his wife, Liesel Pritzker Simmons. The 43-year-old joined the effort to recruit other moneyed families to support a wealth tax in the June letter. The idea of taxing a relatively steady base of trillions of dollars felt consistent to Simmons with what he first learned at the Harvard University introductory economics class taught by Martin Feldstein, who was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s economic adviser. \u201cThis is really a conservative position about increasing the stability of the economy in the long term and having an efficient source of taxation,\u201d he said. Retirement savings:Doing this simple thing once a year can help you save more Simmons\u2019 family money came in part from mail order retailer Montgomery Ward, which opened in 1872, an innovation aided by the U.S. Postal Service. The Hyatt hotel chain that helped form his wife\u2019s family fortune was aided by the government\u2019s construction of the interstate highway system. That\u2019s part of the reason he supports a wealth tax - because his family\u2019s fortune stems in part from government programs, echoing Warren\u2019s key argument for her tax plan. When Simmons called the retired real estate developer Robert Bowditch this year to endorse the idea, the 80-year-old did the math on what it would mean for his own lifestyle. He figured it would cut into some of his charitable giving, but the returns would be much greater because the public would be able to decide in a democratic fashion on how the money would be spent. \u201cCharitable giving by itself simply cannot provide enough money to support public goods and services, such as public education, roads and bridges, clean air,\u201d Bowditch said. \u201cIt has to be done by taxes.\u201d Rich people have had limited success as advocates for tax hikes. In 2011, billionaire Buffett\u2019s declaration that he paid a lower tax rate than his employees spawned President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to raise rates on people making more than $1 million. The so-called \u201cBuffett rule\u201d fizzled in Congress. In 1999, when Trump was mulling a presidential bid for the Reform Party, he proposed a one-time tax of 14.25% on fortunes above $10 million, saying at the time that it could eliminate the national debt. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for the American people,\u201d Trump said then. Asked whether\u00a0the president still supports the idea, the White House did not respond.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Throne DES MOINES \u2014 The Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration offers\u00a0the biggest launching pad for Democratic presidential candidates hoping to electrify their campaigns in the final sprint to the Iowa caucuses. With just three months to go before Feb. 3, the time for a breakout moment is dwindling, and campaigns will be looking for a boost\u00a0at the state party\u2019s signature fundraiser Friday night. They\u2019ll be hosting block parties, staging\u00a0thousand-person marches and flying in celebrity endorsers to try to signal to\u00a0caucusgoers, donors and pundits that they've got momentum and enthusiasm with them. And those big shows will come even before they take the stage at Wells Fargo Arena in downtown Des Moines, where the Democrats will\u00a0try to wow a 13,000-person crowd and create the kind of moment that helped propel Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy. Obama\u2019s speech at the 2007\u00a0event \u2014 then called the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner \u2014 was\u00a0a clear turning point in his campaign, paving the way to a caucus night win and his eventual nomination and inauguration. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect\u00a0as 14 presidential campaigns descend at once on downtown Des Moines. Since at least 1975, the Iowa Democratic Party has held a fall fundraising dinner. An informal straw poll\u00a0that year\u00a0showed Georgia\u00a0Gov. Jimmy Carter in the lead among Iowa Democrats, launching him into the national news and driving his campaign toward the nomination. Since then, the dinner has been a destination for Democratic presidential candidates seeking that same bump. The\u00a0event\u00a0grew in importance and pageantry\u00a0with each election cycle. Candidates\u00a0brought endorsers, celebrities and politicians to show their electoral might. Hillary Clinton was a\u00a0master of the Jefferson-Jackson pageantry. She hosted the event in\u00a02003 as the former First Lady\u00a0and stole headlines from the presidential candidates. During her own campaign for president in 2007, Clinton brought Grammy Award-winning producer Quincy Jones to the event. Pop star Katy Perry performed a 20-minute concert for the\u00a0senator and her supporters outside the event in 2015. But\u00a0beyond\u00a0the\u00a0glittering fa\u00e7ade of fame, the speeches matter, too. Obama seized the opportunity in 2007 to display his popularity and hammer home his message. He brought in a drum corps to march through downtown, held a rally with an estimated 4,000 supporters, as well as\u00a0musician John Legend, and gave a speech that reverberated through the hall \u2014 and echoed for the rest of his campaign. \u201cI run for the presidency of the United States of America because that's the party America needs us to be right now\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership; a\u00a0party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should; a\u00a0party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change \u2014 change that America can believe in,\u201d Obama said. The Des Moines Register\u2019s political columnist called it a great speech and one of the best of Obama\u2019s campaign. David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s 2008\u00a0campaign manager, told the Register later that \u201cfrom that point on, we had inexorable momentum in Iowa.\" This year\u2019s dinner will be the largest in caucus\u00a0history. With 14 candidates scheduled to attend, the Liberty and Justice Celebration will be twice as large as the biggest Jefferson-Jackson dinners, which topped out at seven\u00a0candidates. To accommodate the large field, the Iowa Democratic Party plans to give each candidate\u00a010 minutes to speak. In 2007, Clinton and Obama both had at least 20 minutes. The crowd of Democratic activists will also be\u00a0larger\u00a0than ever before, said Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Jonah Hermann.\u00a0He estimates there will be \u201cupwards of 13,000\u201d people in attendance. The largest crowd to date came in 2007, when 9,000 attendees turned out. Another major change this year is the new name. The Jefferson-Jackson Dinner was named after two of the party\u2019s most prominent U.S. presidents,\u00a0Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. But in recent years, more and more\u00a0Democrats have steered away from honoring the two men\u00a0because both were slave owners and because of Jackson\u2019s policy of forcibly relocating\u00a0Native\u00a0Americans. Since 2012, nearly a dozen\u00a0state Democratic parties have renamed events previously celebrating the\u00a0two party\u00a0leaders. The Iowa Democratic Party's State\u00a0Central Committee passed a resolution in 2015 to change the name of the annual event.\u00a0This will be the first dinner to bear the new name, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, that the party settled on\u00a0in September. Before the main event begins, some candidates are planning to put on a show \u2014 literally. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, activist Tom Steyer, former housing secretary Julian Castro and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet\u00a0have\u00a0not released their specific pre-party plans to the Des Moines Register. After the Liberty and Justice Celebration, candidates will scatter across Iowa for a\u00a0variety of weekend forums and events. There\u00a0are three\u00a0additional multi-candidate events Saturday \u2014 one in Des\u00a0Moines with NAACP and media organizations;\u00a0and two in\u00a0Cedar Rapids:\u00a0an Abby Finkenauer Fish Fry and a forum with disability activists. In addition to those appearances, there\u00a0are over 40 events scheduled around the state between Saturday and\u00a0Tuesday.",

      "content": "Sponsored by Lamps Plus The growing student loan problem has emerged as an issue for the 2020 presidential election. Democratic contenders Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and others have\u00a0proposals to cancel or forgive much of this debt. Balances have mushroomed in recent years to $1.5 trillion, making student loans second only to mortgages among consumer lending categories. The typical borrower pays about $179 a month, or 5% of his or her income to meet student-loan obligations, according to the J.P. Morgan Institute. Though that seems manageable, loan burdens are disproportionately carried by younger, less affluent individuals. Google buys Fitbit:\u00a0Alphabet to buy smartwatch maker in $2.1 billion deal Are your bank deposits safe?\u00a0Potential problems could be brewing Unlike credit card borrowing\u00a0and many other types of debt, student loans typically can't be discharged in bankruptcy. About one in nine loans are 90 or more days delinquent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Student loans can be helpful. The nonprofit group Credit.org considers these loans to be \"good debt\" \u2013 a type of borrowing that, through increased education, adds value to your life in terms of boosting your net worth or income potential. With a college degree, \"you're probably in a more employable situation with higher lifetime earning potential,\" said Michael Rusinak, a certified financial planner and director of financial solutions at Fidelity Investments. But plenty of borrowers face problems or don't fully appreciate what they're up against. \"This is often a person's first experience with debt and having interest accrue (against them),\" Rusinak said. Here are some tips to keep things from getting out of control: Student loan debt repayment typically starts six months after a student graduates. The payment clock can be delayed if a person remains in school, but otherwise borrowers need to know that this grace period will end and that they should take their repayment responsibility seriously. Jessica Ferastoaru, a student loan counselor at Take Charge America, a nonprofit debt counseling service in Phoenix,\u00a0recommends borrowers use the six months to understand what they're dealing with. That can be a daunting task, especially for people who might be starting new jobs, possibly moving homes or grappling with other life changes. \"There's a theme of incredible confusion around student loans,\" she said. Borrowers often don't know how many loans they have, which payment-lowering options they might qualify for, who the servicing companies are or the consequences of falling behind on payments. \"We have seen people with 20 loans,\" Ferastoaru said. Each one could have its own features and wrinkles. It's important to make payments on time, yet some borrowers might not fully realize the implications, especially young adults who haven't dealt with creditors. Missing payments or going into default \"is absolutely the worst possible thing you can do,\" cautioned Kalman Chany, author of the 2020 edition of \"Paying for College.\" Falling behind on payments can damage your credit score\u00a0\u2013 a measure of your ability and willingness to make good on debts\u00a0\u2013 and this can crimp your ability to get credit cards, mortgages or other loans on good terms. Defaulting on a loan can result in wage garnishment or having your income tax refunds or even Social Security payments reduced or withheld by the government, Ferastoaru said. Default\u00a0can make it difficult to obtain additional loans for graduate school, should that be a goal. If in doubt about which federal loans you have and how much you owe, Ferastoaru suggested\u00a0checking the National Student Loan Data System. Credit reports available through annualcreditreport.com should list private loan details. If you can afford it, you might find it worthwhile to pay down your debts early. By adding, say, $100 a month to a fairly typical student loan of $29,000, you could get rid of the obligation three years early and save $3,000 in interest over that time, according to Ronald Denk of Denk Strategic Wealth Partners in Phoenix. If you\u00a0decide to prepay some debt and if you have multiple loans, decide which ones to tackle first. Denk suggested\u00a0applying additional payments to get rid of loans with the highest interest rates. Conversely, if you feel the need to see tangible progress sooner, consider paying off debts with smaller balances first\u00a0to get them out of the way. As attractive as paying down a student loan early might seem, it's important to consider other, and possibly better, uses for extra cash. These include building up an emergency fund, saving for a home or contributing money to an employer's 401(k) plan. \"If your employer offers matching funds, that's often the best investment return,\" Rusinak, said, though the decision gets more complicated, and personal, after you contribute enough to max out on available employer matching funds. As with mortgages and other debts, you might be able to obtain a new student loan featuring a lower interest rate. Just be aware that refinancing could mean extending the length of your indebtedness, possibly piling up higher overall interest costs and delaying the date when you'll be debt-free. Consolidation, or combining multiple loans into one, is another possibility. This can simplify your financial life and possibly lower your payments. In particular, consolidating federal loans will give you a loan featuring one payment and a blending of the interest rates on your prior loans, Rusinak said. Refinancing, by contrast, gives you \"an entirely fresh loan,\" he said. Be aware that consolidating or refinancing can affect, and possibly make you ineligible for, other benefits. For example, some of your\u00a0debt could be canceled if you become disabled or pursue various types of service careers. Chany cited\u00a0teaching, law enforcement or nursing work in low-income areas as examples of jobs that might qualify for forgiveness. \"There are dozens of programs to lower or postpone payments or even get them potentially forgiven,\" Ferastoaru said. Tweaking your loans could invalidate that. Also, there has been an increasing amount of talk among presidential candidates about forgiving student loan debts on a massive scale. This might be reason not to make any serious changes to your loan situation for at least a year or so. In the meantime,\u00a0treat your loans as obligations that must be repaid.

      "content": "Facebook's bid to launch an alternative digital currency, called Libra, has gotten much\u00a0tougher. Big partners announced by Facebook have just dropped out. That includes credit card giants Visa and MasterCard, e-commerce giant eBay, payments startup Stripe and Latin America payment app Mercado Pago. PayPal had previously switched course on Libra. \u201cIt\u2019s a big setback for them but it\u2019s not the end,\u201d Gartner analyst Avivah Litan told The Associated Press. Monday, the Geneva based Libra Association that Facebook formed, is scheduled to convene its first official meeting, and lost the key players before the gavel went down. \"It\u2019s not the end for Libra, but the project faces a hard path moving forward \u2013 and it\u2019s only getting harder,\" notes TheVerge. Bottom line:Would you trust Facebook with your money? What Libra cryptocurrency means for users More:Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook fact-checking policy with false ad saying Zuckerberg endorsed Trump Facebook's big idea was a digital currency that could\u00a0could open online purchasing to millions of people who didn't have access to bank accounts and could reduce the cost of sending money across borders. But Facebook is under attack by politicians who are itching to break it up. \u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0D-Mass.,\u00a0has made it a hallmark of her presidential campaign to do just that, and has gotten into a war of words with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded that if Warren was elected and looked to break up Facebook, that would \"suck\" and he would fight her in court. \"What would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren tweeted in response. Against that backdrop, Facebook wants to launch a new currency that people could use to buy things on the social network and elsewhere, a so-called\u00a0cryptocurrency. Litan told AP that Facebook can still easily launch Libra in countries that would welcome it, and challenged the notion that Facebook needed\u00a0partners like Visa and MasterCard\u00a0to run Libra. \u201cThe only reason they want the companies is because it looks good,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was never a democratic blockchain. It was always run by Facebook and a couple of financial companies that were going along for the ride.\u201d Still, when\u00a0Facebook announced Libra in June, the company said it looked to grow membership from the 27 announced companies to more than 100 in 2020, the planned year for the Libra launch. Instead, notes ArsTechnica, the association's membership has now fallen to 22 companies. Netherlands-based payment company PayU is still in the consortium. \u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d Facebook said, in a statement to Reuters. \u201cAlthough the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.\u201d Contributing: The Associated Press Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter Sponsored by AMERIND Risk",

More:Here's what to know for National Voter Registration Day There is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Between Sept. 17 to 21, 664 registered voters were contacted for the poll through telephone, with 401 of those contacted were voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary. Sen. Kamala Harris stands at 3% in the poll. Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are all at 2% in this poll. All other candidates are at 1% or less. By polling at 2%, this\u00a0is Gabbard's\u00a0fourth qualifying poll\u00a0to participate in October's upcoming debate. Gabbard now the 12th person to qualify for October's debate, which will likely bring debates back to two nights. It was only one night in September.\u00a0Candidates need\u00a0to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors by Oct. 1 to qualify for the October debate, according to the Democratic National Committee guidance. The next debates will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio by CNN and the New York Times. The debates will be held on Oct. 15 and on the 16 if necessary. With 12 candidates, the debates will likely be held on two nights.",

      "content": "DES MOINES \u2014 Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie\u00a0Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had\u00a0led each of the Register\u2019s three\u00a0previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide No other candidate reaches double digits. \u201cThis is the first major shakeup\u201d in what had\u00a0been a\u00a0fairly steady\u00a0race,\u00a0said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is\u00a0at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Eight others are polling at 1% or less. But the race is far from settled: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0their minds are\u00a0made up, while 63% say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. \u201cThe data in this poll seem to suggest the field is narrowing, but my sense is there\u2019s still opportunity aplenty,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThe leaders aren\u2019t all that strong. The universe is not locked in.\u201d The poll of 602 likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0was conducted Sept. 14-18, and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Other candidates have seen their Iowa Poll numbers briefly spike\u00a0\u2014\u00a0O\u2019Rourke hit double digits early after running in a competitive U.S. Senate race in Texas, then fell back.\u00a0Buttigieg surged after a well-received CNN town hall performance, then drops\u00a0in the new poll.\u00a0But no one in Iowa so far this cycle\u00a0has\u00a0seen Warren's steady and sustained momentum. The Register\u2019s first 2020 caucus poll, in December\u00a02018, pegged Warren's\u00a0support at 8%. In March, about two months after she first visited the state and formally announced she would run, that rose to 9%. In June, as Iowa Democrats began to marvel at her organizational strength, she rose to 15%\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though that poll\u2019s methodology differed somewhat from the others. Today, the universe of people who say they are considering Warren in some way\u00a0\u2014\u00a071% of likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is larger than it is for any other candidate. That includes 22% who say she is their first choice for president, 20% who say she is their second choice and another 29% who say they are actively considering her. Trailing her are: Biden (60%), Buttigieg (55%), Harris (55%), Sanders (50%), Booker (42%), O\u2019Rourke (38%) and Klobuchar (37%). It\u2019s also higher than where Warren was polling in June. Then, 61% of respondents were considering her in some way. \u201cThat appears to be a powerful leap forward and suggests that she can improve further, because she\u2019s got these people actively considering her and thinking of her as a second choice,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge number there. Those people can be converted.\u201d Warren is the best-liked candidate in the field:\u00a075% of likely Democratic caucusgoers say\u00a0they view her favorably.\u00a0Next-best\u00a0are Buttigieg, who is viewed favorably by 69%, and Biden, at 66%. But Selzer said Warren\u2019s numbers also reveal some vulnerability. Among those who say she is their first choice for president, only 12% say their minds are\u00a0made up, while 88% say they could be persuaded to support another candidate. More Biden\u00a0supporters are\u00a0firm\u00a0in their choice: 26% say their mind is mind up, with 70% saying they could be persuaded. Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who have held first and second place, respectively, since last December\u00a0\u2014 have hit new lows, though they still outshine 16 other candidates. Their numbers aren\u2019t bad, Selzer said, but the downward trend line is troubling. Overall, the former vice president has slipped in each of the four Iowa Polls the Register has conducted this caucus cycle\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in terms of both support and favorability. In December 2018, 32% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0said Biden was their first choice for president. That\u2019s fallen in each poll as Biden reintroduces himself to Iowans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and as his competitors have targeted him as the polling front-runner. Biden\u2019s favorability rating also has fallen\u00a0\u2014\u00a082% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%. Even among those who say Biden is their first choice for president, they\u2019re less enthusiastic than are supporters of other candidates. Twenty-eight percent of all poll respondents describe their feelings toward their first-choice candidate as \u201cextremely enthusiastic.\u201d But 32% of Warren supporters say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about their choice, compared with 22% of Biden supporters. Biden supporters are more likely to describe themselves as \u201cmildly enthusiastic\u201d (31%) than are Warren supporters (11%). Biden does best with older\u00a0caucusgoers,\u00a0winning the support of 35% of those 65 and older.\u00a0That demographic makes up about a quarter of likely\u00a0caucusgoers, and Biden is their top choice, with an almost 3-to-1 lead over Warren. But he struggles with young people. Just 9% of those younger than 35 say he is their first choice for president. Warren leads that demographic, at 27%. Sanders, too, has hit a new low among those younger than 35, falling from a high of 25% in March\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just after he announced he would run. He dropped to 16% in June and is at 11% today. Part of Sanders\u2019 problem: Warren has eaten into some of his key constituencies. Among those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. Thirty-two\u00a0percent say they will support Warren instead, and 12% opt for Buttigieg. Katie\u00a0Naset,\u00a0a 37-year-old poll respondent and Clive resident, said she caucused for Sanders in 2016 because he advanced a far-left agenda focused on issues such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d student loan debt relief and affordable child care. \u201cI aligned more closely with him than Hillary Clinton on those issues,\u201d the family law attorney said. \u201cBut at this point, Elizabeth Warren best approximates with where I am on these issues. She has bold, realistic ideas. They\u2019re backed with a lot of research and deliberate thought.\u201d Naset\u00a0is\u00a0among the 20% of likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0who describe themselves as \u201cvery liberal.\u201d\u00a0Of that group,\u00a048% back Warren and 20% support Sanders. Sanders\u00a0ties Warren among first-time\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0at 22%, and he's second to\u00a0her in generating support among young people. Twenty-two percent of those younger than 35 say Sanders is their first choice for president, trailing Warren by 5 percentage points. Iowa\u2019s likely Democratic\u00a0caucusgoers\u00a0say that nominating a candidate who has a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump is more important than nominating someone who shares their positions on major issues. Sixty-three percent say defeating Trump is more\u00a0important, and 31% say it\u2019s more important to find someone who aligns with them on the issues. Six percent are unsure. But what does electability\u00a0look like to likely Democratic caucusgoers? Asked which of two phrases better fits their definition of the more electable candidate, 74% choose\u00a0a candidate who can excite new voters and get them to show up, compared to 16%\u00a0who say it's someone who excites\u00a0the Democratic base. Sixty-three percent say a candidate who takes positions seeking to find common ground with Republicans is more electable than someone who takes positions moving the country to the left (28%). Fifty-seven percent say a candidate who represents a new generation of leadership is more electable than someone who has a long history of serving in government (28%). And when it comes to dealing with Trump, 54% say the candidate who will \u201ctake the high road\u201d is more electable than someone who will \u201cget in the mud as needed\u201d to take him on (35%). \u201cIt\u2019s very hard not to get down in the mud with him. He just kind of brings that out in people,\u201d said\u00a0J\u2019Andrea\u00a0Gibney, an 83-year-old poll respondent and Maynard resident. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to take the high road\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you can\u2019t be on his level or you\u2019re no better than he is.\u201d Gibney is among the 59% of likely\u00a0caucusogers\u00a0who believe\u00a0government will return to the way it was if Trump is removed from office in 2020.\u00a0Majorities of every demographic group agree. But 30% say they believe Trump\u2019s presidency has permanently changed the way American government works. Three candidates are polling at 1%: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former U.S. housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland. Two candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0author and activist Marianne Williamson and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are polling at 0%, when accounting for rounding. Three candidates had not a single person name them as their first choice for president: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended his campaign Friday, after polling had concluded; U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio; and former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania. Not a single person named de Blasio as either their first or second choice for president in three rounds of Register polling. \u201cThis is what lack of traction looks like in absolute terms,\u201d Selzer said of de Blasio\u2019s numbers. Among those candidates polling at 1% or below, Castro has the largest universe of people who are considering him in some capacity: 1% say he is their first choice, another 1% say he is their second choice and 20% say they are actively considering him, for a total of\u00a022%. But as he's become better known (71% can now rate their feelings toward him compared to 47% who could do so in June), Castro's unfavorability rating has nearly tripled. It's risen from 13% in June to 36% today. The data also suggest that Castro's performance in the Democratic debate earlier this month did him no favors with Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. On the Texas debate stage, Castro appeared to attack Biden's age, asking repeatedly whether the vice president had forgotten what he had said minutes earlier. Fifty-four percent of those who say they watched all of that debate view Castro unfavorably. He is viewed unfavorably by 23% of those who watched none of it. Delaney is the only other lower-polling candidate to crack double digits when looking at the full universe of people considering him in some way. However, that number\u00a0has shrunk to 10% from 18% since June. \u201cMost of them have come to Iowa at least once\u00a0\u2014\u00a0some of them many times,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve hired staff. They\u2019ve made an investment. And if you\u2019ve got people who are getting numbers above 50% and you\u2019re not getting 10%, you have to either really up your game or consider the alternative.\u201d But the caucus field typically doesn\u2019t crystallize until very late, and there is still opportunity for momentum, she said. The top three\u00a0candidates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Warren, Biden and Sanders\u00a0\u2014 account for just over half of first-choice votes, totaling\u00a053%. There are now 15\u00a0candidates vying for 47% of the remaining electorate. \u201cThose votes could start to coalesce around one of the also-rans and quite easily pop another candidate into double-digits as a contender,\u201d Selzer said.

Follow her on Twitter at @brianneDMR. The Iowa Poll, conducted September 14-18, 2019, for The Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 602 registered voters in Iowa who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 3,510 randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state\u2019s voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex\u00a0and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list. Questions based on the sample of 602 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses\u00a0have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The two top Democratic contenders are carving out their lead in the sprawling primary field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are in a virtual tie in a\u00a0new Quinnipiac Poll published Wednesday, with Warren numerically ahead of Biden. This is the third poll in the past week that Warren has inched ahead of Biden, but the first poll nationally. Warren is at 27% among Democrat and Democratic-leaning voters nationally, according to the poll. Just last month, she was at 19% and trailing\u00a0Biden by 13 percentage points. Biden is at 25%, according to Wednesday's poll. He's dropped 7 percentage points from 32% last month. Wednesday's poll follows several early state polling where Warren has jumped ahead of Biden after trailing the former Vice President. Warren is numerically ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is closing in on Biden in Nevada. In all of the polls, Warren and Biden are within the margin of error. For Wednesday's poll, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,337 registered voters nationwide between Sept. 19 to 23, with 561 Democratic voters or Democratic leaning voters surveyed. Poll:More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada Sen. Bernie Sanders is the only other candidate to be in the double digits, standing at 16%. That is 1 percentage point up from August where he was at 15%. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 7%, up from 5% in August.\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris has fallen to 3%. She previously was at 7% last month. No other candidate is above 2% in this poll. Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement that Warren and Biden are \"leaving the rest of the pack behind.\" \"After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\" he said. Malloy also points to the excitement Warren is garnering among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters. More:Trump administration releases transcript of call with Ukraine's President Zelensky amid impeachment inquiry According to the poll, 70% would be excited if she became the Democratic nominee, with only 18% saying they would not be excited.\u00a0 That is\u00a0higher than both Biden and Sanders. For Biden, 56% said they would be excited if he was the nominee with 35 percent saying they would not be excited. 55% of voters said the would be excited for Sanders as the nominee while 38% said the would not be. \"Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear,\" Malloy said.\u00a0\"She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee.\" AMERIND Risk provides peace of mind with our comprehensive suite of coverage products.

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Facing thousands of cheering supporters in the nation\u2019s largest city, Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren on Monday decried President Donald Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh\u201d and outlined her plans to root out corruption in the White House, Congress and courts. \u201cCorruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy,\u201d said Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has emerged as a leading presidential contender. While aggressive, the message was a familiar one. Warren has embraced corruption as a central campaign theme from the beginning of her 2020 presidential bid. But rarely has Warren addressed such a crowd with such a symbolic backdrop. The crowd \u2013 which exceeded 20,000 people, according to the Warren campaign \u2013 filled almost the entirety of the 10-acre Washington Square Park, wrapping around a massive fountain and clogging the pathways that connect the street chess games to the classrooms of New York University to the giant marble arch the downtown park is best known for. It was a younger audience, racially diverse and packed with women. One of the biggest applause lines of the night: \u201cWe\u2019re not here tonight because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all.\u201d Ilhan Omar:Trump admin can't be trusted on Iran if it ' lies about weather maps or crowd sizes' Amid backlash over his plan for homelessness:Donald Trump heads to California The event was set close to the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire, which killed more than 140 workers in 1911. She framed those deaths as the direct result of corruption. Many women died because factory owners neglected safety features to save money, with the implicit support of local elected officials who declined to intervene. Warren charged that the same thing is happening today. \u201cGiant corporations have bought off our government,\u201d she said. Specifically, her anti-corruption plan would \u201cend lobbying as we know it\u201d by instituting a lifetime ban on members of Congress and White House Cabinet secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists. At the same time, corporate lobbyists would be blocked from working for the federal government. Both practices are common today. She also would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts, prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases and ban class-action waivers for all cases involving employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights. And taking direct aim at issues involving the Trump administration, Warren would require candidates for public office to post their tax returns online. Presidents, Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress would also be prohibited from owning businesses on the side. Trump, of course, has refused to release his tax returns years after promising to do so, and the Trump organization continues to do business around the world. \u201cDonald Trump is corruption in the flesh,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe is sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he serves only himself and his partners in corruption.\u201d Warren noted, however, that Trump is only a symptom of the corruption that has infected the U.S. political and economic systems. Warren has\u00a0long argued that the nation\u2019s modern government\u00a0only works for \u201cthe wealthy and the well-connected\u201d like big energy, health care and insurance companies that employ lobbyists to advance their priorities over the best interests of ordinary citizens. Trump:Democrats should look into Barack and Michelle Obama's books, Netflix deals She wrote that popular policies championed by the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing \u2013 and many in its\u00a0crowded field of presidential hopefuls\u00a0\u2013 like universal child care, an overhaul of the federal criminal justice system, gun reform and plans to promote affordable housing have been \u201cstymied because giant corporations and billionaires who don\u2019t want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign noted that she already proposed a series of anti-corruption measures in Congress last year, but it says the proposal released Monday goes further. Warren has emerged as a central player in the broader fight for the direction of the Democratic Party in the age of Trump. Like her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, Warren is demanding transformational change that Trump and his allies deride as socialism. Warren and Sanders are up against Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, a favorite of the party\u2019s establishment wing. Warren didn\u2019t identify any of her Democratic opponents by name. She noted, however, that \u201ctoo many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done.\u201d Warren doesn\u2019t participate in high-dollar fundraising events as a 2020 candidate, though she did before launching her presidential campaign. On Monday, looking out at the swelling crowd, Warren noted that she typically takes selfies with everyone who wants one at her events. \u201cTonight is a little something different,\u201d Warren said.

      "content": "Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network\u00a0Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed\u00a0Biden, the Massachusetts senator was\u00a0within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. It is the second poll in recent days to show her gaining on Biden in a key state:\u00a0She also has surged in Iowa, edging ahead of Biden in a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released over the weekend. \"Nevada was Elizabeth Warren's weakest early state but this finding is validation that Warren has reached an important inflection point,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"The Democratic nomination could now become a two-person race between Warren and Joe Biden, as she is positioning herself for a first or second place finish in the first three Democratic contests.\" Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4%\u00a0and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucus-goers, taken by landline and cell phone Sept. 19-23, has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Issues in Nevada::Poll respondents said top issues are health care, climate change. The race remains fluid. Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed, 58%, said they might change their mind before the caucuses, scheduled for February. Just 37% said their minds were \"firmly made up.\" The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the \"second choice\"\u00a0of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris. Warren insists it's too early to pay much attention to polls. \"I don't do polls,\" she told reporters when asked about the Iowa Poll. \"We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary election.\" Let's vote:When are the 2020 presidential election primaries? In national polls, Biden continues to have a durable lead among Democratic voters, now at 30% in the RealClearPolitics average of September surveys. Warren has moved into second place, at 19%, three points ahead of Sanders.\u00a0In New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary, the top three contenders are bunched within a few points of one another. Biden continues to have a yawning lead in South Carolina, which holds its contest a week after Nevada. National look:USA TODAY/Suffolk poll: Americans dread the 2020 election Nevada Democrats, like those across the country, care more about electability than ideology. By 20 points, 58%-38%, they said the most important thing for Democrats was to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Trump, rather than a candidate \"who reflects my priorities and values.\" Warren was boosted by her performance in the Democratic debate this month, the third of the series. Among those who watched the forum, she was the candidate most often cited as one who did better than they expected, by 23%. Biden was the candidate most often cited as one who did worse than they expected, at 22%. That could raise the stakes for both candidates in the next debate, slated for Oct. 15 and 16 on the campus of Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio. And the spate of good news for Warren could carry a cost: Her\u00a0rise could well make her the target for her Democratic rivals on stage. Sponsored by AMERIND Risk",

      "subtitle": "Here's how Elizabeth Warren would change Social Security",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Social Security is one of the most contentious issues in American politics, and as the 2020 presidential campaign continues to ramp up, candidates have looked at ways to change the program. In particular, an increasing number of proposals have looked for ways to expand Social Security to extend larger benefits to some recipients, especially those in demographic groups who have greater financial needs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0has long been a proponent of expanding Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0She recently revealed her latest proposal about the program. Warren's strategy would make major changes to Social Security, boosting benefits for all and imposing new taxes on high-income earners to finance them. Is Social Security going bankrupt?:3 facts most people get wrong on retirement income Warren's proposal focuses on the financial straits that many Social Security recipients are in right now. According to her numbers, more than 7 million senior citizens live under the poverty line. With costs of living on the rise, especially in key areas for seniors like health care, it's hard to make ends meet. Few older Americans have significant retirement savings, and many even still have considerable debt to repay. Warren also notes that younger workers have even greater challenges. Between tough economic conditions in the labor market and high debt, it's been hard for typical Gen Xers and millennials to make much headway toward financial security. Lastly, Social Security's financial condition poses an approaching\u00a0threat. Current expectations have the Social Security trust funds running out of money in 2035, and that could bring about benefit cuts of roughly 20%. Social Security:3 things that determine how much money you get In response, Warren offers a simple remedy: a higher Social Security benefit for all. Under the proposal, everyone would get a $200 increase in monthly payments from Social Security, including both retirement and disability benefits. It would also tie future cost of living adjustments to a measure of inflation that's tailored toward the basket of goods and services that older Americans have to pay. Certain groups would see even larger increases. Family caregivers would have the value of their work recognized for Social Security eligibility and benefit calculation purposes, which Warren says will especially help women and people of color. Disabled widows and widowers would be able to claim survivor benefits earlier, and Warren's plan would reinstate special minimum benefit rules that would ensure an annual benefit of at least 125% of the federal poverty line. Public-sector employees would avoid negative adjustments from provisions like the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. In order to cover these benefits and shore up Social Security's future finances, Warren would impose two new taxes. First, a new payroll tax would apply to wages above $250,000, with employees paying 7.4% and employers matching with 7.4% of their own. This is above the 6.2% employee rate that applies to current wages up to $132,900 in 2019, under the rationale that Social Security should have a similarly progressive tax rate structure as the regular income tax system does. Warren notes that the current payroll tax scheme for Social Security is regressive as it charges no tax on earnings above the wage base limit. Second, individual filers making more than $250,000 or joint filers above $400,000 would owe a heightened net investment income tax at a rate of 14.8%. That would be in addition to the current 2.9% net investment income tax, which is based on the Medicare payroll tax withholding rate. Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally:'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh' Warren argues that the new taxes would simply be \"asking the top 2% to contribute their fair share to the program.\" It's not the first time that the presidential candidate has targeted the rich, with a previous proposal seeking to impose a wealth tax on those with a net worth above $50 million. Critics of that wealth tax were quick to note ways that wealthy taxpayers could potentially avoid paying it. With the payroll tax system already having the collection infrastructure in place across millions for employers throughout the nation, the new Social Security taxes would avoid some of the enforcement problems that the wealth tax would have faced. The Warren proposal breaks new ground by largely disconnecting the benefits that Social Security pays from the wages on which the program collects taxes. That's sure to draw the ire of opponents, and regardless of what happens in the 2020 election, the issue of Social Security will remain a contentious one well into the future.

      "content": "\u2013 DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren is enjoying a remarkable stretch on the campaign trail. The Democratic presidential contender drew more than 20,000 to a New York City rally on Monday. She received praise from the crowd and activists at an LGBTQ candidates forum on Friday for starting her remarks\u00a0by naming all 18 transgender women of color murdered in the U.S. this year. And she capped the week on Saturday by taking the polling lead\u00a0in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, according to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. But her success means she now has a target on her back, and some of her 2020 competitors already have begun sharpening the knives. Democratic rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sharply\u00a0criticized Warren in recent days, charging she was avoiding\u00a0directly answering questions about whether her Medicare for All plan will lead to a tax increase for middle-class Americans \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Biden said in an exchange with a Warren supporter during a campaign event Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cSo if you\u2019re willing to pay, and I respect you \u2026 the extra taxes and you think you\u2019ll get that much more for that, that\u2019s good. But let's at least acknowledge, let's tell Elizabeth (to acknowledge) it's going to cost a lot of money, and she's going to raise people's taxes doing it.\u201d Meanwhile, Buttigieg in a CNN interview Thursday said Warren was \u201cextremely evasive\u201d about the tax hike issue. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it's the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd I think it's puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Senator (Bernie) Sanders' plan will raise middle class taxes is yes,\u00a0why you wouldn't just say so, and then explain why you think that's the better way forward?\u201d The tougher engagement of Warren by top-tier Democratic rivals comes at a critical moment in the Democratic presidential nomination. Nineteen major Democrats are still in the race, vying for attention, support and\u00a0the opportunity to take on President Trump in the November 2020 general election. Top of the heap:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Big, Big Apple rally:Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally: 'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh' The new Iowa Poll\u00a0that shows Warren for the first time at the top of the race in the Hawkeye State with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers is just a snapshot of where things stand in the Iowa caucus\u00a0that is more than 130 days away. Still, it is an important marker of the state of the race at a moment when more Americans are beginning to pay closer attention to the 2020 election. In addition to the Iowa Poll, a series of recent national polls following this month\u2019s debate in Houston showed Warren gaining on the frontrunner Biden, while\u00a0Sanders is fading. For her part, Warren has subtly taken aim at Biden and other lower-tier centrist candidates, who she complains lack vision for the country while too often pressing an argument that only a moderate can beat Trump in a general election. \u201cThere is a lot at stake in this election and I know people are scared,\u201d Warren told supporters at her New York City speech last week. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backwards.\u201d Throughout her campaign, Warren has unveiled a series of policy ideas, including providing Americans with universal child care, a plan to cancel student debt and make college free, and a proposal to raise social security payments for all beneficiaries\u00a0by $200. She has said she will largely pay for her proposals through a 2% tax on families with more than $50 million in annual income. More social security money:Elizabeth Warren plans to hike Social Security benefit $200 per month by taxing rich But her and Sanders' proposals to\u00a0expand Medicare\u00a0would cost more than $30 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analyses. When asked at this month\u2019s debate in Houston by ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos if her Medicare for All plan would mean a tax hike for middle-class earners, Warren avoided giving a direct answer. She again demurred during a\u00a0Tuesday appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations \u2026 and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down,\u201d Warren responded on Colbert. Angie Weiland, the Warren supporter from Cedar Rapids who engaged in a back-and-forth with Biden, said that she\u2019s been impressed with the senator\u2019s ideas. Weiland said she would like Warren to vociferously argue that a tax hike to pay for Medicare for All is worth it by making the case\u00a0that the benefits \u2013 such as improved health outcomes and ridding businesses of the burden of matching their employees with health care coverage \u2014 will outweigh the costs. Economists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst project that a Medicare for All program could reduce the cost of care by about 10% through\u00a0lower administrative and drug costs. Another analysis from the liberal-leaning Urban Institute estimates that households and businesses would see about $21.9 trillion in savings and state and local governments would save more than $4 trillion over the next decade. Still, there would be a $6 trillion gap in new federal spending, according to the Urban Institute. Sanders, who was the first to embrace Medicare for All, has acknowledged that the policy will require a tax hike and set out proposals for how he'd pay for it if elected. \u201cI think there is room to improve in making the case on how we\u2019d all be better off with Medicare for All,\u201d Weiland said. \u201cI wish she would embrace it like Bernie Sanders has in arguing that the benefits outweigh the costs.\u201d At Warren\u2019s rallies \u2014 which are starting to rival some of Trump\u2019s gatherings in terms of crowd size and where Warren has bolstered her reputation by hanging out for hours after speaking to take photos with supporters\u00a0\u2014 the Massachusetts senator has made \u201cI got a plan for that\u201d the calling card of her stump speech. Long photo lines:Elizabeth Warren's 'selfies' aren't just for kicks; they're a campaign strategy But Biden and some of her other more centrist opponents have sought to cast doubt on Warren\u2019s ambitious plans without directly naming her. On the day after this month\u2019s debate, Biden told supporters at a fundraiser in the well-heeled River Oaks section of Houston that becoming president was not about \u201cwhat you want to do\u201d but \u201cwhat you can do.\u201d \u201cWe need more than plans,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need a president. We need someone who can execute a plan.\u201d Warren has also repeatedly called for the need for structural change in America and been dismissive of Biden\u2019s focus on restoring pre-Trump norms to Washington. But even as Warren has intoned that the country is in crisis and that the \u201ctime for small ideas is over,\u201d other Democratic presidential rivals have countered that Democrats need to remain focused on winning back voters in areas where Trump won but that Obama took in 2008 and 2012. \u201cIf we want to win and deserve to win, we can't water down our values, and we also can't get so caught up in purity tests that we shut out half the country before we ever get to November,\u201d Buttigieg said in his address at this weekend's Polk\u00a0County Democrats Steak Fry, a gathering in Des Moines that drew 17 candidates and more than 12,000 attendees. \u201cWe've got to do this together.\u201d Warren says she is able to spend so much time taking photos with supporters, because she\u2019s declining to hold big-dollar fundraisers through the primary. But last week a senior aide to Sen. Kamala Harris offered thinly-veiled criticism of Warren, who transferred $10 million in reserves from her Senate campaign fund to her presidential war chest. \"We didn't come in with millions and millions of dollars that we'd raised in 2018,\u201d Lily Adams, Harris' communications director. \u201cWe spent 2018 raising for other candidates.\" Sanders and Warren, two of the most liberal members of the Senate, haven\u2019t criticized each other over the course of the campaign. But last month at a Sanders campaign event in Iowa, the actress and activist Susan Sarandon appeared to take a shot at Warren. \u201cHe is not someone who used to be a Republican,\u201d Sarandon told the crowd during her introduction of Sanders. Warren was a registered Republican until the mid-1990s. While her campaign may be surging, Warren took a more low-key approach to this weekend\u2019s Polk County Steak Fry. Biden marched into the steak fry behind an International Association of Firefighters union fire truck and with a drill team by his side. Harris shimmied her way into the event with her own band and dancers accompanying her. But Warren, a former Harvard law school professor, decided to take a more low key\u00a0yet\u00a0strategic approach to the gathering that drew thousands of likely caucusgoers to one place. Her campaign held an organizing event prior to the steak fry where it trained hundreds of supporters and then dispatched them into the event to have conversations about Warren with the huge Democratic crowd. Some carried clipboards and took the opportunity gather emails and phone numbers of attendees that seemed persuadable. Among the volunteers were Julie and Jim Maddox, retired teachers from Dubuque, Iowa, who managed to get one person to commit to caucusing for Warren just minutes into their canvass and met a second caucusgoer who was leaning toward Warren and agreed to stay in touch with the couple ahead of the Feb. 3 caucus. Julie Maddox said that she expects that Warren\u2019s Democratic rivals will step up their criticism that Warren plans are impractical. But Maddox said she\u2019s ready with an answer for Warren\u2019s Democratic doubters and critics. \u201cWe just have to start out by asking for pie in the sky and then we may end up getting a piece of the pie,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI think the point we have to make is that it could be a significantly more savory piece with Warren than if we stick with the current crowd.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fellow Democratic contender, said above a similar link. \"No child should go hungry at school \u2013 period,\" a third candidate, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, tweeted Tuesday. \"As president, I will fight for universal free school lunch and relieve all school lunch debt.\" Closer to home, the district's congressman, Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat from Camden, New Jersey, declared the policy to be \"unacceptable.\" \"Free school lunches should be available to every student who needs one. No exceptions.\" School officials have expressed exasperation, with Superintendent Joseph Meloche observing no student has been denied a meal due to unpaid cafeteria charges. \"Unfortunately, there is a discussion going on outside of our community that is dramatically different and not representative of what is going on within our community,\" Meloche said in a statement Monday. The new policy also includes outreach provisions intended to identify and help families in need. Officials say that process would not occur if the district used donated funds to erase the debts for all students. Board members have said that by being able to identify families and reach out to them, they could connect qualifying families to the free and reduced lunch program. Another reason for avoiding donations is that they might inadvertently cover bills for families who are able to pay for school lunches, officials have said. \"There are children on the arrears list whose families are struggling, and there are children on the list who come from families and homes with means,\" Meloche said. School board members have said families that can afford to pay their children's lunch charges should be required to do so. But angry tweets showed the issue in a harsher light. Nationally:500,000 kids could lose free school lunch under Trump administration proposal Pennsylvania:CEO tries to play hero, pay for students' late lunch bills: School board says no \"Cherry Hill schools aren't interested in fiscal solvency, They WANT to punish poor kids for being poor,\" Ames Grawert, senior counsel for the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy institute, told his 5,000-plus followers. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy also tweeted a link to a story on the district, noting, \"No child should be shamed, punished or banned from extracurricular activities over lunch money.\" But district officials have noted a state law directs districts to stop serving meals to students if lunch-debts remain unpaid. Cherry Hill's former policy included the mandated language, but did not enforce it. The district said\u00a0the public is welcome to contribute to its Friday Food Backpack Program, launched last year with a\u00a0$25,000 grant that has since run out. The program sent food home over the weekend for children in five schools. Cherry Hill cleared $25,000 in school lunch debt two years ago to start with a clean slate. The back payments currently stand at $16,500. The protracted and highly public debate began over the summer as the Cherry Hill school district began discussions over how to address the debt. The state rule states that districts that have not collected full payment for a lunch debt within 10 days of notification will then send another notice saying lunch\u00a0\"shall not be served to the student beginning one week from the date of the second notice unless payment is made in full.\" However, once the school board began considering enforcement of other existing policies\u00a0\u2013 including one that allowed for an alternate lunch such as\u00a0tuna-fish sandwiches for students with delinquent lunch accounts\u00a0\u2013 the issue exploded into a national controversy.

      "content": "Ten Democrats took the stage in Atlanta Wednesday for the fifth primary debate, featuring a fresh round of attacks on President Donald Trump amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry and public hearings. Candidates were asked right off the bat to weigh in on impeachment, and as in previous debates, discussion on top Democratic policy priorities was punctuated by candidates offering sharp criticisms of fellow rivals. Here are some of the top moments from the debate: The debate stage was set shortly after the closing of a full day of impeachment testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and moderators asked the candidates to dive in on the topic. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked how she would convince her Republican colleagues to vote to remove the president should he be impeached by the House. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say, 'First, read the Mueller report,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Because Congress failed to act on that report, she said, Trump felt free to break the law again. More:Catch up on USA TODAY's coverage of Wednesday's impeachment hearings In light of today's testimony from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Warren took a stab at what she says is corruption in politics, dinging Trump for appointing Sondland to his post after \"he wrote a check.\"\u00a0Sondland gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Warren said she would not appoint donors to ambassadorships, though the practice is longstanding in administrations from both sides of the aisle. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar called for holding Trump accountable. He is accused of improperly pressuring the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into domestic politics, including into 2020 frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that while Trump is \"likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America,\" his campaign cannot only focus on it. \"We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u2019re going to lose the election,\" Sanders said. In past debates, Democrats opened with lengthy exchanges on health care \u2013 an issue that has divided centrists and liberals in the fields for months. This time, the candidates had a longer-than-usual debate on taxes. Warren began by touting her two-cent tax on the wealthiest Americans. \"I\u2019m tired of freeloading billionaires,\" Warren said, but also noted that \"doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.\" Rather, she says, it's about asking those at the top to contribute to others. \"Our government is working better and better for the billionaires,\" Warren said, \"and worse and worse for everyone else.\" The argument drew a quick rebuttal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who called Warren\u2019s plan \"cumbersome\" and difficult to evaluate. Saying that all the Democrats on stage\u00a0support universal pre-kindergarten care and bringing \"a lot more revenue in this country\u201d through closing loopholes, Booker said that, \"I don\u2019t agree with the wealth tax the way Elizabeth Warren puts it.\" More:Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class Warren's wealth tax is also part of her plan to fund Medicare for All. After taking heat from 2020 rivals at previous debates for dodging the question of how she would fund for the policy, Warren released a plan that she says would not raise taxes on the middle class. Sanders and Warren defended their Medicare for All\u00a0approaches while Buttigieg and Biden argued people shouldn\u2019t be forced into one government-run plan. Sanders recycled one of his biggest applause lines from a previous debate during the health care discussion. After Warren talked about the need for reform, the debate moderators gave Sanders a chance to respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d Sanders quipped. \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d It was a line that Sanders first rolled out during a debate in July in Detroit when challenged about the details of his health care plan. \u201cThe vast majority of Democrats don\u2019t support Medicare for All,\u201d Biden said, asserting that it couldn\u2019t pass the Democrat-controlled House. Biden supports a Medicare option that builds on the Affordable Care Act, and says that people don't want to lose their current health insurance plans. \u201cI trust the American people to make a judgement that they believe is in their interest,\" Biden said. Gabbard prompts brawl with dig at Democratic Party Candidates were at each other's throats early on in the\u00a0November Democratic debate. In one instance, it started with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard taking another swipe at the Clintons. It ended with a broader debate about the future of Democratic foreign policy and whether, as Gabbard claims, the party needs to break with the past. Asked to explain a\u00a0Twitter firestorm\u00a0between Gabbard and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month, Gabbard said that the party needs to break away from the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump\u201d foreign policy that she described as being driven by \u201cgreedy corporate interests.\u201d More:Tulsi Gabbard's lawyers sent a letter to Hillary Clinton demanding she retract Russia comments That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who accused of Gabbard of spending \u201cfour years on Fox News criticizing Obama.\u201d \u201cWhat we need on this stage,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis someone who has the ability to win.\u201d Gabbard said that Harris continued to \u201ctraffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I am seeking to bring.\u201d What started it? Clinton\u2019s comments to a podcast last month were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be \"grooming\" Gabbard. Clinton had actually said it was the Republicans who were \"grooming\" Gabbard, according to an aide. But Clinton also said in the podcast that \"She's a favorite of the Russians\" and continued to also talk about former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the \"queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Quick wit served several candidates on stage as they sparred with each other over policy issues, prompting laughter and applause from audience members and spreading widely on social media. And as Trump's rapid response team fired off emails to counter Democrats' points, they also fired off quips aimed at the president. Booker slammed Biden for saying this week that he was not prepared to support\u00a0legalizing marijuana, tying it to the disproportionate effect drug laws have had on communities of color. African Americans have faced a harsher application of those laws than white Americans. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Booker said to Biden. Biden said he supports decriminalizing marijuana, but said Americans should study the long-term effects of the drug before legalizing it. His earlier comments included that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug.\" That view has puts Biden at odds with a significant share of voters of both parties, according to polls. Booker also used a question about how he would unify the country to get in a subtle dig at Buttigieg. Asked how he would bring the country together if he is president, Booker said the nation achieves great things \u201cwhen we stand together and work together.\u201d He went on to cite his work as mayor of Newark, N.J., as an example. \u201cI happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar mayor on the stage,\u201d Booker declared. The quip was a clear reference to Buttigieg, who has overshadowed Booker and other Democratic candidates in the polls for much of the campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s rise \u2013 some polls put in him in first\u00a0place in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 has rankled some of his Democratic rivals. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang got a good laugh \u2013 and applause \u2013 when asked what, if elected president,\u00a0he would\u00a0say in his first call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAt first, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy,\u201d Yang said, taking a stab at Trump. Then he quickly added: \u201cSorry, not sorry.\u201d Before the debate even began, the Biden campaign mistakenly sent an email to supporters that was meant to go out after the debate had ended. \"I hope I made you proud out there,\" the email said. But that wasn't the end of it, as Biden turned some heads with comments he made on stage, after a respite in his notorious verbal flubs in public appearances. Biden\u2019s response to how he would address sexual violence drew laughter for an unfortunate choice of words. He started\u00a0by reminding the audience\u00a0he authored legislation to address violence against women. He argued that \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.\u201d \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period,\u201d Biden said, but then added.\u00a0\u201cAnd keep punching at it and punching it and punching at it.\u201d The former vice president also\u00a0touted his support from African Americans, one of the reasons he\u2019s leading the field in South Carolina while lagging behind the other frontrunners in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI have more people supporting me in the black community,\u201d Biden said, then saying that he was endorsed by \"the only African American woman who'd ever been elected to the United States Senate,\" likely referring to\u00a0Carol Moseley Braun. The Illinois woman, the first black woman elected to the Senate,\u00a0served a single term in the Senate during the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d both Booker and Harris interjected. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris said of herself, incredulously, as the stage erupted and Biden quickly tried to correct by saying he meant to say \"the first,\" black woman elected.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Thursday called for President Donald Trump to release transcripts of phone conversations between him and President Xi of China after reports emerged that\u00a0Trump raised both her and former Vice President Joe Biden's political prospects. A phone call with Xi on June 18 was stored in the same highly-secured electronic system used to hold the\u00a0phone call with Ukraine\u00a0President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, CNN reported. Earlier Thursday, Trump publicly declared that\u00a0China should investigate Biden. \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Warren was reportedly\u00a0mentioned in the phone call as she was beginning to gain traction in the crowded field of 2020 contenders, often emerging as a front-runner along with Biden in polling. \u201cTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values.\u201d According to CNN, \"In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on\u00a0Hong Kong protests\u00a0as trade talks progressed.\" Biden responded on Twitter after Trump first mentioned China, accusing him of attempting to\u00a0\"rig the primary and pick your opponent,\" adding that the president\u00a0\"cannot extort foreign governments\" in his effort to win reelection. \"It\u2019s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security,\" Biden said. The demand for the release of the transcript\u00a0echoed California Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, who called on the White House to release documents\u00a0about Trump\u2019s conversations with Xi \"because we need to know what he has now said in private conversations, because we obviously know what he is saying in public.\u201d \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno on Wednesday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.

      "content": "A bullish stock market hides a lot of sins. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor's 500 and other barometers hitting new highs lately, there's plenty of opportunity to enjoy the profits while overlooking problems in your investment mix. In other words, you're doing well and making money. But could you be faring even better? Here are some potential areas to address: If you have been investing for many years, you might have dozens of stocks, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, so a little weeding and trimming could be in order. With individual stocks or bonds, you likely need to hold at least a dozen issues, from different industries, to achieve a minimal amount of diversification. With funds it's a different story\u00a0\u2013 you already might have more diversification than you need. Student loan debt:\u00a0Strategies to pay it off faster, smarter Refinance or not?Getting a better deal isn't always a slam dunk \"The number of funds you own is less relevant than how they work together to manage your overall risk,\" noted Mark Riepe, a senior vice president at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in a blog. \"If you own multiple funds with overlapping holdings, you could be less diversified than if you owned a single fund with broad market exposure.\" There isn't a magic number of funds above which it makes no sense to keep piling on more. One or a few highly diversified stock and bond funds could be sufficient, especially one like Vanguard's Total Stock Market index fund. Conversely, a dozen or more funds might not be too much if you think they all add value, their costs are reasonable and you don't mind monitoring all that stuff. \"But if you have more than maybe 15, it might be a sign you have become a collector,\" said David Fernandez, a certified financial planner at Wealth Engineering in Scottsdale. If your investments are held in taxable accounts, year-end selling strategies could help.\u00a0 The usual advice, if you hold investments showing a paper loss, is to sell them before year-end to reap a deduction. In general, if your losses exceed your gains, up to $3,000 of the excess could be deductible, while the rest can be carried forward to future years. But if you fall in a low tax bracket, where the 0% capital-gains rate applies, it might make sense to do the reverse and harvest gains on which you could avoid taxes altogether. In 2019, singles with taxable income below $39,375 and married couples below $78,750 fall in the two lowest federal income brackets, where they qualify to avoid taxes on long-term gains held more than one year, according to Baird Private Wealth Management. \"While that doesn\u2019t mean low-income taxpayers can have an unlimited amount of tax-free gains (as the gains themselves can push a person into a higher bracket), it does provide a planning opportunity,\" Baird noted. If you hold actively managed funds in taxable accounts, beware year-end capital gains distributions, too. These payments reflect internal selling by the portfolio manager, which means you can get stuck with a tax bill even if you held tight. After a bull market spanning 10-plus years, \"Some funds have big gains built up,\" Fernandez said. It's not just a question of holding too many stocks or funds. You might own types of investments that just don't make much sense anymore. John Rekenthaler, a Morningstar vice president of research, cited emerging-markets stock funds as a prime example of a category that might be worth discarding. \"In the early 1990s, emerging-markets stock funds were the rage,\" he wrote in the fall issue of Morningstar magazine. \"Their subsequent results have been weaker than even the skeptics believed.\" Emerging markets funds are a \"failed experiment\" where the results haven't lived up to expectations, he continued. The expectations were that fast economic growth in developing nations such as China and India would translate to hefty returns for investors. Economic growth indeed has been brisk, but the returns often are squandered in ways ranging from local corruption to corporate expansion in unprofitable ventures. Rekenthaler's suggestion: Hold a broad international stock fund rather than one focused on developed foreign markets plus a second for emerging markets. \"What matters in today's globally connected marketplace is not where corporations are headquartered,\" he wrote. \"More significant is where corporations conduct their businesses and how they are affected by currency movements.\" The presidential election is less than a year off, and political news increasingly will dominate the headlines. All this noise could buffet your portfolio. Brian Andrew, chief investment officer at Johnson Financial Group, said it's important for investors to keep matters in perspective. Plenty of significant, even potentially threatening, proposals could surface from candidates in the months ahead, but it's not necessarily likely that these ideas ever will become law. Andrew cited Elizabeth Warren's \"Medicare for All\"\u00a0proposal, which has made investors nervous about the future of health care stocks, especially insurance companies, which could face elimination. But this radical plan would require congressional approval, assuming Warren even wins the election. \"It's a long way from being implemented,\" Andrew said. Meanwhile, the aging population implies more revenue for many medical companies. \"I don't worry about her proposals because we will keep spending more on health care,\" Andrew said. Over the long haul, the stock market has risen regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans occupy the White House. This argues against overreacting to election results, let alone proposals. Transaction costs have been coming down drastically in a lot of investment areas. Companies including Charles Schwab and Fidelity now will let you trade many types of stocks, mutual funds or exchange-traded funds for free, or close to it. Internal fund expenses also have been dropping. These include outlays incurred by investment companies, and passed along to shareholders, for portfolio management, administration and so on. The typical annual expense charged by mutual funds and exchanged-traded funds eased to 0.48% last year, according to Morningstar, which made the calculation on a weighted-average basis (meaning larger funds exerted greater influence). That's equal to $4.80 for every $1,000 a person has invested. But you can do even better \u2013 some funds charge less than $1 per $1,000. Overall, weighted-average expenses have dropped from 0.93% or $9.30 per $1,000 in 2000, with most of the decline coming over the past five years, Morningstar added. International stock funds (0.82%) usually charge more than funds holding U.S. stocks (0.70%). Bond funds (about 0.50%) charge less than stock portfolios. The key point: If you're paying much more than these numbers, it's time to look for alternatives. Reach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead a turbulent field for the Democratic presidential nomination, a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but his margin over Massachusetts Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren has been slashed in half. And most Democratic voters\u00a0say they could still change their minds. Almost exactly one year before Election Day\u00a0\u2013 and 96 days before the opening Iowa caucuses\u00a0\u2013 Biden was backed by 26% of likely Democratic primary and caucus voters in the survey. Warren was\u00a0second at 17%, followed by\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Biden's lead over Warren, now 9 percentage points, was 18 points in the last\u00a0USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, taken in late August. His standing has fallen by 6 points since then; hers has risen by 3. \"My front-runner would be Biden,\" Nathaniel Dortch, 77, an Air Force retiree from\u00a0Moreno Valley, California, who was among those surveyed, said in a follow-up interview. Then he added, \"I want to wait and see.\" Iowa caucuses:\u00a0Poll shows they are 'up for grabs' as\u00a0Buttigieg surges into top tier In a sign of the prospect for changes ahead, 18% of likely Democratic voters were undecided. Among those with a preferred candidate, a 57% majority said their minds weren't firmly made up. \"I am undecided in supporting a specific candidate right now because I am not looking for the issue differential, I want someone best equipped to take on Donald Trump,\" said Freyr Thor, 56, a tech CEO from South Pasadena, California. He's worried about\u00a0what he's seen, and hasn't seen, in the Democrats' televised debates so far.\u00a0\"No one has shown me they can take on Trump, including Biden.\" In a match-up between President Trump and an unnamed Democratic nominee, Trump narrowly led, 41%-39%, with 10% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate. Another 10% were undecided. That was a shift, albeit one within the margin of error, from the August survey, when the unnamed Democrat held a narrow lead over Trump,\u00a041%-39%. In the new poll,\u00a0Republicans expressed overwhelming confidence about the outcome of the election, with 86% predicting the president would win. Seventy-five percent of Democrats said their nominee would win. But independents by a double-digit margin expected Trump to prevail. Despite the cloud of impeachment, overall those surveyed predicted by 50%-40% that the president in the end would claim a second term. \"Trump has done a lot of the things he has set out to do,\" said John Siefkas, 52, a farmer and political independent from Osceola, Iowa, who was called in the poll. \"He needs to keep his hands off Twitter, (but) he is doing some stuff that is needing done that people haven't had the guts to do.\" William Collins, 56, an independent who is a retired police investigator from Fort Valley, Virginia, also plans to vote for the president. \"I believe Trump has directed America in the right direction, and I think he really has the American people in his own heart.\" Trump's job-approval rating was 46% approve-52% disapprove, with 27% saying they \"strongly\" approved and 37% saying they \"strongly\" disapproved. More from the poll:Who's sticking with Trump? His seemingly unshakable base. USA TODAY interview with David Rubenstein: 'The country will survive whatever happens now' The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The sample of 399 likely Democratic voters has an error margin of 4.9 points; the sample of 323 likely Republican voters has an error margin of 5.5 points. Those surveyed were split down the middle when it comes to Congress: 43% said they supported the Democratic candidate in their district; 42% the Republican. Asked whether they would prefer Democrats or Republicans to win control of Congress next November, they divided 46%-46%. The Democratic field now has a top tier of four candidates \u2013 Biden, Warren, Sanders and now Buttigieg, whose standing rose 4 points from the August poll. They were followed by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 4% \u2013 up from less than 1% last time \u2013 and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%. California Sen. Kamala Harris was also at 3%, a drop of 3 points from August. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, credited with a strong performance in the last debate, was at 2% \u2013 not a big number, but better than in August, when she registered no support. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also was at 2%. None of the other 11 candidates had support higher than 1%, a troubling sign as they try to raise money and break through. Seven of them had either no\u00a0or only a single backer in the survey. \"I like Warren, Harris and Booker,\"\u00a0said Doleen Reynolds, 51, an independent from Slidell, Louisiana, who is concerned that Biden \"would compromise too much\" with progressive principles. \"But if he gets the nomination, I will vote for him, because we cannot have the alternative.\" The big field is helping Biden, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"Biden's strength has been, at best, fixed, and he benefits from so many other candidates splitting the non-Biden voters,\" Paleologos said.\u00a0\"Overall, Biden has led in the national polls for some time but you can't flatline to the Iowa caucuses.\" The Democratic field has set records for size, but almost one in five Democrats, 18%, said they wished someone else would jump into the race. In response to an open-ended question about who, 10% identified former first lady Michelle Obama,\u00a07% said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg\u00a0and\u00a04% said Hillary Clinton, the party's 2016 nominee. Among Republicans, a similar number, 17%, said they wished someone else would enter the GOP contest. Asked who, 8% said former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and 6% said Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee. Mitt Romney:\u00a0A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party None of the three Republicans who are already running are cutting into Trump's support. In the poll, 85% of likely GOP voters backed Trump. Two percent supported former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld; and 1% each supported former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh. Who are the candidates?\u00a0Meet them in our interactive guide",

      "content": "White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants to impose a massive tax on lobbying activities, creating a new levy that she hopes will nudge some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies and special interest groups toward curtailing federal lobbying. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2013 but in that case, all the better.\u201d The proposal might face long odds\u00a0\u2014 a seeming longshot in a divided Congress in which both sides of the aisle have deep ties to lobbyists \u2014 \u00a0but it marks Warren\u2019s latest effort to press her case to voters that she\u2019s the candidate most in tune with looking out for working-class\u00a0Americans. It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls Under the the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures. For every dollar above $1 million spent on lobbying, the rate will increase to 60% \u2013 and for every dollar above $5 million, it would increase to 75%, Warren explained in a Medium post.\u00a0Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade. Warren\u00a0in March unveiled a plan  that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram. Warren then\u00a0slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\" Big tech clash:Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech More:Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them She took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee. \u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d Warren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan also calls for using the money to bolster federal agencies that are being inundated by companies or industries lobbying against a rule. She noted that having such a mechanism would have been helpful during the Obama administration when financial industry lobbyists successfully stymied the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which would have limited brokers abilities to put fees and commissions ahead of earning returns for their clients\u2019 retirement accounts. After a public hearing on the rule, the agency received more than 100 comments \u2014including 45 from members of Congress \u2014 that seemed to repeat industry talking points. Under law, agencies much respond to all concerns laid out in the public comments; the Obama Labor Department ended up withdrawing the proposed rule amid the flood of comments. \u201cEvery time a company above the $500,000 threshold spends money lobbying against a rule from a federal agency, the taxes on that spending will go directly to the agency to help it fight back,\u201d Warren wrote of her proposal. \u201cIn 2010, DOL could have used that money to hire more staffers to complete the rule more quickly and intake the flood of industry comments opposing it.\u201d Contributing: Rebecca Morin",

      "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 On a recent\u00a0Sunday, Victor Garcia left his Silicon Valley apartment and traveled an hour north to attend a rally by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Garcia, a 20-year-old political science major, is eager to vote both in the November 2020 election and in California\u2019s moved-up primary\u00a0on March 3.\u00a0But as curious as he is about Yang, a passionate\u00a0proponent of a monthly $1,000 Universal Basic Income payment, Garcia\u00a0is still candidate-shopping. He wants to see which politician is most attuned to issues that concern the state\u2019s growing Latino population. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d Garcia says as a largely youthful\u00a0crowd gathers at Civic Center Plazain San Francisco ahead of Yang's speech. \u201cThat said, most candidates really aren\u2019t reaching out to us yet.\" With California's earlier\u00a0primary date giving\u00a0the state newfound clout in choosing who takes on President Donald Trump, political experts say presidential hopefuls would do well to step up their courtship of the Golden State\u2019s increasingly powerful Latino voters. According to the Pew Research Center, not only are\u00a0Latinos the majority-minority, with\u00a039% (or 15 million) of the state's 40 million residents, but they also represent roughly a third of the state\u2019s eligible voters (at\u00a07.7 million). While Latino voter turnout lags that of other ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 45% of Latino adults are likely to vote, compared with 68% of whites, according to the Public Policy Institute of California \u2013 those numbers have been shifting. In the 2018 midterms, contests\u00a0that\u00a0traditionally draw\u00a0fewer voters than general elections, Latino voter turnout hit 36%, a doubling from 2014 that helped California Democratic candidates\u00a0flip seven perennially Republican House\u00a0seats. California Democrats gather:Here's what you need to know And Latino turnout expectations are heightened for the 2020 presidential election. At play not only are robust voter registration efforts aimed at a heavily Democratic constituency \u2013 58% register as Democrats, compared with 15% who register as Republicans \u2013 but also\u00a0a powerful resentment of Trump, whose disapproval rating hovers at 70% among Latinos, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. According to a Nov.\u00a013 statewide Latino Decisions poll commissioned by the Latino Community Foundation, 74%\u00a0of registered Latino voters say they plan to vote in the March 3 primary. Concerns about racism was cited by 76%\u00a0of respondents. The poll also reveals that 31% planned to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 11% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro came in at 9%, and California\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris was at 8%. \u201cThe message we want all Latinos to hear is that they have the power to determine who is going to run against Trump\u00a0and who will win in November,\u201d says Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO of San Francisco- based Latino Community Foundation, which is working to get out the Latino vote across the state. \u201cThe political climate we are in has awoken a new generation of voters,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate the term sleeping giant, because we\u2019ve been working, not sleeping. Now the candidates have to engage.\u201d Democrats making a run for the White House will have an opportunity\u00a0to lock in Garcia\u2019s vote on Nov.\u00a016 in Long Beach, California, site of a televised Univision forum that will include Harris, Warren, Sanders, Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Yang. The event represents a rare in-state gathering by candidates who by and large have been visiting\u00a0California mostly for lucrative private fundraising trips. Many have so far focused their campaigning on\u00a0Iowa and other early battleground states. In fact, Biden has skipped all events hosted by the state\u2019s Democratic Party \u2013\u00a0 but has attended posh donor events up and down the state. He\u00a0recently announced he would not be at the state\u2019s party convention in Long Beach Nov.\u00a015 through 17. Rounding out the Univision forum's field of eight \u2013 and serving as last-minute replacements for original invitees\u00a0Biden, Warren and former Texas Congressman\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, who ended his once-promising campaign Nov. 1 \u2013 will be billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The cost of not grabbing the attention of Latinos across the state is\u00a0high, says Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cA presidential candidate cannot win California without getting a very significant portion of the Latino population, so ignoring outreach here is a huge strategic mistake,\u201d Romero says. USA TODAY reached out to the campaigns of all those initially invited to the upcoming Univision forum to talk about Latino voters in California. Yang\u2019s team was the only one to arrange an interview. \u201cAs a child of immigrants, I appreciate that communities may have unique issues,\u201d Yang tells USA TODAY in a makeshift greenroom just off Mission Street that by night is a chic cocktail bar. \u201cBut my campaign focuses on topics\u00a0that affect all of us.\u201d Yang says that by highlighting the coming negative effects of automation on retail, transportation and food service jobs, he is in fact directly addressing the concerns of Latino voters. \u201cMany communities will be adversely affected by this coming economic natural disaster,\u201d Yang says. \u201cBut those who will suffer the most will be people of color.\u201d So who has the edge? A recent Telemundo poll of Latino voters nationally showed\u00a0Biden leading with 26%, followed by Sanders at 18% and Warren at 10%. The next closest was\u00a0Harris at 3%. But 36% of Latino voters said they were undecided. Those findings largely were borne out in conversations with a range of California Latino leaders, from the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to a popular radio deejay. \u201cMost Latinos certainly know who Joe Biden is, so he\u2019ll get solid support, especially from the older generation,\u201d says Xavier Becerra, the state's first Latino\u00a0attorney general. His office has\u00a0sued the Trump administration more than 60 times on a range of issues. Becerra says that for many Latino voters, name recognition is key. \u201cFour years ago, I was campaigning for Hillary (Clinton) and Sanders was having a tough time gaining traction with Latinos, and now he\u2019s way up there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that shows is Latinos, like others, want to know who you are before they turn to you.\u201d Interest in Sanders and Warren indicates Latinos are \u201ctrending on the progressive side, which makes sense when you see the growth of younger voters,\u201d\u00a0Becerra says. Currently, 44% of eligible Latino voters are in the millennial age bracket, 18 to 33, according to Pew. Chuy Gomez, a longtime Bay Area radio broadcaster, often has the ear of younger Latino voters. \u201cA lot of people I speak with want Bernie in,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cHe speaks to the common folks, the workers. He\u2019s anti-rich.\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, has endorsed Warren. \u201cShe talks about bread and butter issues in a Midwest way, but it\u2019s all about paying the rent, getting more power as a worker, and our community relates to those issues,\u201d she says. When asked about Julian Castro, the lone Latino in the shrinking cluster of Democratic candidates, many say that while Latinos instantly relate to a man with a familiar last name and life story, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has their vote. \u201cWe want Castro in the race because he lives like us and represents us, so him being president is secondary to him just being on that stage,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe should be an example for the nation. We were scapegoated by this president as a way to win the last election. So we want to help galvanize Latinos everywhere to vote.\u201d Political pundits often like to talk about voters being driven largely by specific issues. But conversations with Latinos make it clear this is not a monolithic group. In fact, they hold a range of views, from progressive to conservative, and care about a rainbow of issues ranging from income inequality to climate change. \u201cThere is no issue that is not a Latino issue,\u201d says Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state who is also the first Latino to hold that position. \u201cWe want what everyone else wants. An opportunity for a good-paying job, access to health care, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing. Our dream is the American dream.\u201d Padilla says many Latinos see that dream as increasingly under threat by the Trump\u00a0administration, which has appealed to its base by attacking illegal immigration\u00a0and calling for tougher security\u00a0at the Mexican border. That, however, has served only to galvanize Latinos in a way that reminds Padilla of California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed by the state\u2019s voters 25 years ago this month. Prop 187 denied undocumented immigrants access to health care and education. Although a day later the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, it created a movement that eventually saw 1 million California Latinos become citizens and arguably launched the ethnic group on a path toward\u00a0increased power at the polls. Latino political activists agree that while the debate over illegal immigration is deeply upsetting to Latinos, candidates would be making a mistake if they focused their messaging on this one topic. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for these candidates to understand that it is not the case that if you know what one Latino wants, you know what we all want,\u201d says Latino Community Foundation CEO Martinez Garcel. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m a Dominican from New York, so when I hear AOC (progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) speak, I don\u2019t hear socialism, I hear policies that care about the poor,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Another mistake for candidates would be displaying a level of sympathy that teeters into pity. \u201cSometimes presidential candidates don\u2019t talk about Latinos in uplifting ways but just as victims, and we need to challenge that image,\u201d says Sarah Souza, president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, the first DACA recipient (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), or \"Dreamer,\" to be appointed to the post. Souza, who originally is from Brazil, says candidates who push for access to home ownership and financial resources for Latinos will find a ready audience. \u201cWe want economic opportunities just like everyone else,\u201d says Souza, adding that she supports Castro, Sanders and Warren. \u201cThey\u2019re the most progressive and have an agenda that is for people of color, a group that has long been a target when it comes to economic equity.\u201d For Alma Beltran, mayor of Parlier, California, just south of the agricultural mecca of Fresno, the upcoming primary and general election are about restoring opportunity and dignity to the lives of her 15,000 constituents \u2013 98.8% of whom are Latino, including her and the entire City Council. Though times are tough in Parlier because of scarce economic opportunities and looming water quality issues, Beltran\u00a0finds encouragement in the younger generation. \u201cI talk to some people who will say \u2018It won\u2019t make a difference if I vote,\u2019 but then I run into young people like my son, who is 17 and told me when he gets older he wants to run for office,\u201d Beltran says. \u201cYou think maybe they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re watching. They\u2019re the people who will make a difference.\u201d The crowd waiting for Yang at Civic Center Plaza is in fact mostly younger. Signs invariably tout the merits of his basic income plan, while most of the baseball caps say, \"MATH,\" a play off Trump's MAGA slogan that stands for Make America Think Harder. Marching with a smile is Eliana Jaramillo. Her large sign features a cartoon drawing of Yang as Uncle Sam, and in Spanish it reads, \u201cUniversal Basic Income: I want you to have $1,000 a month.\u201d Jaramillo says she was drawn to Yang\u2019s campaign specifically because that kind of stipend would have allowed her and her two children to flee an abusive relationship sooner. \u201cI\u2019m marching in the hope that other women don\u2019t have to go through what I did,\u201d she says. Nearby, Milo Alvarez bops up and down on his toes as he tries to get his infant son to sleep in his chest-mounted sling. \u201cI was a Bernie fan, but now I like Yang because I love this idea of a universal basic income,\u201d\u00a0says Alvarez, a scooter repairman from Daly City just south of San Francisco. Alvarez reels off the other issues that are important to him, including health care and climate change. He says he doesn\u2019t particularly mind\u00a0if candidates don't appeal to him specifically as a Latino. \u201cI care about the issues, which cut\u00a0across a lot of ethnicities,\u201d he says. Whether a\u00a0broad political appeal, like that made by Yang, will be enough to woo California's Latino voters come the elections in March and November remains to be seen. California\u00a0Secretary of State Padilla\u00a0suggests it may not be. \u201cYou cannot compete in California without paying deep respect and responding to the Latino community,\u201d he says. \u201cBottom line.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava",

      "content": "Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment:5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "author": "",
      "content": "One story that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly told on the 2020 campaign trail is about how she was let go from her first teaching job when she was 22, after school officials realized she was pregnant. But now Warren is on the defense with her account after an interview\u00a0from over a decade ago resurfaced in which she\u00a0described\u00a0the circumstances around her departure from the school district in a different way, and conservative outlets acquired\u00a0meeting notes from the school board of the time showing that her contract was extended. The Democratic presidential hopeful is now using her circumstance to highlight the stories of other women in the United States who have faced gender-based\u00a0discrimination. \"We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\" Warren said in a tweet on Tuesday. Warren's story goes like this: In 1971, she was offered an extra year to her contract after completing her first year as a teacher, before the school knew that she was pregnant. But after a couple months, once her pregnancy became obvious, \"The principal did what principals did in those days\u2014wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\" This all occurred before pregnancy discrimination was outlawed by Congress in 1978. More:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls In an interview\u00a0from 2007, Warren said\u00a0that she left her job and stayed home with her new family. \"I actually didn't have the education courses, so I was on an emergency certificate, it was called, and I\u00a0went back to graduate school and took a couple courses in education, and said 'I don't think this is going to work out for me,'\" she said. \"And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I Was really casting about thinking, 'What am I going to do?'\" In a statement to\u00a0CBS News, Warren attempted to clarify\u00a0the discrepancy. \"After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator,\"\u00a0she said. The school board meeting notes, which CBS also reviewed, include mention of her resignation. Conservatives have latched on to the changes in her account as yet another example of a \"made up\" story,\u00a0along with the now infamous\u00a0claim\u00a0to Native American ancestry. \"What you have here is a pattern of someone who's been successful\u2014and by the way she has been successful, she's a U.S. senator\u2014but rather than say, 'I've been successful,' she has claimed repeatedly to be the victim of discrimination,\" said Fox News' Tucker Carlson. But many women have come forward with their stories of pregnancy and gender discrimination to show that they believe Warren. \"I think of how this resonates with so many millions of women across this country and people who have been in, if not that exact\u00a0situation, similar situations,\" Warren told CBS. Warren has recently gained ground on 2020 rival former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, putting her in the lead in poll averages for the first time.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday. Trump \u2013 who has\u00a0a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58%\u00a0\u2013\u00a0trails\u00a0by\u00a0sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%);\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%);\u00a0South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%). Each of those Democratic candidates\u00a0performed\u00a0well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and\u00a0all of them expanded\u00a0those leads in this week's survey. Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is\u00a0not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances. Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that \"the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020\" won't start coming out until after the holiday season. 'I have the real polls':Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment \"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states,\" Johnson said. \"But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points.\" MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there\u00a0\"literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national\u00a0more than a year out from the election.\" \"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident,\" he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College. A recent poll\u00a0from\u00a0The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading\u00a0Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona. More:Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds According to the Post-ABC poll,\u00a0most Americans share\u00a0negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say\u00a0they don't think the president is\u00a0\"honest and trustworthy,\" 62% say\u00a0he lacks\u00a0presidential\u00a0temperament, 60% say\u00a0he does\u00a0not understand their problems, 55% say\u00a0he is not good at making political deals and 54% say\u00a0he is\u00a0not a strong leader. Fifty-four percent say the United States is\u00a0less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses\u00a0the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable. Forty-nine percent favor\u00a0impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill\u00a0Clinton's impeachment at 27% to\u00a041% in 1998. Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure\u00a0Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U.S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did\u00a0something wrong\u00a0\u2013 though 8% say they don't\u00a0think it was a serious matter. Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want\u00a0to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and\u00a030% say\u00a0they would prefer someone else. The 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and\u00a0Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When asked who has\u00a0the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say\u00a0Biden, 17% say\u00a0Warren and 16% say\u00a0Sanders.

      "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been in a feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and now she's using his own platform against him with a new ad\u00a0calling out the Facebook policy against fact-checking politicians. \"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" the ad begins. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?'\" it continues. \"Well it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\" Warren is referring\u00a0to a Facebook advertising policy that allows for politicians to present false or misleading information in ads due to the belief that any statement from a political figure is important to the public interest. Facebook ads, in general, are subject to a third-party fact-checking system. Ads with claims debunked by the fact-checkers are prohibited. Facebook says that ads are reviewed prior to being made public. Politicians, however, are exempt from that fact-checking program. A senior Facebook official explained that policy in a speech last month. \"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said. \"We don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\" Clegg added. Rather, Facebook \"demotes\" politician-generated ad content that has previously been determined false. The politician advertising policy has\u00a0come under recent scrutiny because of a Trump campaign ad featuring claims about former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine that is not supported\u00a0with credible\u00a0evidence. The Biden campaign requested that Facebook and other sites remove that ad due to misinformation, but Facebook refused, citing its policy. \"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" Trump's ad claimed. In fact, the prosecutor in question was considered by the United States and\u00a0international\u00a0groups to be ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0There is no credible evidence\u00a0for the assertion that the ouster of the prosecutor was intended to benefit Hunter Biden. More:CNN says it won't air a Trump campaign ad featuring 'false' claim against Biden Warren said in her ad, \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\" CNN and NBCUniversal both refused to air Trump's ad targeting Biden with the Ukraine claims. The Trump campaign spent more than $1 million on Facebook\u00a0ads in one week in September\u00a0to beat back the impeachment inquiry, ABC News reports.\u00a0The ads come as House Democrats push their impeachment inquiry over whether the president pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. Warren's ad is the latest in her battle with big tech companies over her plan to promote competition in the tech industry and roll back tech company mergers, such as Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp. In leaked audio published by\u00a0The Verge, Zuckerberg said\u00a0\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" Warren replied in a\u00a0series of\u00a0tweets, saying she is \"not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\" More:Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech \"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Warren tweeted\u00a0Saturday about her new Facebook ad. \"If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN in a statement.

The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen.

Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan. Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the\u00a0Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election. The Times said the results of the poll \"suggest that the president\u2019s\u00a0advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole\u00a0remains intact or has even grown\u00a0since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could \u2013 for the third time in the past six elections \u2013 win the presidency while losing the popular vote.\" And The Times\u00a0said the results showed \"little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward\u00a0winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016.\" Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher.

Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary:Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren:Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency:Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

      "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden dodged some of the piling on from other 2020 candidates he has seen in previous Democratic debates, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here. Tell us how you're going to do what you say you're going to do\" More:Elizabeth Warren is a new front-runner in town. Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

But you will be able to find this new all-caps \"Facebook\" logo on its other products such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. The social networking giant announced the new company brand in an online post Monday. \"We\u2019re updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook,\" the company's post says. \"We\u2019re introducing a new company logo and further distinguishing the Facebook company from the Facebook app, which will keep its own branding.\" If you want to go deep into the company's design choices, Facebook has an entire page devoted to the explanation. There you can gain insights on how the \"new brand system uses custom typography, rounded corners, open tracking and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and the app.\" Facebook's Portal TV:New product delivers video chat at its best. Too bad it's from Facebook Here comes Google:Is Fitbit selling us out with sale to search engine giant? The logo can also be scrunched into an \"FB\" in small places. \"FB is already associated with Facebook, is the company\u2019s stock ticker symbol and is used in domains and employee email addresses,\" the reasoning goes. And the decision to have a multicolored logo allows it \"to be responsive to its context and environment. This system allows the wordmark to take on the color of our individual brands, creating a clearer relationship between the company and the products we build.\" Beyond that, it addresses the multicultural audience Facebook has, the company says. \"The brand comes to life in the context of people, cultures, communities and relationships. The art direction is designed to capture the emotional connections between people and express a sense of potential when they can come together.\" OK, but for many folks this announcement was much ado about nothing. \"Someone spent millions on that,\" tweeted Edward Hardy, a political commentator and host of\u00a0The Hardy Report podcast. And quite a few had some fun with\u00a0the all-caps aspect, noting that an aging audience on Facebook often communicates in all caps, anyway. And others saw the rebranding \u2013 or new umbrella branding \u2013 as a way to deflect attention from some of Facebook's ongoing issues including need for improved protections of consumer privacy and concerns about\u00a0its planned cryptocurrency. \"Facebook announced that it's rebranding, with a new logo that's in all caps. Because that was everyone's biggest complaint with Facebook - the logo,\" tweeted\u00a0\"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon\" account. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0took it a bit more serious noting that the move won't make those concerns go away. \"Facebook can rebrand all they want but they can't hid the fact that they are too big and powerful,\" she tweeted. But some just took the Facebook move an opportunity to draw attention to a good cause, such as finding homes for rescued dogs. Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The fourth round of the Democratic primary debates saw a record 12 candidates battling it out over top issues, while\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is underway. The focus shifted from former Vice President Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility. Here are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate: As expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. When asked about his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected. Foreign business deals:Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter)\u00a0made.\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct. Ukraine explainer:Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases This debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support\u00a0with varying levels of enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to\u00a0determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him\u00a0how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election\u00a0makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives\u00a0while pursuing impeachment:\u00a0\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\" Sen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d Warren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was\u00a0Warren's turn to take some hits. Warren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer. Costs will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\" \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan. Polls:Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls More data:Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio Klobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump. \"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan. \u201cI\u00a0appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan.\u00a0\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d According to CNN's tracker, Warren\u00a0had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes. At the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate. O'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a\u00a0\u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support. More on\u00a0buyback debate:Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d Calling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said,\u00a0\"I\u00a0don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been\u00a0lost to gun violence. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d In a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election. \"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is\u00a0\u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable. Candidates' ages:4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like. Sanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage. Biden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said. Warren, 70, said she'd\u00a0\"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. On the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37.\u00a0She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important. After a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate. \"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said. Later in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department\u00a0review before states passed anti-abortion laws. Klobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate:Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More:Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September. Warren is the choice of 50% of Democratic voters\u00a0and independents who lean Democratic\u00a0who identify as \"very liberal\"\u00a0in the poll from Quinnipiac. Sanders and Biden are tied at 14% within that group. Among those who call themselves \"somewhat liberal,\" Warren finishes\u00a0first at 34%, Sanders comes in at 17% and Biden at 15%. Biden is\u00a0the clear favorite among those who identify\u00a0as conservative Democrats at 36%;\u00a0Warren comes in second at 19%, and Sanders is third at 6%.

But Democratic voters indicate\u00a0defeating President Donald Trump in the general election is their top priority, and about half of Democratic voters see Biden as the candidate best equipped to pull that off. Forty-eight percent say Biden has\u00a0the best chance of defeating Trump, and 21% see\u00a0Warren as the candidate with the best shot. While Biden has hovered at 42% to\u00a056% in Quinnipiac polls on this question, Warren had never finished higher than 9% in previous surveys from the pollster. More:Elizabeth Warren leads\u00a0Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primary polls When asked which Democratic candidate they think would be the best leader, 32% say\u00a0Biden and 28% say\u00a0Warren. On the question of impeachment, 46% say\u00a0Trump should be removed from office, and\u00a048% oppose\u00a0such a move. A\u00a0narrow majority of 51% approve\u00a0of the Democrat-controlled House's move to open an impeachment inquiry, and 59% say\u00a0they disapprove\u00a0of the way Trump has responded to the inquiry. Fifty-one percent say the impeachment is a \"legitimate\" investigation, and\u00a043% say\u00a0it is a \"political witch hunt.\" Though 66% say it is \"not acceptable\" for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump encouraged\u00a0Ukraine to look at\u00a0Biden, only 44% say\u00a0that is a good enough reason to remove a president from office. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Oct. 11-13 among 1,195 registered voters. It has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

      "content": "Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren. National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest \u2013 that would be the rivals competing for the nomination \u2013 were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates. Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed \u201cwealth tax\u201d could fly. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren declared.\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed\u00a0\u201creality check\u201d on Warren. \u201cI'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. \"I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\" Winners and losers:Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense The debate didn\u2019t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else\u00a0\u2013 Klobuchar,\u00a0South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left.\u00a0During the debate, he teased that he would have a \"special guest\" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday.\u00a0That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party\u2019s most influential young liberal voices. All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family\u2019s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through\u00a0\u2013 in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher. And when the debate was over? The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. \"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware. That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Sanders fired back at Biden, too. \"I say this as a friend,\" he said, \"but you got the Iraq war done.\" Biden vs. Warren:Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.\u00a0Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her\u00a0time to respond to attacks.\u00a0In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2. Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.",
