      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday criticized President Donald Trump's \"go back\" tweets about\u00a0four Democratic congresswomen of color, saying that the president's tweets contradict \"the strength of America.\" \u201cPeople of very different nationalities have contributed to the strength of the American people, so these are \u2026 comments that very much run counter to this firm impression that I have,\u201d Merkel said during an annual news conference in Berlin. \u201cThis is something that contradicts the strength of America.\u201d \"I\u00a0distance myself firmly from this and feel solidarity with the women who were attacked,\" she continued. Merkel is the second western leader in a day to speak out about the controversy sparked by Trump's remarks this week.\u00a0On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the \"send her back\" chants that broke out at a Trump rally\u00a0\"completely unacceptable.\" More:Trudeau slams 'send her back' chant at Trump rally Throughout the week Trump\u00a0has repeatedly blasted Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0\u00a0Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The four lawmakers, who have become\u00a0colloquially known as \"The Squad,\" are all American citizens. Omar immigrated from Somalia to the United States and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. The other three congresswomen were born in the U.S. Since then, the four congresswomen have\u00a0come out against Trump's remarks, calling them \"racist.\" The House on Tuesday formally voted to condemn Trump's tweets as racist. During a Wednesday night rally, chants of \"send her back\" broke out as Trump criticized Omar. The president went on to slam the other three members of The Squad.\u00a0 The chanting has been criticized by Democrats and some Republicans. More:What we know about the 'send her back' chants that erupted at Trump's North Carolina rally More:Trump employs familiar tactic in attacks on 'Squad': Distract and shift spotlight using racial rhetoric More:Supporters chant 'Welcome home, Ilhan' as Rep. Ilhan Omar receives thunderous Minnesota welcome Trump had initially\u00a0distanced himself from the chant at his North Carolina rally on Thursday. But Friday after Merkel's remarks, Trump continued to attack The Squad, in particular, Omar. When asked about being unhappy about the chant, Trump said: \"No, you know what I\u2019m unhappy with? The fact that a congresswoman can hate our country.\" The president\u00a0and Merkel have had a tense relationship throughout Trump's tenure as president. Most recently, at Wednesday's rally Triump also referenced Merkel during his speech, saying that he had to badger her into paying her country's bills. The president has frequently complained about the amount of defense costs in Europe that the U.S. is shouldering, especially\u00a0in regard\u00a0to NATO. \u201cThere was a recent poll \u2014 Germany likes Obama better than Trump. A lot better. I said of course, because I\u2019m making them pay their bills,\" Trump said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saying you got to pay. I say, \u2018Angela, Angela, you\u2019ve got to pay, Angela!\u2019 Obama would go in, make a speech, leave. \"I go in, make a speech, I say, \u2018Let me speak to Angela. Angela you\u2019ve got to pay your bills, you\u2019re way behind,\" he concluded. Contributing: Associated Press Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 A movie poster mockup depicting Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib as \"The Jihad Squad\" was shared on the Facebook page for a group of state Republican leaders last week before being taken down days later. The meme shared by the Illinois Republican County Chairman's Association depicts Omar with pursed lips and a shotgun, while\u00a0Pressley is seen pointing a pistol with a grin. Tlaib is shown screaming in anger\u00a0and Ocasio-Cortez is at\u00a0center in a slinky red dress that tapers down to a ball of flames. \"Political Jihad is their game. If you don't agree with their socialist ideology, you're racist,\" reads the satirical tagline about the four congresswomen, who are often\u00a0referred \"the Squad.\" The poster includes an image of the group's logo with its url beneath. The image is modified from the poster for the 2013 film \"Gangster Squad.\" Chicago Tribune reporter Rick Pearson shared the image on Twitter on Sunday afternoon. Hours later, the group's president, Mark Shaw, said it had been removed. \"A couple of days ago, an image which was not authorized by me was posted on the Facebook page of the Illinois Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association (\u201cRCCA\u201d). I condemn this unauthorized posting and it has been deleted. I am sorry if anyone who saw the image was offended by the contents,\"\u00a0Shaw said in a statement. Shaw called the \"unauthorized\" post an \"unfortunate distraction from the serious debate surrounding the policies advocated by these four socialist members of the United States House of Representatives.\" \"Republican opposition to their proposed 'Green New Deal', elimination of all private health insurance, open borders and anti-Semitic posturing has nothing to do with these Representative\u2019s races or religion,\" he said. Shaw said his group was conducting an internal review of its approval process for social media posts to make sure \"that any content posted in the future represents the 'big-tent'\u00a0nature of the Republican Party.\" From 'Central Park Five' to 'the Squad':A dozen times Donald Trump has stoked racial tensions Fox News host Chris Wallace:'No question' Trump is 'stoking racial divisions' Tim Schneider, the chairman of the Illinois Republican Party said in a statement that he condemns \"evoking race or religion as the basis for political disagreement.\" \"Bigoted rhetoric greatly distracts from legitimate and important policy debates and further divides our nation,\" Schneider said.\u00a0\"My intense disagreement with the socialist policies and anti-semitic language of these four congresswomen has absolutely nothing to do with their race or religion.\" Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib have been the target of verbal and Twitter attacks from President Donald Trump in the past week. His tweets telling the four women \u2013 all of them U.S. citizens and three of them born in the USA\u00a0\u2013 to \"go back\" and fix their countries of origin before legislating in the U.S. led to a House resolution condemning the remarks\u00a0as racist. And his rhetoric was seen as spurring a crowd to chant \"send her back\" when he tore into Omar at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday. Michigan's Tlaib and Minnesota's Omar are the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress. Ocasio-Cortez of New York is the youngest women ever elected Congress and a self-described democratic socialist. Pressley is the first African-American woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts. Trump has denied his rhetoric intentionally played into old racist tropes about sending non-white Americans \"back where they came from.\" He said he meant that, based on their criticisms, they \"hate our country\" and \"If they don\u2019t like it, let them leave.\" As evidence of their lack of patriotism, Trump and other administration officials\u00a0\u2013 including Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0\u2013 have\u00a0pointed to comments from Omar that were condemned as anti-Semitic and Ocasio-Cortez's comparison of migrant detention facilities to concentration camps. But they have also falsely attributed other comments to the congresswomen or taken remarks out of context. Critics have also pointed out dissent is a normal part of political debate, that their criticism is about policy rather than country, and that Trump himself made similarly critical remarks about the U.S. during the Obama administration.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a clear message for fellow Democrats Wednesday morning after party infighting with some of Congress' most popular new members, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spilled into public view and on Twitter. At their weekly\u00a0breakfast, Pelosi told members of the Democratic caucus that they\u00a0were a family and\u00a0have to stick together, while also suggesting\u00a0they\u00a0keep their differences private. \"You got a complaint?\u00a0You come and talk to me about it,\" Pelosi told the group, according to a source in the room. \"But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK.\" Pelosi's comments came in the aftermath of bitter party in-fighting with some of the most outspoken progressive members of her caucus: Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.;\u00a0Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Pelosi's quarrel with the four new freshman members, who each boast large followings on social media,\u00a0reached a boiling point last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running\u00a0migrant detention centers. 'Children come first':House passes $4.6 billion in aid for migrants at border after Pelosi caves to Republicans More:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib fire back at Nancy Pelosi's 'Twitter world' quip The feud went public, with Pelosi dismissing the four lawmakers\u00a0in an interview with the New York Times and criticizing them for being the only members to vote against the original version of the spending bill. \"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\" Pelosi\u00a0said, according to Maureen Dowd's column in the Times. \"But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\" The lawmakers quickly shot back.\u00a0\"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. \"And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\" In her speech during the weekly morning breakfast on Wednesday, Pelosi seemed to call for peace. She said the fighting was playing \"into the hands\" of Republicans who want to see divisions.

She added,\u00a0\"I hope there will be some level of respect and sensitivity for our \u2013 each individual experience that we bring to this caucus.\" She highlighted that the majority of members voted for the border aid bill late last month, sending $4.6 billion to facilities along the southern border. She said it was fine that she was the target of scrutiny after the House reluctantly passed a Senate version of the bill instead of pushing even further for added restrictions that Democrats said would mandate\u00a0better care for migrants and children housed in the facilities. The House version of the funding bill with the restrictions was rejected by\u00a0the Republican-led Senate. \"I take responsibility,\" Pelosi said, according to the source.\u00a0\"You make me the target, but don\u2019t make our Blue Dogs and our new Dems the target in all of this because we have important fish to fry.\" Contributing: William Cummings",

      "content": " President Donald Trump has been on a days-long Twitter tirade about\u00a0four freshman congresswomen of color called the \"Squad.\" And while Trump's a fan of nicknames, he didn't come up with this one. Instead, the congresswomen gave it to themselves. The nickname refers to Democratic\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.\u00a0It started with a November Instagram post by then-representative-elect Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 a photo of the four congresswomen seated together, captioned \"Squad.\" \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Oh you should do a hashtag or something #squadgoals\u2019 and then it morphed into this\u00a0thing,\u201d Pressley told CBS\u00a0in an interview last week. The 'Squad':The four congresswomen Trump told to 'go back' to other countries It's not just 'Rocket Man':Trump has long history of nicknaming his foes What started as a simple photo caption has grown\u00a0into a broader talking point for the four\u00a0congresswomen. On\u00a0Monday at the national NAACP convention in Detroit, Tlaib said that the \"Squad\" is \"beyond just the four\u00a0of us\" and that \"we need bold action.\" \"I can tell you, you are all the squad, trust me. If you support equity, you support justice, you are one of us,\" she said.\u00a0\"The Squad is all of you.\" It's even an 82-year-old man from New Jersey, as it turns out. Last week, Rep. Bill Pascrell asked to be part of the \"Squad\" by\u00a0responding\u00a0to a tweet from satirical news site The Onion, which\u00a0posted an article entitled \"82-Year-Old New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell Quietly Asks Ilhan Omar If He Can Be Part Of The Squad.\" Ocasio-Cortez gladly welcomed the congressman via Twitter. Referring to your friends as a \"squad\" or \"#squadgoals\" is common on social media.\u00a0It's typically used as an aspirational term to highlight something you and your friends want to accomplish. Rapper Waka Flocka Flame has claimed ownership of the term \"squad,\" which he and rapper Gucci Mane have been including in their lyrics since the\u00a0founding of their record label in 2007, according to Slate. The hashtag began to gain traction on social media in 2015, when Taylor Swift popularized the slogan during her world tour that year. Tlaib:'I'm not going nowhere, not until I impeach' Trump Poll:Many Americans have never heard of the 'the Squad' Waka Flocka Flame tweeted on the subject in 2015, when some began attributing the popularization of the term to Swift. Regardless of its origins,\u00a0squad goals no longer just applies to Instagram. It's \u00a0become tied to\u00a0 perhaps the four most visible freshman congresswomen in America.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group. The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as\u00a0McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about\u00a0his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border. He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and\u00a0the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to\u00a0Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report,\u00a0McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the \"disturbing\" and \"inexcusable\" posts. \"Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?\" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked\u00a0McAleenan. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.\" \"Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped\u00a0images of my violent rape?\" Ocasio-Cortez continued. \"Yes I did,\"\u00a0McAleenan responded. 'A kennel for dogs':\u00a0Lawmakers hammer acting DHS chief Kevin McAleenan over migrant detention facilities McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents\u00a0were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media\u00a0questioned whether they were still \"responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.\" He said several agents\u00a0have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying \"I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to\u00a0dozens of\u00a0more.\" McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a \"dehumanizing culture\" within Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0\"We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,\" he said touting that the agency, \"rescues 4,000 people a year\" and is \"committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.\" He said the posts were \"unacceptable\" but \"I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.\" The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all\u00a0women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies. It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should \"go back\" to where they came from. The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which\u00a0he\u00a0doubled down on\u00a0at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week. He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting \"send her back\" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from\u00a0Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, \"I disagree with it\" and \"I wasn't happy with that message.\"",

      "content": " Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren. National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest \u2013 that would be the rivals competing for the nomination \u2013 were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates. Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed \u201cwealth tax\u201d could fly. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren declared.\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed\u00a0\u201creality check\u201d on Warren. \u201cI'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. \"I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\" Winners and losers:Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense The debate didn\u2019t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else\u00a0\u2013 Klobuchar,\u00a0South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left.\u00a0During the debate, he teased that he would have a \"special guest\" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday.\u00a0That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party\u2019s most influential young liberal voices. All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family\u2019s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through\u00a0\u2013 in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher. And when the debate was over? The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. \"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware. That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Sanders fired back at Biden, too. \"I say this as a friend,\" he said, \"but you got the Iraq war done.\" Biden vs. Warren:Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.\u00a0Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her\u00a0time to respond to attacks.\u00a0In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2. Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0said Thursday that Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0does not need to apologize to\u00a0Joe Biden after the New Jersey Senator criticized the former vice president's controversial comments about working with segregationist senators during his early years on Capitol Hill. Booker on Wednesday had asked Biden to apologize for praising his work with former Democratic Sens.\u00a0James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia during a fundraiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York, both of who fought against the civil rights movement and opposed the racial integration of schools. Biden, however, said that Booker \"knows better\" and should be the one to apologize. The former vice president added that he doesn't \"have a racist bone on my body.\" Ocasio-Cortez, who has been critical of Biden, weighed in on the debate on Thursday. \"For the record, Cory Booker does *not* owe Joe Biden an apology for pointing out that waxing nostalgic about working with segregationists is insensitive,\" she tweeted. \"'He knows better?'\u00a0Really? What is 'better?' To stay quiet about it?\" she wrote. More:Biden: Booker should apologize after criticism of my comments on segregationists 'He is out of step':Backlash after Biden talks 'civility' with segregationist senators Booker campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh confirmed Booker and Biden spoke Wednesday night after the New Jersey Democrat appeared on CNN. \u201cCory shared directly what he said publicly \u2014 including helping VP Biden understand why the word 'boy' is painful to so many,\u201d\u00a0Singh said. \u201cCory believes that Vice President Biden should take responsibility for what he said and apologize to those who were hurt.\" The Biden campaign confirmed in an email that two candidates spoke. Ocasio-Cortez also warned that voter turnout in the 2020 election could be harmed by Biden's comments. Many of the Democratic wins in the 2018 midterms were driving by black voters, particularly black women, according to analysis from the NAACP. \"For folks saying we should gloss over this, I think it\u2019s important to realize that we can\u2019t risk depressed turnout in 2020,\" she wrote in a second tweet. \"The original remark is valid to ask about & have a discussion on or clarify - not dismiss. We should be compassionate toward each other, but not silent,\" she continued. Biden's comments defending his stance on civil rights\u00a0came\u00a0on Wednesday, which was Juneteenth\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a day marked in many states and by African Americans across the country\u00a0commemorating June 19, 1865, when blacks in Galveston, Texas, learned they were no longer slaves, almost two years after President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation. A number of top lawmakers that are part of the Congressional Black Caucus have defended Biden, Politico\u00a0reported. Ocasio-Cortez has previously criticized Biden for his \"middle-of-the-road approach\" on climate change, for his previous support of the Hyde Amendment, and believes that only a true progressive candidate could beat Trump. Biden has repeatedly touted as being moderate and working with both sides of the aisle, while maintaining that he is progressive. Despite her criticisms, Ocasio-Cortez has said she would support Biden if he was the nominee during an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" She added that she still thinks the candidate that is picked as the Democratic nominee is \"going to be exciting to vote for, that all people, women, people of all genders, races, income levels, geographies feel excited and good about voting for.\" \"I think that it is absolutely important that we defeat Donald Trump,\" she said.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump urged House Republicans on Tuesday to oppose a resolution condemning him over racist tweets against\u00a0four House congresswomen. \"The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game,\" Trump tweeted. \"Republicans should not show 'weakness'\u00a0and fall into their trap.\" Trump's latest tweets came as\u00a0House Democrats were preparing a vote on a resolution that would condemn the president's\u00a0comments about four progressive lawmakers, all of whom are women of color. Trump on Sunday suggested that the lawmakers \"go back\" to the countries\u00a0they \"originally came from\" instead of telling Americans \"how our government is to be run.\" The four House members, all critics of Trump, are\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. All four are U.S. citizens. Several Republican lawmakers have distanced themselves from Trump's tweets, though in a news conference on Tuesday House GOP leaders stopped short of criticizing president's comments and instead criticized the Democrat congresswomen. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, wrote on Twitter that Trump's comments were \"racist and he should apologize. We must work as a country to rise above hate, not enable it.\" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said Trump and the party should work to defeat Democrats on the merits of their ideas, not on their ancestry. \u201cPresident Trump was wrong to suggest that four left-wing congresswomen should go back to where they came from,\" Toomey said in a statement. \"Three of the four were born in America and the citizenship of all four is as valid as mine.\" More:Pence aide defends Trump's 'go back' tweets by citing Elaine Chao's presence in Trump administration However, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the top Republican in the House, told reporters\u00a0he does not believe Trump's tweets were racist, adding that \"I believe this is about ideology. This is about socialism versus freedom.\" Protesting the\u00a0House resolution during a Tuesday Twitter storm, Trump insisted his Sunday tweets \"were NOT Racist.

      "subtitle": "NBA postpones media sessions in Shanghai amid China rift",
      "author": "",
      "content": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday that the league is still expecting them to play as scheduled this week, even while the rift between the league and Chinese officials continued in ways that clearly suggested the two planned games in Shanghai and Shenzhen were anything but guaranteed. The NBA called off scheduled media sessions Wednesday for both teams. At least two other NBA events to be held Wednesday before the start of the China games were canceled as part of the fallout that started after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a since-deleted tweet last week that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. \"Given the fluidity of the situation, today's media availability has been postponed,\" the league said. The sessions were not rescheduled Wednesday, though having them on Thursday \u2014 game day in Shanghai \u2014 remains possible. Later Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers \u2014 including the rare alignment of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 sent a letter to Silver saying the NBA should show the \"courage and integrity\" to stand up to the Chinese government. They asked the NBA to, among other things, suspend activities in China until what they called the selective treatment against the Rockets ends. \"You have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government's targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it,\" the lawmakers told Silver. The NBA did not have any immediate comment on the letter, and it was unclear if Silver had even seen the document. In Shanghai, the mood surrounding the game that \u2014 if played \u2014 will feature LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and other big NBA names was anything but festive. An NBA Cares event that was to benefit the Special Olympics was called off, as was a \"fan night\" celebration that was to be highlighted by the league announcing plans to refurbish some outdoor courts in that city. And workers in multiple spots around Shanghai were tearing down large outdoor promotional advertisements for Thursday's Lakers-Nets game. The teams are also supposed to play Saturday in Shenzhen. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has joined the list of companies that have suspended ties with the NBA for now, only adding to the uncertainty surrounding the China games. Vivo was a presenting sponsor of the games, and on Wednesday there was no reference to the game in Shanghai on the list of upcoming events scheduled at Mercedes-Benz Arena. Other firms such as apparel company Li-Ning announced similar moves earlier this week, as the rift was just beginning. Silver said Tuesday in Tokyo that he supports Morey's right to free speech. Several Chinese companies have suspended their partnership with the NBA in recent days, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it will not broadcast the Lakers-Nets games. \"I'm sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset,\" Silver said. \"I don't think it's inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\" All around China, stores that sell NBA merchandise were removing Rockets-related apparel from shelves and many murals featuring the Rockets \u2014 even ones with Yao Ming, the Chinese great who played for Houston during his NBA career \u2014 were being painted over. Effects are already being felt in NBA arenas, in a pair of games featuring Guangzhou Loong Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association. After the playing of the Chinese national anthem in Washington on Wednesday before Guangzhou's game against the Wizards, one fan shouted, \"Freedom of expression! Freedom of speech! Free Hong Kong!\" Another fan shouted for a free Hong Kong from the second level during the second quarter. Minutes later, security approached one fan holding up a \"Free Tibet\" sign and another holding the Tibet flag. Security tried to take the sign, and the fan refused to give it up. Security then escorted them out of the seats. A similar scene played out in Philadelphia on Tuesday, also during a Guangzhou game. There, two fans were removed by arena security for holding signs and chanting in support of Hong Kong. The signs read \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Free HK.\" The sentiment was not different from Morey's since-deleted tweet last week of an image that read, \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\" The 76ers and Wells Fargo Center, the team's home arena, released statements Wednesday confirming that the fan removal took place and explaining why. \"During the second quarter of last night's 76ers game, Wells Fargo Center security responded to a situation that was disrupting the live event experience for our guests,\" the arena's statement Wednesday said. \"After three separate warnings, the two individuals were escorted out of the arena without incident. The security team employed respectful and standard operating procedures.\" The NBA is not the first major corporation to deal with criticism from China over political differences. Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara and others also have found themselves in conflicts with China in recent years. After Morey's tweet was deleted, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the organization. Joe Tsai, who recently completed his purchase of the Nets and is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has said the damage to the NBA's relationship with China \"will take a long time to repair.\" ___ Reynolds reported from Miami.

      "content": " They're young, charismatic and, as some of the most liberal members of Congress, have\u00a0drawn President Donald Trump's scorn and rankled party leadership on both sides of the aisle. Most recently, the four freshmen minority congresswomen\u00a0were seemingly the targets of a Twitter rant by Trump. \"Why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how\u00a0it is done,\" he tweeted. They are \"the Squad.\" Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., have collectively come to be known by that label since taking office in January. The four have found common cause on a number of issues, most recently by becoming the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill that was backed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That act of rebellion prompted Pelosi to dismiss them as four people with a following in \"their Twitter world\" but no following on Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez responded by telling The Washington Post that she thought Pelosi was \"singling out newly elected women of color.\" Trump weighed in on the Democratic infighting and defended Pelosi, saying, \"For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.\" And Sunday, Trump sparked outrage by appearing to tell the congresswomen\u00a0\u2013 three of whom were born in the U.S.\u00a0\u2013 to \"go back\" and fix the countries they \"originally came from\" before trying to make changes in the U.S. So who are the four congresswomen who make up \"the Squad?\" 'This is what racism looks like':Congresswomen react to Trump's 'go back' tweetstorm A self-described democratic socialist, Ocasio-Cortez won a major upset in New York's Democratic primary last year by unseating veteran\u00a0Rep. Joe Crowley. And at age 29, she became the\u00a0youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She was born in the Bronx to a father from the same\u00a0New York City borough and a\u00a0mother from Puerto Rico. She was working in a restaurant before she became a congresswoman and fighting for better pay for people in similar occupations has been a major part of her political platform. Sometimes referred to by her initials AOC, which also happens to be her Twitter handle, Ocasio-Cortez has earned a reputation as one of the\u00a0most active\u00a0users of social media in\u00a0Congress. She is perhaps best known as one of the sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution, which called for the U.S. to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions along with other goals meant to mitigate the effects of climate change. AOC to Republicans:Stop fixating on Green New Deal and read it 'Broken' and 'horrifying':AOC, Joaquin Castro, lawmakers visit Texas border facilities Omar was born in Somalia. Her family fled that country's civil war when she was 8 years old and spent four\u00a0years in a refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in the U.S. and settling in\u00a0Minneapolis in 1997, according to\u00a0her biography. Omar, 36, has sparked anger with her rhetoric criticizing the Trump administration and U.S. foreign policy since taking office. And she caused an uproar with her criticism of\u00a0Israel and the influence of the pro-Israeli lobby, which many said played into anti-Semitic tropes. She and Tlaib were the first Muslim women elected to Congress and some critics have tried to use anti-Islamic rhetoric to paint her as dangerous or to\u00a0tie her to Islamic extremists. Last week, Fox News host Tucker Carlson called Omar \"living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country.\" \"I believe as an immigrant, I probably love this country more than anyone that is naturally born,\"\u00a0Omar said while speaking at a Netroots Nation event Saturday. Who is Rep. Ilhan Omar?:The Muslim lawmaker Donald Trump loves to attack More:New York man accused of threatening Rep. Ilhan Omar remains behind bars Pressley, 45,\u00a0is the first African American woman to be elected to the Congress from Massachusetts. Like Ocasio-Cortez, she pulled off a major political upset in the Democratic primary last year, unseating 10-term Rep. Michael Capuano. According to the biography on her congressional webpage,\u00a0she was born in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago\u00a0by her mother, a community organizer. Her father struggled with addiction and was in and out of jail before going on to become an author. Pressley is a survivor of sexual assault who has openly discussed abuse she suffered as a child and being raped by an acquaintance in college. Her biography says, \"She believes that the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power and that a diversity of voices in the political process is essential to making policies that benefit more Americans.\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley to Kellyanne Conway:'Keep my name out of your lying mouth' Tlaib, 42, is the oldest of 14 children born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrant parents. Her father, who was born near Jerusalem, worked on the assembly line at the Ford Motor Co. plant. She stirred up controversy quickly after her arrival in Washington, using\u00a0an expletive and vowing\u00a0\"we're gonna impeach\" Trump on the night she was sworn in. And since taking office, she has been a leading advocate for the president's impeachment. Some right-wing critics have tried to use\u00a0Tlaib's religion against her, painting her as un-American or a danger to the country. And, like Omar, she has been accused of anti-Semitism for her criticisms of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. Trump:President slams Rep. Rashida Tlaib for Holocaust comments More:Six things about Rashida Tlaib, one of the first Muslim woman in Congress The four congressmen have embraced the Squad moniker\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a term derived from hip-hop origins and later appropriated by Taylor Swift and the ever-shifting circle of celebrities around her to refer to a tight-knit group of people with common goals. On Sunday, Pressley tweeted that the Squad is about more than herself and three other congresswomen, but rather represents all those who embrace their progressive ideals. Contributing: Erin Kelly",

Many demanded the resignation of Times editors while pledging to unsubscribe from the paper and calling for others to do the same. Some have criticized the hashtag, arguing\u00a0The Times buckled too easily by changing the headline under liberal pressure.

But the Democratic representative from Queens dwarfed the Democrats who are actually seeking President Donald Trump\u2019s job in a measurement of social media interactions with news articles by the tracking firm NewsWhip. The statistics were first reported by Axios. For the week that ended on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, had attracted 4.8 million such interactions, NewsWhip said. By comparison, all of the Democrats running for president reached a combined 6.5 million. California Sen. Kamala Harris had 1.2 million to lead the way, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren getting around a million each. Race for 2020:Kamala Harris took money from law firm that represented Epstein on same day she blasted it Given how Trump\u2019s tweets about Ocasio-Cortez and three of her colleagues have dominated the news since they were first made Sunday, that picture doesn\u2019t appear likely to change much this week. \u201cThey can\u2019t get a breath because all of the oxygen is gone,\u201d said Fox News Channel\u2019s Harris Faulkner on Wednesday. That would be a bigger concern if it wasn\u2019t mid-July, squarely in the middle of vacation season and 16 months before the presidential election. But since it\u2019s generally considered a goal of Trump supporters to have the liberal Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of Democrats, that indicates they are having some success.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Sixteen\u00a0protesters from the climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion glued themselves to underground shuttle entrances in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, resulting in the arrests of at least three. Using Gorilla Glue, the protesters affixed themselves to doorways in front of the subway entrances leading from the Cannon and Rayburn House office buildings to the Capitol, hoping to address congresspeople on their way to a\u00a0House vote at 6:30 p.m.\u00a0The protesters managed to remain until around 8 p.m. when U.S. Capitol Police began to remove and arrest them. Earlier this month, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., along with\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0introduced a resolution declaring a \"climate emergency\" and demanding a broad mobilization of resources to prepare for the impact of climate change. Extinction Rebellion protesters want to make sure that resolution passes. \u201cPart of the protest is to force the U.S. to consider following in the U.K.\u2019s footsteps of declaring a climate emergency,\u201d said Kaela Bamberger, a media representative for Extinction Rebellion. \u201cPart of the point in using civil disobedience is creating this situation where we disrupt business as usual for congresspeople and put pressure on Congress to demand a climate emergency and to see that resolution through the legislature.\u201d That resolution is latest measure to be introduced by Ocasio-Cortez. Earlier this year the New York Democrat unveiled\u00a0the Green New Deal, which a number of high-profile\u00a0Democrats\u00a0\u2014 many of whom are running for president\u00a0\u2014 have endorsed. In April, members of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s U.K. division blocked the Waterloo Bridge for more than a week, also\u00a0gluing themselves to buildings and climbing on top of trains. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, met with the protesters and promised to consider a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate change. Additionally, on May 1, in accordance with one of their demands, U.K. Parliament members declared a climate and environment emergency, becoming the first national legislature to do so. Heather Berube, age 34, who is a member of the Toxics Action Center in Maine, was one of the protesters who got arrested after gluing themselves to the Rayburn entrance. She took a bus to D.C. specifically to put pressure on lawmakers.

Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,\u00a0encouraged the Rayburn protesters after encountering them by the entrance. \u201cWhat\u2019s the word?\u201d she asked them, to which they shouted \u201cclimate change\u201d in unison. \u201cSay it louder,\u201d she said \u2014 which they did \u2014 then offered them a shout of encouragement before walking off.

      "content": " CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas \u2013 Immigration authorities released an 18-year-old American citizen late Tuesday who had been kept in federal custody for nearly a month after he and his brother were detained at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint while en route from their home in South Texas to a soccer camp west of Fort Worth. The release came well after his\u00a0lawyer\u00a0presented federal authorities with the birth certificate that proves his U.S. citizenship,\u00a0The Associated Press reported. The Dallas Morning News first reported\u00a0that\u00a0Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18, and his 17-year-old brother\u00a0Marlon Galicia were detained June 27 at the checkpoint in Falfurrias about 80 miles from the Rio Grande. Marlon, who is not a U.S. citizen, agreed to be deported, but Francisco was held, attorney Claudia Galan of McAllen told the newspaper. Francisco Galicia was carrying a state-issued ID, which can only be obtained by producing a Social Security number and is\u00a0only available to American citizens. Immigration debate:Trump campaign again draws Mollie Tibbetts' name into debate despite family's objections \u201cI presented them with his original birth certificate and other documents and they ignored them,\" Galan told the Morning News. \"So now I\u2019ve faxed over all the documents to the ICE agent handling the case. \"He\u2019s going on a full month of being wrongfully detained. He\u2019s a U.S. citizen and he needs to be released now.\u201d Representatives of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The Morning News report caught the attention of U.S. Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who tweeted that federal authorities were \"detaining American citizens.\" \"How would you feel trapped in a border camp, where guards wear face masks because the human odor is so strong?\" Ocasio-Cortez said in her tweet. \"When we allow the rights of some to be violated, the rights of all are not far behind.\" Galicia was released from the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall, about 240 miles north of McAllen \u201cI\u2019m so thankful Francisco is free and he can sleep at home tonight and see his mom,\u201d Galan said in the AP report. Until Saturday, neither she nor Galicia's family were aware of the teen's whereabouts. He was not permitted to call his mother, she said in published reports. Galan said Galicia did provide\u00a0Border Patrol agents a wallet-sized birth certificate indicating he was born in Dallas. But he also had a Mexican tourist's visa, which also suggested he was a citizen of Mexico, she said. \u201cAt the time that his mother registered his birth certificate, she used a fake name,\" Galan\u00a0told the McAllen Monitor. \"Because of that name on the birth certificate, she could never get him a passport, and she never corrected the birth certificate to get him a passport. Instead of doing that, she thought it would be easier to get him a tourist Visa listing him as being born in Mexico.\" John C.

      "author": "Rebecca Morin",
      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 A North Carolina gun store owner took out a billboard advertisement focused on\u00a0four Democratic congresswomen of color that makes reference to \"The 4\u00a0Horsemen\" and all but calls the four progressive lawmakers\u00a0\"idiots.\" The lawmakers featured on the billboard are the same four Democrats \u2014 colloquially known as the \"Squad\" \u2014 who have drawn President Donald Trump's ire in recent weeks as he has leveled repeated racist attacks on\u00a0them. Cherokee Guns, based in Murphy, N.C., posted a picture of the billboard on its\u00a0Facebook page Sunday. The image has photos of Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. Above the four women's\u00a0photos, the billboard reads\u00a0\"The 4 Horsemen Cometh are Idiots,\" and below it says \"Signed, the Deplorables.\" \"The 4\u00a0Horsemen\" is a biblical reference to\u00a0the coming of the\u00a0end of the world. In the Bible, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are said to bring pestilence, war, famine and death. In addition, the sign references \"deplorables,\" a term that Hillary Clinton famously used in 2016 to describe some of Trump's supporters. 'It's breaking my heart':Greenville, NC, wrestles with fallout of Donald Trump's rally \u2018Racist words ... giving me flashbacks.':Black Cincinnati residents brace for Trump rally following \u2018racist\u2019 comments In a separate post on Monday, the store said\u00a0that it\u00a0will be giving out\u00a0bumper stickers bearing\u00a0the same image. Trump several weeks ago tweeted for the four congresswomen\u00a0to \"go back\" to their countries. Three of the four lawmakers were born in the United States and all four are U.S. citizens. The four Democrats\u00a0have criticized Trump's comments as racist. The House of Representatives last month also condemned the president's tweets as racist. Trump has repeatedly denied that his comments about and attacks on the four women of color are\u00a0racist. Following Trump's tweets, chants of \"send her back\" broke out at a rally in North Carolina when the president mentioned Omar. Trump initially denounced the chant, but later called the supporters at that rally \"patriots.\" Several top Democratic lawmakers called for more security for Omar and others after Trump's attacks and the\u00a0chants\u00a0that followed. Speaking to reporters Thursday before heading to a rally in Cincinnati \u2014 his first since the North Carolina rally, the president said he would prefer that his supporters not revive the chants. But Trump also suggested he was not sure he would\u00a0be able to stop the chanting if it happened. 'I prefer they don't':Trump says he hopes Cincinnati rally crowd doesn't revive 'send her back' chant The advertising company responsible for the billboard, Allison Outdoor Advertising, said on\u00a0Facebook Wednesday that it was\u00a0going to take the billboard down, according to North Carolina's News Channel 9. The company has since deleted the post. It did not respond to\u00a0request for comment from USA TODAY. Pressley on Tuesday criticized the billboard and called on Rep. Mark Meadows, who represents the district where the gun shop is located, to get involved. \"#Racist rhetoric from the occupant of the @WhiteHouse has made hate our new normal. We are still vulnerable,\" Pressley wrote on Twitter. \"@RepMarkMeadows \u2013 Cherokee Guns is in your district & you and I serve on a committee together. Here\u2019s your chance to finally do the right thing.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0praised workers from Wayfair, an online home goods website, for planning a walkout after the company sold furniture to an organization that is managing migrant camps along the U.S-Mexico border. \"Wayfair workers couldn\u2019t stomach they were making beds to cage children,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\u00a0\"They asked the company to stop. CEO said no.\" \"Tomorrow, they\u2018re walking out,\" she continued. \"This is what solidarity looks like - a reminder that everyday people have real power, as long as we\u2019re brave enough to use it.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is a top-tier candidate in the 2020 Democratic field, also tweeted that she supports the walkout. \"I stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow,\" she wrote. \"The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for. \" Wayfair employees are staging a walkout in Boston, Mass.,\u00a0on Wednesday after the company said it\u00a0would not end its\u00a0business relationship with\u00a0BCFS, a government contractor that has been managing migrant camps at the border, according to several reports. Employees for the company learned last week that a $200,000 order of bedroom furniture was placed by BCFS for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas,\u00a0the Boston Globe first reported. Friday, nearly 550 employees on Friday signed a letter to Wayfair\u00a0executives asking that the company\u00a0cease all business with contractors that operate detention camps for immigrants. \"We believe that the current actions of the United States and their contractors at the Southern border do not represent an ethical business partnership Wayfair should choose to be a part of,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Globe, which obtained a copy of the letter.\u00a0\u201cAt Wayfair, we believe that \u2018everyone should live in a home that they love.\u2019 Let\u2019s stay true to that message by taking a stand against the reprehensible practice of separating families, which denies them any home at all.\" The walkout is set for Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. local time in Boston, the Washington Post reported. In addition, employees are calling on Wayfair to donate all profits made from the sale to BCFS to Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based non-profit that provides legal services to immigrants. More:Federal appeals court orders more fact-finding on Trump administration's plan to add census citizenship question More:GOP Rep. Michael Burgess says migrant children in one detention center can leave 'at any time' This is not the first time Wayfair has sold furniture to a migrant center. According to the Post, the company sold to a facility in Tornillo, Texas, last September. That center has since been shut down. A Twitter account\u00a0about\u00a0the walkout was created, as well as a Facebook page. Wayfair and the organizers of the walkout have not responded to requests for comment. Another Democratic lawmaker\u00a0has also responded to the media reports about the planned\u00a0walkout. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., whose district includes Wayfair's headquarters, said she stands in solidarity of those walking out on Wednesday. \"We must actively #resist any & all efforts by this cruel, incompetent administration to cage children and separate families,\" she tweeted.\u00a0\"I proudly stand in solidarity w/ the hardworking individuals at #Wayfair who are walking out in the name of #justice & humanity.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": " \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d opened this week's\u00a0episode with a\u00a0President Donald Trump skit \u2013 big surprise, huh? \u2013 but this Alec Baldwin outing\u00a0was much better than some recent ones. The cold open of Saturday's episode, which was hosted by Chance the Rapper,\u00a0packed in newsy items \u2013 Syria, ISIS, impeachment, tax returns \u2013 while throwing jabs at Trump, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, former President Bill Clinton and the most zealous of Trump rallygoers. Refreshingly, it\u00a0highlighted the talented \u201cSNL\u201d cast \u2013 supported by alums Darrell Hammond and Fred Armisen\u00a0\u2013 rather than relying\u00a0on the celebrity stunt-casting that has propped up some less-than-stellar presidential skits. The Trump sketch played off a September\u00a0rally in New Mexico, but also referenced the real president's comment last week that\u00a0a wall is being built in Colorado, a\u00a0non-border state, a statement that is hard to parody. Surprise!\u00a0Jason Momoa rips shirt open during\u00a0cameo in Chance the Rapper's 'SNL' court skit More 'SNL':Chance the Rapper opens second hosting gig with song saluting No. 2's The gag was bolstered by a funny map that included Good America (mostly states that voted for Trump), Bad America (the Northeast, which didn't), Bad Mexico (which borders Colorado), New Mexico being north of Colorado\u00a0and California, which did not vote for Trump, in the ocean. Trump got the devoted rally crowd going, asking what the impeachment inquiry really is? \"A witchhunt,\" they replied in unison. White House antics:Rudy Giuliani as Joker? A Ferris Bueller-esque Mike Pompeo? It's all in 'SNL's opening skit Baldwin's Trump is back:Alec Baldwin returns to 'SNL' as Trump stressing about impeachment; 'Kanye' ends friendship He then segued into, \"And there was no?\" \"No collusion!\" they shouted. \"No, the new one,\" Baldwin's Trump said, hinting at a phrase he has used to combat the impeachment inquiry. \"No quid pro quo,\" the crowd yelled. Baldwin's Trump was then praised\u00a0by a bunch of fervent supporters he invited to the microphone. Cecily Strong played a woman whose T-shirt misspelled Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. When Trump mentioned the typos, she responded, \"No, this is taken verbatim from one of your tweets. Therefore, it's correct.\" She said the impeachment inquiry is \"a\u00a0deep-state liberal conspiracy and everyone's in on it: The\u00a0CIA, the FBI, the M-I-C, the K-E-Y, and the M-O-U-S-E.\" Aidy Bryant played another Trump devotee: \"I love you and I worship you as the one true white lord.\" When Trump said he might shoot the anonymous author of an upcoming Trump expose on Fifth Avenue, playing off a real Trump statement, Bryant's supporter offered him a gun.\u00a0\"The Earth is flat and Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0is white,\" she said,\u00a0as Trump shooed her off. Pete Davidson, clad in black, was introduced as a young Trump supporter. The president asked if he was from New Mexico. \"ISIS,\" Davidson's character answered, echoing news of ISIS escapees in Syria. \"I was in a prison in Syria until last week when you freed me. So, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing jobs back\u00a0\u2013 to ISIS. And I promise that I will make ISIS great again.\" \"Terrific. What a great guy,\" Trump responded. \"ISIS is back in a big way, folks. And we love that, don't we?\" Then, it was time for famous faces. Trump couldn't seem to identify Graham, one of his strongest supporters in Congress. \"Sorry, I thought you were a scoop of ice cream melting into a suit.\" \"I'm sweating profusely all the time,\" Kate McKinnon's jowly senator replied. \"Even\u00a0my bodily fluids are trying to distance themselves from me.\" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Alex Moffat), who faced harsh questioning in Congress last week, was on hand, because \"he got his (behind) completely owned by AOC (New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), so it means he's one of us now.\" Trump tax returns:New York prosecutor says president can't block subpoena for financial records Trump thanked him for running \"our Russia campaign,\" with Moffat's awkward Zuckerberg replying \"Facebook isn't pro-Russia. It's just not anti-Russia.\" He then went on about a rigorous fact-checking review board \u2013\u00a0before Davidson's ISIS soldier said he was on the panel. Hammond's Clinton\u00a0arrived, saying he just \"followed the party.\" When Trump said he was getting impeached, Clinton surmised it had something to do with a sex-related matter, as it was when he was impeached in 1998. \"No, it's not for that,\" Trump said. \"They don't mind when I do that.\" Finally, Trump introduced his \"new friend,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip\u00a0Erdogan. (The real president's decision to change\u00a0U.S. policy in Syria after a call with the Turkish president has come under bipartisan criticism.) \"Erdogan and I are such good friends now,\" Trump said. \"It's like when Franco and Mussolini would take vacations together,\" Armisen's Erdogan responded, continuing the bromance banter. When Trump said he didn't have anything to gain financially from the decision, the pair got into a debate about how rich Trump really is.\u00a0When Erdogan said Trump had $100 billion, Trump said, \"Not exactly, but it's definitely billions.\" \"He's being modest,\" Erdogan responded, setting up one last dig on a newsy item. \"I'm sure it's more than that. Show them your tax returns.\"",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Ivanka Trump's suitability as a U.S. diplomatic representative at last week's G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, saying on social media that simply being the president's daughter does not make her qualified for the role. \"It may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification,\" the freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York said in a tweet on Saturday night. \"It hurts our diplomatic standing when the President phones it in & the world moves on. The US needs our President working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either,\" she added. Ocasio-Cortez's post included a link to a tweet featuring a viral video clip\u00a0\u2013 which has more than 9 million views\u00a0\u2013 of President Donald Trump's oldest daughter, and White House adviser, participating in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0and\u00a0the director of the International Monetary Fund's director, Christine Lagarde. At G20, Trump tells Putin playfully:'Don't meddle in the election.' Putin laughs New strategy?:Trump criticized Kamala Harris at the G20, breaking a silence More:Donald Trump's future depends in part on Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un The context of the 19-second video clip\u00a0that\u00a0was published on the official\u00a0Instagram account of the French presidential palace\u00a0is not provided, and the sound quality leaves some of the dialogue unintelligible. But it shows Macron making a comment about \"social justice\" to which Ivanka Trump nods and expresses agreement. \"As soon as you begin talking about the economic aspect of it, though, a lot of people start listening who otherwise wouldn't listen,\" May says. \"Yeah,\" Trump agrees. \"And the same with the defense side of it,\" which she says is \"male-dominated.\" Many Twitter users characterized the attempts by the president's daughters to join the conversation as embarrassing. A number of commentators noted an apparent eye roll from Lagarde as Ivanka Trump spoke. \"Your thoughts on this video, @IvankaTrump? Your thoughts on the French government releasing it for the world to see?\" tweeted actress and liberal activist Alyssa Milano. Edward Luce, a columnist for the Financial Times, wrote\u00a0that Ivanka Trump \"inserting herself into an awkward circle of world leaders\" will be the \"abiding image\" of the G-20 summit. He noted the \"varying expressions of tortured politeness\" displayed by the European political figures as Ivanka Trump spoke, and said that \"Lagarde, in particular, was unable to conceal her irritation.\" \"America\u2019s self-named 'First Daughter' is rarely out of the frame at global summits. Other Trump officials are almost invisible compared with Ms Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the only two White House players who are thought to be immune from Mr Trump\u2019s trademark phrase: 'You\u2019re fired,\" Luce wrote. Some of Ivanka Trump's defenders pushed back against Ocasio-Cortez's criticism. They said it was ironic that Ocasio-Cortez, a bartender and the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, was criticizing someone as being unqualified. College professor Oliver McGee, a frequent guest on Fox News, accused Ocasio-Cortez of \"jealousy\" for Ivanka Trump's place\u00a0\u00a0\"on the world stage\" and called her criticism \"petty & classless.\" \"Diplomat Ivanka is savvy in business & politics to dialogue with world leaders! Being a bartender is NOT a savvy qualification for Congress,\" McGee tweeted. \"Imagine lacking this much self-awareness. The bartender turned Congresswoman, called someone unqualified,\" the Students for Trump Twitter account replied to Ocasio-Cortez's post. \"She didn\u2019t 'turn'\u00a0Congresswoman,\" another Twitter user replied to Students for Trump's criticism. \"She campaigned, beat an entrenched politician, and she did it with grit and a vision. You may not like her views, but nothing was handed to her ... unlike Ivanka.\"",

The Citizen Times spoke to a\u00a0man who described\u00a0himself as the owner of Cherokee Guns and identified himself only as \"Doc.\" The \"about\" section on Cherokee Guns' Facebook page lists Doc Wacholz as the store's 2012 founder. \"I'm not inciting any violence or being racist,\" Wolf said. \"It's a statement. It's an opinion.\" When asked why he chose to pair the congresswomen with his gun shop advertisement, Wacholz said,\u00a0\"They're socialists, from my point of view. I also feel a couple of them, being Muslim, have ties to actual terrorists groups.\" 'Jihad Squad':Illinois GOP group apologizes for offensive post about AOC, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley Wacholz\u00a0reiterated that his billboard is protected by free speech and said he paid about $250 a month to rent it. Allison Outdoor Advertising\u00a0Inc., the owner of the billboard, doesn't screen the ads that renters display, said Danny Coleman, the account executive responsible for Cherokee County. \"As long as there's no vulgar stuff or stuff with kids,\" Coleman said. \"That's the only thing I could think of.\" At least three previous Cherokee Guns billboards involve words or images that mock Islam or Arab\u00a0or Muslim Americans. In 2015, Wacholz rented a billboard that said \"Give me your tired, your poor ... Keep your Syrian refugees.\" \u201cPeople on Facebook were saying it was ignorant or racist,\u201d Wacholz told the Citizen Times in 2015, but \u201call the feedback I\u2019ve gotten from people coming into my shop is completely positive. People have come in and tried to actually give me money just to keep the billboard up.\u201d Online critics say this pairing \u2014 of guns and racial generalizations \u2014 is particularly worrisome in the wake of mass shootings committed by white supremacists. When asked whether he thought people might be less concerned if the billboard were a stand-alone political message without mention of guns, Wacholz said he \"hadn't considered it.\" \"If (Wacholz)\u00a0were a business owner and a member of ours, we would try to discourage him,\" said Sherry Raines, executive director of the Cherokee County Chamber of Commerce. Raines noted Cherokee Guns' history of \"controversial\" advertisements. Murphy Mayor Rick Ramse did not respond\u00a0to two calls for comment on July 30. Fact check:Trump\u2019s false claims about Rep. Ilhan Omar And U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows did not respond to multiple requests for comment July 30. Murphy falls in his 11th Congressional District. Wacholz hasn't shied away from the publicity the billboard has attracted. According to a July 29 Facebook post on the Cherokee Guns account, Wacholz plans to offer a \"FOUR HORSEMEN COMETH STICKER.\" The post continues with instructions for would-be bumper sticker buyers: \"(E)at a piece of bacon ... tell us you're voting for Trump in 2020 ... then get your limited edition bumper sticker!!\" \"Snowflakes and Liberals are not eligible ... sorry,\" the post said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden sounded a note of caution Friday about progressive Democrats and their policies, saying\u00a0that Democratic voters are more \"center-left\" and not \"way left.\" During an interview with CNN broadcast\u00a0Friday, Biden pointed to a number of moderate Democrats who won swing districts during the 2018 midterms. \"That's what this election is about. I'm happy to debate that issue and all those issues with my friends because guess what, look who won the races. Look who won last time out,\" Biden said. Throughout the Democratic presidential primary race, Biden\u00a0has continued to tout his more moderate proposals as some other\u00a02020 Democrats have announced their support for more left-leaning ideas, such as Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all. He said his plan includes keeping private insurance while allowing people to opt in to Medicare if they would like. The former vice president also downplayed last year's electoral victory by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \"By the way, I think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary,\" Bidden said. \"In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education and health care.\" More:Joe Biden says that he wasn't prepared for Kamala Harris' criticism on segregation and busing More:Elizabeth Warren's 35,000 selfies aren't just for kicks; they're a campaign strategy Ocasio-Cortez, 29, had a stunning\u00a0upset during the 2018 primaries against former Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, who served in the House for 10 terms. The district is predominately Democratic and Ocasio-Cortez won the general election with\u00a078% of the vote. Since then, Ocasio-Cortez has become\u00a0the face of the new progressive lawmakers elected to the House of Representatives. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination, retweeted a clip of Biden's comments and\u00a0said he was proud to work with Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders has endorsed the New York Democrat's Green New Deal. The two lawmakers have also introduced legislation that would impose a 15 percent interest rate cap on all consumer loans. \"I\u2019m proud to be working with @AOC and so many other Democrats to pass Medicare for All, debt free college and a Green New Deal,\" he tweeted. \"This is the agenda America needs \u2014 and that will energize voters to defeat Donald Trump.\" Ocasio-Cortez retweeted Sanders and then added a thank to the Vermont senator: \"Thank you, @SenSanders. It\u2019s an honor to work alongside you and the millions of other people fighting for education, healthcare, and a living wage as rights.\" However, during the 2018 midterms, many of the Democrats who flipped districts were more moderate. And those moderate Democrats helped the party flip key House districts from Republican hands, according to analysis from Vox. Biden described the Democratic Party as moderate. \"Look, it's center-left, that's where I am,\" he said. \"Where it's not is way left.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 On a recent\u00a0Sunday, Victor Garcia left his Silicon Valley apartment and traveled an hour north to attend a rally by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Garcia, a 20-year-old political science major, is eager to vote both in the November 2020 election and in California\u2019s moved-up primary\u00a0on March 3.\u00a0But as curious as he is about Yang, a passionate\u00a0proponent of a monthly $1,000 Universal Basic Income payment, Garcia\u00a0is still candidate-shopping. He wants to see which politician is most attuned to issues that concern the state\u2019s growing Latino population. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d Garcia says as a largely youthful\u00a0crowd gathers at Civic Center Plazain San Francisco ahead of Yang's speech. \u201cThat said, most candidates really aren\u2019t reaching out to us yet.\" With California's earlier\u00a0primary date giving\u00a0the state newfound clout in choosing who takes on President Donald Trump, political experts say presidential hopefuls would do well to step up their courtship of the Golden State\u2019s increasingly powerful Latino voters. According to the Pew Research Center, not only are\u00a0Latinos the majority-minority, with\u00a039% (or 15 million) of the state's 40 million residents, but they also represent roughly a third of the state\u2019s eligible voters (at\u00a07.7 million). While Latino voter turnout lags that of other ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 45% of Latino adults are likely to vote, compared with 68% of whites, according to the Public Policy Institute of California \u2013 those numbers have been shifting. In the 2018 midterms, contests\u00a0that\u00a0traditionally draw\u00a0fewer voters than general elections, Latino voter turnout hit 36%, a doubling from 2014 that helped California Democratic candidates\u00a0flip seven perennially Republican House\u00a0seats. California Democrats gather:Here's what you need to know And Latino turnout expectations are heightened for the 2020 presidential election. At play not only are robust voter registration efforts aimed at a heavily Democratic constituency \u2013 58% register as Democrats, compared with 15% who register as Republicans \u2013 but also\u00a0a powerful resentment of Trump, whose disapproval rating hovers at 70% among Latinos, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. According to a Nov.\u00a013 statewide Latino Decisions poll commissioned by the Latino Community Foundation, 74%\u00a0of registered Latino voters say they plan to vote in the March 3 primary. Concerns about racism was cited by 76%\u00a0of respondents. The poll also reveals that 31% planned to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 11% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro came in at 9%, and California\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris was at 8%. \u201cThe message we want all Latinos to hear is that they have the power to determine who is going to run against Trump\u00a0and who will win in November,\u201d says Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO of San Francisco- based Latino Community Foundation, which is working to get out the Latino vote across the state. \u201cThe political climate we are in has awoken a new generation of voters,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate the term sleeping giant, because we\u2019ve been working, not sleeping. Now the candidates have to engage.\u201d Democrats making a run for the White House will have an opportunity\u00a0to lock in Garcia\u2019s vote on Nov.\u00a016 in Long Beach, California, site of a televised Univision forum that will include Harris, Warren, Sanders, Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Yang. The event represents a rare in-state gathering by candidates who by and large have been visiting\u00a0California mostly for lucrative private fundraising trips. Many have so far focused their campaigning on\u00a0Iowa and other early battleground states. In fact, Biden has skipped all events hosted by the state\u2019s Democratic Party \u2013\u00a0 but has attended posh donor events up and down the state. He\u00a0recently announced he would not be at the state\u2019s party convention in Long Beach Nov.\u00a015 through 17. Rounding out the Univision forum's field of eight \u2013 and serving as last-minute replacements for original invitees\u00a0Biden, Warren and former Texas Congressman\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, who ended his once-promising campaign Nov. 1 \u2013 will be billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The cost of not grabbing the attention of Latinos across the state is\u00a0high, says Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cA presidential candidate cannot win California without getting a very significant portion of the Latino population, so ignoring outreach here is a huge strategic mistake,\u201d Romero says. USA TODAY reached out to the campaigns of all those initially invited to the upcoming Univision forum to talk about Latino voters in California. Yang\u2019s team was the only one to arrange an interview. \u201cAs a child of immigrants, I appreciate that communities may have unique issues,\u201d Yang tells USA TODAY in a makeshift greenroom just off Mission Street that by night is a chic cocktail bar. \u201cBut my campaign focuses on topics\u00a0that affect all of us.\u201d Yang says that by highlighting the coming negative effects of automation on retail, transportation and food service jobs, he is in fact directly addressing the concerns of Latino voters. \u201cMany communities will be adversely affected by this coming economic natural disaster,\u201d Yang says. \u201cBut those who will suffer the most will be people of color.\u201d So who has the edge? A recent Telemundo poll of Latino voters nationally showed\u00a0Biden leading with 26%, followed by Sanders at 18% and Warren at 10%. The next closest was\u00a0Harris at 3%. But 36% of Latino voters said they were undecided. Those findings largely were borne out in conversations with a range of California Latino leaders, from the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to a popular radio deejay. \u201cMost Latinos certainly know who Joe Biden is, so he\u2019ll get solid support, especially from the older generation,\u201d says Xavier Becerra, the state's first Latino\u00a0attorney general. His office has\u00a0sued the Trump administration more than 60 times on a range of issues. Becerra says that for many Latino voters, name recognition is key. \u201cFour years ago, I was campaigning for Hillary (Clinton) and Sanders was having a tough time gaining traction with Latinos, and now he\u2019s way up there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that shows is Latinos, like others, want to know who you are before they turn to you.\u201d Interest in Sanders and Warren indicates Latinos are \u201ctrending on the progressive side, which makes sense when you see the growth of younger voters,\u201d\u00a0Becerra says. Currently, 44% of eligible Latino voters are in the millennial age bracket, 18 to 33, according to Pew. Chuy Gomez, a longtime Bay Area radio broadcaster, often has the ear of younger Latino voters. \u201cA lot of people I speak with want Bernie in,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cHe speaks to the common folks, the workers. He\u2019s anti-rich.\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, has endorsed Warren. \u201cShe talks about bread and butter issues in a Midwest way, but it\u2019s all about paying the rent, getting more power as a worker, and our community relates to those issues,\u201d she says. When asked about Julian Castro, the lone Latino in the shrinking cluster of Democratic candidates, many say that while Latinos instantly relate to a man with a familiar last name and life story, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has their vote. \u201cWe want Castro in the race because he lives like us and represents us, so him being president is secondary to him just being on that stage,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe should be an example for the nation. We were scapegoated by this president as a way to win the last election. So we want to help galvanize Latinos everywhere to vote.\u201d Political pundits often like to talk about voters being driven largely by specific issues. But conversations with Latinos make it clear this is not a monolithic group. In fact, they hold a range of views, from progressive to conservative, and care about a rainbow of issues ranging from income inequality to climate change. \u201cThere is no issue that is not a Latino issue,\u201d says Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state who is also the first Latino to hold that position. \u201cWe want what everyone else wants. An opportunity for a good-paying job, access to health care, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing. Our dream is the American dream.\u201d Padilla says many Latinos see that dream as increasingly under threat by the Trump\u00a0administration, which has appealed to its base by attacking illegal immigration\u00a0and calling for tougher security\u00a0at the Mexican border. That, however, has served only to galvanize Latinos in a way that reminds Padilla of California\u2019s Proposition 187, which was passed by the state\u2019s voters 25 years ago this month. Prop 187 denied undocumented immigrants access to health care and education. Although a day later the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, it created a movement that eventually saw 1 million California Latinos become citizens and arguably launched the ethnic group on a path toward\u00a0increased power at the polls. Latino political activists agree that while the debate over illegal immigration is deeply upsetting to Latinos, candidates would be making a mistake if they focused their messaging on this one topic. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for these candidates to understand that it is not the case that if you know what one Latino wants, you know what we all want,\u201d says Latino Community Foundation CEO Martinez Garcel. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m a Dominican from New York, so when I hear AOC (progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) speak, I don\u2019t hear socialism, I hear policies that care about the poor,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Another mistake for candidates would be displaying a level of sympathy that teeters into pity. \u201cSometimes presidential candidates don\u2019t talk about Latinos in uplifting ways but just as victims, and we need to challenge that image,\u201d says Sarah Souza, president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, the first DACA recipient (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), or \"Dreamer,\" to be appointed to the post. Souza, who originally is from Brazil, says candidates who push for access to home ownership and financial resources for Latinos will find a ready audience. \u201cWe want economic opportunities just like everyone else,\u201d says Souza, adding that she supports Castro, Sanders and Warren. \u201cThey\u2019re the most progressive and have an agenda that is for people of color, a group that has long been a target when it comes to economic equity.\u201d For Alma Beltran, mayor of Parlier, California, just south of the agricultural mecca of Fresno, the upcoming primary and general election are about restoring opportunity and dignity to the lives of her 15,000 constituents \u2013 98.8% of whom are Latino, including her and the entire City Council. Though times are tough in Parlier because of scarce economic opportunities and looming water quality issues, Beltran\u00a0finds encouragement in the younger generation. \u201cI talk to some people who will say \u2018It won\u2019t make a difference if I vote,\u2019 but then I run into young people like my son, who is 17 and told me when he gets older he wants to run for office,\u201d Beltran says. \u201cYou think maybe they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re watching. They\u2019re the people who will make a difference.\u201d The crowd waiting for Yang at Civic Center Plaza is in fact mostly younger. Signs invariably tout the merits of his basic income plan, while most of the baseball caps say, \"MATH,\" a play off Trump's MAGA slogan that stands for Make America Think Harder. Marching with a smile is Eliana Jaramillo. Her large sign features a cartoon drawing of Yang as Uncle Sam, and in Spanish it reads, \u201cUniversal Basic Income: I want you to have $1,000 a month.\u201d Jaramillo says she was drawn to Yang\u2019s campaign specifically because that kind of stipend would have allowed her and her two children to flee an abusive relationship sooner. \u201cI\u2019m marching in the hope that other women don\u2019t have to go through what I did,\u201d she says. Nearby, Milo Alvarez bops up and down on his toes as he tries to get his infant son to sleep in his chest-mounted sling. \u201cI was a Bernie fan, but now I like Yang because I love this idea of a universal basic income,\u201d\u00a0says Alvarez, a scooter repairman from Daly City just south of San Francisco. Alvarez reels off the other issues that are important to him, including health care and climate change. He says he doesn\u2019t particularly mind\u00a0if candidates don't appeal to him specifically as a Latino. \u201cI care about the issues, which cut\u00a0across a lot of ethnicities,\u201d he says. Whether a\u00a0broad political appeal, like that made by Yang, will be enough to woo California's Latino voters come the elections in March and November remains to be seen. California\u00a0Secretary of State Padilla\u00a0suggests it may not be. \u201cYou cannot compete in California without paying deep respect and responding to the Latino community,\u201d he says. \u201cBottom line.\u201d Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava",

      "author": "John Fritze",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump delivered a warning to Democrats during a raucous Minnesota rally last month: The impeachment inquiry, he predicted, would backfire in next year's election. \"The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box,\" Trump said at the time. \"We will defeat them.\" Nearly a month later, as the White House prepares for the next phase of the investigation, the president's combative remarks in Minneapolis have emerged as a central theme in Republican advertising as groups loyal to Trump gamble that his woes will be an asset rather than a hindrance next November. Far from avoiding the impeachment inquiry, or the president\u2019s now infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Republican\u00a0groups are hammering vulnerable Democrats in digital and television ads for abandoning pocketbook issues in favor of what they describe as a relentless drive to remove Trump from office. Republican political strategist Ron Bonjean said GOP groups are moving away from attacking the impeachment process to accusing Democrats of playing politics. \u201cYou\u2019re either defining this environment right now or you\u2019re going to get defined by it politically,\u201d Bonjean said. Trump\u2019s campaign spent more than $1 million on Facebook ads in October that mentioned \u201cimpeachment,\u201d according to an analysis by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic group. But while the Trump campaign was the largest player, it was far from alone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the campaign arm of Senate Republicans spent nearly $200,000 on Facebook ads referring to impeachment during that same time. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC with ties to House GOP leaders, launched a new digital ad campaign soon after the House voted Thursday to formalize the impeachment investigation. The ads, aimed at Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016, tell voters that \u201cyour member of Congress just voted for impeachment!\" Explainer:What comes next in the Trump impeachment inquiry? With a sepia-toned photo of an angry-looking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the ads slam Democrats for focusing on impeachment at the expense of health care, the economy and infrastructure. The ad fails to mention the Trump administration made little progress on health or infrastructure during its first two years, when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. The anti-tax group Club for Growth, meanwhile, is running digital ads focused on impeachment in House districts in Virginia, California, Illinois and New Mexico. Those ads have embraced the theme that Democrats are giving up on \u201creal problems\u201d to focus instead on \u201cimpeachment, all the time.\" \"There\u2019s a reason Pelosi has been hesitant to make impeachment official,\" said David McIntosh, the group's president. \"She knows the evidence doesn\u2019t meet their charges and it will be a political liability.\" Underscoring that they believe the politics of impeachment are on their side, aides at the campaign arm for House Republicans sent\u00a0packing boxes to House Democrats this week. The boxes were\u00a0adorned with bows and a\u00a0message that read \"Get packing!\" At the national level, the Trump and the Republican National Committee have spent more than $10 million on that message. Following the announcement of the impeachment inquiry, the RNC launched an\u00a0anti-impeachment campaign called \"Stop the Madness,\" targeting House Democrats up for re-election in 2020. Trump\u2019s campaign aired a television ad during the World Series this week that touted the economy and the recent U.S. special forces raid in Syria that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdad. \u201cHe\u2019s no Mr. Nice guy,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says of the president. \u201cBut sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.\u201d Similar messages are running in down ballot races as well. A campaign ad for Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican up for re-election on Tuesday, also cites impeachment, portraying Bevin's opponent, Democrat Andy Beshear, as a backward liberal whose \u201ctop supporters want to impeach our president.\u201d A separate spot paid for by an affiliate of the Republican Governors\u2019 Association goes further, claiming Bevin and Trump \u201care making Kentucky great again\u201d while painting Beshear, the state\u2019s attorney general, as part of the effort to bring Trump down. \u201cSocialists in Washington want to impeach Trump and take us backward,\u201d the narrator says as photos of an angry-looking Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appear on the screen. The effort comes as polling indicates the nation is as sharply divided on impeachment as it is on many other issues facing Congress. Nearly four in 10 Americans said Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president was itself an impeachable offense, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. Another 31% said there was nothing wrong with the conversation, echoing Trump\u2019s insistence that his conversation with Zelensky was \"perfect.\" Just over 20% of Americans said the call was \u201cwrong\u201d but doesn\u2019t rise to an impeachable offense. Democratic groups that engage in elections have, so far, been more reticent to bring up impeachment in their own advertising. Presidential candidate Tom Steyer, who in 2017 founded a grassroots effort to impeach Trump called Need to Impeach, has spent nearly $600,000 on Facebook ads mentioning the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d this month, according to the Bully Pulpit analysis. That group is also airing television ads targeting four Republican senators \u2013 Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona \u2013 in case a Trump impeachment goes to a Senate trial. Warren, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, doled out nearly $70,000 on Facebook ads referencing impeachment last month. \"It\u2019s time for Congress to step up and begin impeachment proceedings,\u201d one Warren ad bluntly says. \u201cNo president is above the law,\u201d another reads. One of the largest pro-impeachment digital ad buyers isn\u2019t a candidate at all but rather the executive of a Wisconsin-based spice company. Bill Penzey of Penzeys Spices, an outspoken Trump critic, spent nearly $500,000 on impeachment ads on Facebook last month. In a lengthy ad, Penzey describes Trump as a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201ccheater.\u201d \u201cNext time shorter,\u201d the Penzey ad concludes, \u201cand with recipes, too!

Rather, the strategist said, Democrats don\u2019t want to be accused of attempting to politicize the impeachment investigation.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0has been outspoken about\u00a0the Trump administration's treatment of migrants crossing\u00a0into the U.S. via the southern border with Mexico\u00a0and about\u00a0undocumented immigrants living in the United States currently. The New York Democrat\u00a0has repeatedly called for\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be abolished. And now, Ocasio-Cortez says she thinks that the Department of Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over\u00a0ICE, should be eliminated as well. \u2018They tore out a piece of my heart\u2019:Migrant mother describes toddler\u2019s illness, death In an interview with the New Yorker, the progressive lawmaker\u00a0said she believes the core structure of ICE and the DHS\u00a0\"are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight\"\u00a0and \"it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies.\" When asked whether she would\u00a0get rid of DHS, she said: \"I think so.\" \"I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush Administration did,\" she said.\u00a0\"I feel like it is a very qualified and supported position, at least in terms of evidence and in terms of being able to make the argument that we never should have created D.H.S., in the early 2000s.\" Amid intra-party bickering between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several freshmen congresswomen, including Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat said she doesn't believe she really has a relationship with the House speaker. \"I think sometimes people think that we have this, like, we have a relationship,\" she said during the interview. When asked whether she does, Ocasio-Cortez said: \"Not particularly.\" \"Not one that\u2019s, I think, distinguished from anyone else,\" she said. More:Pelosi after quarrels with AOC, Tlaib: 'You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it' She added that the last time she spoke to Pelosi one-on-one was when the House speaker asked her to join the select committee on climate change. Ocasio-Cortez said she did not join the panel because\u00a0she had several requests regarding the committee which were not accommodated: that the committee have a legislative mission that\u00a0included\u00a0drafting legislation by 2020, that\u00a0it have subpoena power and that\u00a0members of the select committee\u00a0not take any money from the fossil fuel industry. In addition, she said that her committee assignments that she was ultimately given have been \"very intense and very rigorous.\" Ocasio-Cortez serves on the\u00a0House Financial Services Committee and the House Oversight Committee. \"I was assigned to two of some of the busiest committees and four subcommittees,\" she said.\u00a0\"So my hands are full.\" \"And sometimes I wonder if they\u2019re trying to keep me busy,\" she added, laughing. In 2016, Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Now the Vermont senator is\u00a0running again, but Ocasio-Cortez has not endorsed him\u00a0just yet. However, she has worked on legislation with him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Ocasio-Cortez said she has been approached by several candidates seeking her endorsement. She said she tells them all the same thing:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody for some time.\u201d \"I certainly don\u2019t want to endorse anyone this year,\" she said, but she noted\u00a0that she will likely make an endorsement before the Democratic nomination is locked in. \"You know, I think we need to have debates. I think we need to have a national conversation. And also, I need to do my job.\" Ocasio-Cortez also commented on former Vice President Joe Biden's and Sen. Kamala Harris' debate performance late last month. The freshman congresswoman said she thinks it was fair that Harris confronted Biden on his comments about working with segregationist Democrats during his time in Congress and about\u00a0his stance on busing decades ago. More:Penalizing candidates who interrupt, and other changes coming to the Democratic debates \"I absolutely think she was fair,\" Ocasio-Cortez said of Harris.\u00a0\"And I think this is also part of a larger discussion, and that issues of race and gender are not extra-credit points in being a good Democrat. They are a core part of the competencies that a President needs.\" However, the New York Democrat said that past criticism of Harris has\u00a0been warranted and she wants to learn about the California senator's worldview. Ocasio-Cortez said that\u00a0Biden's debate performance called into question whether he is capable of being president due to his age. \"His performance on the stage kind of raised some questions with respect to that,\" she said. Biden is 76 years old. However, if Biden\u00a0is the Democratic nominee, Ocasio-Cortez said \"I will do what I can\" to help beat President Donald Trump in 2020. \"Well, we need to defeat this President.\" she told the New Yorker, \"And so, to the extent that I could be helpful in that, you know, I will do what I can.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": "President Donald Trump is\u00a0set to sign a bill at the White House on Friday that compensates 9/11 first responders who suffered illnesses, injuries and other medical problems as a result of their service. The measure supplies money for a compensation fund for firefighters, police officers and other emergency personnel who worked on the scene in New York City\u00a0in the aftermath of\u00a0the terrorist attacks of\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001. The bill passed the Senate earlier this week by a margin of 97-2, despite attempts by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah,\u00a0to offset the costs and add amendments. Trump will sign it into law during a ceremony with dozens of first responders, but one high-profile advocate won\u2019t be there. Comedian and longtime first-responder activist Jon Stewart will reportedly be on vacation. After weeks of public friction, high-profile Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York) are scheduled to meet face-to-face Friday in Washington, DC.\u00a0Pelosi said she's \"looking forward\" to the meeting and Ocasio-Cortez added it is \"nothing too climactic.\" Signs of tension between the two have arisen since Ocasio-Cortez's arrival in January, but they appeared to boil over after Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-year congresswomen from the party's progressive wing known as the \"Squad\"\u00a0were the only Democrats to vote against a version of a border funding bill that Pelosi promoted.\u00a0Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez have appeared to unify in recent days after President Donald Trump unleashed a series of racist attacks against\u00a0the Squad.

      "author": "William Cummings",
      "content": " A group of freshman Democratic congresswomen responded on social media this weekend to criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who dismissed them and \"their Twitter world\" in an interview with The New York Times. Columnist Maureen Dowd asked Pelosi about the opposition to a border funding bill from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.;\u00a0Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Pelosi said \"our bill\"\u00a0was the best Democrats\u00a0could do. She\u00a0criticized the four liberal freshman\u00a0\u2013 whom Dowd referred to as \"the Squad\"\u00a0\u2013 for being the only members of their party\u00a0to vote\u00a0against the original version of the legislation passed by the Democratic-led House, which included some protections for migrant children. \"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\" Pelosi\u00a0said, according to Dowd. \"But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\" The response was swift. \"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment,\" Ocasio-Cortez fired back on Twitter. \"And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\" 'Children come first':House passes $4.6 billion in aid for migrants at border after Pelosi caves to Republicans More:AOC criticizes CBP after report of secret Facebook group as agency opens investigation \"I don\u2019t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, explaining her opposition to the legislation. \"It\u2019s a huge mistake. This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People\u2019s lives are getting bargained, & for what?\" The House version of the border funding bill was rejected by\u00a0the Republican-led Senate. Pelosi then capitulated and agreed to join the moderates in her party in passing\u00a0the Senate version of the $4.6 billion bill. Ninety-five Democrats bucked their leader and voted against that version, with another 10 not voting. Pelosi said she \"reluctantly\" decided to back\u00a0the Senate version of the bill because\u00a0\"the children come first\" and the emergency funding was needed to get resources to help the mass of migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Pelosi told Dowd that the blame should go to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whom she called \"authentically terrible.\" \"With all due respect, the press likes to make a story that is more about Democrats divided than the fact that Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t care about the children,\" she said. Migrant children's haunting drawings:'These children coming into our country need a voice,' doctor says The stuff of nightmares:Inside the migrant detention center in Clint, Texas 'They are run beautifully':Trump responds to report describing dangerous conditions at detention facilities Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti said on Twitter that the four Democrats had opposed Pelosi's version of the bill because they did not trust a promise he says McConnell made to Pelosi that he would pass the House version of the bill. \"Nah. It is deeper than that,\" Tlaib wrote in response to\u00a0Chakrabarti's tweet. \"Why would we fund a broken system that rips children away from their parents, deny asylum seekers due process & fuels a racist ideology that dehumanizes people?\" Tlaib also retweeted two posts that fired back at Pelosi's comment to Dowd, including one from immigrants right advocate Greisa Mart\u00ednez Rosas who said, \"The strategy is simple: Don\u2019t fall for lies. Play to Win,\" and another from Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein that pointed out the \"pivotal policy proposals\" authored by each member of \"The Squad.\" Democratic divisions:Biden urges caution about policies of 'way left' Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez Stein's tweet was also shared by Omar, who responded to Ocasio-Cortez's post about\u00a0Pelosi's comments with a cry of\u00a0\"Patetico!\"\u00a0\u2013 apparently referring to the Spanish word for \"pathetic.\" \"You know they\u2019re just salty about WHO is wielding the power to shift 'public sentiment' these days, sis. Sorry not sorry,\" Omar tweeted. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, also took issue with Pelosi's dismissal of Twitter, saying the speaker would \"rather campaign like it\u2019s 2008.\" \"I find it strange when members act as though social media isn\u2019t important,\" she said before using emojis to slam conventional campaigning, which spends\u00a0millions of dollars on television advertising. \"I haven\u2019t dialed for dollars *once* this year, & have more time to do my actual job,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Several members of Congress are calling for\u00a0investigations following\u00a0the\u00a0apparent suicide\u00a0of Jeffrey Epstein,\u00a0the disgraced financier who faced federal\u00a0sex trafficking charges before his death. Epstein was\u00a0found \"unresponsive in his cell\"\u00a0about 6:39\u00a0a.m. Saturday and given\u00a0life-saving measures. He was later transported from\u00a0Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to a statement by the MCC, which is\u00a0part of the Federal\u00a0Bureau of Prisons. The Bureau of Prisons said the FBI would be investigating the incident. Attorney General William Barr said he was \"appalled\" to hear about Epstein's suicide and added that Epstein's death \"raises serious questions that must be answered.\" Barr said the Department of Justice Inspector General would open an investigation in addition to the FBI investigation. More:Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, awaiting sex trafficking charges, dead of apparent suicide More:Jeffrey Epstein 'misappropriated vast sums of money,' billionaire Leslie Wexner alleges Lawmakers want answers over what led to Epstein's death while reiterating the need to probe a controversial plea deal he struck with former Labor secretary Alex Acosta. Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel\u00a0said\u00a0Epstein's death did not mean the investigation into\u00a0his controversial\u00a0plea deal\u00a0in 2007 would end. Frankel represents Palm Beach, Fla., where Epstein owned a home and where prosecutors say he sexually abused dozens of minor girls. \"With the obvious end to criminal proceedings against Epstein, it is important that the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform begin its investigation,\" she wrote, reiterating her prior calls for an investigation into Epstein's\u00a0plea deal. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said the \"Trump DOJ cannot be trusted to take it from here\" and called for an independent investigation into Epstein's death. Epstein had been accused of sexually abusing\u00a0\"dozens of minor girls\" in his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach from 2002 to 2005. A Miami Herald investigation in November 2018\u00a0revealed\u00a0Acosta\u00a0had been\u00a0directly involved in negotiating a plea\u00a0deal\u00a0with Epstein's lawyers in 2007.\u00a0Acosta had brokered a\u00a0deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid a longer prison sentence and federal sex-trafficking charges, a sentence many considered light. Epstein pleaded guilty to state felony prostitution charges and\u00a0agreed to\u00a0pay restitution to his victims, register as a sex offender\u00a0and serve 13 months in county jail. While serving\u00a0his jail term, Epstein\u00a0was permitted to leave the jail to work for 12 hours a day, six days a week. More:Trump's Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigns amid Epstein plea fallout Facing\u00a0backlash to the deal and calls to step down, Acosta\u00a0resigned as President Donald Trump's Labor secretary shortly after Epstein was indicted again\u00a0in July. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., also renewed her calls for an Oversight Committee investigation. \"Jeffrey Epstein was a serial child molester who evaded accountability because he was rich, powerful & well-connected,\" she wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\"We need answers. Most importantly, we need justice for his victims. Oversight must investigate.\" Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, called Epstein's suicide an \"impossibility\" that needed further congressional investigation. \"When an impossibility occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation,\" Green wrote. \"Because the public has a right to know, I\u2019m calling for a congressional investigation.\" More:'She should be shot': Ohio man charged after Facebook threat against Ocasio-Cortez Sen. Ben Sasse., R-Neb., sent a letter to Barr saying that the Department of Justice\"should not have allowed this to happen.\" \"His death not only deprives his victims of the opportunity to confront him in court and to see him held accountable for his crimes, but also makes it harder to unravel his ring and to hold accountable the many other powerful men who raped and exploited these children,\" Sasse wrote. Sasse asked\u00a0Barr for answers about Epstein's suicide, confirmation of the Department of Justice investigations into his death, and for the immediate securing of other evidence related to the case. More:Was Jeffrey Epstein on suicide watch when he died? How safeguards aren't foolproof Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said he welcomed the Department of Justice and FBI investigations, as \"there\u00a0are many questions that need to be answered in this case.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voiced concern about Epstein's death. \"We need answers. Lots of them,\" she wrote on Twitter. She then retweeted a post from former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, in which Mariotti says that the criminal probe into Epstein would conclude because \"no one else was charged in the indictment.\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called on the Bureau of Prisons to \"provide answers on what systemic failures of the MCC Manhattan or criminal acts allowed this coward to deny justice to his victims.\" Contributing: Doug Stanglin, Kevin McCoy",

According to the Associated Press, the\u00a0father sought the order to gain control over the funeral arrangements of his daughter from his daughter\u2019s aunt, Bonita Body.

The new sign, which will be placed at the spot where the 14-year-old's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River, will be open to the public but protected by a gate and security cameras, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission said. Till, 14, was tortured and murdered in 1955. An all-white, all-male jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men accused of the slaying. The memorial sign has been targeted repeatedly by vandals since it was first erected in 2008. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., plans to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and appear with him at an event this weekend. Nina Turner, a former state senator and current Sanders campaign national co-chair, said\u00a0that Ocasio-Cortez was returning the favor for the groundwork Sanders' campaign had laid in 2016. Sanders promoted the rally, which will take place in Queens, New York, during Tuesday's debate, along with the promise of a \"special guest.\" Ocasio-Cortez's district includes part of Queens, though the rally would take place right outside her district. The endorsement by the outspoken progressive could help the Sanders campaign, which has recently lagged in polls amid the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and questions about Sanders' health after he had a heart attack. This\u00a0weekend, British lawmakers will do something they have only done four times since the outbreak of World War II: Sit in the House of Commons on a Saturday.They will debate and then vote on\u00a0Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new deal to leave the European Union that won the backing of the bloc's leaders. If Johnson wins the vote, he will claim victory over a Brexit process that led to the resignation of his two predecessors (David Cameron and Theresa May).\u00a0But Johnson's ruling Conservative Party doesn't have a majority in Britain's 650-seat Parliament. In order to win support for his Brexit deal, he will be relying on votes from other parties and independent lawmakers \u2014\u00a0while his allies in Northern Ireland are opposed to a deal and the three main opposition parties have pledged to vote it down.The vote is expeted after mid-morning East Coast Time. Ratification meetings are expected to start Saturday after\u00a0the UAW National General Motors Council\u00a0reached a\u00a0tentative agreement with General Motors.\u00a0 GM\u00a0and the UAW reached a proposed tentative agreement on a new, four-year contract Wednesday, the 31st\u00a0day of a nationwide\u00a0strike.\u00a0The union appears to have won on many of its goals, including a path to permanent employment for temporary autoworkers, a faster route to top pay for workers hired after 2007. But the biggest obvious loss for the union is the continued closure of the Lordstown Assembly Plant in Ohio \u2014 a sore point that former Lordstown workers\u00a0said would\u00a0cause them to vote against the deal.",

The committees overseeing the\u00a0impeachment inquiry of Trump\u00a0released hundreds of pages of testimony Monday\u00a0from the former ambassador to Ukraine,\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch, and a former State Department adviser,\u00a0Michael McKinley. Their testimonies were the first in a series of transcripts that will be released from closed-door depositions that are part of the\u00a0inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by soliciting foreign interference in U.S. elections. Yovanovitch said that before\u00a0her ouster,\u00a0Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, gave her some advice: Tweet her support of Trump. Four hundred and sixty-two inmates in Oklahoma were set to be\u00a0released Monday\u00a0after a law signed this year retroactively reduced the sentences for individuals who committed low-level crimes.\u00a0Friday, Gov. Kevin Stitt\u2019s office processed the recommendations for final approval. It is the largest mass commutation \u2013 or reduction of a sentencing \u2013 in U.S. history since President Barack Obama released 330 federal prisoners on his last day of office. The manhunt for the killer or killers who opened fire on a Halloween party at a California Airbnb rolled into Monday after the death toll rose to five\u00a0and\u00a0the short-term rental\u00a0industry faced a series of rule changes. Since\u00a0the tragic shooting, Airbnb's CEO has vowed to crack down on \"party houses\" \u2013 though the definition of\u00a0\"party houses\" remains uncertain.\u00a0Now people are asking how. Columnist E. Jean Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against Trump,\u00a0who she said raped her in a department store dressing room more than 20 years ago. Carroll, 75, first went public with the allegation against Trump in June, before the release of her book \"What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,\" which contains a description of the alleged assault. Trump denied the allegation and accused Carroll of inventing it to boost book sales. \"It should be sold in the fiction section,\" Trump said. The lawsuit claims Trump's statements damaged Carroll's\u00a0reputation and caused her professional harm. Shia LaBeouf voiced a profound show of gratitude during his speech at the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday. Accepting a\u00a0screenwriting award for his autobiographical film, \"Honey Boy,\"\u00a0LaBeouf thanked the Georgia police officer\u00a0who arrested him for public drunkenness in\u00a02017.\u00a0\"I want to thank the police officer who arrested me in Georgia,\" said LaBeouf, who carried on speaking over laughs from members in the audience\u00a0who thought he was joking. \"For changing my life.\" LaBeouf, who is now sober, used time during his court-ordered\u00a0rehab after the arrest\u00a0to write the script. \ud83d\ude98 How close are we to seeing flying cars? \ud83d\udcb0 Ready to invest in individual stocks?

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday night, joining many others who've taken swings at the senator over the past few days. But her criticism\u00a0was\u00a0for a different reason. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a photo that had\u00a0been circulating\u00a0on social media and tagged the senator. The photo shows a group of young men holding a cardboard cutout of Ocasio-Cortez with\u00a0one of them\u00a0making a choking gesture at the throat and another gesturing to\u00a0kiss her\u00a0cheek. The handle of the person who originally shared the photo was blacked out, but the caption reads, at least in part, \"break me off a piece of that.\" \"Hey @senatemajldr,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in response to the photo, \"these young men look like they work for you. Just wanted to clarify: are you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch? Thanks.\" McConnell's camp told the Washington Post it does not condone the image. In a statement, McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden explained that the high school boys in the photo were not campaign staff. \"It\u2019s incredible that the national media has sought to once again paint a target on their backs rather than report real, and significant news in our country,\u201d the statement said. The photo\u00a0comes after Amy McGrath, who hopes to unseat the senator in November 2020, criticized McConnell for posting a photo of a tombstone with her name on it on Saturday. Another tombstone in the picture said, \"Green New Deal,\" a plan introduced by Ocasio-Cortez to tackle climate change. Reach breaking news reporter Sarah Ladd at sladd@courier-journal.com.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Stephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, pushed white nationalist material\u00a0to staffers at\u00a0Breitbart, a right-wing website, through 2015 and leading up to the 2016 election, according to a report published\u00a0by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The report released by the SPLC is the first installment in a series. More than 900\u00a0emails between Miller and Breitbart were examined by SPLC\u2019s Hatewatch.\u00a0\u201cMore than 80 percent\u201d of the emails \u201crelate to or appear on threads relating to the subjects of race or immigration,\u201d the report says. Miller is one of Trump\u2019s main influences on immigration policies, including restrictions on\u00a0travel from Muslim-majority\u00a0countries and family separation policies at the southern border. More:Supreme Court leans toward Trump plan to end DACA program for nearly 700K undocumented immigrants \"Miller\u2019s perspective on race and immigration across the emails is repetitious. When discussing crime, which he does scores of times, Miller focuses on offenses committed by nonwhites. On immigration, he touches solely on the perspective of severely limiting or ending nonwhite immigration to the United States,\" the nonprofit group wrote. Katie McHugh,\u00a0a former Breitbart editor who leaked the emails to the SPLC, said, \"What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration.\" McHugh renounced her\u00a0far-right views after being fired from the site in 2017 for anti-Muslim tweets. Some of the findings published by the SPLC include evidence that Miller pushed links from white supremacist site VDARE as an editorial basis\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart articles, including links to articles about conspiracy theories such as\u00a0\"white genocide,\"\u00a0which claims\u00a0nonwhite people are trying to eliminate the white race. Miller touted\u00a0a French novel that warns of a migrant invasion. \u201cThe Camp of Saints\u201d is a\u00a0popular book among white nationalists and neo-Nazis. The report says Miller directed\u00a0McHugh to \u201cdraw information\u201d from articles published in \"American Renaissance,\" a white supremacist online publication, about crimes committed by minorities and immigrants. \u201cIt was after lunchtime. I was sitting at my desk with my MacBook, and as Miller was speaking, I was looking away \u2026 to better concentrate on what he was saying,\u201d McHugh told Hatewatch. \u201cMiller asked me if I had seen the recent \u2018AmRen\u2019 article about crime statistics and race. I responded in the affirmative because I had read it. Many of us (on the far right)\u00a0had read it. I remember being struck by the way he called it \u2018AmRen,\u2019 the nickname.\u201d More:'Anonymous' author warns that Trump 'will not exit quietly,' even if defeated or impeached Miller\u2019s name appeared in \"American Renaissance\" as an author in\u00a02005, according to the SPLC, when the site republished a piece he wrote for \"FrontPage Magazine,\" a far-right online publication. Hatewatch said\u00a0Miller was angry at retailers who stopped selling Confederate flags after the Charleston church shooting when white supremacist Dylann Roof slaughtered nine African Americans in 2015. The SPLC highlighted\u00a0Miller's mentions of President Calvin Coolidge, who signed the eugenics-era Immigration Act of 1924 that limited immigration from certain parts of the world into the USA, as a foundation for why the United States\u00a0should stop\u00a0immigration altogether. The SPLC noted\u00a0that scholars said Hitler portrayed this policy in his book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d as a potential model for Nazi Germany. Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0tweeted that Miller \u201chas been exposed as a bonafide white nationalist\u201d and called for him to resign. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said officials had not seen the report but called the SPLC \u201ca far-left smear organization\u201d whose members \u201clibel, slander\u00a0and defame conservatives for a living. They are beneath public discussion.\u201d The SPLC wrote on Twitter that \u201cthe only appropriate response is to fire Stephen Miller. Hate doesn\u2019t belong in the White House,\u201d and it included a link to a petition. More:One sister has DACA status, the other doesn't. Their lives are worlds apart. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination, said Miller\u2019s \u201cwhite nationalist views are a danger to the American people. We are going to defeat this hateful administration and everything it stands for.\u201d According to the SPLC\u2019s report,\u00a0Miller was successful in shaping multiple stories that appeared on Breitbart regarding race and immigration when\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0was\u00a0executive chair of the site. Bannon\u00a0later\u00a0served as White House chief strategist in the Trump\u00a0administration and as the chairman for Trump's 2016 campaign.",

Gretna, La., police officers Charlie Rispoli, who create\u00a0the post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, were fired, police chief Author Lawson announced in a press conference Monday. \"These officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to the violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congressman, a member of our government, we're not going to tolerate that,\" Lawson said at the news conference, according to the New York Times.\u00a0\"This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department.\" Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the department, shared\u00a0a blog post that falsely claims the New York Democrat said \"We pay soldiers too much,\" according to a screenshot of the post\u00a0taken by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate.

The social media post and resulting firings came\u00a0amid mounting concern for elected officials' safety in the current political climate. Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, have been the target of President Donald Trump's ire in the past week. He has repeatedly criticized the four progressive Democrats and called on them to \"go back\" to their countries. All four congresswomen are U.S. citizens, with three being born in the United States. Trump's comments led leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to inquire about\u00a0additional security for Omar and other lawmakers.

      "author": "Sara M Moniuszko",
      "content": " Celebrities and politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, are weighing in on Taylor Swift's public fight with Big Machine Label Group. On Saturday, Warren\u00a0commented on the singer's claims that her former label is blocking her from performing\u00a0her old hits at the American Music Awards. \"Unfortunately,\u00a0@TaylorSwift13\u00a0is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm,\" Warren tweeted.\u00a0\"They're gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries. It's time to rein in private equity firms \u2014 and I've got a plan for that.\" U.S. Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared a similar message on Twitter: \"Private equity groups\u2019 predatory practices actively hurt millions of Americans. Their leveraged buyouts have destroyed the lives of retail workers across the country, scrapping 1+ million jobs. Now they\u2019re holding\u00a0@taylorswift13\u2019s own music hostage,\" she tweeted. \"They need to be reigned in.\" Cher also voiced her support for Swift on Saturday, validating her fellow singer's complaints that she isn't getting fair access to or compensation for her own work. \"BABE, THIS (expletive) HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE (a) MILLION SELLING ARTISTS WERE PAID OFF WITH A CADILLAC & A BOTTLE OF JACK!! I'M SORRY,\" Cher tweeted, adding an emoji with a puzzled look next to music tycoon Scooter Braun's name. Developments between Swift and her music industry foes\u00a0Big Machine Label Group owner Scott Borchetta and Braun escalated Friday. To recap: Swift took to Twitter on Thursday, claiming she's being asked to meet an onerous set of conditions if she wants to play a medley of her old hits at the American Music Awards show on Nov. 24, where she's being presented with the artist of the decade award. Swift says Borchetta and Braun, who purchased her extensive back catalog in June (to Swift's loudly expressed shock and horror), are blocking her from performing her old songs on television because \"they claim that would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year.\" Big Machine\u00a0says it's not so. In a statement provided to USA TODAY, the label said it was \"shocked\" to see Swift's statements \"based on false information.\" Later, Swift's\u00a0spokeswoman, Tree Paine, shared an updated statement with USA TODAY, insisting that Borchetta and Big Machine \"flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix.\" Who is Scooter Braun?\u00a0A look at the man who became Taylor Swift's 'worst case scenario' More celebrities like Hayley Kiyoko, Adam Rippon, Cara Delevingne and\u00a0Kathy Griffin\u00a0have announced their support for Swift on social media since then. \"Who the (expletive) do these guys think they are?\" Griffin tweeted Saturday. \"You, Taylor, have gone through the proper channels. That cost a fortune of your hard earned money. You created your own content. They don't have talent, just greed. Stay the course.\" 'I won't let you fall':Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes debut dreamy new lyrics in 'Lover' remix Justin Bieber, who is managed by Braun, appeared to take his and Borchetta's\u00a0side on the matter, sharing (and later deleting) a TMZ article on his Instagram Story about Big Machine denying Swift's claims. Earlier this week, singer Halsey also\u00a0shared a message on her Instagram Story about the matter. \"Not only are we looking at an awful business move ... but this is just mean. This is punishment. This is hoping to silence her from speaking about things by dangling this over her head,\" she wrote. Selena Gomez, a self-described best friend to Swift, also commented in a lengthy post to her Instagram Story, saying her heart is \"so heavy right now.\" \"It makes me sick and extremely angry,\" she wrote.\"...It's greed, manipulation and power. You've robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.\" Gomez said she hoped there would be a change of heart over this \"unfortunate\" situation. And she issued fair warning: \"Taylor fights. She will never stop fighting.\" Contributing: Andrea Mandell and Hannah Yasharoff More:Scooter Braun says he had a 'friendship' with Taylor Swift prior to Big Machine drama More:Justin Bieber's longtime manager Scooter Braun praises his 'courage,' slams media coverage",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 A Louisiana police officer last week said in a Facebook post that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a \"vile idiot\" who should be shot. A screenshot of the post by veteran Gretna police officer Charlie Rispoli was taken by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. In it, Rispoli shares a blog post that falsely claims the New York Democrat said\u00a0\"We pay soldiers too much.\" \"This vile idiot needs a round,\" reads Rispoli's remarks above Ocasio-Cortez's image. \"And I don't mean the kind she used to serve,\" he adds, referring to her prior career as a bartender. Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson said the post was \"disturbing\" but did not believe Rispoli, who has been with the department since 2005, intended it as a genuine threat, The Times-Picayune reported. \"I will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\" Lawson said, according to the newspaper. \"I\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. It\u2019s not something we want someone that\u2019s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements. That\u2019s not going to happen.\" The Gretna Police Department did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. Rispoli's post comes amid mounting concern for elected officials' safety in an increasingly rancorous political climate. In June 2017, a man opened fire on a group of Republican members of Congress\u00a0during their baseball team's practice in Virginia. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisana was severely injured in the attack. Last week,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told lawmakers\u00a0\"we continue to see the threat assessment cases we're opening continue to grow.\" In May, Ocasio-Cortez said she was regularly getting \"hateful messages\" and a \"flood of death threats.\" She said there was a connection between the threats and the reporting about her on\u00a0conservative news media outlets and also blamed Fox News. On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez, a fierce critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies, questioned\u00a0Homeland Security head Kevin McAleenan over threatening messages directed at her \u2013 including Photoshopped images depicting her rape\u00a0\u2013\u00a0on a secret Facebook group\u00a0for\u00a0Border Patrol agents. AOC to DHS chief:Border agents shared 'Photoshopped images of my violent rape' in secret Facebook group 'This puts me in danger':Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blames GOP groups for death threats Ocasio-Cortez is one of four Democratic congresswomen, known as \"the Squad,\" who have been the target of sharp criticism from President Donald Trump. Trump has said Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., \"hate our country.\" The president has also suggested that the four congresswomen of color, all of whom are U.S. citizens and three of whom were born in the U.S., should return to their countries of origin and fix the problems there before trying to make legislative changes in the U.S. Omar has said she has faced an increase in death threats since she became a target of the president's ire. In April, a New York man was accused of saying he would \"put a bullet\" in Omar. That same month, a Florida man was arrested after he allegedly threatened several high-profile Democrats, including Tlaib and Omar, whom he said he wanted to throw off the Empire State Building. Trump and his family have been targeted as well.\u00a0In May, a New Jersey man was arrested for allegedly saying he wanted to \"bomb Trump Tower,\" and two years before that\u00a0a Michigan man was charged with threatening to assassinate Trump. And in February 2018, Donald Trump Jr.'s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, was rushed to the hospital after opening a package containing a \"suspicious\" white substance that was later determined to be non-toxic. Those around Trump and his administration have also been confronted in public on a number of occasions. Last month, Eric Trump said an employee at a Chicago cocktail bar spat on him. In April, charges were dropped against a woman who White House counselor Kellyanne Conway says grabbed her and shook her by the shoulders.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are in talks to set up a face-to-face meeting with each other, amid intra-party tension between the two Democratic lawmakers. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hamill said Ocasio-Cortez's office reached out Tuesday afternoon for a one-on-one meeting. During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd\u00a0earlier this month,\u00a0Pelosi downplayed four votes from a group of progressive Democrats against a\u00a0border funding bill. Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all voted against the bill. The four congresswomen of color are colloquially known as \"The Squad.\" \"We are working to schedule this meeting,\" Hamill said of Pelosi meeting with Ocasio-Cortez, adding that the speaker's chief of staff has already met with the four chiefs of these offices. In an interview with CBS News\u00a0broadcast Wednesday,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez said she \"absolutely\" wants to meet with Pelosi. More:New York businesswoman and Jamaican immigrant Scherie Murray launches campaign to unseat Ocasio-Cortez More:House votes to condemn Trump's racist tweets with support from only 4 Republicans Pelosi in the New York Times said of The Squad: \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Since then, some members of \"The Squad\" have individually responded to the\u00a0speaker's remarks on Twitter. That prompted Pelosi in a closed-door meeting to warn Democratic lawmakers that if any\u00a0lawmaker had an issue within the party, they should come directly to her and not tweet about it. During an interview with the Washington Post\u00a0last week,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi of \"singling out of newly elected women of color.\" The\u00a0next day, she told\u00a0CNN that she \"absolutely\" did not believe Pelosi was racist. Since then, however, the tension between Pelosi and the Squad has been drowned out by days of tweets and attacks on the four progressive lawmakers by President Donald Trump. Trump on Sunday tweeted that\u00a0the four lawmakers should\u00a0\"go back\" to their countries, and has since doubled down several times on his attacks and criticisms of the Democrats. Three of the congresswomen were\u00a0born in the United States. Omar immigrated to the U.S. over 20 years ago from Somalia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. The House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's comments as racist,\u00a0by\u00a0a 240-187 vote. During the CBS interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she did not believe there is a fracture in the Democratic Party. \"I think that just as there were members of Congress that did not vote for the speaker on the House Floor the day of our swearing-in, just as there are members who challenge her conclusions, who disagree with her, so do we from time-to-time,\" she said.\u00a0\"But that does not mean that there is a fundamental fracture or a dehumanizing going on within our caucus.\" Contributing: Christal Hayes Like what you\u2019re reading?:Download the USA TODAY app for more",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is welcoming a new member to \"The Squad\": 82-year-old Rep. Bill Pascrell. The New Jersey Democrat\u00a0asked Tuesday to\u00a0be part of the outspoken group of House Democratic congresswomen who have been given their own moniker. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are the four freshmen lawmakers who have\u00a0collectively become known as \"The Squad.\" Pascrell responded to a tweet from The Onion, a satirical website, that posted an article entitled \"82-Year-Old New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell Quietly Asks Ilhan Omar If He Can Be Part Of The Squad.\" 'We want to just fight':Democrats' attempt to condemn Trump's racist tweets through House resolution delayed More:George Conway, husband of Kellyanne Conway, calls Trump a racist in op-ed \"Well. How bout it @AyannaPressley @AOC @RepRashida @IlhanMN?\" Pascrell tweeted. Shortly afterward, Ocasio-Cortez gave her approval to the 82-year-old. \"You\u2019re in, @BillPascrell!\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, with several emojis including a smiley face and heart. The exchange comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized \"The Squad\" in recent days. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted for the progressive lawmakers to \"go back\" to their country, a phrase often used in racist tropes. Three of the lawmakers were born in the U.S. Omar came\u00a0to the United States as a refugee from Somalia more than 20 years ago and is\u00a0a naturalized U.S. citizen. The president has doubled down on his comments several times since his initial tweets on Sunday.\u00a0The four congresswomen held a press conference Monday denouncing Trump's comments, calling them \"racist,\" \"xenophobic,\" and \"bigoted.\" More:House GOP leaders refuse to condemn Donald Trump's racist tweets, say the uproar is 'all about politics' More:Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad.' Here's what we know Pascrell is one of many Democrats who have defended the congresswomen from Trump's attacks, saying that the president\u00a0\"can't leave soon enough.\" Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also criticized the congresswomen after they voted against a\u00a0border funding bill. The speaker's statement sparked tension between The Squad and Pelosi, which has since been diminished following Trump's remarks as Pelosi and\u00a0many Democrats have lined up in solidarity behind the four congresswomen.

      "content": "   WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met face-to-face Friday\u00a0after weeks of public friction between the two high-profile Democrats. \"It went very well,\" Pelsoi said after the meeting. When asked if she and Ocasio-Cortez resolved any of their differences, Pelosi replied, \"we don't have that many differences.\"\u00a0The speaker wrote in a tweet later that the two met \"to discuss working together to meet the needs of our districts and our country, fairness in our economy and diversity in our country.\" Speaking later Friday at her weekly press conference, Pelsoi expressed \"some level of confidence, and actually joy\" at the diversity of the House Democratic caucus and its ability to unify around issues. \"Ever since I came here, we have engaged in differences of opinion in our caucus, and that is a good thing,\" Pelosi said.\u00a0\"In our caucus, we have our differences. Respect that, instead of making a big issue of it. Respect that.\" The collegial tone after the meeting appears to be the latest iteration of the sometimes-contentious\u00a0relationship between the speaker from California and the freshman lawmaker from New York,\u00a0who has come to represent the progressive wing of the party. The two have have quibbled over both policies and tactics during their six months together in the House but recently appeared to unify after President Donald Trump made\u00a0racist attacks against\u00a0four minority members of Congress. Budget deal:Donald Trump's budget deal with Democrats passes House but conservatives pan it as reckless The pair condemned Trump\u2019s tweets\u00a0in which he told the four House Democrats, which included Ocasio-Cortez,\u00a0to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d Pelosi said the tweets were \u201cdisgraceful and disgusting\u201d and introduced a resolution to condemn the comments as racist. But before Trump's attacks, signs of tensions between the two had\u00a0been\u00a0visible\u00a0from the time of Ocasio-Cortez's congressional orientation, when she joined\u00a0a climate protest outside Pelosi's office. And they continued as Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0disagreed\u00a0with the speaker's cautious approach to pursuing impeachment proceedings against Trump, while Pelosi offered\u00a0lukewarm support for Ocasio-Cortez's\u00a0Green New Deal. Tensions appeared to boil over after Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-year congresswomen from the party's progressive wing were the only Democrats to vote against a version of a border funding bill that Pelosi promoted. '45 is a puppet':Trump appears in front of altered presidential seal saying '45 is a puppet' During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Pelosi criticized Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for voting against the bill. \"They didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got,\" Pelosi said. That article prompted\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff\u00a0to criticize Pelosi and centrist Democrats on social media.\u00a0Pelosi then called out Ocasio-Cortez and the other three freshman congresswoman\u00a0in a caucus meeting. \"You got a complaint?\u00a0You come and talk to me about it,\" Pelosi said, according to a source in the room. \"But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK.\" From impeachment to indictment:5 repercussions from Robert Mueller's testimony Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying it was \u201coutright disrespectful\u201d for Pelosi to repeatedly single out newly elected women of color, though she later tried to downplay any ill-will between herself and the speaker. On Thursday, Pelosi minimized\u00a0reports of strain in her relationship with Ocasio-Cortez, saying,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\" \u201cI don\u2019t think there are tensions,\" she said. When asked about the meeting Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said, \"I don\u2019t think I have a strong message for her.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, views the meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0as a further sign of de-escalation. \"The speaker is our coach and leader, and (Ocasio-Cortez)\u00a0is a star recruit freshman who\u2019s capable of big plays,\" he said, \"so they should see that they both have a particular role to play on the team and ultimately the goal is for the team to win.\" Executions:Justice Department resumes capital punishment after nearly two decades, orders executions of five inmates Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar for the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump's comments \"actually brought Democrats together.\" \"They felt under siege in a completely vile way and that created a commonality,\" he said. \"It created an opening for a different kind of dialogue between the speaker and AOC.\u201d Ornstein said the meeting is significant because\u00a0\"the speaker doesn\u2019t meet individually with a lot of members on a regular basis because she has so many other things going on.\" When Pelosi was asked at her weekly press conference if she and Ocasio-Cortez had buried the hatchet, Pelsoi replied, \"I don't think there ever was any hatchet.\" Contributing: Christal Hayes",

The leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus issued a joint statement on Thursday asking Miller to step down in light of the report. \"It\u2019s clearer than ever that Stephen Miller is a far-right white nationalist with a racist and xenophobic worldview.

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 Adding fuel to the fire in the highly controversial debate over free speech and politics on social media, the CEO of President Donald Trump's preferred outlet says the company will no longer accept political ads. \"We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in a tweetstorm Wednesday. \"A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money,\" Dorsey continued. The ban will go into place in November. Dorsey wrote, \"We\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\" Twitter's recent decision differentiates itself from other companies that have resisted the push to stop taking political ads.\u00a0Facebook is currently in a debate over\u00a0the spread of misinformation through ads from political campaigns. The social media company has reiterated it does not think it should be the gatekeeper of political speech. Several hundred Facebook employees have noted their disagreement with the decision\u00a0in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. When Zuckerberg was recently testifying on Capitol Hill, Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0asked him if she could \u201crun advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d \u201cProbably\u201d was one of Zuckerberg responses. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. Dorsey clarified\u00a0details about Twitter's thoughts behind the decision, stating that the company \"considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too.\" \"A final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address,\" Dorsey concluded. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in on Twitter, saying \"This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world. What say you, Facebook?\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. called out former Sen.\u00a0Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Thursday over her work opposing a California bill that would make it harder for companies to classify workers as\u00a0independent contractors\u00a0in many industries including those workers participating in the \"gig economy\" for services like Lyft and Uber. Boxer, who is advising Lyft,\u00a0penned an op-ed\u00a0in the San Francisco Chronicle earlier this week\u00a0where she criticized the bill, writing, \u201cSwitching to an employee model will mean far fewer opportunities to drive.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0responded on Twitter writing, \u201cFmr officials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It\u2019s an abuse of power + a stain on public service.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a Democrat doing it (both parties do). In fact, that makes it worse \u2014 we\u2019re supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them,\u201d she continued. The bill, California AB-5, takes aim at the\u00a0titans of the \"gig economy\"\u00a0such as Lyft, Uber, Doordash, and Postmates. If it became law, the bill they would make it more difficult for such companies to deny a number of legal protections to workers which they don't currently enjoy as independent contractors. Some 2020 Democrats presidential candidates have weighed\u00a0in supporting the pro-worker legislation. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0wrote earlier this month in an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fighting for an America where everybody \u2013 even the biggest, richest and most well-connected companies \u2013 plays by the rules. Passing AB 5 gets us closer to that ideal.\u201d A spokesperson for the Bernie Sanders campaign said that the senator \u201cstrongly supports AB5,\u201d according to Cal Matters. Sen. Sanders has also specifically called for protections for the workers of ride-hailing services. Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif.,\u00a0also supports the bill.\u00a0Ian Sams, a Harris campaign spokesman told Vice, \u201cIn our evolving economy, she believes it's critical we ensure a robust social safety net for all workers and support their right to join a union.\u201d As for Ocasio-Cortez's beef with former lawmakers becoming lobbyists, she has joined forces with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to draft legislation which would prohibit the frequent move on the behalf of many ex-Capitol Hill lawmakers.",

Ireland was charged with \"one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, one count of being a fugitive in possession of a firearm and one count of making interstate threats,\" according to\u00a0the Department of Justice. According to the criminal complaint, at the end of July, the U.S. Capitol Police received a report from a person who'd perceived a Facebook post from\u00a0Timothy J. Ireland, Jr. as potentially threatening against Ocasio-Cortez.

Can\u2019t fire me, my employer would load the gun for me,\u201d Ireland had written on Facebook, along with a link to a story about Ocasio-Cortez. On August 2, the Capitol Police called Ireland at a number found in public records and asked him if he made the post and if he owned firearms. The Capitol Police said Ireland told them he was \"very proud of that post he made,\" and admitted to owning firearms. Six days later, Capitol Police and the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents searched Ireland's house after obtaining a search warrant. They detained him at the scene and\u00a0found seven rounds of ammunition inside his kitchen drawers\u00a0\u2013 three rounds of .32 caliber ammunition and four rounds of .45 caliber ammunition. Ireland told agents he did not have a gun in his house but brought ammunition with him when he\u00a0moved into the house. An FBI criminal background check of Ireland found\u00a0he had two outstanding warrants for failure to appear charges in Florida and Georgia, which stemmed\u00a0from a marijuana possession charge. The criminal complaint noted\u00a0Ireland had\u00a0also been convicted in 1996 of four felony counts of dealing in stolen property in Sarasota County, Fla. \u201cThere is absolutely no place in the marketplace of ideas for threats of violence against any person, especially those who are elected to represent the American people,\u201d U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said in a press release. \u201cDisagreement on political issues cannot lead to acts of violence, and if it does, we will seek federal prison time.\u201d More:Louisiana police officer's Facebook post says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 'needs a round,' report says Ocasio-Cortez has been outspoken about the number of threats that she receives as a high-profile member of Congress. \"I\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\" she wrote on Twitter at the end of May.",

Bernie Sanders learned Saturday that Amazon owner Jeff Bezos reportedly\u00a0asked\u00a0fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg about running for president, Sanders\u00a0couldn\u2019t contain his laughter to speak. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was in Iowa campaigning for Sanders, jumped in while Sanders composed himself. \u201cOf course!\u201d she said in an interview with the Des Moines Register. \u201cThey\u2019ve got class solidarity.\u00a0The billionaires are looking out for each other. They\u2019re willing to transcend difference and background and even politics. \"The fact that Bill Gates seems more willing to vote for Donald Trump than anyone else tells you everything you need to know about how far they\u2019re willing to go to protect their excess, at the cost to everyday Americans.\u201d Sanders jumped in to joke that the two billionaires make for their own \u201cstrong grassroots movement.\u201d More:Michael Bloomberg qualifies for Democratic primary ballot in Alabama \u201cJeff Bezos, worth $150 billion, supporting Mike Bloomberg, whose worth only $50 billion, that's real class solidarity,\u201d Sanders said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by that grassroots movement. We on the other hand have had over a million people contribute to our campaign, in millions of individual contributions averaging $16 a piece. That's what we get from working class people. So a little bit different approach to politics.\u201d On the campaign trail, Sanders frequently says\u00a0that Amazon raised its starting wage to $15 an hour after pressure from him. Earlier Saturday, at a Des Moines summit on the climate change crisis, Sanders criticized billionaires deciding to run for president just because they have tremendous wealth. He didn\u2019t name Bloomberg then, but made his point clear in an\u00a0interview. Extreme wealth inequality, coupled with lack of regulation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like unlimited political spending allowed under the Citizens United Supreme Court decision\u00a0\u2014 is seeping deeper into politics via things like the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of Bloomberg pondering a run, he said. \"He's deciding because he is worth $50 billion, he's going to run for president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe doesn't have to worry about coming into Iowa, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about going to New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina. He's just going to spend, I suspect, hundreds of millions of dollars in media in California because he's a billionaire. So that's the corruption of the political system based on the kind of massive wealth inequality that exists right now.\" Sanders brought up Bloomberg when tying his \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 the stated theme behind Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s visit to Iowa \u2014 to a broader \"class war\" Sanders sometimes describes on the campaign trail. \"When you talk about class warfare within the context of climate change, like Alexandria was just saying, the fossil fuels industry makes billions of billions of dollars in profits every single year, and the people who suffer the most are often lowest income people. But it's not just low income people. Family farmers in Iowa and\u00a0agriculture in Iowa is going to be suffering.\u201d The \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d would create \u201cmillions of good paying jobs while we save the planet for our children,\u201d Sanders promised. The $16.2 trillion proposal, spread over 10 years, aims to fundamentally remake the economy around renewable energy and decarbonization. Ocasio-Cortez, a lead sponsor of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d in Congress, agreed with the class war framework. Oil companies knew in the 1970s that carbon emissions would lead to global temperature increases, she said, and prioritized profits over being part of the solution. \"The climate crisis is not impacting all of us equally,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt's happening along class lines, so I think it's important to acknowledge the essential classism in the issue and how it's impacting us.\"",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Thursday held a Capitol Hill news conference to unveil\u00a0the first plank of the ambitious plan: a bill designed to make housing cheaper, safer and more environmentally friendly. The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act would set aside $180 billion over 10 years to repair existing apartments, upgrade health and safety features and\u00a0eliminate carbon emissions. The measure would also provide money\u00a0to electrify all public housing buildings with clean energy, add solar panels, and start powering apartments housing low-income Americans using renewable energy sources. Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0said it was no accident that the first legislation to implement the Green New Deal would center on poorer communities in urban and rural areas where widespread droughts, powerful hurricanes and strong tornadoes pose the greatest threat. \"This is how we show that tacking the climate crisis is an opportunity for\u00a0us to create an economic stimulus and an economic boon not just for Wall Street but for working people,\" she said at the news conference. Backers say the bill \"dramatically improves\" living conditions for nearly 2 million people living in roughly 1 million public homes. Sanders said the Green New Deal isn't \"just about climate change. It is an economic plan to create millions of good-paying jobs.\" Democratic pushback:After Green New Deal goes down, Democrats try less ambitious approach to climate change One of the\u00a0co-sponsors of the public housing bill is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is vying with Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The bill's prospects appear dim given that the Senate is currentcontrolled by Republicans and most House Democrats have yet to sign on to the Green New Deal. Thursday's announcement comes less than a month after Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders for president, a move that was seen as a key boost for the Vermont senator struggling to overtake Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden in the polls. More:Scientists want to help save the Earth by storing carbon dioxide in the ground Unveiled earlier this year, the Green New Deal calls\u00a0for shifting completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the coming years\u00a0and prescribes\u00a0a broad social justice platform that includes free housing, medical coverage and higher education for all Americans. Mocked by Republicans as a socialist program that would end air travel and demolish the economy, the program has also faced pushback by moderate Democrats who have argued for smaller steps such as having the U.S. rejoin the Paris accord on climate change.",

      "content": " ALBANY \u2013 Elise Stefanik made history in 2014 when she was elected at age 30 as the youngest woman to be elected to Congress. Now she is gaining new notoriety in Washington and the nation. The upstate New York Republican has become a staunch defender\u00a0of President Donald Trump during the House's impeachment hearings, drawing his praise but also scorn from Democrats. \"A new Republican Star is born. Great going\u00a0@EliseStefanik!,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning. The ascension is perhaps an unlikely role for Stefanik, who has sought to be a moderate Republican in a district that stretches from Saratoga County to the Canadian border and whose voters\u00a0backed Barack Obama twice before flipping to Trump in 2016. As the only Republican woman on the House Intelligence Committee, Stefanik, 35, has coveted the role of playing adversary to the Democratic-led impeachment proceedings. \"Thanks,\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0& EVERYONE for the outpouring of support!\" she wrote Sunday night on Twitter. \"I will continue to work hard to pursue the truth on behalf of my constituents. The Radical Left will continue their sick attacks on me but I\u2019m proud to represent the people of NY21!\" How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Democrats, however, have ripped Stefanik, leading to a frenzied stretch of campaign donations\u00a0for her and her opponent Tedra Cobb ahead of next November's\u00a0elections. \"This is about GOOD v EVIL, not politics NOT Democrat or Republican,\" state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, D-Pelham, Westchester County wrote Friday on Twitter. \"Truly a disappointment for the state of NY to have one our representatives on the wrong side of history.\" Stefanik has landed national attention for her piercing questions of witnesses during the hearings and her biting critiques of Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the Intelligence Committee. On Friday, she noted President Barack Obama's administration\u00a0also raised concerns with the service of Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, being on the board of the Ukraine-based energy company Burisma Holdings Stefanik insisted\u00a0the younger Biden\u2019s work for Burisma is\u00a0a vital point to raise. \u201cAnd yet our Democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry foul when we dare ask that same question that the Obama State Department was so concerned about,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cBut we will continue asking it.\u201d Later, Rep. Devin Nunes tried to\u00a0allocate time to Stefanik, but was disallowed by Schiff under House rules. \u201cWhat is the interruption this time?\u201d Stefanik responded.\u00a0\u201cThis is the fifth time you have interrupted duly elected members of Congress.\u201d Stefanik did criticize Trump, chiding him for tweets that targeted\u00a0U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch while she was testifying. \"I disagree with the tweet,\" Stefanik told reporters. \"I think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant, like many of our public servants in the foreign service.\" More:Impeachment hearing: Marie Yovanovitch calls Trump's attacks on her 'intimidating' As a minority party member, Stefanik is one of only 13 Republican women in the House. At one point, Republicans charged that Schiff was treating a woman lawmaker unfairly. \u201cYou are gagging the young lady from New York,\u201d Nunes said when Schiff prohibited her from speaking. The Harvard graduate's aggressiveness has drawn plaudits from her colleagues. \u201cShe\u2019s effective. She\u2019s a great spokesperson,\u201d\u00a0Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, another member of the Intelligence committee, told the Associated Press.\u00a0\u201cAnd these issues are in her wheelhouse.\u201d Republicans benefitted from having a woman lead the questioning of Yovanovitch, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., told the AP. Demings called Yovanovitch \u201ca female witness who is a career foreign service officer with an impeccable record.\" So if Republicans \"want to badger her, it\u2019s a better look when a woman has taken the lead on that.\u201d The major stage for Stefanik has led to national media profiles about her rise. The New York Post noted that she and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal New York lawmaker, are both among the youngest members of Congress, but have few similarities. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York City and grew up in Yorktown, Westchester, bested\u00a0Stefanik's record as the youngest woman elected to Congress in 2018\u00a0when she was elected at age 29. \u201cI am proudly the opposite of AOC,\u201d Stefanik told The Post.

Cobb announced Sunday she has surpassed $1 million raised, and Cobb received the backing of Star Wars icon Mark Hamill and celebrity Chrissy Teigen. \"I am happy to announce we raised $1 million dollars! It is impossible to express the feeling of gratitude I have tonight,\" Cobb wrote Sunday night on Twitter. \"Together we started something big but it\u2019s not over yet.\" Support for Cobb led to a fight on Twitter when George Conway, a Trump foe and husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Stefanik \"lying trash. Please give to her opponent.\" Nikki Haley, former U.S Ambassador to the United Nations, responded Monday, \"This is absolutely uncalled for and disgusting. What is wrong with people? George Conway is the last person that can call someone \u201ctrash\u201d. #Pathetic\" And Stefanik replied, \"The one thing I\u2019ve NEVER been called in my life is TRASH. You need serious help. My opponent Taxin\u2019 Tedra can have your sick mysogynist support.\" The barbs led Republicans to urge support of Stefanik, who is the first Republican to represent the district in 22 years, and to raise money for her re-election in 2020. She is just one of five Republicans among New York's 27 congressional members. The district stretches from the Capital region across the\u00a0Adirondacks and has 47,000 more Republicans than\u00a0Democrats. Local party leaders on Monday vowed in a joint letter their united support for\u00a0Stefanik \"as she leads our country through this historic moment.\" More:Judge delivers blow to Donald Trump's quest to shield his tax returns More:Donald Trump ordered to pay $2M to charity to settle Trump Foundation lawsuit",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. weighed in on D.C. statehood during a Thursday hearing on the issue and discussed the \"disenfranchisement\" of the District's people as rooted in the \"history of slavery.\" She opened her statement by talking about her family's roots in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and how her family had lacked the right to vote in federal elections. \"I wish that upon no citizen of the United States of America,\" she said. \"Where the disenfranchisement of Puerto Ricans was rooted in the colonialist and imperialistic history that we've had in policies of the United States, the issue of D.C. statehood is\u00a0rooted in a different evil in our history, which is the history of slavery in the United States,\u201d she added. Ocasio-Cortez cited the disenfranchisement of the\u00a0majority-minority city as \"upholding the injustice of the practices enacted during slavery.\" \"It is a profound injustice and a thick irony of our history that the people who fled here to the District of Columbia to free slavery because of the enlightenment of this community are now disenfranchised,\" she said, observing that the District was the first part of the Union to emancipate slaves. The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform was to debate a D.C. statehood\u00a0bill, aptly named \"H.R. 51,\" in the first House of Representatives hearing on statehood since 1993. How does statehood work?:Will DC become the 51st state? Advocates to make their case in Congress with boost from Elizabeth Warren Other debate in the hearing surrounded practical matters like the governance of buildings like the Trump International Hotel, which is in a building still owned by the federal government, but would be included within the boundaries of the new state. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., asked about its fate. D.C. Mayor Muriel\u00a0Bowser told him that all hotels would be included in the new state. The question drew derision from Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who joked that the hotel was the \"Washington Monument.\" \"It's amazing to me that the political rights of 700,000 people might be conditioned on the business interests of one man,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.",
