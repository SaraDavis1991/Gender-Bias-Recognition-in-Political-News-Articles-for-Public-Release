In the past five years in North Dakota, 8 children have died and 1,037 youngsters 12 and younger were injured in motor vehicle crashes. The health department recommends keeping children in rear-facing car seats for as long as possible. Once a child outgrows the rear-facing seats, a forward-facing car seat with a harness should be used. And, after outgrowing the forward-facing seat, children should be placed in a booster seat until they are the right size to use just a seat belt."

The Department of Health and Welfare says the cat in Owyhee County was behaving aggressively and bit its owner. It tested positive for a strain of rabies normally associated with bats. The department’s state public health veterinarian, Dr. Leslie Tengelsen, said in a prepared statement that rabies is fatal virtually 100% of the time. She said the cat was likely exposed to a rabid bat, and that’s how it became infected. Tengelsen said pet owners should vaccinate their dogs, cats, ferrets and horses against the disease.

If approved as proposed, Dominion says the approximately $7.8 billion project could produce more than 2,600 megawatts of energy during peak wind by 2026, enough to power 650,000 homes. “This is, to us, big news. It’s a big step for us to accomplish our carbon reduction goals,” says Mark Mitchell, vice president of generation construction for Richmond-based Dominion. The project has been years in the making.

The appeals court put PolyMet’s dam safety permit and its permit to mine on hold, ruling Wednesday that the Department of Natural Resources failed to adequately consider two important developments that happened after the agency issued the permits in November 2018. One was the massive failure of a tailings basin dam at an iron mine in Brazil in January that was somewhat similar to the dam PolyMet plans to build near Hoyt Lakes, in the Iron Range about 190 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The other is the acquisition of a majority stake in PolyMet by the Swiss commodities giant Glencore in June, Minnesota Public Radio reports."

Taylor took over as state superintendent after her predecessor, Tony Evers, was elected governor. The speech comes a week after standardized test scores showed that less than half of Wisconsin students are proficient in math and English. The scores also showed a continuing achievement gap. Stanford Taylor says progress is being made to address “deep, persistent gaps in achievement, access and opportunity.” Democrats say the poor test results showed the need to increase funding for K-12 schools, while Republicans say they showed that the status quo was not working."

Because no one claimed the ship’s remains, the state can now move forward in federal court to take permanent possession. Researchers identified the wreckage of the ship earlier this year north of Mobile. Officials say they’re unsure how much of the Clotilda remains, but they believe at least some of the hull could be intact in the muddy bottom of the Mobile River near an island.

The guidelines posted on the Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton websites say e-bikes and traditional bicycles are barred from boardwalks, snow routes and nearly all backcountry trails. E-bikes can reach speeds of 28 mph or higher. Outdoor and conservation groups have objected to allowing them in parks without additional study or public notice."

The Long Island Democrat cited estimates that hotels in New York City alone dispose of an estimated 27 million plastic toiletry bottles annually. If the ban were enacted, hotels could instead use wall-mounted dispensers or packaging made from non-plastic materials. The idea is gaining support in the industry, with the Hotel Association of New York City and the state Hospitality and Tourism Association both backing Kaminsky’s idea. Last month Marriott International, the world’s largest hotel chain, announced plans to eliminate small plastic toiletry bottles worldwide by December 2020."

Officials say the bill was one of several being considered by lawmakers Wednesday, but it also requires approval of the full Legislature. State lawmakers say currently people age 18 and older are allowed to purchase tobacco products. Officials say 18 states have risen their minimum smoking age to 21 with some exemptions for military members. Officials say enforcing existing laws and a higher purchase age could be effective at discouraging young people from purchasing products illegally. Officials say 95% of smokers start before the age of 21."

The New Haven Register reports Officer Jason Bandy sued city police this week. His attorney says the department has “no rules, regulations or policies” regarding tattoos or body art, and no women in the department have been disciplined because of piercings, makeup, jewelry or other items. Chief Otoniel Reyes said the department cannot comment on personnel matters or on pending litigation. The former chief recommended firing Bandy because the tattoos violated a general order requiring officers to “present a neat and clean appearance.” Bandy agreed to cover the tattoos while on duty. According to a previous Register story, the tattoos include a Latin phrase, date and the letter “D.”"
