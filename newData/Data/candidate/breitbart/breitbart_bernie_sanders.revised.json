      "content": " Michael Moore addressed some of the common critiques of Sanders \u2014 most specifically, that he is \u201ctoo old\u201d and unhealthy to be president. Moore dismissed both arguments, declaring that he is \u201cglad\u201d that Sanders is 78 and calling the Electoral College \u201ctoo old.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s 78, and we will benefit for his wisdom and his experience and his knowledge and his love for the American people,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,\u201d Moore continued, addressing what he believes is really \u201ctoo old\u201d in the country. \u201cWell here\u2019s what\u2019s too old. The Electoral College is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d the\u00a0Fahrenheit 11/9\u00a0director said. \u201cA $7.25 minimum wage \u2014 that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men \u2014 that\u2019s too old.\u201d \u201cThousands and thousands of dollars in student debt. What is that?\u201d he asked, to which the crowd shouted, \u201cToo old!\u201d \u201cA $10,000 deductible for your health care. What is that?\u201d Moore asked again, with the crowd shouting, \u201cToo old!\u201d \u201cSuper delegates. What\u2019s that? Fossil fuel. What\u2019s that? That\u2019s what\u2019s too old!\u201d he exclaimed. Moore also addressed the concerns over Sanders\u2019 health. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore said, later chanting, \u201cGreen New Deal!\u201d",

We are not going to spend too much time talking about a racist, demagogue, xenophobic, paper-throwing, president. The mayor\u2019s mention of President Trump prompted many Sanders supporters to chant \u201cLock Him Up\u201d \u2014 a play on the\u00a0\u201cLock Her Up\u201d slogan\u00a0synonymous with failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s vote him out,\u201d Cruz responded to attendees, before leading a \u201cVote Him Out\u201d chant. Cruz has repeatedly criticized President Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which killed\u00a03,057 people across the\u00a0U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in September 2017. Yet, it is Cruz and other members of her administration that are under investigation by the FBI for allegedly keeping supplies from reaching the victims. The \u201cBernie\u2019s\u00a0Back \u201crally marked the Sanders campaign\u2019s first\u00a0rally\u00a0since the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack two weeks ago. Storming past questions about his health, Sanders vowed that he\u2019s \u201cmore ready than ever\u201d to fight for a political revolution \u2014 with a little help from new friends \u2014 at his rally that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the democratic socialist is still very much a force in the presidential race. Sanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back,\u201d Sanders declared, sparking chants of, \u201cBernie is back\u201d from the massive crowd. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he added. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d The event marked Sanders\u2019 formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he\u2019s lagging behind liberal rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and establishment favorite former Vice President Joe Biden. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), both of whom formally offered their endorsements of the presidential hopeful. The socialist senator spoke following speeches from his endorsers and outlined his broad vision to not only radically transform the country but to \u201ccreate a new America\u201d altogether. Sanders stated: Standing before you today, I believe more than I have ever believed, that we are at a moment in our great country\u2019s history where all of us coming together can create the America that we are entitled to have. The America we know that we can become. \u201cWe can create a new America true to the principles that are supposed to be the foundation of our democracy,\u201d he said, failing to elaborate on what he believes the country\u2019s founding principles are truly \u201csupposed to\u201d be. Sanders\u2019 call for the creation of a \u201cnew America\u201d follows his recent pleas to fundamentally \u201ctransform\u201d the country. He told attendees of his rally at Denver\u2019s Civic Center in September that the 2020 election is about more than defeating President Trump, and he asked them to help him \u201ctransform this country\u201d and wage \u201ca political revolution.\u201d \u201cI am here in Denver asking your support for more than just defeating Trump,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI am here to ask you to help me transform this country and create an economy and government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.\u201d \u201cI am here in Denver to ask you to wage with me a political revolution, which will take on not only the corruption of Washington but the greed and corruption of the corporate elite in this country,\u201d he added. As Axios noted in August, Sanders\u2019 utopian vision for the country \u2013 offering \u201cfree\u201d health care and college, exponentially raising taxes, and implementing a multi-trillion-dollar proposal to combat \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 would essentially \u201creorder or referee almost every part of American life.\u201d Sanders wrote on Instagram following his rally: Thank you Queens for an incredible day! If there is one thing I want you to remember, it is this: If you are willing to fight for other people as much as you\u2019re willing to fight for yourself, there is no doubt in my mind that not only will we win this election.\u00a0We will transform this country.

      "content": " Sanders\u2019s campaign estimated that 26,000 people attended his rally, where he was formally endorsed by left-wing icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Though an independent crowd estimate was not reported, a security firm that worked at the event counted 25,872 attendees, according to the\u00a0Washington Examiner. The\u00a0Examiner said the city had issued a permit for 15,000 people in the local park, but that about 10,000 people watched from outside. In contrast, Warren\u2019s campaign estimated that 20,000 people showed up for her rally in Washington Square Park in the heart of lower Manhattan in September, though the park itself only holds 10,000, the maximum permitted for the event. Warren\u2019s campaign has a consistent habit of exaggerating its crowd sizes; Biden rarely draws large crowds. Though Warren now leads in many national polls of Democratic party presidential primary voters, especially in the states that will vote first, Sanders is still clinging to his spot among the three frontrunners, together with former Vice President Joe Biden. He used the rally to send the message that he has recovered from a heart attack just two weeks before. At 78, he is the oldest candidate in the race \u2014 though both Biden and Warren are also in their seventies. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is taking the fight to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment after a spat Friday in which the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee claimed Gabbard was a Russian puppet.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " In a video released Sunday on Twitter, Gabbard talks about the origins of her long-simmering feud with Democratic leaders, dating back to her support for the insurgent campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016. Gabbard resigned from her post within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at the way then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was treating Sanders. Her concerns were later vindicated by Wikileaks, which released emails showing that party leaders had conspired to help Clinton secure the nomination, forcing Schultz to resign. In Sunday\u2019s video, Gabbard recalls: \u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my \u2018political career.\u2019 They said, \u2018Clinton will never forget,\u2019 that \u2018she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media, will make sure that you are destroyed.'\u201d  Gibbered then refers to the \u201ccountless hit pieces\u201d against her in the mainstream media, the most recent of which was an Oct. 11 article in the\u00a0New York Times painting Gabbard as a right-wing extremist. (The\u00a0Times hosted the fourth primary debate just three days later, and the article \u2014 which lacked any evidence \u2014 was seen by some as an effort to marginalize Gabbard after she had attacked Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) effectively in the second debate.) Citing her 16 years of military service in the U.S. Army National Guard, and her congressional service on national security committees, Gabbard rebukes Clinton and others for \u201cfalsely portray[ing] me as a traitor.\u201d Clinton claimed in a podcast hosted by former Barack Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe last week that Gabbard was a \u201cRussian asset\u201d likely to run as a third-party candidate. She cited no evidence to back up her claim \u2014 which Gabbard promptly rejected, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of the warmongers\u201d and blaming her for a string of media smears. In her video, Gabbard goes on to say that the message of the party establishment is that \u201cif you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d \u201cThey will not intimidate us,\u201d she declares. \u201cThe will not silence us.\u201d Gabbard goes on to say that not only is she running against corruption, but against the Democratic Party elite. \u201cI\u2019m running for president to bring about a New Democratic Party, a new leadership that will fight for peace, fight for the people, and protect our planet.\u201d Separately the Gabbard campaign sent fundraising emails over the weekend capitalizing on the confrontation with Hillary Clinton. The email from Gabbard read, in part (original emphasis): Hillary Clinton \u2014 the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long \u2014 finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset, asserting I was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russian interests. If this a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly. Gabbard has struggled to escape the second tier of presidential candidates, and failed to qualify for the third debate in September. However, she has made an impact in each debate appearance, partly because of her strong anti-war stance, and partly because of her willingness to attack other candidates\u2019 positions \u2014 something few others have been bold enough to do until recently. Though she supported Sanders in 2016, Gabbard has more moderate positions on several issues. She does not believe in decriminalizing illegal border crossings, for example, and would restrict many abortions in the third trimester \u2014 a position widely shared by the American public but which few of her rivals would dare to take. She has come under fire in recent years for her opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria \u2014 a position she has pursued, in part, through a controversial visit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a similar visit in 2007. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " The new poll by Iowa Emerson College\u00a0showed that only six percent of registered voters in Iowa said impeachment was their top issue. In comparison, 33 percent said the economy was the top issue, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent said social issues. Even among just Democrats, 25 percent said health care was the most important issue, 17 percent said the economy, and 14 percent said the environment. Among Republicans, 55 percent said the economy was the most important issue, 14 percent said immigration. Among independents, 27 percent said the economy was the most important issue and 24 percent said health care. In other words \u2014 impeachment is not within the top issues that Iowa voters care about. The Iowa poll also found a plurality of voters \u2014 48 percent \u2014 oppose impeachment, versus 42 percent who support impeachment. However, last week, three Democrat-led House committees held three separate closed-door hearings with current and former U.S. and State Department officials as part of House Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach Trump. And the fourth Democrat debate on Wednesday began with the issue of impeachment. \u201cThe Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,\u201d said Spencer Kimball, director of Emerson Polling. A recent Axios focus group showed that nine out of 11 swing voters in Ohio\u00a0said impeachment is a distraction from the issues they care most about, which are wages and unemployment, border security, bringing troops home, and health care costs and access. With all but less than a dozen House Democrats supporting impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, it is considered increasingly inevitable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has told Republican senators that he expects House Democrats will seek to impeach Trump. He has vowed in a campaign video he will stop it in the Senate. The poll also showed that in a head-to-head matchup, Trump has a slight advantage over Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden, 51 percent to 49 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has a two-point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent. Among the Democrat candidates, Warren and Biden are tied at 23 percent, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent, and Sanders fourth at 13 percent. The Iowa poll was conducted October 13-16, 2019, with a sample size of 888 registered voters. The margin of error was +/- 3.2 percentage points. Follow Breitbart News\u2019\u00a0@Kristina_Wong.",

      "content": " The analysis finds 66 percent of millennials actually have no student debt, \u201ceither because they did not attend college or did not acquire debt in the process,\u201d says the report by Beth Akers, Manhattan Institute senior fellow.  \u201cThe typical graduate will have borrowed $28,500 in pursuit of a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThat can be repaid with monthly payments of $181 on a standard, 20-year repayment plan.\u201d Secondly, only 6 percent of student borrowers have more than $100,000 in debt. Most of these borrowers have graduate or professional degrees and often come from families with higher income. \u201cMore than one-third of outstanding student debt is held by individuals who are themselves in the highest income quartile,\u201d with individual income greater than $97,000, the report observes. \u201cTypically, those in trouble are not the ones with high debt but those who never completed college \u2013 default rates are highest for those with less than $5,000 in debt.\u201d Thirdly, the report notes the mean income for all millennials \u2013 including those without college degrees \u2013 is $46,092: Under the existing income-driven repayment programs for all federal student loans \u2026 borrowers with this level of income would never be required to pay more than $173 per month (4.5% of pretax income), regardless of how much they had borrowed. \u201cThe typical millennial has no student debt,\u201d Akers writes. \u201cEven among those who pursued higher education and borrowed to fund it, a typical household with two college-educated workers has more than $100,000 in annual income and pays less than $400 monthly on their loans.\u201d Instead of loan forgiveness, Akers recommends that federal intervention \u201cfocus on the small subset of borrowers with unmanageable debt burdens and ensure that they still repay what they can afford. Those programs already exist.\u201d The report is released as Democrats plan to reauthorize the Higher Education Act with provisions that would allow for massive \u201cstealth\u201d student loan forgiveness, as Preston Cooper wrote at Forbes. Continuing along the path of the Obama administration, which ultimately allowed more student loans to be \u201cforgiven,\u201d the Democrats\u2019 plan contains a proposal that changes how loan payments for student borrowers are calculated based on income. Cooper observes: Currently, borrowers in these plans pay an amount equal to 10% of their income above 150% of the poverty line (about $25,000 for a household of two). House Democrats would raise that threshold to 250% of the poverty line, slashing monthly payments for some borrowers and eliminating them for others. As it stands now, student debt after 20 years of repayment is \u201cforgiven.\u201d Raising the threshold of the poverty line, however, means American taxpayers will be stuck with billions in student loan \u201cforgiveness.\u201d In October 2018, Jason Delisle and Cody Christensen wrote at National Review the Democrats\u2019 plan \u201cwould let borrowers out of loans they could afford to pay back.\u201d They explain that a typical student borrower has an income of about $35,000 and, currently, would pay $140 per month in loan repayment, with \u201cforgiveness\u201d after 20 years of repayment. An increase in the income exemption to 250 percent of the poverty line, however, \u201cmeans the borrower\u2019s initial payments would be just $39.\u201d While payments would grow as the borrower\u2019s income increases, under the Democrats\u2019 plan payments \u201cwould still be so low that they would barely cover the\u00a0interest\u00a0on the $30,000 loan,\u201d the authors noted. \u201cThat would mean\u00a0all\u00a0of the original principal balance would have to be forgiven after 20 years of payments.\u201d Many Democrat presidential hopefuls claim college graduates are crushed by student debt that prevents them from getting ahead and stimulating the economy. Both 2020 candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have plans to cancel student debt. Sanders\u2019 proposal would eliminate all existing student loan debt in the country. His campaign website states, if elected, he will \u201ccancel the entire $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt for the 45 million borrowers who are weighed down by the crushing burden of student debt.\u201d Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan contains caps, but would still cancel $1.25 trillion in student debt for 42 million people. Her proposal would forgive $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of $100,000. Those whose households make between $100,000 and $250,000 would have a portion of their student debt forgiven. In August, the Wall Street Journal editorial board minced no words in asserting American taxpayers are victims of a student loan \u201cscam.\u201d The board noted the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s quarterly household debt survey released the week before showed more Americans are defaulting on their student loans. The editors observed delinquent student loans have risen dramatically since 2012, when Barack Obama was president, and have overtaken delinquencies in credit card payments, auto loans, and mortgages. During the Obama era, they noted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u201cscored student loans as a government profit center by underestimating the growth in income-based repayment plans.\u201d Now, however, CBO predicts taxpayers will be on the hook for $306.7 billion over the next ten years. Of course, with the influx of taxpayer funds to pick up the tab, the WSJ board points out income-based repayment plans \u201chave also encouraged schools to raise prices and enroll students who probably won\u2019t earn enough to pay off their loans,\u201d knowing those students ultimately will be \u201cforgiven\u201d by taxpayers. As it happens, \u201cAmericans who borrow more than they can repay typically default first on student loans,\u201d the editors say. But, while defaults on mortgages and car loans have serious consequences, individuals who default on student loans \u201care encouraged to enroll in income-based repayment plans.\u201d The editorial board warns of substantial losses for American taxpayers due to the Obama-era repayment scheme that current Democrats plan to take to new heights. \u201cAll of this is worth keeping in mind as Democrats promise to save taxpayers billions by taking over other private industries and expanding the cradle-to-grave entitlement state,\u201d the board says.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren has established herself as a fierce proponent of a single-payer health care system, but she has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in admitting that the plan will result in taxes going up for middle class Americans. The presidential hopeful told a crowd at a town hall event in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday that she will soon release an outline detailing the plan to fund the system, which by some estimates could cost over $60 trillion in the next decade. \u201cWe need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and specifically how we pay for it,\u201d Warren told the crowd. \u201cI think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I\u2019ve been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,\u201d she told reporters:  Moderators \u2013 in more than one Democrat debate \u2013 have asked Warren if she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All. Each time, the Massachusetts senator has offered notoriously evasive responses, talking about overall \u201ccost\u201d rather than directly explaining if taxes will go up for the middle class. Moderators presented her with the same question during last week\u2019s Democrat debate, and Warren went to her go-to talking point, arguing that overcall costs will go up for the \u201cwealthy and big corporations\u201d and go down for middle-class families. That answer sparked criticism from Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who slammed Warren for repeatedly dodging the question. \u201cWell, you heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d he continued. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this.\u201d Warren would not budge in the spin room following the debate, telling the panel, \u201cMy commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.\u201d Sanders, on the other hand, has been very open about the cost of his plan. While he also believes that it is about overall \u201ccosts,\u201d \u2013 arguing that middle class Americans will ultimately save money due to health care costs supposedly going down \u2013 he admitted last month that health care is not free. \u201cNow having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,\u201d Sanders told late-night host Stephen Colbert last month. \u201cSo what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person\u2019s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes.\u201d \u201cAbove that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if I say to you, that right now you\u2019re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That\u2019s gone.\u201d",

Appearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, the failed presidential candidate\u00a0claimed: [Russia]\u00a0has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it. Shortly later,\u00a0Gabbard\u00a0\u2014 a combat military veteran and Army National Guard\u00a0Major \u2014 hit back at Clinton in a series of tweets, slamming her as the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and accusing her of being behind a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0hit piece\u00a0published\u00a0ahead of last Tuesday Democrat presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio:   Gabbard doubled down against Clinton in a video shared to Twitter on Sunday, warning\u00a0that \u201cif you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d  \u201cThey will not intimidate us,\u201d declared the lawmaker. \u201cThey will not silence us.\u201d President Donald Trump has also weighed in on Clinton\u2019s claims against Gabbard, calling his former presidential rival \u201ccrazy\u201d for her comments. \u201cSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again!

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Paul, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and prominent libertarian, said he remembers in the 1970s and 1980s when Americans would never admit to being socialists, let alone a liberal. Today, he said, Democrats are openly running on socialist platforms, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling, actually,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe now live in a time where not only are people talking about socialism, they\u2019re proudly running as a socialist.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important for this generation to realize what socialism was in the last century\u00a0and how [it] really invariably was associated with violence, with genocide, with famine, with horrible tragedy and you know, today\u2019s youth seems to have forgotten that,\u201d he said. He said in China, as many as 40 million died during the Great Famine in the late 1950s, and today, in Venezuela, people are eating their pets. \u201cThat is the end result of socialism, there is no food in the stores,\u201d he said. \u201cVenezuela has more oil than any other country in the world, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia, they were one of the richest countries, and now they\u2019re in calamitous poverty.\u201d His book tells the story of a young woman in Venezuela in a gang that controls territory \u2014 six dumpsters where they can search for food. \u201cHow did they get there?\u00a0It\u2019s almost, it\u2019s mind-boggling. How do you even explain it?\u201d he said. He said he does not think America is ready for socialism, but pointed out that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2014 who does not call herself a socialist but is running on socialist policies \u2014 appears to be the Democrat frontrunner. \u201cThe socialist doesn\u2019t win, but the person who has all the same policies who doesn\u2019t call herself a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, and right now is looking like the frontrunner, but she\u2019s for most of the policies that Bernie Sanders is for and so that will be the question, will we elect someone with socialist policies?\u201d he said. Paul debunked the myth that there is socialism in Scandinavia. \u201cThey\u2019re not socialist in Scandinavia. They have private property, they have a private stock market, they don\u2019t even have a minimum wage, prices go up and down, but they do have a big welfare state. So while they\u2019re not socialist they have a big welfare state. They do have free college, free paid leave, all these sort of welfare goodies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out in Scandinavia, the way they pay for free college and all this so-called free stuff is they tax the working class, and the middle class, extensively, so there\u2019s a 25 percent sales tax, they call it a VAT, it\u2019s on food, clothing, everything, you name it. Twenty-five percent so everybody pays that, including the poor. So that\u2019s a pretty significant tax \u2014 25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also have an income tax that\u2019s 60 percent starting at $60,000. That\u2019s way higher than the United States. So the dirty little secret of Scandinavia is you can have a welfare state but everybody\u2019s got to pay taxes,\u201d he said. He said back in the U.S., Warren is promising Medicare-for-all without saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. \u201cShe won\u2019t answer the question. Now Bernie has, he said we\u2019ll raise taxes on the middle class but they\u2019ll save money on their healthcare cause it\u2019ll be \u2018free,'\u201d he said. \u201cWell Elizabeth Warren won\u2019t answer that question, I think that\u2019s going to be an important question for her, and we\u2019ll see, and even the left and the establishment media and the left are going, \u2018Elizabeth, how are you going to pay for this?\u2019 and I think she\u2019s boxed in a corner and eventually she\u2019s going to have to admit \u2014 with massive middle class taxes.\u201d  Follow Breitbart News\u2019s\u00a0@Kristina_Wong.",

Rather, she looked at the \u201cfeminist values in the campaign.\u201d \u201cFor me, this is not about \u2018Why not any other candidate?'\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. \u201cThe fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.\u201d \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it\u2019s far larger than a presidential campaign,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar\u2019s remarks. \u201cThis is about creating a mass movement.\u201d Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing \u201cterrific work.\u201d \u201cI am a fan of the congresswoman. She\u2019s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we\u2019re all going to be on the same side,\u201d Warren\u00a0said. Ocasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders. \u201cI think she\u2019s\u00a0[Warren] a fabulous candidate and so frankly, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and myself are all on the same team in the party,\u201d she said: ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a Business Insider report, which found that an individual needs to make \u201cat least $500,000 a year\u201d in order to make the \u201ctop one percent\u201d in the United States. \u201cA lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in \u2018the 1%.\u2019 That may be bc it\u2019s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cEven this number \u2013 $500k \u2013 reflects top income, & even THAT doesn\u2019t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth,\u201d she added:  The socialist lawmaker\u2019s public complaint regarding the reality of \u201cincome inequality\u201d comes just one day after she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\u00a0\u2013 a millionaire \u2013 for president. According to Forbes, Sanders has a $2.5 million fortune, which he acquired via \u201cestate, investments, government pensions\u2014and earnings from three books,\u201d many of which lament the very system that made his wealth possible. While his senator\u2019s salary is $174,000 per year, Forbes notes that the socialist lawmaker has made a \u201csix-figure annual salary since he joined Congress in 1991\u201d: With 28 years in office and a current salary of $174,000, Sanders is entitled to around $73,000 a year from the federal government for the rest of his life. If he were to sell that guaranteed income stream for a lump-sum pile of cash, Forbes figures he could get around $650,000 for it. In 2016, Sanders purchased a $575,000 lake house \u2013 dubbed a \u201csummer home\u201d \u2013 in the Champlain Islands, making the socialist the proud owner of not one, not two, but three homes. Despite Sanders\u2019 commitment to make the wealthy pay their \u201cfair share\u201d and eradicate the existence of billionaires, Sanders has been defensive of his own wealth accumulation. \u201cI wrote a best-selling book,\u201d he quipped during an interview with the New York Times this year. \u201cIf you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\u201d Supporters of Sanders \u2013 many of whom are part of the wealthy elite (such as Michael Moore, who has a net worth of roughly $50 million) \u2013\u00a0believe that the government should play a key role in \u201credistributing\u201d wealth. Proponents of capitalism, however, believe that individuals in the private sector can create a better society and argue that self-interest benefits everyone, not just the \u201cone percent\u201d\u2013 a sentiment outlined by Founding Father Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations. Tax returns show that Sanders and his wife donated just 3.4 percent of their $566,000 income \u2013\u00a0or $19,000 \u2013 to charity in 2018. Despite that, Sanders has consistently slammed the wealthy for not paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d The presidential hopeful unveiled a massive plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d last month, which would impose a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. According to the plan: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.  Sanders reiterated in April that the wealthy \u2013\u00a0including himself \u2013\u00a0needs to pay their fair share but argued that he already pays the taxes that he owes. \u201c[Y]our taxes do show that you\u2019re a millionaire. You did make a million in 2016 and 2017. You\u2019re right, the 561 [thousand] in 2018, but your marginal tax rate was 26% because of President Trump\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d Bret Baier said during a Fox News town hall with Sanders in April. \u201cSo, why not say, I\u2019m leading this revolution, I\u2019m not going to take those?\u201d he asked. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re nearing \u2014 I am \u2014 I pay the taxes that I owe, and by the way, why don\u2019t you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes?\u201d Sanders responded, failing to explain why he did not decline the tax cut and give more the IRS voluntarily.",

Martin continued: With doubts rising about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?'\u201d said longtime Democrat, Leah Daughtry \u00a0at the dinner hosted by the progressive group, American Bridge. However, Martin wrote the \u201cmood of alarm is even more intense because of the party\u2019s hunger to defeat President Trump and \u2014 with just over three months to go before voting starts in Iowa \u2014 their impatience with finding Mr. or Mrs. Right among the current crop of candidates.\u201d In May, Breitbart News reported that Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said none of the current Democrat candidates could beat President Trump in 2020. \u201cIf you look at why people voted for Donald Trump, in my opinion, first and foremost it was because he wasn\u2019t a politician,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cPoliticians are the least trusted of every profession.\u201d On Monday, Democrat presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) said he would exit the race unless his campaign could raise a significant amount of funds in the coming days. \u201c[T]his is a critical moment\u2014 if my campaign can\u2019t raise $800,000 by October 31st, my campaign will be silenced for good,\u201d he stated. However, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s (D-HI) campaign gained traction among potential voters this week after Hillary Clinton accused her of being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Russians to be a third-party candidate. \u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Monday in her defense.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Omar responded to a New York Times\u00a0op-ed, which essentially argues\u00a0the U.S. should cut military spending and instead use the money to pay for the costly Medicare for All system. According to the op-ed: Over 18 years, the United States has spent\u00a0$4.9 trillion on wars, with only more intractable violence in the Middle East and beyond to show for it. That\u2019s nearly the\u00a0$300 billion per year\u00a0over the current system that is estimated to cover Medicare for All (though\u00a0estimates vary). While we can\u2019t un-spend that $4.9 trillion, imagine if we could make different choices for the next 20 years. We\u2019ve identified\u00a0more than $300 billion in annual military savings alone that we could better invest in priorities like Medicare for All, working with a national grassroots movement called\u00a0Poor People\u2019s Campaign. \u201cWe can afford Medicare for All,\u201d Omar wrote. \u201cWhat we cannot afford is losing more lives to endless wars and a health insurance industry that profits off sickness\u201d:  While estimates tend to vary, one from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University assessed that the government-run healthcare system would cost $32 trillion over the next decade alone and would require massive tax increases. It would ultimately result in a \u201ctransformative change in the size of the federal government,\u201d according to the study\u2019s author Charles Blahous. As Breitbart News reported: Blahous argues that the estimates for the $32 trillion price tag are relatively conservative because they assume that Sanders\u2019 bill achieves its goals of reducing payments to health providers, as well as lowering drug prices and administrative costs. The Mercatus Center\u00a0suggested\u00a0that doubling federal individual and corporate income tax would not cover the costs of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. However, Blahous later testified before the House Rules Committee\u2019s hearing on Medicare for All and said the federal government\u2019s total spending on a government-run healthcare system could top $60 trillion over the next decade. As Breitbart News reported: Blahous said that the $32 trillion price tag was too conservative and that given historical spending levels on health care, net new federal spending would likely increase spending by $38.8 trillion over the next ten years and would increase federal healthcare spending to 13 to 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Mercatus scholar also noted that the Medicare for All\u2019s total federal spending price over the next ten years would amount to between $54.6 trillion and $60.7 trillion. Blahous mentioned that \u201cdoubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound\u201d of the $32.6 trillion in new federal spending. Most Americans, 64 percent, are opposed to paying more in taxes to implement Medicare for All, according to a Locust Street Group released in August. Omar\u2019s position follows her endorsement of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who remains a fierce proponent of a single-payer system. Sanders has been extremely forthcoming on how he would pay for the implementation of the multi-trillion dollar proposal, openly admitting that taxes will go up for middle class Americans but arguing that overall \u201ccost\u201d will go down as premiums are erased. The latter is an argument Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made repeatedly, but she has yet to explicitly say if she would raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for Medicare for All. \u201cWhat our bill does \u2026 what people should understand is that what Medicare for All does is eliminates your private health insurance premiums. You\u2019re not going to be paying that, you\u2019re not going to be paying co-payments, you\u2019re not going to be paying deductibles,\u2019 Sanders told\u00a0Iowa CBS affiliate KCCI in May. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be seeing your prescription drug cost, in my view, come down by 50 percent. Will you be paying more in taxes? Yes, you will,\u201d he added. Cost, however, is not the only concern. Opponents of Medicare for All also point to bureaucratic mismanagement and argue that a government-run healthcare system will result in a sharp decline in overall quality of care.",

Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks \u2013 with Warren topping Biden in some cases \u2013 Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field. The current results, taken\u00a0Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline \u2013 falling from a 40 percent high in May \u2013 and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March. Notably, though, is Biden\u2019s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders\u2019 remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren\u2019s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent. Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden\u2019s 24 percent. The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg. The results of the survey are based on\u00a011,521 interviews with registered voters \u201cwho indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus.\u201d The margin of error is +/- 1 percent.",

Bernie Sanders has 16 percent while Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris only have six percent support each. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke end up with three percent support. Political analysts believed the fourth Democrat debate hosted by CNN would shake up the race, as Biden continued to deliver an underwhelming performance and other candidates targeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. And respondents seemed to agree with this assessment. When asked \u201cwhich candidate do you think did the best job in the debate?\u201d Warren was ranked number one with 28%, Biden second at 15%, and Bernie Sanders third at 13%. Yet Biden\u2019s support jumped ten points from the last poll taken in September, from 24 percent to 34 percent. Warren only increased her support by one percent. Biden was also targeted by President Donald Trump for corruption in recent weeks, as the president attacked Biden\u2019s son Hunter for his shady foreign business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president. A big majority of moderate/conservative Democrat voters chose Biden as their first choice; 43 percent to Warren\u2019s 12 percent and Bernie Sanders ten percent. Fifty-three percent of potential Democrat voters in the poll said that they might change their minds, while 46 percent said that they would definitely support their first choice. The CNN Poll was conducted from October 17-20 by SSRS of 1,003 adults, 424 registered voters who identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. The margin of error among potential Democrat voters is +/- 5.8 points.",

      "content": " The big news today is a poll from the far-left CNN, which shows former Vice President Joe Biden surging to a 34 to 19 percent lead over Warren, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hanging on \u2014 heart attack and all \u2014 to third place with 16 percent support. Granted, this is only one poll, and it is CNN, but if Biden is indeed at 34 percent nationally, that is about where a frontrunner needs to be. Thirty-five percent is considered the safe zone in a crowded race. While I don\u2019t have an enormous amount of faith in CNN\u2019s polling, comparing the trends within a particular poll is always useful, and those look especially bad for America\u2019s Favorite Fake Indian. Since June, in this same poll, Warren\u2019s favorability number has climbed just two points, from 36 to 38 percent, but her unfavorable rating has also climbed, from 38 to 41 percent. Most importantly, she is upside down on favorability, 38 to 41 percent, and the only top tier Democrat candidate with that problem. By comparison, Sanders enjoys 48 to 45 percent favorability rating. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is right-side up at 28 to 23 percent. Joe Biden enjoys an incredible advantage at 74 to 20 percent. On the top four issues of the day, Biden enjoys a wide lead among Democrats. On foreign policy, 56 percent say Biden will do the best job, compared to 13 percent for Sanders and just 11 percent for Warren. On the economy, it\u2019s Biden 38 percent, Sanders 19 percent, and Warren 16 percent. On guns , it\u2019s Biden 27 percent, Sanders 13 percent, and Warren 11 percent. On immigration, it\u2019s Biden 29 percent, with Warren and Sanders tied at 16 percent. In worse news for Chief Lies-Like-a-Rug, Warren is slipping everywhere else. Two weeks ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Warren was tied with Biden nationally and even led in a number of polls. In the seven most recent polls, however, Biden has a steady lead; in six of those polls he leads anywhere from 8 to 15 points. The real problem for Warren, though, is that she wilts under scrutiny. As soon as the \u201cfrontrunner\u201d status swung the spotlight her way, everything that makes Elizabeth Warren a terrible candidate was once again magnified times ten. On top of her extremist policies, she\u2019s a weak, shrill, dishonest neurotic. During this last debate, there was nothing to instill confidence among those looking for someone tough enough to take on Trump, especially when she dissembled over and over again when asked a simple question about how she intends to pay for her Medicare For All plan without raising taxes on the middle class. The primary thing voters look for in a candidate is strength and competence. Are they strong, unable to be rattled? Are you the alpha male (or female)? But whenever she\u2019s under pressure Warren unravels like Lucy Ricardo when Ricky catches her sneaking into his nightclub. In short, Elizabeth Warren is a mess. This was obvious \u2014 hell, everything was obvious about Warren\u2019s inability to handle pressure after she bungled the release of her DNA results last year. As I said at the time, that was the single worst political debacle since John McCain suspended his 2008 presidential campaign to run off and save the economy. She made a fool of herself, and that is almost impossible to overcome. For that reason, I was legitimately surprised when she became the frontrunner earlier this month, but I was not at all surprised when she immediately fell apart as soon as the scrutiny arrived. She just doesn\u2019t have The Stuff. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

Sanders, who has struggled in recent national polls, saw a spike, jumping to second place with 25 percent support. The survey shows the Massachusetts senator dropping to third place with 21 percent support.\u00a0With a margin of error of +/- 4.7 percent, the three are statistically tied. The poll reflects Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) continued tailspin, dropping behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s (D), who saw six percent support to Harris\u2019s five percent. Andrew Yang (D) experienced a slight bump, garnering four percent support, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. Results also show that Sanders, who just received the formal endorsement of young, freshman socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), continues to have a stronghold on younger voters (18-29) with 45 percent of their support. No one else comes close, as Warren gains 17 percent support from that age group, and Yang is right behind her, earning 15 percent support. While Biden only sees 12 percent support among young voters, his backing increases exponentially among\u00a0older voters. He is garnering 17 percent support from those aged 30-49 and 44 percent support from those 50 and older.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Sanders held a massive rally at\u00a0Queensbridge Park on Saturday, which featured special guests Michael Moore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), both of whom gave their formal endorsements. \u201cWe need a United States that really, truly, and authentically is operated, owned, and decided by working \u2014 and all \u2014 people in the United States of America,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the rally. \u201cThat is what it \u2014 it is multiracial, multigendered,\u00a0multigenerational, and multigeographic,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cWe have to come together, not ignoring our differences but listening to them, prioritizing them, understanding injustice.\u201d Sanders appeared to choose Queens, in part, because it is \u201cground zero for the fight for public housing\u201d and home to the country\u2019s \u201clargest public housing project\u201d \u2014 something Ocasio-Cortez highlighted in her speech. \u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge the ground that we are on, which is the ground zero for the fight for public housing and fully funded, dignified housing in the United States of America,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd on Saturday. However, some residents of Queens, particularly residents of the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, say that the Sanders campaign snubbed them. Queensbridge Tenants Association President April Simpson said the Sanders campaign did not seem to make significant efforts to reach out to Queensbridge residents. She said there were no flyers in the building advertising the event, although the Sanders campaign claims it did, in fact, hand some out. Simpson said the Sanders campaign did not contact her until the day before the rally, which happened to coincide with the monthly tenant association meeting. \u201cThese people were coming from near, far \u2014 but they weren\u2019t from Queensbridge,\u201d Simpson told Patch. \u201cThat rally wasn\u2019t for us.\u201d As Patch reported: A Sanders campaign spokesperson said the team handed out flyers to Queensbridge residents going in and out of their buildings on Friday, the day before the rally, and had reached out to Simpson as soon as they got her contact information and invited her to meet with Sanders. But Simpson said she felt slighted. \u201cThe residents that were sitting in the meeting, they said they found out from all the people going past,\u201d Simpson added, calling the lack of outreach \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Community leader Bishop Mitchell Taylor was also perturbed by the Sanders campaign\u2019s purported lack of outreach and remarked that the event \u201cseemed to be a pretty white rally.\u201d \u201cThey chose a picture over a population,\u201d he said, according to Patch. \u201cHow could you use Queensbridge Park as your rallying point but not engage Queensbridge people as a part of the rally?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got the biggest projects in the world, and you didn\u2019t even let the people there know what\u2019s going on in their own neighborhood,\u201d Queensbridge resident Billy Robinson told the outlet. Simpson told Patch reporter Maya Kaufman that the Sanders campaign reached out to set up a meeting \u201cwith Sanders and Queensbridge community leaders\u201d following the publication of the Patch article. The Sanders campaign maintained that it offered such a meeting the day prior to the rally, but Simpson denies that:  Both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have emphasized the need to provide affordable housing for all. Sanders released a $1.5 trillion Housing for All plan which asserts that every American is entitled to a \u201cdecent\u201d home. \u201cIn the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right,\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal\u00a0states. \u201cWe need a homes guarantee.\u201d Similarly, Ocasio-Cortez has put forth a massive \u201canti-poverty\u201d proposal which gives illegal aliens access to public benefits and outlines a protections for renters under \u201cThe Place to Prosper Act.\u201d The act \u201cgives access to a \u2018counsel fund\u2019 for renters who are facing eviction and \u201cimposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties\u201d on what the freshman lawmaker calls \u2018abusive and predatory landlords,'\u201d as Breitbart News reported.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d who they would vote for between the two. While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey\u2019s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters. According to Zogby Analytics: The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%). Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump\u2019s 37 percent. The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points \u2013 49 percent to 38 percent \u2013 and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.  The poll emphasizes that 2020 results will largely hinge on voter turnout\u2013 a point emphasized in\u00a0Moody\u2019s Analytics 2020 election forecast. As Breitbart News reported: If turnout by Democrats and independents voting against Trump is low to average, Trump easily wins under the models. If it climbs to the historical maximum, Trump would lose under the stock market and unemployment models but still win in the pocketbook model. The results, or general sentiment of Trump defeating his rivals in hypothetical general election matchups, is reflected in the latest poll from the Economist/YouGov: ",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " A report by the Wall Street Journal reveals that three illegal aliens working for Sanders\u2019 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign helped craft the democratic-socialists\u2019 plan to decriminalize illegal immigration, end deportations, and stop federal immigration raids. All three illegal alien Sanders staffers have been allowed to stay in the U.S. through former President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The Journal notes: The campaign has a Latino outreach program that spans every early state, and has held specific events tailored to the Latino community in Iowa and California. (California holds its primary on March 3, a month after Iowa. But voters can begin mail-in voting the same day as Iowa.) Of the 542 paid staff on the campaign in the third quarter, at least 70 are Latino, according to the campaign. Three of the staff members who worked on Mr. Sanders\u2019s immigration policy are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. [Emphasis added] Despite repeatedly denouncing open borders and its impact on the quality of life, wages, and economic opportunities of America\u2019s working and middle class, Sanders\u2019 2020 immigration plan endorses policies that end federal immigration enforcement. Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sanders is promising to decriminalize illegal immigration to the U.S., making it only a civil violation to cross international borders. Similarly, Sanders has introduced a plan to at least temporarily end raids and deportations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. As Breitbart News reported in March, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint was filed against Sanders\u2019 campaign for his hiring of the three DACA illegal aliens. The complaint alleges that Sanders\u2019 hiring of foreign nationals for advisory jobs on his campaign equates to foreign election interference. John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

      "content": " The debate, which is being sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Georgia on Nov. 20, will be moderated by\u00a0NBC News\u2019s Andrea Mitchel and Kristen Welker,\u00a0The Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. As the Post reported when announcing the lineup, the November debate will mark the second time in history that an all-female panel has moderated such an event. It is unclear, however, if the gender of the moderators will be enough to allay doubts and concerns about the neutrality of the DNC and the NBC networks. Even prior to the moderator lineup,\u00a0progressive activists had questioned if it is improper for MSNBC to sponsor the event given that executives of its parent corporation, Comcast Corp., have donated heavily to candidates likely to be on the debate stage. In particular, Comcast executives have overwhelmingly showered two of the more moderate Democrats running,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with campaign donations. Executives have donated more than $77,000 to Buttigieg and nearly $75,000 to Biden since the start of the 2020 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. No such donations were made to the presidential campaigns of Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) or Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who poll higher than Buttigieg nationally and outpace Biden in several of the early primary states. Apart from the potential bias on the part of MSNBC and Comcast, progressive activists and even lower-tiered presidential candidates have questioned the DNC qualifications standards for the debate. Since the DNC first announced it would be limiting participation in the debates, the organization has consistently tightened requirements in hopes of winnowing the field. The tactic, though, has only led to accusations that the DNC is \u201cpenalizing\u201d lesser known candidates to the benefit of those that are more established, like Biden. For the upcoming debate, the DNC is requiring candidates reach at least three percent in four state or national polls or five percent in two state polls. For those unable to meet that goal in the 19-person field, candidates can also qualify by receiving 165,000 \u201cunique donations,\u201d from at least 600 \u201cunique donors\u201d in 20 states. To date, only eight candidate have met these qualification standards for the November debate. Complicating matters for the DNC is that\u00a0viewership for its last four presidential primary debates has fallen off significantly. October\u2019s debate, which was hosted by CNN in Ohio, only drew an estimated 8.3 million views, much lower than the 9.7 million that tuned in for the second primary debate in July.",

Buttigieg and Harris are the choice of 8% and 7% of women respectively. Among men, Sanders edges out Warren 25% to 23% with Biden third at 16%, followed by Buttigieg at 10% and Harris with 9%. The poll\u2019s margin of error is +/-\u00a02.4 percent. The Change Research poll\u2019s results coincide with a\u00a0Civiqs survey\u00a0released this week, which shows Harris continuing to fall in Iowa with just three percent support. This is despite her change in strategy, beefing up resources and appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support. One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders\u2019 slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last\u00a0Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent. The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is\u00a0+/- 4.6 percent. While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping. According to Quinnipiac: Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today\u2019s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate \u201ccares most about people like you,\u201d as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent. The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with\u00a030 percent to Biden\u2019s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders\u2019 slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way. \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,\u201d Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll\u2019s results. Warren\u2019s extended lead over Biden and Sanders\u2019 bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren\u2019s 19 percent and Sanders\u2019 16 percent.",

Buttigieg talked about his idea to expand the size of the Supreme Court in order to incorporate \u201cmore justices who think for themselves,\u201d citing \u201cJustice Kennedy or Justice Souter\u201d: So I\u2019ve floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best.

Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law. Sanders, however, disagreed and made it known that he is only interested in piling the court with ultra-progressive justices who are ideologically similar to Ginsburg and Sotomayor. \u201cInteresting, I\u2019d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d Sanders tweeted:  Sanders and Buttigieg have largely avoided attacking each other on the campaign trail and are both experiencing a bit of a boost, recent polls indicate.

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is reversing its position on accepting help from super PACs amid anemic fundraising.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manager, announced the decision on Thursday, framing it as a result of the President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to \u201cintervene directly\u201d in the Democrat\u2019s primary process. Claiming that the president and his allies were already \u201cspending massive amount[s] of money\u201d to prevent Biden from becoming the nominee, Bedingfield said the campaign had no choice to abandon its earlier pledge to discourage the aid of super Pacs. \u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to this disastrous presidency,\u201d Bedingfield said. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d  The move comes as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to keep up in fundraising in comparison to candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT). Although the former vice president started his campaign with a strong funding advantage, thanks in part to high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In particular, Biden only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of this year, far below the sums brought in by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million). Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand. Biden\u2019s cash crunch results from his inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders,\u00a0more than\u00a02,800 donors\u00a0have already\u00a0maxed\u00a0out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement in late April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors. In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he\u2019s secured the nomination.\u00a0David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid,\u00a0explained\u00a0the problem to\u00a0Politico\u00a0this month. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d As evidenced by its decision on Thursday, the campaign appears to have decided his best way forward is to rely on super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Such groups are increasingly being scorned on the left \u2014 including Biden just a few short months ago. When first announcing his campaign, the former vice president pledged not to accept any campaign donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. Part of that pledge was also his assurance not accept money from super PACs, even going as far to discourage one that had already formed on his behalf. \u201cVice President Biden does not welcome assistance from super PACs,\u201d a campaign aide told the Huffington Post in April when asked about the PAC. As part of its reasoning for rejecting the help, the Biden campaign pointed to the former vice president\u2019s long record of championing campaign finance reform. The candidate, himself, elaborated on his position during an interview with PBS News Hour last year while discussing campaign finance advice he purportedly gave to Sanders in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d",

His campaign on Thursday essentially modified its position on accepting Super PAC support and blamed President Trump for using advertising to \u201cintervene directly\u201d in the Democrat primaries in an effort to take down Biden. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement. She continued: He and his allies are already spending massive\u00a0amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee. Both Warren and Sanders wasted no time to slam Biden for reversing course. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the Biden campaign is essentially trying to \u201cbuy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.\u201d Shakir\u2019s campaign statement, via Bern Notice,\u00a0reads: Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally. As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors \u2014 and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop. Let\u2019s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors. Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs \u2014 and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy. Sanders also criticized Biden during a town hall event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country,\u201d he said. Similarly, Warren \u2013 who has pledged to refrain from attending big fundraisers and courting wealthy donors despite doing so during her senatorial bids and transferring leftover funds to cushion her presidential run \u2013 took a shot a Biden on social media but did not call him out by name. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination,\u201d she continued. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d \u201cEvery Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary,\u201d she added:  ",

In particular, outlets like Politico and The Washington Post\u00a0have pointed to polls showing Biden well behind his rivals in the early caucus and primary states. Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading by as much as double digits in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.

In New Hampshire, where Biden once led by more than 15 percentage points, the former vice president has been eclipsed by neighboring state rival, Warren. In fact, Biden has not led Warren in the first primary state since mid-September.   A similar situation has played out nationally, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from this week found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden\u2019s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to\u00a0 27 percent. Other national polls from around the same time, found Biden similarly displaced as the frontrunner:   Biden\u2019s squandered lead in the polls has coincided with a drop-off in fundraising. Even though Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, due to his connections with high-dollar donors, the former vice president ended the most recent fundraising quarter well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million). Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand. All of that has led to even Biden\u2019s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, acknowledging he is no longer the frontrunner.",

      "content": " According to recent reports from both the New York Times and Washington Post, Clinton has not taken a 2020 run off the table and is, instead, keeping tabs on the growing distress among some members of the Democrat Party, who are unhappy with the current selection of candidates. \u201cHillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,\u201d the Washington\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. \u201cBut put it this way: It ain\u2019t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,\u201d a source said, according to the\u00a0Post. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters. \u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d a \u201cNew York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,\u201d told CNBC. While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are \u201cremote,\u201d it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates \u201cbelieve the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.\u201d A\u00a0McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race. While Bloomberg\u2019s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden\u2019s absence and Clinton\u2019s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support. Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:  However, the poll found Biden leading the race as is with 28 percent support, followed by Sanders with 18 percent support and Warren with 16 percent:  The McLaughlin & Associates National Survey was taken October 17-22 among 1,000 likely voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.",

Omar\u2019s call coincides with fellow \u201cSquad\u201d member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has lamented the state of housing in America over the past few months. During a town hall event in the Bronx in June, Ocasio-Cortez minimized the \u201cluxury\u201d status of her D.C. apartment and proclaimed housing a \u201chuman right.\u201d \u201cWe have to make sure that housing is being legislated as a human right,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cWhat does that mean? What it means is that our access and our ability and our guarantee to having a home comes before someone else\u2019s privilege to earn a profit.\u201d In September, she unveiled her \u201cA Just Society\u201d proposal, which updates national poverty guidelines, extends federal benefits to illegal immigrants, and \u201cgives access to a \u2018counsel fund\u2019 for renters who are facing eviction,\u201d as Breitbart News reported. Sen.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who this week reversed his position on accepting help from super PACs, made the remarks when asked by CBS News\u2019s Norah O\u2019Donnell if he still considered himself the Democrat frontrunner. O\u2019Donnell, particularly, noted that Biden had not only lost his polling advantage but had also fallen behind competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fundraising. \u201cI just flat beat them,\u201d Biden responded with a laugh before adding that his campaign was \u201con a course to do extremely well.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.\u201d Despite the former vice president\u2019s bravado, his campaign has expressed increasing concern over its fundraising capabilities in the past few weeks. \u201cI hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,\u201d Elana Firsht, a campaign aide, admitted in a recent fundraising email. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.\u201d Although Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, thanks to support from high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Warren ($24.6 million), and\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million). Compounding the problem is that the former vice president\u2019s campaign has spent on luxury travel, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand. Biden fundraising troubles stem from inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders,\u00a0more than\u00a02,800 donors\u00a0have already\u00a0maxed\u00a0out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors. In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he has secured the nomination. Biden\u2019s cash crunch was seen as the primary motivator for his campaign\u2019s decision to jettison its stance of discouraging super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds, on Thursday. The move came even after Biden had made a show this year of pledging to pass stronger restrictions on super PACs and dark money groups if elected president. \u201cOur Constitution doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u2018We the Democrats\u2019 or \u2018We the Republicans,'\u201d Biden said at a campaign event in May. \u201cAnd it certainly doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u201cWe the Donors.\u201d",

According to the Washington Post, Sanders went a bit deeper at a news conference, explaining that he views his long track record as a clear cut advantage. It demonstrates his consistency in ideology throughout the years, he states. \u201cThe ideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday,\u201d he said, according to the Post. \u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d he continued. \u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts.

He, like Sanders, presented it as an advantage, stating that it is the Electoral College\u2013not Sanders\u2013that is too old. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s 78, and we will benefit for his wisdom and his experience and his knowledge and his love for the American people,\u201d the\u00a0Fahrenheit 9/11 director told the crowd, calling Sanders\u2019 advanced age a \u201cgift.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for President of the United States,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWell, here\u2019s what\u2019s too old. The Electoral College is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d he continued. \u201cA $7.25 minimum wage\u2013 that\u2019s too old.

The crowd replied, \u201cToo old!\u201d He prompted the crowd in the same fashion a few more times, using healthcare deductibles, super delegates, and fossil fuel as examples as things that are \u201ctoo old.\u201d Moore also dismissed the growing concerns over Sanders\u2019 health. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying.

His plan not only promises to expunge past convictions, but pledges billions of dollars to communities disproportionately affected by the War on Drugs. One of the ways he plans to reinvest in those communities is by creating federally-funded programs \u2013 using tax revenue generated by legalizing marijuana \u2013 that would help provide ex-convicts with opportunities to work in the marijuana industry.

      "content": "  Trump\u2019s full statement emphasized the need to put country ahead of party as the nation celebrated, as follows: I want to personally congratulate President Obama and the men [and] women of the Armed Forces for a job very well done. I am so proud to see Americans standing shoulder to shoulder, waving the American flag in celebration of this great victory. We should spend the next several days not debating party politics, but in remembrance of those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those fighting for our freedom. God Bless America. Moreover, Trump congratulated Obama even though the president had infamously mocked him mercilessly just hours before the raid, at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD). Obama said\u00a0on that occasion: And I know just the guy to do it -\u2013 Donald Trump is here tonight!\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Now, I know that he\u2019s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2013- like, did we fake the moon landing?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What really happened in Roswell?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.) But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For example \u2014 no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 at the steakhouse, the men\u2019s cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks.\u00a0 And there was a lot of blame to go around.\u00a0 But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership.\u00a0 And so ultimately, you didn\u2019t blame Lil\u2019 Jon or Meatloaf.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You fired Gary Busey.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Well handled, sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well handled. Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got up there.\u00a0 (Laughter.) (Screens show \u201cTrump White House Resort and Casino.\u201d) Other Republicans were generous to Obama, too, putting patriotism ahead of politics. As the\u00a0New York Times noted: WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama drew praise from unlikely quarters on Monday for pursuing a risky and clandestine mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a successful operation that interrupted the withering Republican criticism about his foreign policy, world view and his grasp of the office. Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, \u201cThe administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.\u201d New York\u2019s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, \u201cI admire the courage of the president.\u201d And Donald J. Trump declared, \u201cI want to personally congratulate President Obama.\u201d The\u00a0Times observed that Republicans praised Obama even though it was clear the raid would help him politically. Later in 2011 and 2012, Trump walked back his praise for Obama somewhat:   As of Sunday morning, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had congratulated U.S. forces while pointedly excluding President Trump from their congratulations. Joel B.

The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies,\u201d Sanders tweeted:  Trump, in his statement on Sunday, detailed the raid led by U.S. Special Operations forces, who \u201caccomplished their mission in grand style.\u201d \u201cCapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration. U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,\u201d Trump said. According to Trump, the terrorist leader reportedly detonated his suicide vest after being cornered by U.S. forces. Trump said: The U.S. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification it was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS, origins, future plans, things that we very much want. Like Sanders, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) did not mention Trump in his congratulatory statement on al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. However, he acknowledged and praised the courage and dedication of \u201cour military and intelligence community\u201d:  Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) also congratulated U.S. special forces, the intelligence community, and \u201call our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u201d but also made no mention of Trump:  As Breitbart News noted, Trump congratulated former President Barack Obama after he announced the raid that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May 2011: ",

      "content": " \u201cI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\u201d the former vice president said shortly after the White House announced it had successfully killed the ISIS leader during an overnight raid in Syria. \u201cIt is thanks to their courage and relentless determination to carry out their mission that ISIS has suffered a vital loss.\u201d Biden, in his short statement, followed the trend of other presidential candidates, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, by not once mentioning Trump. The snub came despite the fact that Trump gave the order to go after al-Baghdadi, who led ISIS since 2014 and was responsible for most of the group\u2019s terrorist activities in the past few years.  The president confirmed on Sunday that al-Baghdadi was killed during a daring nighttime raid on a compound in northwestern Syria\u2019s Idlib Provence. The raid, which was led by a group of U.S. special forces, killed a \u201clarge number\u201d of ISIS forces, culminating in al-Baghdadi being cornered in a tunnel beneath the compound. Instead of being captured by the approaching U.S. forces, the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest killing himself and three children. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Trump said when announcing the news. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d No U.S. troops were wounded in the operation, according to the president, except for \u201ca beautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented dog\u201d that was part of the canine unit brought along for the mission. Biden, in his own statement on Sunday seemed to agree\u00a0with the president, even if he refused to mention him by name, when he said the \u201cworld is better and safer without\u201d al-Baghdadi. Biden\u2019s reluctance to congratulate the president for successfully taking out the ISIS leader stands in stark contrast to a\u00a0message Trump sent to then-President Barack Obama upon the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011.

I mean, something like 80 to 90 percent of Americans describes themselves as middle class,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cYou might be upper or lower within that, but there were not enormous gaps.\u201d \u201cI mean, there is a problem with the oligarchs in this country and they\u2019re the ones bringing in the cheap labor and they\u2019re the ones \u2014 not all of them but a lot of them \u2014 who don\u2019t care about the country per se,\u201d Coulter continued. \u201cThey just want more and more cheap labor. And they are going to deliver a country to us like Venezuela through people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d As Breitbart News has noted, despite Warren\u2019s populist rhetoric \u2014 where she has called out multinational corporations for having no loyalty to American workers \u2014 her campaign to win the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination has endorsed one of the most open borders platforms of all the candidates.  Warren\u2019s immigration plan includes decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing amnesty to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. \u2014 policies that will force America\u2019s working class to compete for scarce blue-collar and middle-income jobs against the world\u2019s migrants. Likewise, Warren has championed the donor class and Chamber of Commerce\u2019s effort to increase legal immigration to the U.S. and thus driving up foreign competition against middle class and college-educated Americans. Current immigration levels are already helping to hand electoral dominance to Democrats nationwide, research by the New York Times, Axios, and the Atlantic has noted. The U.S. is set to bring\u00a0at least 15 million\u00a0new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters\u2019 swing towards Democrats has\u00a0been realized\u00a0in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

Additionally, only a little over half of millennial\u00a0respondents said that they believe the Declaration of Independence better guarantees freedom and inequality over the Communist Manifesto \u2014 compared to 94 percent of the Silent Generation, who came of age during the Cold War. The poll also revealed that 72 percent of Americans in general do not know that communism has killed less than 100 million people in the past 100 years. A separate poll released over the summer by\u00a0Chegg and College Pulse revealed candidates identifying as socialist poll highest among college students, as they prefer the more fringe candidates such as Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) over moderate Democrat alternatives.

They NEED the Black vote in both elections,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cShowing an officer \u2018respect\u2019 still regularly gets Black people killed because racism,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cOooohhhhh, so all those victims of police shootings were\u2026 just asking for it\u2026 Gotcha,\u201d another added. Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) was presented with a similar question. \u201cIf I were your daughter, what advice would you give me the next time I am stopped by police?\u201d a young black woman asked. \u201cIf you were my daughter, you would be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn\u2019t be pulled over,\u201d Biden said to applause. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. What I would tell you is that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong. That is what\u2019s wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists,\u201d he added:  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event, despite pledging to skip it the day prior due to the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center\u2019s recognition of President Trump. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin (D) assured candidates that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center had nothing to do with the event, which prompted Harris\u2019s reversal. \u201cI am excited to welcome presidential candidates to a criminal justice forum dialogue which will allow Benedict College students and the wider community to have full participation,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cI want to be clear that the Candidate Forums are hosted by myself and Benedict College. This portion of the weekend is not a 20/20 Presidential Justice Center event,\u201d he added. Despite that, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center \u201cmaintained a presence there throughout the day,\u201d the Washington Post reported, even tweeting images from Harris\u2019s discussion:  ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Whereas, Trump congratulated former President Obama\u00a0after he announced the raid that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. The president announced the death of\u00a0al-Baghdadi on Sunday, praising U.S. Special Operations forces, who \u201caccomplished their mission in grand style.\u201d \u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\u201d Trump said, detailing the moment the terrorist ignited his suicide vest after finding himself entrapped by U.S. forces. While 2020 candidates reacted to the news, many omitted any mention of the president\u2019s role, despite the fact that \u2013 as Trump noted \u2013 \u201ccapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority\u201d of his administration. \u201cI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden (D) wrote, omitting any mention of Trump:  \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a campaign of mass violence and terror that devastated the region and threatened the world. His death is a setback for ISIS and a victory for justice,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote. \u201cI am grateful for the skill and courage of our special operations and intelligence professionals,\u201d she continued, noting that his death is \u201cnot the end of our fight against terrorism\u201d:  \u201cThe removal of al-Baghdadi from the battlefield is a credit to our armed forces & intelligence community who have committed years of service in the fight against ISIS & violent extremism,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to them, the Kurds & other allies & partners as we continue the fight ahead,\u201d he added:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in his initial response, thanked the \u201cKurds and other U.S. allies\u201d but failed to mention Trump or U.S. troops:  \u201cISIS has caused immeasurable suffering & destruction; the death of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was an important, much needed action to defeat it,\u201d Marianne Williamson (D) said. \u201cPraise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission\u201d:  \u201cAl-Baghdadi was a dangerous terrorist who committed heinous crimes. As I said this morning, getting rid of him was good for America and the world. But as I discussed today on @FaceTheNation many challenges remain,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) wrote:  \u201cA ruthless murderer has been brought to justice. I\u2019m grateful to our military and intelligence community. Their courage and dedication inspire us all,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) said, also omitting any mention of the president. \u201cAbandoning our Syrian and Kurdish partners remains a disastrous decision that will make the fight against ISIS harder,\u201d he added:  \u201cThank you and congratulations to our special operations forces and others involved in tracking and getting rid of ISIS/Daesh leader Baghdadi,\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) responded, actively bashing what she calls Trump\u2019s \u201cshort-sighted policies\u201d in the remainder of her statement:  Andrew Yang (D) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) were among the most generous in their responses, although neither directly congratulated the president. \u201cThe death of al-Baghdadi is a major blow to ISIS and a testament to our armed forces. It will make the world safer,\u201d Yang wrote. While he did not mention Trump by name, he extended his congratulations to the special ops team \u201cthat executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command\u201d:  \u201cThis is a blow against ISIS and an important step in the fight against stateless terrorism. Credit should go to all who were involved; above all to the brave Americans in uniform and intelligence professionals who risked their lives to complete this mission,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cToday, we honor them,\u201d he added:  As Breitbart News pointed out, Trump openly acknowledged former President Obama following the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, offering personal congratulations after Obama mocked him at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD) hours prior to the raid: ",

      "subtitle": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told the far-left J Street organization on Monday that the U.S. should give some of its annual $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel to Palestinian Hamas-run Gaza instead.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The Times of Israel reported: \u201cMy solution is, to Israel, if you want military aid you\u2019re going to have to fundamentally change your relationship to the people of Gaza,\u201d [Sanders] said. \u201cI would say that some of the $3.8 billion should go right now to humanitarian aid in Gaza.\u201d \u201cMy proposal in terms of Israeli-Palestinian efforts is not a radical proposal,\u201d he went on. \u201cAll it says is that we need an even-hand proposal for both people. What is going on in Gaza right now, for example, is absolutely inhumane. It is unacceptable. It is unsustainable.\u201d Sanders did not explain how he would ensure that money for humanitarian uses was not spent on terrorism. Hamas has been run by the terrorist Hamas group since a coup against the Palestinian Authority in 2007 (which itself has not had a democratic election since 2005). Since then, Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip have launched thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians \u2014 often attacking from densely-populated civilian areas. Hamas also indoctrinates Palestinian children to hate Israelis and Jews. Israel permits humanitarian aid to reach Gaza but restricts the flow of goods, since the terror group \u2014 which has used child slave labor to build underground tunnels aimed at smuggling into Egypt or conducting attacks in Israel \u2014 uses civilian goods for terrorist purposes. Sanders, like almost every other candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, skipped the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which pushes for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. In contrast, J Stret often opposes Israel \u2014 including most of its military actions in self-defense \u2014 and wants the U.S. to pressure Israel for concessions to Palestinians, despite the fact that Palestinian leaders continue to support terrorism. Earlier this year, Sanders suggested that he might move the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv if elected. Sanders has been endorsed by Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who back boycotts of Israel. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Morning Consult has consistently shown Joe Biden (D) as the frontrunner, despite numerous national polls suggesting otherwise. The\u00a0George Washington University Politics Poll\u00a0released\u00a0ahead of the fourth Democrat debate, for example,\u00a0showed Biden falling to third place nationally, behind both Warren and Sanders. Morning Consult\u2019s latest poll, taken\u00a0October 21-27, 2019, among\u00a015,431 registered voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary or caucus in their state, showed Biden leading the pack with 32 percent. Warren, who has bested Sanders in a number of polls in recent weeks, tied with the Vermont socialist for second place with 20 percent support each. The divide between the top tier of candidates and the remainder of the field has become more drastic, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in a distant fourth place with just seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with six percent support, and Andrew Yang (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 1 percent:  Sanders also made advances with voters in early primary states, which includes\u00a0Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. While Biden leads with 29 percent support from voters in early primary states, Sanders surpassed Warren with 18 percent support to the Massachusetts senator\u2019s 17 percent support. Once again, Buttigieg came in fourth with eight percent support, followed by Harris and Tom Steyer (D) with seven percent and six percent, respectively. The early primary state results came from\u00a0611 voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. The margin of error was +/- 4 percent. Voters were also asked to choose a second choice candidate. According to the survey, 28 percent of Biden supporters chose Warren, 28 percent of Warren supporters selected Sanders, and 30 percent of Sanders supporters picked Biden. Sanders\u2019 bump in the polls may be\u00a0indicative of the power behind his recent endorsements from far-left members of the \u201cSquad\u201d\u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Tlaib was the latest to endorse \u201cAmo Bernie,\u201d praising him as someone who is\u00a0\u201cnot going to sell us out.\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2013 and notable Hollywood figures, like notorious anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore. New Hampshire, the first primary state to vote, is one of the most desirable states for the presidential hopefuls, and a survey conducted by the\u00a0University of New Hampshire indicates that Sanders is back on top. The\u00a0University of New Hampshire Survey Center\u00a0conducted the survey on October 21 \u2013 27, 2019 among 1,266 adults, including \u201c574 likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters and 461 likely 2020 Republican primary voters.\u201d According to the survey, Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who falls three points behind with 18 percent support. Joe Biden (D) comes in third with 15 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with ten percent support. Andrew Yang (D), Sen Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) followed with five percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered three percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:  The results coincide with the Morning Consult poll results released this week, which show Sanders tying with Warren nationally and edging her out in early primary states. The UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll illustrates a rapidly changing landscape for the top tier of the race. A YouGovUS/CBS News poll released prior to the fourth Democrat debate showed Sanders falling significantly behind in the Granite State, with 17 percent to Warren\u2019s 32 percent and Biden\u2019s 24 percent:  Sanders has\u00a0made a noticeable effort to combat concerns over his age and health in recent days. \u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa last week, adding, \u201cBut there are advantages to being old.\u201d Sanders argued that his age proves that the \u201cideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d Moore, who spoke at a Sanders rally in Queens this month, also defended Sanders\u2019 age and health. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,\u201d Moore said, arguing that the Electoral College \u2013 not Sanders \u2013 is \u201ctoo old.\u201d The Fahrenheit 11/9 director also dismissed concerns surrounding Sanders\u2019 health. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore added.",

The city has turned off the water for an increasing number of Detroit families due to their inability to pay the bills, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cHere in this campaign, we hear the word socialism a lot. Well, what this is a perfect example of is socialism for billionaires, massive amounts of subsidies and tax breaks,\u201d Sanders said, allowing the empty shelves to serve as his backdrop. \u201cBut for children, there\u2019s not enough money for a decent education and for poor people, there\u2019s not an ability to get clean drinking water,\u201d he added.

Respondents were asked, \u201cIf the Democratic presidential primary or caucus in your state were held today, who would you vote for?\u201d Biden led the pack with 27 percent support from Democrat primary voters, followed by Warren with 23 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who recently\u00a0experienced a bump in New Hampshire, came in third place with 14 percent support. The survey affirmed Harris\u2019s continued fall, showing Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) firmly taking over her once-held fourth-place position with eight percent support among Democrat primary voters. Harris flopped to fifth place, tying with Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) with just four percent support each. Andrew Yang (D) followed with three percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent when adjusted for weighting and +/- 2.8 percent among registered voters. Respondents were also asked to select their second choice. Warren and Sanders topped the field with 13 percent support each, followed by Biden, Buttigieg, and Harris with eight percent, seven percent, and four percent, respectively. Democrat primary voters remain more confident in Biden\u2019s ability to defeat Trump, as 64 percent said he could \u201cprobably\u201d beat the president. In contrast, 54 percent said Sanders could \u201cprobably\u201d defeat Trump, and 57 percent said the same of Warren.",

It\u2019s stripping 150 million Americans of the health insurance they are satisfied with to force us into a one-size-fits-all, government-run system.

Then there\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d college on top of forgiving a trillion dollars in student loan debt that is owed to us, the hard-working taxpayers of America. Don\u2019t forget a guaranteed income, whether you work hard or stay home all day smoking a bowl in front of the Cartoon Network. Do you want to know just how good life is in this country? We are worried about an epidemic of obesity among the \u201cpoor,\u201d and just this week we learned that the children of the \u201cpoor\u201d \u00a0spend more time in front of an electric screen than the non-poor. In other words, poor people have too much food and munch on all that food while enjoying their iPads and iPhones and hand-held video games. In other words, they are not really poor. Other than the mentally ill and those dealing with addiction, people that cannot be helped without violating their civil right to live on the street, America has done it \u2014 we have licked poverty. Oh, sure, we can use slide-rules and charts and graphs, we can pull a number out of our backside to designate a certain group of people as \u201cpoor,\u201d but while we are doing that the poor are enjoying a standard of living the rich only dreamt of a hundred years ago \u2014 central heat, television, air conditioning, an abundance of food, games, Internet access, a cell phone\u2026 are you kidding me? And now, because 19 percent of the population \u2014 most of them almost assuredly young and dumb, immature and unwise, inexperienced and ignorant \u2014 think they want socialism, the 2020 field is prepared to \u201cfix\u201d a market economy that is working miraculously well, because fairness or something\u2026 And here\u2019s the thing, most of those 19 percent\u2026 They are going to grow out of it. As they gain experience, maturity, and wisdom, they will wake up to certain realities of life and reject socialism, because only a lunatic can look at the history of socialism and want to live that way. Before he assassinated President Kennedy, even dedicated Marxist Lee Harvey Oswald got his wish to live in the Soviet Union\u2026 \u00a0and then spent most of his time there trying to return, not just to the United States, but to Texas! Remember the Woodstock Generation? A majority of them are Republicans now. That\u2019s just how it works, how it has always worked\u2026 But what has changed, what has moved Democrats into a socialist posture that would shock even Barack Obama, is that the establishment media is now infested with radical leftists who all speak as one. On top of that, America\u2019s young and dumb enjoy a presence on social media that over-exaggerates their influence and twists reality (if you\u2019re dumb enough to believe social media is reality) into something it is not. The horror show, then, would be a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren sliding into power, and that would be a horror show even for those 19 percent, because in a few years they are growing to become a little wiser as they struggle and die in the awful world they wished for.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " While Democrat voters tend to believe that Biden stands the greatest chance of defeating Trump in a general election matchup, his once-secure lead is slipping. Morning Consult/Politico surveyed\u00a01,997 registered voters on a hypothetical Biden-Trump matchup, and while it showed Biden besting Trump by five percentage points, that is a six-point drop from the 11 point lead he held over the president in June. According to the survey, taken October 25-28, Biden would defeat Trump 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 36 percent. However, June\u2019s survey showed the former vice president with an 11 point lead, 44 percent to Trump\u2019s 33 percent. Trump is also gaining on Sanders. In June, Sanders led Trump 42 percent to 32 percent. October\u2019s survey, however, showed Trump two points behind Sanders. The survey also showed Trump overtaking Warren in a hypothetical 2020 matchup, 36 percent to 35 percent. The margin of error is +/- two percent.  As Morning Consult indicates, Trump\u2019s gains come from two demographics he has traditionally struggled with, women and young voters: While Trump cut into Biden\u2019s edge with several demographic groups between the two surveys, some of the president\u2019s biggest gains came among women and the youngest voters, two groups that are typically seen as some of his weakest voting blocs. Trump trails Biden by 11 points among women in the latest poll, conducted Oct. 25-28, compared with a 20-point gap in June. And while he still lags 14 points behind Biden among voters ages 18 to 29, that\u2019s a significant improvement on the 28-point deficit he faced in June. Independents are also falling in line with the incumbent: Biden\u2019s 1-point lead among those voters is down from an 11-point edge in June. While Democrat voters have tended to flock to Biden due to his perceived electability, which may be changing. \u201cForty percent of Democratic primary voters said\u00a0in September\u00a0that they thought Biden has the best chance of beating Trump in 2020, more than twice the share who said the same of any other candidate,\u201d Morning Consult noted. \u201cTo that extent, declining returns in head-to-head matchups against Trump may pose a unique risk to his prospects for securing the nomination,\u201d it added.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A poll\u00a0released\u00a0by Franklin & Marshall College on Thursday shows the former vice president leading his nearest rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), by double digits. Biden, known to refer to himself as \u201cJoe from Scranton\u201d\u00a0on the campaign\u00a0trail, commands 30 percent of registered Democrats, according to the results. Warren, who has leapfrogged the former vice president in national and early state polls, captured second place with 18 percent. Rounding out the top four were Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The results paint a different picture than the last Franklin & Marshall poll from August, which saw Biden only leading Warren within the margin of error. In that survey, the former vice president only posted 28 percent among Democrats to Warren\u2019s 21 percent. Biden\u2019s improvement between August and October comes from the inroads his campaign seems to have made with those that identify as liberal Democrats.\u00a0In August, the former vice president garnered only 13 percent among such voters, trailing both Warren (31 percent) and Sanders (16 percent). This time around, however, Biden bested Sanders for second place among liberal Democrats, taking 24 percent to the self-described democrat socialist\u2019s 15 percent. Warren still remained the favorite at 31 percent, but did not gain any support even as Sanders, a darling of the progressive left, lost ground. The former vice president\u2019s rise among liberal Democrats, though, has come at the price of his support with self-acknowledged moderates. In August, Biden dominated among such voters, commanding 47 percent outright, leading Biden and Sanders by as much as forty percentage points. Thursday\u2019s poll found Biden taking 40 percent among moderates, with Sanders in second place with nine percent. Warren and Buttigieg landed in third and fourth place respectively, garnering eight percent and seven percent each. The poll also found an educational divide between\u00a0Pennsylvania Democrats that seems to fit into the broader argument Biden has been making since entering the race. Among respondents with a high school degree or less, the former vice president led his challengers resoundingly. Biden captured 39 percent among such voters, compared to ten percent for Warren and six percent for Sanders. He similarly led with Democrats that had some college education, taking 29 percent to Sanders\u2019 13 percent and Warren\u2019s seven percent. It was only among college educated Democrats that Warren led Biden narrowly, 28 percent to 26 percent. Sanders landed in third place with such voters at 14 percent. Biden\u2019s strong showing in Pennsylvania, especially among working class voters, buoys his campaign as it faces fundraising troubles and sinking poll numbers. The poll also seems to give credence to Biden\u2019s argument that he\u2019s the only Democrat capable of winning back the white working class, who although decreasingly nationally still make up a significant portion of the electorate in states like Pennsylvania. In 2016, voters without a college degree\u00a0backed\u00a0President Donald Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by a margin of 52 percent to 44 percent. The share was significantly larger among non-college educated whites, who broke for Trump by the largest margin since 1980\u201467 percent to 28 percent. Trump\u2019s margin among the group was vital in carrying Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial United States that had voted Democrat for decades prior to 2016. Biden\u2019s showing in the Franking & Marshall is also likely a personal boost, especially as the former vice president often touts his Pennsylvania roots.\u00a0Not only was Biden born in Scranton, Pennsylvania but he lived there with his family until the age of 11, when they moved to neighboring Delaware. Although Biden remained in Delaware for the rest of his life and built a successful political career, Pennsylvania, by his own admission, held a special place in his heart. During his nearly 40-year congressional career, Biden\u2019s advocacy on behalf of the state and it\u2019s interests earned him the nickname the \u201cthird senator from Pennsylvania.\u201d \u201cFor the last thirty-five years, any time Scranton needs something\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say no to them,\u201d Biden\u00a0told\u00a0GQ\u00a0magazine in 2010. \u201cFor real. I really don\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s still home\u201d Since announcing his campaign, Biden\u00a0frequently invoked Pennsylvania and his upbringing in Scranton, specifically, to legitimize his middle-class bonafides. Biden\u2019s proclivity for such statements has even drawn derision from Trump, who hopes to carry the state again in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s not from Pennsylvania,\u201d the president\u00a0said\u00a0during a May campaign swing through the state. \u201cI guess he was born here, but he left you folks. \u2026 He left you for another state, and he didn\u2019t take care of you, because he didn\u2019t take care of your jobs. He let other countries come in and rip off America.\u201d",

Here\u2019s the headline: My plan won't raise taxes one penny on middle-class families. In fact, we'll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That's bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history. Here's how: \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) November 1, 2019  Warren contrasts with fellow 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who has admitted that the middle class will pay more in taxes; however, he claims that it will pay less in premiums and other healthcare costs. Warren estimated that her plan would cost $52 trillion over the next years, which would require $20.5 trillion in new spending. To offset the cost of her plan, Warren proposed an \u201cEmployer Medicare Contribution,\u201d which replaces what companies pay to insurance companies and sends it to the federal government. In a similar manner with Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be exempt from the Employer Medicare Contribution. The Employer Medicare Contribution essentially amounts to an employer-side payroll tax, which many economists say harms workers in the form of suppressed wages. The Tax Policy Center noted that the\u00a0\u201cemployee bears the burden of both the employer and employee portions of payroll taxes.\u201d Important reminder when understanding Warren's M4A plan, \"in the end, all payroll taxes are based on the labor income of workers\u2026taxes on labor (such as payroll taxes) are paid by workers.\"\u2013Saez and Zucman. \u2014 Nicole Kaeding (@NKaeding) November 1, 2019  Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Beddingfield, has contended that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle-class tax increases.\u201d Beddingfield said that the plan \u201cwould place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d As\u00a0Washington Examiner editor Phillip Klein noted, even if Americans would save money on premiums and administrative costs through her Medicare for All plan, the Medicare Contribution would \u201cstill count as a tax increase.\u201d An Emory University healthcare expert told the\u00a0Washington Post that \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that Medicare for All \u201chits the middle class.\u201d The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contended that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to finance Medicare for All only through taxes on the wealthy. Further, in Warren\u2019s plan, she proposes to fund Medicare for All through a financial transactions tax, which would likely target the country\u2019s wealthiest. Although, some experts suggest that the tax could still soak the middle class. Another Democrat presidential candidate \u2014 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 told Fox News this week that Warren\u2019s plan\u00a0\u201cis not just the multi-trillion-dollar hole, but also the fact that most Americans would prefer not to be told that they have to abandon their private plan.\u201d Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh blasted Warren\u2019s plan as a \u201ctotal disaster.\u201d \u201cThere are 52 trillion reasons why this plan is a total disaster,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cBest of luck to the fact checkers who now have to clean up the mess.\u201d However, despite her claims, Warren promised this week that she would \u201cnot sign any legislation into law for which costs for middle-class families do not go down.\u201d Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " It was a warmup for the evening\u2019s Democrat Party Liberty and Justice Celebration and fundraiser at the Wells Fargo Arena, where thousands of rank-and-file Democrats are expected to listen to 14 of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination explain why Iowa Caucus attendees should back them. Breitbart News spoke with two of the Buttigieg volunteers, one from Santa Barbara and another from San Diego, who said they were part of 150 volunteers who paid their own way to come to Iowa to support the Buttigieg campaign. One volunteer said that a total of 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country flew to Des Moines to lend their support to Buttigieg. \u201cI\u2019m strictly a volunteer. I absolutely paid for my travel here myself,\u201d Laurie from Santa Barbara told Breitbart News. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be at least 150 to 200 people from California for Pete tonight,\u201d she added. Laurie had a succinct explanation for why she made the trip to Des Moines. \u201cThis is a big deal for the Democratic Party to be participating in this event. As we all know, this is the event tonight that turned around the polls and the momentum for Barack Obama. And we see the same thing happening for Pete,\u201d she said. Laurie was also optimistic about Buttigieg\u2019s chances of winning the Iowa Caucuses outright, saying, \u201cIf you look at the polls released this morning from CNN it basically shows a four-way tie for first place.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here as part of the barnstorming effort for Pete. It\u2019s a group of volunteers who feel so inspired by Pete running for president that we paid our own way to fly to Iowa to meet with the folks here and get visibility for Pete and explain our personal stories as to why we feel Pete is the most qualified person to be president,\u201d George, who said he is a deputy city clerk from San Diego, told Breitbart News. \u201cI feel like Pete speaks to the division in the country, and why we need to have a candidate to bring everyone together. He speaks about the day after the election how divided the country will be, regardless of who the next president is, and how important it will be to everyone in the country to feel that the person that\u2019s been elected speaks to them. So he\u2019s staking out a ground that speaks to, not either side, but to both sides of the country,\u201d George added. When pressed by Breitbart News to explain how Buttigieg\u2019s support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives\u2014which many Republicans have characterized as a grossly unfair and un-American partisan witch hunt\u2014would unite the country, George was unable to provide a compelling response. \u201cEach of these individual candidates has a position as to whether the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. That\u2019s the position they\u2019re taking. I feel that, for a lot of folks, an inquisition, or an inquiry is important for everybody to look into,\u201d George said Breitbart News spoke with two Buttigieg volunteers from Indiana at another venue in Des Moines on Friday morning who confirmed that volunteers have flown in to Des Moines from around the country at their own expense, but could not confirm the number of such volunteers. As many as 200,000 Iowa Democrats are expected to gather across the state on February 3 for a first-in-the-nation electoral contest to determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the November 2020 general election. Blue and yellow \u201cPete 2020\u201d campaign signs are widely visible in downtown Des Moines, a clear indication that the presidential campaign of the 37-year-old two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is well organized on the ground in advance of the evening\u2019s event. Other campaigns, including those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), and Andrew Yang (D), also had street signage visible in Des Moines on Friday, but most of that was within a thousand feet of the Wells Fargo Arena. In advance of the evening, all the major presidential campaigns hosted meet and greet events near the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday afternoon in hopes of creating volunteer enthusiasm and support for their candidate at the evening\u2019s event. The Buttigieg campaign is clearly hoping that the candidate\u2019s speech this evening\u2013where each candidate is limited to a ten minute address\u2013will give him the same kind of boost that Obama received when he addressed the same event 11 years earlier in 2007.",

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Earlier in the day, a fourteenth candidate who had been scheduled to speak, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), withdrew from the race. Democrat National Committee Chairman Tom Perez set the tone for the evening when he told the audience Donald Trump was \u201cthe worst president in the history of our country.\u201d Perez attacked members of Iowa\u2019s Republican Congressional delegation as well. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) \u201cis a Trump puppet, plain and simple,\u201d he said, and Rep. Steve King (R-IA) \u201cis an utter disgrace not only in Iowa but in the country.\u201d Comparing Rep. King to one of the characters created by the horror novelist Steven King,\u00a0 Perez said, \u201cSteve King is that evil clown.\u201d The most recent poll of likely Iowa Caucus attendees shows a top tier of four candidates: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA); Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden. Two themes dominated the candidates\u2019 speeches: a promise to take the fight to President Trump and a promise to unify the country after that fight is won. Notably, among the top tier candidates, only Sanders mentioned the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d in his speech. Buttigieg, who has been moving up in the polls and appears to have the best on-the-ground organizational infrastructure in the state, was the first of the 13 candidates to address the crowd. As Breitbart News reported on Friday, an estimated 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country, including 150 from California, flew into Des Moines to attend Friday night\u2019s event. In advance of Buttigieg\u2019s speech, his campaign had attempted to create the expectation he would replicate the \u201cObama moment\u201d of the 2008 campaign when then-candidate Barack Obama, addressing the crowd at the same event (then called the Jefferson Jackson Day Dinner, now called the Liberty and Justice Celebration) in November 2007, shifted the entire momentum of the primary campaign from front runner Hillary Clinton to the relatively little-known junior senator from Illinois. But there was to be no \u201cObama moment\u201d for Buttigieg in Des Moines on Friday night. While his speech was politely received by the entire audience, the loud applause and wild demonstrations that constantly interrupted his talk came from one narrow section of the arena\u2013the part reserved for a large contingent of about 1,500 Buttigieg supporters wearing yellow t-shirts and waving rally batons. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer who knocked on doors for a presidential candidate, a young man with a funny name. We knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d Buttigieg began. \u201cThis country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. We will not recognize it if he is re-elected. We know what is at stake. And we know he will do everything he can to hold on to power. But if you nominate me, his playbook isn\u2019t going to work this time around,\u201d he continued. Buttigieg was followed by former Vice President Joe Biden, who promised repeatedly that if he is the Democrat nominee, he will \u201cbeat Trump like a drum\u201d in the general election. Sen. Warren noted that the country needed \u201cbig structural change\u201d due to the abuses of wealth and power visited upon the middle class by the rich and that she is uniquely qualified to deliver that structural change by offering Medicare for All and her two percent wealth tax. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and people all across the country know in their bones. Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful,\u201d Warren began. \u201cThey make it work for themselves, and they leave everyone else behind. We see it every time a corporate executive threatens to cut pay and move jobs overseas. We see every time an insurance company won\u2019t give people, denies treatment and denies people access to the doctors they know and trust. We see it when a criminal justice system tears apart black and brown families,\u201d she continued. Sen.\u00a0 Sanders began his speech by noting that \u201ctonight, no matter what candidate we are supporting, all of us are in agreement that we must defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country,\u201d echoing the theme sounded by DNC Chair Tom Perez at the beginning of the evening. \u201cThe man is a pathological liar, a man who is running the most corrupt administration in the history of our country, a man who does not understand the rule of law, or our country\u2019s history, and a man who will soon be impeached. That is what we all agree on,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut let us acknowledge that we have some disagreements,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo we continue the status quo politics that has enabled the wealthiest people in our country, the largest corporations in their markets, to have extraordinary influence over the economic and political life of our country?\u201d Sanders asked. Andrew Yang was the only candidate who chose not to focus on what a terrible president Donald Trump is but instead on the underlying economic reasons for his election victory in 2016\u2013the loss of retail and manufacturing jobs around the country and the rise of the power of technology companies. Yang in particular focused on Amazon, which, he said, had over $20 billion in revenue but paid no taxes, while retail clerk jobs were disappearing around the country. Yang\u2019s solution was to tax the technology companies and use those proceeds to pay each American $1,000 a month, an idea, he said, that was not new. He claimed it was a proposal passed by Congress in 1971. [Note on crowd size: The seating capacity of the Wells Fargo Arena is 15,000 for hockey games and 16,000 for basketball games. The arena appeared to be about 3/4 filled at the beginning of the event, hence the estimate that the crowd size was about 12,000 in the stadium seats and about another 1,000 were seated at dinner tables on the floor of the arena.]",

A Locust Street Group survey, commissioned by the Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future in August, found that the majority of American voters, 64 percent, were not willing to pay more in taxes in exchange for Medicare for All \u2013\u00a0a proposal Sanders adamantly supports.

      "subtitle": "Top Democrat candidates are trailing President Trump in a general election matchup in Texas, a\u00a0University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll shows.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The survey, taken October 18-27, among 1,200 registered voters, found that none of the Democrats in the presidential race,\u00a0not even top candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), would be able to defeat Trump in the Lone Star state. Respondents were asked, \u201cWho would you vote for in this possible general election matchup?\u201d The survey showed both Warren and Biden trailing Trump by seven points, 39 percent to Trump\u2019s 46 percent. Sanders, while still losing, suffers a defeat by a smaller margin, 40 percent to Trump\u2019s 45 percent. Even Texas native Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), who dropped out of the presidential race last week, lost to the president, with 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 47 percent. The survey also shows former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) falling to Trump in a head to head matchup by double digits, or 13 percentage points. The margin of error is +/- 2.83 percent. The results were as follows: Trump: 46 percent\n\nWarren: 39 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nBiden: 39 percent Trump: 45 percent\n\nSanders: 40 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nCastro: 33 percent Trump: 47 percent\n\nO\u2019Rourke: 41 percent However, the Texas Tribune notes that \u201csignificant numbers of Democrats are holding back their votes \u2014 possibly a sign that while they oppose the Republican incumbent, they favor a different Democrat\u201d: For instance, 89% of Republicans say they would support Trump over Biden, and 5% say they would favor Biden, leaving 6% unwilling to pick. But in the same race, 82% of Democrats favor Biden, and 4% favor Trump, leaving 14% who either like another Democrat more or don\u2019t want to pick yet. The biggest gap was in the Trump-Castro matchup, where 93% of Republicans have a definite choice and only 71% of Democrats do. Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin, does not necessarily believe the results will reflect what will happen in the general election, but he noted that the results become \u201cmore Republican\u201d as they \u201cmove from registered voters to likely voters in Texas.\u201d A blue shift scare has been on the mind of the GOP as Democrats continue in their attempts to flip Texas blue. Last year\u2019s Texas senate race, between\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (D-TX) and O\u2019Rourke, sparked concerns, as Cruz narrowly defeated his Democrat challenger\u00a050.9 percent to 48.3 percent. However, as Breitbart News pointed out, O\u2019Rourke lost despite \u201ctremendous support from Hollywood and\u00a0double\u00a0the campaign contributions\u2013 $70.2 million to Cruz\u2019s $33.4 million.\u201d Nonetheless, the results were still too close for comfort for the GOP, which has been beefing up resources in Texas ever since. \u201cWithout our 38 electoral votes, no Republican candidate has a path to victory for the foreseeable future. That is why we are asking for the support of people around the country,\u201d\u00a0Republican Party of Texas chairman James Dickey said\u00a0on Sirius XM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Saturday in April. \u201cOne of the things that we face as a challenge in Texas is people assume that Texas always has been and always will be red. That\u2019s not true. It was only 16 years ago that Republicans even took the Texas House,\u201d Dickey continued. \u201cDemocrats have been pouring money and pouring resources into Texas to try and flip Texas,\u201d he added. Trump won Texas in 2016 with 52.2 percent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 43.2 percent.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The City Council is expected to consider an ordinance on November 6 that would make it illegal to camp out or sleep in the streets of the city and in residential areas \u201cwhen beds are available at established homeless shelters,\u201d according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Penalties include a $1,000 fine or six months in jail, NBC News reports. Sanders came out against the proposal with force. \u201cHomelessness isn\u2019t a crime, it\u2019s a symptom of the greed that is destroying housing in America,\u201d Sanders said in a statement, according to the Hill. \u201cWe are in the middle of a national housing crisis, with Nevada having the greatest shortage of affordable housing for the lowest income earners, while the wealthiest have it all,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat has got to change.\u201d According to the Hill, the Sanders campaign is planning to \u201cutilize\u00a0its email list to urge\u00a0residents to\u00a0attend a rally outside Las Vegas City Hall on Wednesday, when the\u00a0city council is\u00a0set to vote on the proposal.\u201d However, some councilmembers say that the ordinance is not intended to \u201cput folks in jail.\u201d \u201cThis ordinance is not to put folks in jail,\u201d Councilwoman Victoria Seaman said, according to the Las Vegas Journal-Review. \u201cIt\u2019s to help them get them where they need to go and not have the encroachment upon businesses where you have folks sleeping in doorways,\u201d she added. Councilman Brian Knudsen said: I look at this as an effort of desperation, really, to try to figure out how to manage a situation that is almost unmanageable. The city\u2019s taking really proactive steps, but it\u2019s not enough, and it\u2019s not fast enough. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman also rejected the implication that the proposed ordinance will hurt the homeless population. \u201cThe city believes the ordinance will be a benefit to the homeless population, while at the same time protecting the health and safety of the entire community,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThe city has always demonstrated compassion for the needs of the growing homeless population, understanding the public safety of everyone is a top priority,\u201d she added. Sanders has declared the public housing crisis one of his top priorities, pitching a $1.5 trillion housing plan and calling for a \u201chomes guarantee.\u201d \u201cIn the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right,\u201d his campaign website states. Sanders has faced backlash on the campaign trail for what some have described as his campaign\u2019s tone-deaf moves, reportedly displacing part of the homeless population to hold a rally in Sacramento, California, in August. The socialist senator was also criticized by residents of Queens, who claimed that he largely ignored them, despite holding a rally in the area because it is, as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) described, \u201cground zero for the fight for public housing.\u201d",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who was once the Democrat frontrunner but has been eclipsed by Warren in recent months, made the comments in a self-published Medium piece titled, \u201cI Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career.\u201d The piece, although not mentioning Warren by name, set out to repudiate not only her suggestion that Biden should be seeking the Republican nomination but also the \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d that those who \u201cdisagree with you \u2026 must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics. But it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view,\u201d the former vice president wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing\u2019. \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.'\u201d Biden proceeded to argue such tactics were not conducive to getting \u201canything done\u201d or building a party that was capable of beating President Donald Trump in 2020. \u201cI learned a long time ago that if you question someone\u2019s motivations rather than their judgment you get nowhere,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get past go if you start off by saying the other person is in the pocket of special interests or is corrupt.\u201d Despite the pleas for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d Biden spent a good deal of the piece highlighting his own policy prescriptions, many of which are directly in opposition to those being proposed by more liberal Democrats like Warren. In particular, the former vice president touted his proposal for expanding ObamaCare through a public option, which Warren and others have claimed will not be as efficient as Medicare for All. \u201cI stand with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama \u2014 the party that fought for and passed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an historic transformation of our health care system that took a generation to achieve,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not walking away from ObamaCare \u2026 Maybe others want to walk away from ObamaCare \u2014 I don\u2019t.\u201d The medium piece comes as the Biden and Warren camps have traded barbs back and forth in recent weeks. Biden, specifically, has attacked Warren for lying about how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal without raising taxes on the middle class. It was in response to such attacks last week that Warren suggested Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Even though Biden had technically started the altercation, the former vice president\u2019s campaign manager used the opening to attack\u00a0Warren\u2019s prior Republican affiliation. Many have noted that the flare-up between the two camps underscores the ideological divisions raging within the Democrat Party at the moment. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat to win back the white working class, is campaigning as something of a moderate that will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident by the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. Adding to the antagonism between the camps is the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As Biden\u2019s campaign spins downward, his attacks on Warren, who many now acknowledge as the frontrunner, have only increased, culminating in his Medium piece on Tuesday. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic party my whole career. I know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones,\u201d the former vice president stated. \u201cThat\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d",

Earlier this year,\u00a0AFSCME Local 3299, which represents employees involved in patient care and related services, held a strike as an expression of solidarity with another union on strike against the UC system. The featured guest at a street-corner rally \u2014 which attracted more than 1,000 supporters \u2014 was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who had recently launched his 2020 presidential campaign. As Breitbart News reported from the protest, Sanders barely mentioned the presidential campaign and focused on supporting the striking workers, saying he had always done so.",

When asked \u201cWho is the best candidate\u201d on health care, 24 percent chose Sanders, who has unabashedly touted his Medicare for All plan and admitted that middle class taxes will, in fact, go up. Meanwhile, 15 percent chose Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and 14 percent chose Joe Biden (D). Democrat respondents overwhelmingly chose Sanders as the best candidate on the environment, with 20 percent support. Sanders unveiled the most comprehensive climate change plan of any candidate, coming with a $16 trillion price tag. Biden followed with 12 percent, and Warren came in third with 11 percent. Additionally, 20 percent of those surveyed said Sanders is the best candidate on the economy, and 16 percent said he is the best on immigration. Despite that, respondents did not choose Sanders as the candidate most able to defeat Trump in a general election matchup, with Sanders falling behind Biden with 16 percent to Biden\u2019s 29 percent:   The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " This signals the open borders lobby has, in recent months, impacted his positions on immigration. Sanders vows to \u201coverturn all of President Trump\u2019s actions to demonize and harm immigrants on the first day of his presidency\u201d and offers a list featuring a general overview of the reforms he hopes to enact \u2013 reforms which include many positions the open borders lobby welcomes:  He calls to end the construction of what he considers the \u201cracist and ineffective wall on the U.S.-Mexico Border,\u201d place a moratorium on deportations until the completion of a comprehensive audit, expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA),\n\nand overturn the Trump administration\u2019s travel restrictions against terrorist-laden countries which were outlined by the Obama administration. Additionally, Sanders aims to empower sanctuary cities, signaling his intention to instruct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to \u201cdrop any litigation or funding restrictions relating to sanctuary cities.\u201d The socialist senator also proposes amnesty, promising to \u201cenact a swift, fair pathway to citizenship\u201d for the 11-22 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States. That proposal includes \u201cexpedited citizenship for undocumented youth.\u201d Another massive part of Sanders\u2019 proposal involves \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d border crossings, making it a civil offense and calling its criminal status \u201cmorally wrong.\u201d On that front, Sanders also proposes the creation of a \u201c$14 billion federal grant program for indigent defense,\u201d to \u201censure due process\u201d for illegal immigrants. His plan states: The criminalization of immigrants has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, dehumanized vulnerable migrants, and swelled already-overcrowded jails and prisons. Decades of unaccountable funding for militarizing our border has created a dangerous situation that has led to thousands of deaths along the border and at least seven children have died in the custody of the United States since last year. Bernie believes this is unacceptable. By criminalizing immigration, we have worsened the effects of mass incarceration and racial disparities in our broken criminal justice system. Black immigrants make up 5 percent of the undocumented population but account for 20 percent of those facing removal on criminal grounds. Tying local law enforcement to immigration enforcement perpetuates racial biases in policing, where black and brown people are stopped, harassed, and arrested at higher rates than white people. We must decouple local law enforcement and immigration, leaving the proper authorities to carry out their respective missions. Sanders expresses his intention to extend his overwhelmingly expensive domestic policies, such as Medicare for All and \u201cfree\u201d college, to illegal immigrants. He also vows\u00a0to enact Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-NY) Embrace Act, which is part of her \u201cA Just Society\u201d package. The Embrace Act essentially expands entitlement benefits to illegal immigrants, ensuring that \u201call persons in need are eligible for the largest programs of the social safety net, regardless of their immigration status.\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan states he will \u201ctake bold and necessary executive action\u201d to institute his immigration reforms if Congress does not act swiftly. The presidential hopeful\u2019s plan stands in contrast to the position he held during the last election cycle. He has long called for \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d while claiming to be an opponent of open borders and made waves in 2015 after calling open borders a \u201cKoch brothers proposal\u201d that would \u201cmake everybody in America poorer.\u201d He said during an interview with Vox: What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don\u2019t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs. You know what youth unemployment is in the United States of America today? If you\u2019re a white high school graduate, it\u2019s 33 percent, Hispanic 36 percent, African American 51 percent. You think we should open the borders and bring in a lot of low-wage workers, or do you think maybe we should try to get jobs for those kids? I think from a moral responsibility we\u2019ve got to work with the rest of the industrialized world to address the problems of international poverty, but you don\u2019t do that by making people in this country even poorer.  Sanders even corrected an audience member at a campaign stop in Iowa in April after the individual suggested Sanders supported an open borders immigration policy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you may be getting your information wrong. That\u2019s not my view,\u201d Sanders stated. \u201cWhat we need is comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d \u201cIf you open the borders, my god, there\u2019s a lot of poverty in this world, and you\u2019re going to have people from all over the world,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that we can do at this point. Can\u2019t do it. So that is not my position\u201d: ",

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is again considering running for the Democrat nomination for president in 2020 after previously ruling out a run, a move that comes as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama signaling he may be a late entrant to the race.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " All of this comes as speculation builds that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee, may run again in 2020 as well. Holder did very publicly flirt with running in 2020 before, even making the rounds to travel to some early presidential states for key speeches, but he ultimately announced earlier this year he would not run. In March 2019, he came out and said he would not be running in 2020 and that he planned to instead focus his efforts on redistricting efforts. But now, given how weak the rest of the Democrat presidential field is in 2020, and with other top talent showing that the water is definitely still warm, Holder appears to be reconsidering and thinking about getting into the race after all. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reported late Thursday evening that Holder has been discussing a late entrance into the crowded Democrat field with a handful of close advisers and political consultants:  The news that Holder is reconsidering his decision to bow out on 2020 comes as Bloomberg has filed paperwork in Alabama, which has a Friday filing deadline, to run for president. He has not yet, according to multiple reports, made a decision on whether he will run for president or not, but filing paperwork in Alabama ensures he would have a shot at ballot access there should he mount a national campaign for the Democrat nomination. Politico reported Thursday night: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to file paperwork to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, ahead of a Friday deadline. The move would be a first step toward a national campaign, though Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run. Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson is quoted in the story as well, suggesting that Bloomberg is actively considering jumping into the still-crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field. Wolfson said: We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated \u2014 but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America\u2019s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America\u2019s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist. All of this comes as Clinton, whom some have speculated may get in herself, again toyed with the idea publicly during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin this week and then tweeted video of the joke:  Clinton, Bloomberg, and now Holder all considering late entrances to the crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field comes as its onetime frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has proven particularly weak against his opponents. Biden\u2019s deep corruption concerns with regard to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine and China, and potentially elsewhere around the world in shoes yet to drop, have Democrats concerned that a much more radical leftist like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could win the Democrat nomination. While the hard left of the Democrat Party led by the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d believes that nominating a leftist socialist like Sanders or Warren would energize the party\u2019s base and bring an army to take on President Donald Trump and his base in November 2020, more establishment Democrats are concerned that Warren or Sanders being the nominee would turn off battleground voters and cede the White House back to Trump in 2020. Most of the \u201cSquad,\u201d\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY),\u00a0 Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) endorsed Sanders since the last Democrat debate in October, while the freshman group\u2019s fourth member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) endorsed Warren. Members have insisted there is no divide in the group. Biden\u2019s polling numbers have steadily sunk in recent months, to the point where he has lost the frontrunner status he enjoyed at the beginning of his campaign. Warren has replaced Biden as the frontrunner in many national polls, and especially in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s numbers keep slipping as the public learns more and more about his son\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where he was paid more than $80,000 per month. Questionable Hunter Biden dealings in China, too, have put a spotlight on Biden corruption concerns, all of which in their totality are a nearly daily national news story given the fact that House Democrats have decided to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over the fact that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate corruption including what happened with Hunter Biden and Burisma. If Bloomberg or Clinton decided to launch national presidential campaigns in the next few weeks, they would have considerable resources at the ready. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has immense financial resources at his disposal, while Clinton as the party\u2019s nominee in 2016 and the former first lady, as well as a leader with a national profile and universal name identification among voters, would quickly be able to assemble the structures necessary to compete in the upcoming primaries and caucuses. Holder, though, may have a rougher go of it given that he\u2019s never run a national campaign before and does not have the financial resources of Bloomberg:  Holder does have deep ties to former President Barack Obama, however, and is considered a favorite among the Democrat base given the work he did to help Obama cover up a variety of scandals, including most notably the Operation Fast and Furious scandal. Holder\u2019s coverup of documents on behalf of Obama, who asserted executive privilege to withhold the information from Congress, led to him being the first-ever and only sitting Attorney General of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress. The U.S. House in 2012 voted Holder into both civil and criminal contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal, just one of many scandals that plagued Holder\u2019s Department of Justice.",

He said that while he could defeat President Donald Trump, he had doubts about the primary: \u201cI am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,\u201d he wrote. At the time, Bloomberg went further, arguing that \u201cuntil 2021, and possibly longer, our only real hope for progress lies outside of Washington.\u201d He pledged to continue to devote himself to cherished causes, such as gun control and climate change (which he has pursued by literally paying the salaries of state prosecutors\u00a0around the country). The mayor who tried to ban large sodas\u00a0and claims China\u2019s Xi Jinping is \u201cnot a dictator\u201d was bearish about his chances. Left unsaid at the time was the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden had entered the race, making it harder for Bloomberg and other so-called \u201cmoderates\u201d to join. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who had also toyed with an independent run for president, likewise deferred and then declined to run. Biden, though nearing 80, was the heir apparent to Obama\u2019s donors, if not his endorsement. The party establishment realized it had to stay united to win. But then Biden began to falter \u2014 first in the debates, where he was embarrassed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for his collegiality with former segregationists, and then in the polls. While still nominally the nationwide frontrunner , Biden has lost ground to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). In a recent Iowa poll, Biden was in fourth place \u2014 even losing to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has surged to second there. Moreover, Biden has also lost the battle for the soul of the party. Radical socialist policies have become the default among Democrat activists. Both Warren and Sanders back \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government takeover of health care that would cost $52 trillion under Warren\u2019s plan. She denies that her plan would impose new taxes on middle class families, but Sanders, whose plan has been costed at a mere $32 trillion, openly and proudly admits that it would. In January, when \u201cMedicare for All\u201d moved to the fore \u2014 thanks in part to the efforts of newly-elected \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) \u2014 Bloomberg told New Hampshire voters frankly: \u201cYou could never afford that, you\u2019re talking about trillions of dollars.\u201d He also embraced a version of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 but one that he said would be \u201cachievable,\u201d in contrast to her plan to kill the fossil fuel industry. Bloomberg was incredulous at Democrats\u2019 other policies. He blasted Warren\u2019s \u201cwealth tax\u201d on billionaires such as himself: \u201cIf you want to look at a system that\u2019s non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death \u2014 it\u2019s called Venezuela,\u201d he said. And: \u201cI\u2019m a little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that we never are going to pass or never are going to afford.\u201d It was Joe Biden\u2019s job to stop all of that, and appeal to Democrats in the \u201cbattleground states\u201d who prefer a moderate candidate. But he failed, and none of the other candidates seem to be electable. That is why Democrats have chosen impeachment: they do not believe their candidates can win. And it is why Bloomberg is thinking of jumping in \u2014 in\u00a0Alabama, of all places. He like much of America, is voting \u201cno confidence\u201d in the Democratic presidential field. Joel B.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) plans to hike taxes on the ultra-wealthy would be \u201cincredibly disruptive.\u201d",

      "content": " Clinton appeared at the\u00a0DealBook conference this week and dismissed both Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 plans to tax the wealthy, suggesting their proposals are \u201ccomplicated\u201d and would not work in the long run. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton said. Both Warren and Sanders have unveiled radical redistribution plans as key features of their presidential platforms. Warren\u2019s \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d targets individuals with more than $50 million in assets, levying a two percent tax, which goes up to three percent for those with more than $1 billion in assets. However, her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan increases the taxes on the ultra-wealthy, \u201casking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan also targets America\u2019s ultra-wealthy, proposing a one percent tax on couples with a net worth in excess of $32 million: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. \u201cBillionaires should not exist,\u201d he declared following his plan\u2019s rollout:  Clinton signaled that neither of their proposals is feasible. \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Both Warren and Sanders took aim at billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is close to making a decision on a presidential bid, following the reports that he filed\u00a0presidential primary paperwork in Alabama ahead of the deadline. \u201cWelcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you\u2019re looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here,\u201d Warren tweeted, providing a link to her calculator \u201cfor the billionaires.\u201d \u201cThe billionaire class is scared and they should be scared,\u201d Sanders tweeted following the news.",

      "content": " Warren participated in what progressives describe as a \u201cLatinx community conversation\u201d and took a question from a woman who told an emotional story of her husband, who was deported after serving a jail sentence. \u201cSenator, I have two questions. If you become president, will you pass a moratorium on deportations? And if the answer is yes, would you be willing to include people like my husband, with criminal records, as part of the moratorium,\u201d she asked through a translator.

      "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/hillary-clinton-establishment-democrats-signal-deepening-panic-over-democrat-field/",
      "subtitle": "The elite class and Hillary Clinton, specifically, are unsatisfied with the current Democrat primary field and have signaled their dissatisfaction in a variety of ways in recent weeks, from refusing to endorse former Vice President Joe Biden (D) to dismissing the ultra-far-left candidates\u2019 radical agendas.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " There is no shortage of candidates in the current Democrat primary field. Democrats have, on paper, everything they have claimed to want in terms of diversity in their lineup. They have multiple women \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and self-help guru Marianne Williamson (D). They have candidates who represent racial minorities \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) \u2014 as well as a candidate who embodies their self-proclaimed devotion to the LGBT community. Yet, despite that, Democrat elites like Clinton are unsatisfied, indicating a deepening divide within the Democrat Party. The first presidential primary is less than three months away, yet select Democrats are still mulling a last-minute run. On Thursday, reports indicated that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama, with sources adding that he is \u201cclose\u201d to coming up with a final decision on a presidential bid. Similarly, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly considering a long-shot bid, and Hillary Clinton has been teasing a run for weeks, failing to use her recent interviews to quash the rumors. It has been widely believed among Democrats that Bloomberg and Clinton would not run unless Biden, who was long believed to be the unshakeable frontrunner, showed signs of wavering. Both Warren and Sanders have managed to put a dent in his support, keeping potential candidates like Clinton on the fence and prepared to pounce. Bloomberg\u2019s, Holder\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s purported considerations speak volumes about the state of the current Democrat field. Democrat elites are unsatisfied with the choices, fearing Biden\u2019s lack of stamina in a general election matchup against Trump and questioning the electability of Warren and Sanders, who have unabashedly embraced far-left proposals and positions that strategic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have long attempted to keep at bay. Clinton has openly criticized the positions of Warren and Sanders, causing some to wonder if she is subtly attempting to undermine the field or in the very least, influence the candidates\u2019 positions. She appeared at the\u00a0New York Times\u2019\u00a0DealBook conference this week and took aim at ultra-wealthy tax proposals and Medicare for All \u2014 two progressive plans both Warren and Sanders not only support, but champion. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said of the wealth tax proposals, calling them \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Clinton also expressed doubt that Warren\u2019s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan would ever pass. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Clinton replied when asked if she thought Warren\u2019s plan would pass. \u201cI don\u2019t, but the goal is the right goal. \u201d \u201cI believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have, a public option is something I\u2019ve been in favor of for a very long time. I don\u2019t believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs,\u201d she added. Clinton has also taken direct aim at candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), calling her a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and suggesting that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast with Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe last month. Time and time again, rather than encouraging Democrats to rally behind a candidate in the existing presidential primary field, Clinton has subtly hinted that she could jump in the race instead. In October, President Trump tweeted that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d as long as she explains \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d and fueled further speculation during an appearance on\u00a0PBS NewsHour. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d Clinton kicked off an additional 2020 buzz on social media after posting a quote from\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power:   @Beyonce speaks the truth.\u2063 \u2063 #GutsyWomen A post shared by  Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Oct 22, 2019 at 10:03am PDT The twice-failed presidential candidate\u2019s book tour has almost doubled as an outlet to express her views on the 2020 race. She dropped yet another doubtful analysis of the current 2020 field during an event at Portland\u2019s Revolution Hall last month, suggesting that it would be nearly impossible for anyone in the current field to unseat Trump in the next election in the event that he is not impeached. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running,\u201d she said. She continued: We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached, or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard,\u2019 because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has done little to extinguish the mounting rumors, explaining that his wife \u201cmay or may not ever run for anything\u201d during an appearance at Georgetown Law\u2019s second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lecture in Washington, DC, last month. Most recently, Clinton dodged a question on whether she is planning a last-minute jump into the race, reverting to jogging jokes at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, to run? You know, I have always been a very, very slow runner. I am embarrassingly slow,\u201d she said, continuing her bit. \u201cThere\u2019s been some teasing and some hinting that, maybe, you\u2019re sitting off in the wings here and waiting for some moment,\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin said. Clinton, however, refused to answer the question directly:  Look, I think I would have been a really good president. I think I could have been a very effective leader. We have real divides in the country over all kinds of things, but I certainly, in my time in the Senate and secretary of state, worked really hard, as you say, to actually solve problems, not exacerbate them or ignore them. I would have done everything I could to try to get us positioned for the future. That\u2019s what a leader is supposed to do. Elections are supposed to be about the future and leadership should be about the future. I think I could have done a really good job. I think the last election was deeply flawed and that there were so many unprecedented problems in that election that it\u2019s almost hard to make sense of. Sources for both the New York Times and Washington Post have said that Clinton has not ruled out a presidential bid and is actively keeping an eye on it, which is overwhelmingly evident to those who have been tracking her latest remarks. The possible late entrances \u2014 from Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder \u2014 indicate the growing worry over not only the direction of the Democrat field but the Democrat Party\u2019s ability to defeat Trump in 2020. While Democrat voters are more open to radical policies, such as Medicare for All and multitrillion dollar proposals to combat climate change, there are growing concerns that those proposals will not bode well for the left in a general election matchup. Despite that, Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate, is boldly running with his multitrillion-dollar, big government proposals and has garnered support from three individuals largely demonstrative of the ideological divide within the party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s infamous feud with Pelosi over the summer was almost a foreshadowing of the internal strife to be seen within the Democrat Party in the presidential primary. There is an ongoing, although largely unsaid, matchup between establishment Democrats and the unabashedly socialist \u201cnew\u201d left. Ultimately, the Democrat establishment worries the progressive flank will hand Trump, and his MAGA agenda, four more years in the White House.",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " In his national immigration plan released this week, Sanders \u2014 who once disavowed open borders and endorsed more detention space for border crossers \u2014 is now vowing to halt the deportation of all illegal aliens currently in deportation proceedings in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, regardless of their criminal history. In any given year, more than 6,600 convicted murderers and sex offenders are arrested by ICE and placed into deportation proceedings. Under Sanders\u2019 plan, those criminal illegal aliens would have their deportations halted, allowing them to remain in the United States for an extended period of time. In December 2018, there were more than 6,100 \u201cLevel 1\u201d convicted criminals in ICE custody. These are the most violent, career criminal-types. Sanders\u2019 plan would ensure that none are deported. At the same time that ICE would be banned from deporting even the most violent convicted criminal illegal aliens under Sanders\u2019 plan, new arrests by ICE agents would pile up and potentially cause a shortage of detention space for the agency. One particular case, for example, involves 59-year-old\u00a0Amir Abdelghani \u2014 a convicted terrorist \u2014 who was deported this year by ICE. Sanders\u2019 plan, though, would have halted his deportation. Jumping to copy Sanders\u2019 plan, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2014 who has promised to decriminalize illegal immigration \u2014 said this week that she may halt all deportations of illegal aliens until Congress passes an amnesty for the 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

But you built that fortune in America \u2014 I guarantee \u2014 you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part by protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you make it to the top of one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in the two cents so every other kid in America has the chance,\u201d she added.

So tonight, we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, \u2018Sorry, you ain\u2019t going to buy this election,'\u201d the presidential hopeful said to cheers. Sources close to Bloomberg say he is \u201cincreasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned\u201d to defeat Trump in 2020 and note that he is willing to \u201cspend whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cMike will spend whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d the source close to the former mayor told Axios. \u201cThe nation is about to see a very different campaign than we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d Bloomberg, if he runs, would not focus on early primary and caucus states, focusing instead on Super Tuesday states. Sanders dismissed the strategy. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. You\u2019re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThose days are gone.\u201d Sanders suggested during an interview with ABC that Bloomberg\u2019s concerns are rooted in arrogance and slammed him for refusing to meet with \u201cordinary people\u201d in early primary and caucus states. \u201cI\u2019m doing five events this weekend right here in Iowa,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re all over New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, California.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s too important.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Monday unveiled his $62 billion plan to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), promising to end the exclusion on what the presidential hopeful describes as \u201cmedically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries\u201d and emphasizing the need to provide \u201cabortion care.\u201d",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The former chair of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee unveiled his VA plan on Veterans Day, proposing $62 billion in new funding to revamp the VA. \u201cToday, due to serious underfunding, the VA\u2019s infrastructure is crumbling and in vital need of repair. VA hospitals have gone without needed updates and maintenance, and outpatient clinics and Vet Centers have gone unopened,\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan states. \u201cAs President, Bernie will invest at least $62 billion in the infrastructure needed to provide the cutting-edge health care services our veterans have earned and deserve,\u201d it continues. A good portion of Sanders\u2019 plan is devoted to guaranteeing quality health care for veterans, which he believes Medicare for All will enhance. \u201cCoupled with Medicare for All, veterans will be able to rely on a health care system that is working for them, not against them; a system focused on a person\u2019s health, not their ability to pay,\u201d his plan states. Part of that quality medical care, Sanders assesses, should include the ability to undergo taxpayer-funded \u201cmedically necessary gender affirmation surgeries\u201d and receive what he calls \u201cabortion care.\u201d As president, Sanders would \u201cend the VA\u2019s blanket exclusion on medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries\u201d and\u00a0 \u201censure that women veterans will no longer be forced outside the VA system for basic women\u2019s health services, including fertility treatment, abortion care, or specialized cancer treatment and prevention services.\u201d Sanders is not the only presidential candidate to focus on taxpayer-funded \u201ctransition-related\u201d surgeries as part of his VA plan. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) promised\u00a0\u201cgender-affirming and culturally-competent\u201d health care for LGBT service members and veterans as part of her comprehensive veterans plan released last week. \u201cA Warren VA will ensure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care they need,\u201d Warren\u2019s plan states. \u201cThat means providing all medically necessary care related to the health of transgender people, including\u00a0transition-related surgery, and allowing providers discretion to deem gender-affirming procedures as medically necessary based on an individualized assessment,\u201d it continues, noting that such surgeries will be available under her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan as well. \u201cThis care will also be available\u00a0under Medicare for All. Professional medical associations recognize the need for transition-related surgery,\u201d her plan states. \u201cVA\u2019s blanket exclusion policy of medically necessary treatment is not grounded in medicine; it should be repealed,\u201d it adds.",

He eventually admitted that the financial burden would \u201cend up on some taxpayers\u2019 shoulders.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, however, does not view cost as an issue, arguing that we are already \u201cpaying\u201d in the form of natural disasters. \u201cAnd when it comes to a Green New Deal, people say, always always always with this question of how are you going to pay for it, as though we\u2019re not paying for it now,\u201d she said, citing natural disasters that have occurred since the beginning of time.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Biden, who is one of the only 2020 Democrats to come out in opposition to the universal health care proposal, was asked during a televised CNN town hall in Iowa about criticisms he made regarding Warren\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d brand of politics. The former vice president made the remarks last week in a self-published Medium piece after Warren suggested he was running in the wrong presidential primary because he was unwilling to support Medicare for All. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, she attacked me,\u201d Biden said when asked about the dust up. \u201cShe went out and said\u2026Biden is a coward, Biden is\u2026and she went down the list of saying I should be in a Republican primary. What do you call that?\u201d The former vice president defended his decision to write the Medium piece, saying there was an \u201cattitude that exists\u201d in the country right now that \u201cif you disagree with me, you must be bad.\u201d Despite the pleas for civility and understanding, Biden proceeded to lambast Warren\u2019s views and attitude as \u201celitist\u201d and condescending once more. Although the moderator, CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, attempted to push back against Biden\u2019s comments, what ended up being lost in the mix was that the former vice president had started the altercation over Medicare for All. Earlier this month, Biden accused Warren of lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she would pay for it during an interview with \u201cPBS News Hour.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president said when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal. \u201cLook, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it.\u201d Even prior to the interview, Biden\u2019s campaign had been pressuring Warren for months to explain how she would cover the costs associated from Medicare for All, which some estimate could run upwards of $32 trillion, without raising taxes on the middle class. When the Massachusetts Democrats did finally answer that question with a detailed proposal, Biden\u2019s campaign jumped to claim she was promising to raise taxes on middle class families, even though Warren expressly pledged in her plan there would be \u201cno middle class tax increases.\u201d \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manger, said at the time.\u00a0\u201cSenator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d Warren, herself, responded to the attack while campaigning in Iowa by accusing the former vice president of \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d on Medicare for All to the benefit of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cIf anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies\u2026drug companies\u2026and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes,\u201d the senator said, \u201cthen I think they\u2019re running in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Warren, in part, was echoing her progressive rival from Vermont, Sanders, with the attack. In July, Sanders had publicly accused Biden of parroting\u00a0GOP talking points in an effort to undermine the credibility of Medicare for All. \u201cObviously what Biden was doing\u00a0is what the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries, Republicans, do: ignoring the fact that people will save money on their health care because they will no longer have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d\u00a0Sanders, who authored the initial Medicare for Al bill in 2017, told The New York Times over the summer. Regardless if the rebuke had partially been used before, Warren\u2019s suggestion that Biden should be running as a Republican sent the former vice president\u2019s team spinning. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, even\u00a0claimed Warren has no right to question his Democrat credentials since she herself was a Republican until the age of 47-years-old.  When that attack failed to get traction, Biden penned his Medium piece, accusing Warren of brandishing an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201ccondescending\u201d brand of politics that was eroding the national discourse. Although the former vice president never once mentioned Warren in the piece, his rigorous defense of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option left little to the imagination. The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was\u00a0relegated\u00a0to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As the candidates standing in the 2020 field has reversed, with Warren being described as the frontrunner by even some of Biden\u2019s former Obama administration colleagues, the former vice president has only escalated his criticism, as exhibited at the CNN town hall on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m more of a Democrat from my shoe sole to my ears than about anybody running in this party,\u201d Biden claimed, before clarifying that also included Warren.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) issued statements of support on Monday for Bolivian strongman Evo Morales, following his resignation.",
      "author": "Ben Kew",
      "content": " Morales announced his resignation on Sunday evening after nearly 14 years in power, in what leftists have falsely branded a \u201ccoup.\u201d Morales chose to step down after the Organization of American States (OAS) published a report revealing widespread evidence of fraud in the October 20 presidential election that granted Morales an unprecedented fourth term in power. The Bolivian\u00a0military issued a statement saying suggesting that, given the OAS report, Morales should step aside and allow a free and fair election.  Many on the left were\u00a0furious by his departure, including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who declared himself \u201cvery concerned.\u201d \u201cI am very concerned about what appears to be a coup in Bolivia, where the military, after weeks of political unrest, intervened to remove President Evo Morales,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cThe U.S. must call for an end to violence and support Bolivia\u2019s democratic institutions\u201d:  Sanders did not offer any explanation for what evidence he has seen that would indicate Morales\u2019 resignation was a \u201ccoup.\u201d New York Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, who supports Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party primary, asserted that the resignation was definitively a coup in a bilingual post to Twitter. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now in Bolivia isn\u2019t democracy, it\u2019s a coup,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe people of Bolivia deserve free, fair, and peaceful elections \u2013 not violent seizures of power\u201d:  Ocasio-Cortez has not addressed the extensive evidence of fraud that the OAS found in the election that granted Morales power in her call for Bolivia to have \u201cfree, fair, and peaceful elections.\u201d The pair\u2019s comments came hours after reaction from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who despite previously\u00a0coming out\u00a0in favor of the murderous Maduro regime in Venezuela, called on the world to \u201cunequivocally oppose political violence\u201d in Bolivia. \u201cThere\u2019s a word for the President of a country being pushed out by the military. It\u2019s called a coup,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe must unequivocally oppose political violence in Bolivia. Bolivians deserve free and fair elections\u201d:  Omar also offered no evidence that the military \u201cpushed out\u201d Morales. Reaction from the Republican side was very different. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), widely considered the most influential Republican voice on issues surrounding Latin America, pointed to the fact that Morales\u2019s re-election was unconstitutional as he had already served three terms in office.  His sentiment was echoed by President Donald Trump, who described it as a \u201csignificant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d \u201cAfter nearly 14 years and his recent attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people, Morales\u2019s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard,\u201d Trump said in a statement. He continued: The United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for abiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution. These events send a strong signal to the illegitimate regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua that democracy and the will of the people will always prevail. We are now one step closer to a completely democratic, prosperous, and free Western Hemisphere.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed. The Monmouth University poll, taken\u00a0November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren\u2019s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth\u2019s previous poll. No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three \u2014 Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:  According to Monmouth, Buttigieg \u201chas gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.\u201d Per Monmouth: His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren).\u00a0 Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden\u2019s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders).\u00a0 Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren). \u201cButtigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,\u201d\u00a0Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray\u00a0said, noting that the presidential hopeful\u2019s support cannot be attributed to any one group. \u201cWhile he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can\u2019t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.\u201d Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent.",

      "subtitle": "Former Democrat Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), in recent days, has exposed herself as a radical feminist leftist hellbent on taking down the president and maiming those who support him.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The disgraced Democrat fell from her position of legislative authority in stunning fashion, resigning from Congress after finding herself unable to overcome mounting allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with members of her staff. In recent days, Hill has rebranded herself as an \u201cunfiltered,\u201d woman, no longer shackled by expectations to represent a relatively split district or distracted by the political jockeying that dominates the nation\u2019s capital. As such, she has exposed herself for what she has been all along: A radical feminist leftist obsessed with taking down the president. The California Democrat, 32,\u00a0rose to the national spotlight in October after allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with members of her congressional staff surfaced. The allegations included a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with a female staffer \u2013 a relationship she eventually admitted to and described as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d She was also accused of carrying on an affair with a male staffer, which she denied. Nonetheless, the allegations sparked an ethics probe. Hill formally resigned shortly thereafter, but not before voting alongside her impeachment-driven colleagues to pass the partisan impeachment inquiry resolution, which has yet to expose any instance of criminal behavior on the part of President Trump. Hill, bizarrely, said she voted in favor of the resolution\u00a0\u201con behalf of the women of the United States of America.\u201d Prior to the vote, she attributed her political demise, in part, to sexism and blasted \u201cright-wing media\u201d and \u201cRepublican opponents\u201d for\u00a0\u201cenabling and perpetuating\u201d her husband\u2019s \u201cabuse\u201d by reporting on her alleged sexual escapades. Scandal aside, Hill did not tend to make headlines during her short tenure as a congresswoman. While she was part of the infamous freshman class of House Democrats \u2013 which includes Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) \u2013 she maintained a relatively low profile, at least in comparison. That could have had something to do with the fact that she represented a relatively split district, defeating incumbent Republican\u00a0Steve Knight with 54.4 percent to Knight\u2019s 45.6 percent. The district has flipped from red to blue since its creation in both House races and presidential elections, causing its representatives, specifically, to play a different political game than counterparts in \u201csafe\u201d districts. As an example, Ocasio-Cortez, who has championed radical proposals such as the Green New Deal and formally endorsed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT),\u00a0secured a win in New York\u2019s 14th district with a whopping 78.2 percent of the vote. Tlaib secured\u00a084.6 percent in Michigan\u2019s 13th district, and Omar garnered 78.2 percent of the vote in Minnesota\u2019s 5th district. The wide margins grant far-left Democrats more flexibility in terms of promoting radical ideas and ultra-progressive proposals \u2013 proposals that tend to make more \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats in the House nervous due to electability. Hill did not have that luxury, until now. The\u00a0mask has slipped. She has been, essentially, celebrating her freedom from any burdensome cover like representing a politically split district, which forced her to keep her true thoughts at bay. On Tuesday evening, the former lawmaker announced in a video on Twitter that she would soon be resurfacing in a more \u201cunfiltered\u201d way, admitting that it had everything to do with the fact that she no longer serves in Congress. \u201c[I] also wanted you to know I\u2019m starting to resurface. You\u2019re going to be seeing more of me on social media. More of me out and about so I look forward to seeing all of you,\u201d she said, donning a shirt from her \u201cgood friend Ayanna [Pressley]. \u201cAnd I wanted to say that now I\u2019m not a member of Congress it might be a little bit more unfiltered, which I\u2019m kind of looking forward to,\u201d she added: The fight continues \u2014 if you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention. (shout out to my friend @AyannaPressley for the shirt and the reminder \ud83d\ude09) pic.twitter.com/jUpBOcYIy4 \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 12, 2019  Hill originally ran on run-of-the-mill Democrat ideas, signaling support for Medicare for All and a federal ban on \u201cassault\u201d weapons and calling climate change \u201cone of the greatest threats to our planet.\u201d However, she also took what many described as a \u201cmoderate\u201d approach on immigration, expressing a willingness to compromise: Border security in exchange for DACA protections \u2013 a departure from the \u201cSquad.\u201d In a June 12 piece ahead of the 2018 election, the New Yorker described Hill as a \u201ccentrist Democrat\u201d who \u201cflouts the old identity conventions of female political contenders\u201d by identifying as bisexual. Prior to joining Congress, Hill led PATH\u00a0(People Assisting the Homeless) and \u201cspearheaded a ballot measure to raise more than a billion dollars to fund permanent supportive housing for the homeless in Los Angeles.\u201d She told the New Yorker: Passing H.H.H. was this incredible victory. But instead of being able to celebrate, we realized what it meant to have a Republican House and Senate and Donald Trump as President\u2014that that could undermine every bit of hard work we\u2019d accomplished. So she ran and won, successfully flipping the district back to blue, in part by painting herself, with the help of media, as a more \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrat. Hill has since shown that is far from the case. The new, \u201cunfiltered\u201d Hill has made good on her promise to resurface, unabashedly picking fights with her former colleagues on Twitter and others she likely would have otherwise ignored, had her alleged sexual escapades not taken her down. On Wednesday, Hill\u00a0weighed\u00a0in on the extraordinary coded message Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) dropped in a string of impeachment-related tweets on Wednesday, which read, \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself\u201d \u2013 a social media phenomenon which has been featured on a number of memes in recent weeks: No like this actually happened. Real members of Congress tweeting out real conspiracy theories. In an acrostic no less. https://t.co/yVVULw6PQb \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 14, 2019  \u201cYou\u2019re surprised by me? You single handedly taught an entire country a new word. #throuple. And wth is up with that tattoo?\u201d Gosar said, referencing a\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0article that featured \u201cshocking\u201d photos of the former congresswoman. \u201cGee Doc, I am sorry you\u2019re behind the times. @sho_shameless taught the country that word way back in season 7,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t talk to me about a tattoo\u2026 because you just admitted you clicked to see my nudes and that disturbs the hell out of me,\u201d she added, referring to the photos featured in the Daily Mail article: Gee Doc, I am sorry you\u2019re behind the times. @sho_shameless taught the country that word way back in season 7. And please don\u2019t talk to me about a tattoo\u2026 because you just admitted you clicked to see my nudes and that disturbs the hell out of me. https://t.co/UyjSvFGwRX \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 14, 2019  Hill was particularly active during Wednesday\u2019s lackluster impeachment hearing, desperately trying to assist her former Democrat colleagues from the sidelines. In one tweet, she declared that the identity of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose second-hand complaint sparked the partisan impeachment inquiry, \u201cDOES NOT MATTER.\u201d In the tweet, she referred to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a man and added a sarcastic explanation to her critics: PS I am saying \u2018he\u2019 because I listened to The Daily podcast with @mikiebarb today and they said the whistleblower is known to be a man.\u00a0 Today\u2019s episode \u2018A third graders guide to the impeachment hearings\u2019 is a must listen for learning\u2026 and also adorable. In another tweet, she claimed that Trump \u201cwas not asking for something to help America but to straight up help HIMSELF get re-elected.\u201d That Democrat talking point, however, is patently false. Trump did not condition aid on investigations into a potential political opponent. Hill also used her renewed social media presence to attack more of her colleagues, dropping an \u201cOMG\u201d and continuing to lambaste Republicans. She even retweeted a highly inflammatory remark from Samantha Bee\u2019s \u2013\u00a0a notorious anti-Trumper \u2013\u00a0Full Frontal account, which read, \u201cJim Jordan is pretending that the impeachment witnesses are Ohio State wrestlers and he\u2019s an assistant coach.\u201d She also attempted to compare President Zelensky\u2019s denial of \u201cpressure\u201d to her own experience of alleged sexual abuse. \u201c@RepJohnRatcliffe is trying to say that because Zelensky publicly said he wasn\u2019t being coerced by Trump means he wasn\u2019t. Well, I denied any kind of abuse not just publicly but to my closest friends and family for years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is no different.\u201d More: OMG. If you had any doubt as to how hard it is for the Republicans to legitimately cast doubt on any of this, please turn on the hearings now and see if you can make sense of anything they are trying to make Taylor say. I sure can\u2019t. #impeachmenthearings \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 13, 2019  @RepRatcliffe \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 13, 2019  No @RepStefanik. Those are not the most important facts. The most important fact is that Ukraine received the aid  BECAUSE the whistleblower stepped up. The timeline matters: Sept 9 \u2013 Intel rcvd complaint & launched investigation. Sept 11 \u2013 Aid released. https://t.co/aryOJt6Pte \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 13, 2019  .@DevinNunes wants hearings to stop so they can scream about 1) the whistleblower, 2) pretend Ukrainian \"election meddling\" to hurt Trump when real meddling was Russia helping Trump, & 3) Hunter Biden/ Burisma. ALL the red herrings they could find. \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 13, 2019  In another tweet, Hill lamented Breitbart News for merely reporting on her self-proclaimed emergence back into the spotlight: Uh oh\u2026 Breitbart\u2019s mad that I stood back up. What are they going to throw at me next to try and make me go away? https://t.co/9VM39pkNB6 \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 14, 2019  In the days following her political fall, Hill has attempted to attach her recent experience to a greater feminist movement, using her newfound voice as a modern-day feminist rallying cry. Shortly after her resignation, Hill, who admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, took to Twitter and referred to Trump as a\u00a0\u201cserial sexual predator\u201d and encouraged U.S. voters to put a woman in the office as a way to stomp the patriarchy and \u201cshow women and girls that we matter\u201d: A year from now, we have a chance to show women and girls that we matter. Hopefully, we\u2019ll elect a woman as President \u2014 if not, let\u2019s work to make sure a serial sexual predator no longer occupies the White House. What are we as a nation going to do? Ladies, show up. \u2014 Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 4, 2019  It is a similar sentiment Hill expressed on the House floor following her final vote on the impeachment inquiry, attempting to tie the impeachment of Trump to feminism \u2013\u00a0two subjects that have little in common. \u201cAnd so today, as my last vote, I voted on impeachment proceedings. Not just because of corruption, obstruction of justice, or gross misconduct, but because of the deepest abuse of power including the abuse of power over women,\u201d Hill said on the House floor. \u201cToday, as my final act, I voted to move forward with the impeachment of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will then make tomorrow better than today,\u201d she added. As Hill teased, Americans can expect more from the former lawmaker, who is now \u2013\u00a0for all intents and purposes \u2013 politically exposed, unrestricted, and uncuffed.",

The lawmakers said at the press conference that the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act is one of a series of bills they plan to introduce\u00a0to put in place a number of radical programs detailed in the Green New Deal Resolution, including ending air travel, halting the use of fossil fuels and retrofitting every building in the United States to fight climate change. Ocasio-Cortez said she invited public housing residents, many of whom chanted \u201chousing is a human right,\u201d that she and Sanders wanted them to help shape the legislation because other people are \u201ctoo far from the pain.\u201d \u201cPublic housing is one area of our infrastructure that\u2019s in immediate crisis that is actually threatening people\u2019s lives,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect place for us to reimagine what a progressive economic agenda can do, particularly with a Green New Deal context.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) \u2013\u00a0whose members frequently take to Twitter to express their unfiltered critiques of President Trump and offer their ultra-leftist, borderline socialist views. Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar eagerly endorsed Sanders, who has called for a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d promising massive proposals such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and \u201cfree\u201d college and \u201cfree\u201d universal childcare. Pressley veered from her colleagues, throwing her weight behind Warren, who has also proposed ultra-far left proposals, including Medicare for All and an \u201cUltra-Millionaire\u201d tax. Obama continued, according to the Times: I don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Obama has yet to throw his support behind any of the current Democrat candidates, including his former running mate and vice president Joe Biden (D). Obama ally Deval Patrick (D), former governor of Massachusetts, recently jumped into the race \u00ad\u2013 a move Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte described as a slap in the face to Biden: Well, Patrick and Obama\u00a0are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another major Obama figure, is also reportedly considering a longshot presidential bid, further adding to the growing belief that establishment Democrats \u2013\u00a0Obama and Hillary Clinton included \u2013\u00a0are increasingly worried by what the current Democrat field has to offer.",

He also vowed to \u201cexpunge past convictions of marijuana related offenses, and ensure that victims of the War on Drugs are not passed over by the burgeoning marijuana industry.\u201d Additionally, Sanders promised to reinvest in communities most impacted by the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d He said he will do that, in part, by creating a $10 billion federal program to help former convicts work in the marijuana industry.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).   Modine\u2019s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats \u2014 Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion. A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll\u00a0shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren\u2019s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.   The Biden campaign\u2019s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful\u2019s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter \u2014 a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren \u2014 and reported just $9 million cash on hand. \u201cHis rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,\u201d as Breitbart News noted.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " America First Policies, the president\u2019s official Super PAC, gave Breitbart News on Monday an exclusive sneak peek at findings from its focus group work nationwide in the last month. The organization has now conducted 18 separate focus groups in nine different American cities since late October. Those cities include Des Moines, Iowa, Orlando, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. America First Policies has gathered 36 total hours of focus group data from the participants, all of whom are independents or swing voters in their respective cities. The biggest takeaway from all the groups, including one in Pittsburgh thatwas conducted after the first House Intelligence Committee public impeachment hearing last Wednesday that featured State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, is that swing voters are not being moved in the slightest against Trump by the impeachment narrative Democrats are offering. America First Policies screened footage from these focus groups for Breitbart News at their headquarters\u00a0 just outside the nation\u2019s capital on Monday afternoon, including the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, group that was filmed after that first Democrat impeachment hearing. When the moderator asked the room if anyone thinks Donald Trump should be impeached, not a single person in the room\u2014all independents, most of whom do not like Trump\u2019s personality\u2014said they did. After a moment of silence when the focus group conductor asked the room of independents if Trump should be impeached, a man finally said: \u201cNot even close.\u201d The man continued when asked why the Democrats are pushing for impeachment: This is their platform. This is all they got\u2014and what they got is nothing. They want to keep to politics and Trump is not a politician. They are going to do everything they can because he bucked the system. He exposed what the draining the swamp and everything means. That\u2019s the thing\u2014they don\u2019t even have anything close to valid. It\u2019s just nothing. Instead of focusing on policies, they\u2019re trying to do this to win the election. When the moderator asks another man how House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has done handling the impeachment inquiry so far, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t know because I can\u2019t believe half of what the media puts out because they\u2019re biased\u2014and there\u2019s been no proof on the table.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not all Trump\u2026 I\u2019m not a party voter,\u201d that man continues. \u201cBut he calls it like it is. He\u2019s a renegade\u2026 Do I respect the man? I don\u2019t. But I respect the office. But I don\u2019t see where they have enough to say he knew about it so\u2026\u201d Up next was a woman, who said she is not a Trump supporter but thinks the president is getting railroaded: I\u2019m not a Trump supporter by any means, but I totally disagree with what they\u2019re doing. I know he\u2019s not perfect, but by the same coin he\u2019s right there and he tells you how it is. I don\u2019t agree with all of the things. But at least he\u2019s trying to do things. After that another woman and another man\u2014both of whom are not Trump supporters\u2014made the case that Democrats\u2019 impeachment goals are meaningless because the Senate will clear Trump even if the House impeaches him. \u201cSadly, I don\u2019t feel\u2014just because they\u2019ll stick to party lines\u2014that this will go anywhere,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd they have to know that, so then you have to ask why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d the man added. \u201cCorrect,\u201d the woman concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of the taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Another man said he thinks the Democrats are doing it so Trump \u201chas an asterisk next to his name going into the next election.\u201d He went on: But another thing is I think it shows a weakness, or a lack of confidence, in the Democrat field and concern that their eventual candidate can\u2019t beat Donald Trump. Otherwise, why would you be doing this a year out from the election? This dismissal of impeachment was a consistent theme throughout the focus groups that America First Policies conducted throughout the country. Generally speaking, most of the focus groups\u2014video from all of which Breitbart News reviewed in America First\u2019s northern Virginia offices\u2014had no supporters of even the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The handful of those that did support an actual inquiry\u2014because they want elected leaders like Trump to face scrutiny and they support investigations, not because they think he actually did anything wrong\u2014certainly do not think there is enough evidence to impeach, never mind convict Trump and remove him from office. A woman in the North Carolina focus group, for instance, said Democrats are \u201cwasting a lot of time and money\u201d pursuing Trump\u2019s impeachment and should instead \u201cget back to doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, passing laws.\u201d A man in that group also summed up what independents are thinking, dismissing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment agenda: When the news of this first broke, I was sitting there thinking okay these are conversations that mostly went on and then you step back and look what they are\u2014from what media outlet\u2014and you go, okay, his personality is arrogant. We\u2019ve all seen him say something stupid. However, on the flip side of that, all this secrecy\u2014the smoke and mirrors\u2014the unwillingness to unmask the whistleblower out of fears of safety. Come on. What are you hiding? These sentiments on impeachment were not the only thing that America First\u2019s focus groups uncovered. Another consistent theme is that while these independent swing voters like President Trump\u2019s policies and what he\u2019s accomplished for the country, they do not like his personality or his tweets. Generally speaking, the swing voters wish Trump would tweet less attacks on opponents\u2014and not say certain things sometimes. But they did also reveal that while the voters find Trump\u2019s abrasive personality off-putting at times, they do like that he is a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d in the words of one and that he has exposed corruption in the federal government. Perhaps most importantly for Trump, the voters do not see him as part of the political system\u2014they do not consider Trump a \u201cpolitician,\u201d despite the fact he\u2019s been in office for nearly three years now\u2014and they still consider him an outsider or \u201crenegade,\u201d in the words of one Pittsburgh-area independent. What\u2019s more, America First\u2019s focus groups also uncovered a lot of sentiment among independents about several of the top Democrat presidential candidates. Regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, top terms focus group participants used were \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cforgetful,\u201d and \u201cObama\u2019s second hand.\u201d They also described Biden as a \u201ccreep\u201d who makes unwanted advances against young women and as \u201cthe swamp,\u201d a sign that America First Policies officials believe demonstrates that attacks on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden are breaking through to voters nationwide. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is described as a \u201csocialist,\u201d \u201coutspoken,\u201d a \u201cliar,\u201d and \u201cacademic.\u201d Warren\u2019s history of falsely claiming to be a Native American has broken through, as several of the independent voters in the focus groups across the country called Warren \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was described as \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d Another interesting finding from these focus groups is that these independent voters do not see much of a difference between any of the Democrats, even when there are actual policy-specific nuances separating them. For instance, when former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) called for door-to-door gun confiscation and mandatory government-controlled buybacks of Americans\u2019 firearms before he later dropped out of the presidential race, one woman in a North Carolina focus group expressed outrage at the whole Democrat field over it. She said: \u201cI watched ten minutes of the Democratic debate and when I heard somebody talking about taking your guns I thought \u2018you just fucking killed yourself.\u2019 What was he talking about when he was saying he was going to take our guns?\u201d \u201cNo way in hell are they getting our guns,\u201d another woman said. The woman did not use the name \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke\u201d when expressing her frustrations with Democrats on gun confiscation, but just broadly spoke of all the Democrats like this. America First Policies officials told Breitbart News that generally speaking on issues like gun confiscation, illegal immigration, and healthcare\u2014particularly the backing of the government takeover of healthcare through \u201cMedicare For All\u201d\u2014these focus group voters do not see much nuance between the different Democrats\u2019 plans and policy visions, a problem for Democrats as swing voters are painting them all with a broad brush into radically leftist socialist positions. What\u2019s more, the only two Democrat candidates for president these focus group independent swing voters spoke highly of were Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and businessman Andrew Yang. The swing voters, the America First Policies officials told Breitbart News, like Gabbard\u2019s military service and the fight she just got in with 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for Yang, they said, the voters are intrigued by his different kinds of ideas like the universal basic income idea.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina.\u00a0Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively. Biden\u2019s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was \u201csafe,\u201d while 55 percent said the former vice president was \u201cdown to earth.\u201d\u00a0A further 71 percent believed Biden\u2019s policy stances were \u201cabout right for defeating [President] Donald Trump\u201d in 2020. Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as \u201crisky\u201d by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist. The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points. Biden\u2019s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from Monmouth Poll estimated that\u00a0more than six-in-ten of South Carolina\u2019s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020. Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates\u2019 level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats\u00a0across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president\u2019s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux. In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter\u2019s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president\u2019s political position. Biden\u2019s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles\u00a0that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs. As Biden\u2019s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg\u2019s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor\u2019s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina. Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor\u2019s speeches. Another likely late\u00a0entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor\u2019s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he\u2019s already running. As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president\u2019s position in South Carolina. When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg\u2019s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey.",

      "content": " Warren expressed her willingness to consider a UBI, which quite literally amounts to the government handing individuals and families a \u201cbasic\u201d income per month regardless of employment or income status, in a Washington Post survey that asked, \u201cShould the federal government pay a universal basic income to every American adult?\u201d Three candidates were listed as supporting the measure \u2013 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Marianne Williamson (D), and Yang. Notably, two candidates were listed as \u201copen to it\u201d \u2013\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) and Warren. \u201cWe absolutely must raise wages and strengthen the social safety net so that every American has basic financial security. Universal basic income and universal living wages are options to consider,\u201d Warren told the Post, noting her push for a $15 minimum wage. She continued: To raise wages, I have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, and empowering American workers at big American corporations to elect no less than 40 percent of the company board members \u2014 giving workers a powerful voice in corporate decisions about wages and benefits. Her position is drastically different than Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT), who typically holds similar views to Warren. He has openly expressed skepticism of a universal basic income, contending that his federal jobs guarantee is better because \u201cpeople want to work.\u201d \u201cWe take a very different approach from Mr. Yang and that is I believe in a jobs guarantee,\u201d Sanders told Hill.TV in August. He continued: The challenge that we face is how do we use technology to improve the lives of working people. So if you have a really terrible job, a boring job and we make your job better and we enable you to work 20 hours a week rather than 40 hours a week, it\u2019s not a bad thing\u2026but it means to say you still need an income to live by, we can\u2019t cut your salaries in half.  He repeated that sentiment to the Post: Sanders believes that all Americans are entitled to economic rights. These include the right to a decent job with good pay, affordable housing, quality health care, a clean environment, and a secure retirement. We will guarantee a good-paying job to all Americans through a federal job guarantee program to ensure everyone has a decent quality of life. Furthermore, [Sanders] strongly supports the BOOST Act, introduced by Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib to guarantee all Americans an income. Yang, a strong proponent of the measure, addressed Sanders\u2019 critique. \u201cBernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government, which isn\u2019t true,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange \u2013 he seemed open and warm to the idea of a Universal Basic Income not too long ago,\u201d he added. \u201cNow he seems irritated every time it comes up\u201d:  Yang has argued that a guaranteed income will \u201cAmericans will work even harder\u201d:  However, numerous studies and experiments have idicated that a UBI does not necessarily leave recipients better off. The Washington Post analyzed the experiment on the small scale, in which a non-profit gave \u201c20 African American single mothers living in public housing $1,000 each month for a year\u201d with no strings attached. While the women were able to buy necessities, they also spent money on nonessentials, with one woman noting that she \u201cblew all of it.\u201d Despite that, the Post did not necessarily deem the experiment a failure, blaming the lack of fruitful results on the participants\u2019 \u201clack of \u2018experience\u2019 in handling discretionary income,\u201d as Breitbart News reported.",

According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in\u00a0Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this story is going to end,\u201d said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. \u201cAt the moment just over half think there was an ask.\u201d It was also noted that in October \u2014 before the public\u00a0testimony began \u2014 the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed. When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the\u00a0margin of error), which turns the tables from August\u2019s survey results that\u00a0 showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent. As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by\u00a048 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent. \u201cCall it a small advantage to Trump,\u201d said Franklin. The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure\u00a0Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not. With regards to whether or not the president\u2019s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong. The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during Wednesday\u2019s debate.  Warren, until the recent rise of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, has been seen as Biden\u2019s biggest rival for the Democrat nomination. As such, the two have sparred openly over the direction of the Democrat Party. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat able to win back the white working class in 2020, is campaigning as something of a moderate who will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident in the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. The differences between the two have been evident in their recent back and forth on Medicare for All. Biden, who opposes the universal healthcare plan in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option, has accused Warren and other supporters of Medicare for All of being dishonest. In particular, the former vice president has claimed Warren is lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she plans to fund the program. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president\u00a0told\u00a0PBS News Hour earlier this month\u00a0when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal: Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it. Warren has responded to such attacks by suggesting Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d",

      "content": " The latest Harvard/Harris Poll reveals that about six-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to support 2020 presidential candidates who vow to strengthen the southern border \u201cto reduce illegal immigrants,\u201d among other things. Only about four-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to vote for presidential candidates who promise to\u00a0open \u201cour borders to many more immigrants,\u201d as all leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates have promised to do. As Breitbart News has noted, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have similar immigration plans \u2014 all designed to open the U.S.-Mexico border to more illegal immigration, provide big business with an endless flow of cheaper foreign labor, and increase foreign competition against America\u2019s working and middle class with increased legal immigration levels. Across all issues facing the nation, U.S. votes continue to say that health care and immigration remain the two most important problems in the upcoming 2020 election. For years, Trump has committed to reducing overall immigration to the country to boost wages and decrease labor market pressures for American workers. While Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d economy has resulted in record employment for nearly all demographic groups, there remains about 11.5 million Americans who are either unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor market but all of whom want good-paying full-time employment.  Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota has found that the country\u2019s current legal immigration system \u2014 wherein 1.2 million mostly low-skilled workers are admitted annually \u2014 burdens U.S. taxpayers and America\u2019s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion\u00a0in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, has found that every one-percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers\u2019 occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants with the overwhelming majority, nearly 70 percent, coming through the process known as \u201cchain migration,\u201d whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign nationals to the country. The mass inflow of legal immigrants is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who are added to the U.S. population annually. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Presidential candidates Andrew Yang, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar will take the stage just months before the nominating process starts.",

      "content": " MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell will moderate the debate with NBC\u2019s Kristen Wekler and the Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern. Debate begins at 9 PM ET.  11:50 PM: Warren just not appealing to people like Peter Gammons\u2026. and David Gergen:  11:39 PM: MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell says Biden\u2019s screw up re: Harris/Moseley Braun was unlike anything he has ever seen in a debate because he forgot that Harris existed. He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president. 11:30 PM:  11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. \u00a0He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a \u201cmoral moment\u201d right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, \u201cgood trouble.\u201d He asks Americans to keep him on the stage. Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the \u201ccriminal in the White House.\u201d He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that \u201cMr. Trump\u201d is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument. Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect\u2013 \u201cAloha\u201d values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the \u201cAloha spirit\u201d when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says \u201clet\u2019s make Dr. King\u2019s dream a reality.\u201d\n\nYang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for. He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now. Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can\u2019t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery. Harris says we\u2019re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests\u2026 she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America\u2019s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices. Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class. He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building. Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history. Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan. Biden says he hopes Warren wasn\u2019t talking about the \u201cspotless\u201d Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the \u201cwoe is me\u201d attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: \u201cGet up and take it back.\u201d 11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization\u2019s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a \u201csweeping victory.\u201d 10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg\u2019s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his \u201cinexperience\u201d and cites his recent \u201ccareless statement\u201d about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a \u201cmurderous dictator like that\u201d (Assad). Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes. Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev. 10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over \u201cWashington experience\u201d after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us. 10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a \u201chuman right\u201d and an \u201ceconomic right\u201d when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party. Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don\u2019t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies. 10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should \u201ccodify Roe v. Wade into law.\u201d She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election. 10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if \u201che was high\u201d when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850. Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren\u2019t those candidates. Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. \u201cEveryone gets out, records expunged,\u201d Biden says. Biden says he \u201ccomes out of the black community\u201d in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials. Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: \u201cNope\u2026 The other one\u2019s here.\u201d  10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses. 10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an \u201ceconomic justice\u201d issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will \u201cclose the black-white\u201d income gap. 10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country. 10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts. Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them. 10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says \u201cwe have to fundamentally change the culture\u201d re: how women are treated. He talks about the \u201cit\u2019s on us\u201d movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women\u2019s issues by keep \u201cpunching at it.\u201d 10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way. 10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we \u201cset the record straight\u201d and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system. 10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks. 10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems. He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians. He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but \u201cit is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.\u201d He says America must treat Palestinians with \u201crespect.\u201d 10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for\u00a0Khashoggi\u2019s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah. Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China. 10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d foreign policy. He says Trump\u2019s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy. 10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House. Yang says he will say he is sorry that \u201cI beat your guy.\u201d He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America\u2019s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO. He says he will propose a new world data organization\u2013like the WTO for data. Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses. 10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban. Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the \u201cterrible war in Iraq\u201d while he voted against it. Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so. 10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years. Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they \u201cview that as a threat, it\u2019s an easy thing to respond to\u201d by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he\u2019s re: Korea. 10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions. Harris uses the question to say:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump got punked.\u201d 10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC\u2019s playbook, says we don\u2019t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says \u201cclimate refugees\u201d will cause national security problems all over the world. He says the fossil fuel industry is \u201ccriminally liable\u201d for lying about climate change and \u201cmaybe we should prosecute them as well.\u201d 10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won\u2019t say it. Warren won\u2019t say it. He says he will declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy. Biden says climate change is \u201cthe existential threat to humanity.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t need a \u201clecture from my friend\u201d on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than \u201call of Great Britain produces\u201d while he was passing climate legislation. Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate. 10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats. 10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump\u2019s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade war\u201d that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans. 9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction). 9:53 PM:\u00a0Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed. 9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight. Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C\u2019mon. Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate. 9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like \u201cpoker chips\u201d in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible. Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today. Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris\u2019s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates. 9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids. 9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say \u201clock him up\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s about civility\u201d and we need to restore the soul of the country. Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings. Biden says Trump has \u201cindicted himself.\u201d Biden says there are two questions\u2013whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general. 9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting \u201clock him up\u201d at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders\u2019 rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that. Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted. 9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed. 9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world\u2019s leaders. Sounds very establishment. 9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president. Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It\u2019s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don\u2019t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with? 9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he \u201ccomes from the kind of communities\u201d that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses. 9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: \u201cThank you, Andrew.\u201d Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang\u2019s whole campaign theme is that today\u2019s politician don\u2019t understand threat of the future like AI, etc. 9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says 9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:  9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals? 9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the \u201crot\u201d she she\u2019s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the \u201cforeign policy establishment\u201d in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war. Harris is asked to respond and she says \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage\u201d who wants to be the party\u2019s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and \u201cbuddying up to Steve Bannon.\u201d Harris is months late on this comeback\u2013and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short. 9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don\u2019t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn\u2019t and then talks about a health care system that is \u201ccruel and dysfunctional.\u201d He says \u201csome of the people up here\u201d think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He\u2019s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn\u2019t mention them by name. Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch. 9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to \u201cfeel it\u201d and \u201ctaste it\u201d after the third year, people are going to want it. Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: \u201cThank you, I wrote the damn bill.\u201d 9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can \u201cgalvanize\u201d and not \u201cpolarize.\u201d He pitches his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan and says Democrats should not be \u201ccommanding\u201d people to get Medicare. 9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her \u201ctwo cents\u201d wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren\u2019s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth. Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard. It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the \u201cmoderate\u201d candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage. Warren says she is \u201ctired of freeloading billionaires\u201d and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish. 9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says \u201cwe have a criminal in the White House.\u201d Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail. 9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee,\u201d Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn\u2019t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell\u2019s question. Mitchell doesn\u2019t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity. 9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump\u2019s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a \u201ctender\u201d moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed. 9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who is the \u201cmost corrupt president\u201d in modern history when asked how central Trump\u2019s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can \u201cwalk and chew bubble gum at the same time\u201d by dealing with Trump\u2019s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the \u201crigged economy.\u201d 9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won\u2019t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery. 9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course. Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale. 9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including \u201cnational security, race, and climate.\u201d 8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an \u201canti-Trump\u201d party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms. 8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:  8:39 PM:\u00a0Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight\u2019s debate?   Yang creates an all-female playlist featuring a Taylor Swift album on the day Ariana Grande, a Scooter Braun client, expressed her support for Bernie Sanders.

Sanders\u2019 talking point is more than three times bigger than the actual figure derived from federal data, making this claim clearly inaccurate. Slate reported on the changing health insurance landscape: The biggest change in the insurance rate came from Medicaid, which lost nearly 2 million enrollees. Participation in employer-based plans and individual marketplace plans was also down. These declines in Medicaid and private plans are in part offset by more Americans qualifying for Medicare, which picked up more than 1.5 million new participants. Sanders is campaigning on a \u201cMedicare For All\u201d solution or a government takeover of the health system and the elimination of private health insurance. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

This figure is a 10-point increase from last week, as\u00a0noted\u00a0by the\u00a0Hill. Independent support for the inquiry fell to 40 percent \u2013 a seven-point drop.

Sanders answered by criticizing not only the Saudi regime, but also Israel \u2014 the region\u2019s only real democracy \u2014 as well. \u201cSaudi Arabia not only murdered [journalist Jamal] Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which does everything it can to crush democracy, [and] treats women as third-class citizens,\u201d he said. Sanders added, \u201cWe have got to bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together,\u201d without explaining how he would bridge the centuries-old Sunni-Shia divide and the competing ambitions of the two regimes. Sanders continued: The same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel. But we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve. [Applause] What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 or 80 percent, is unsustainable. So we have to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with the United Nations, and not continue to support brutal dictatorships. The \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d senator from Vermont implied that Israel is responsible for high unemployment in Gaza, rather than the Hamas terrorist group, which rules the territory brutally. Sanders has been endorsed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), all of whom have been harshly critical of Israel.

As you will see, the individual sources are not crackpots, but scientific studies and media reports on \u201cexpert\u201d predictions. The sources for numbers 28-41 are linked individually. Most notably, former Vice President Al Gore famously predicted in 2006 that the planet \u201cwould reach a point of no return within ten years\u201d unless drastic measures were taken. That deadline passed nearly four years ago.

Sea level increases are going to continue to matter what we do now. But, we can prevent much larger sea level increases. Much more rapid increases in temperature. The heatwave was in Europe. Now it\u2019s in the Arctic. We\u2019re seeing huge melting of the ice there. So, the warnings of the scientists 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, unfortunately, were accurate. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news, Jonathan, in the Democratic contest for the presidential nominations this year, virtually all of the candidates agree this is either the top issue or one of top two issues,\u201d he added.",

However, he faced backlash after suggesting that his sexuality, or being a gay \u201cstranger in my own country,\u201d will help him connect with and build support among black voters. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) described his comparison as \u201cmisdirected\u201d in a post-debate interview with Dana Bash. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014I\u2019m never going to engage or allow anyone to engage in comparing struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is just misdirected.\u201d She continued: So we\u2019re going to now say that my pain is worse than your pain? We had 400 years of slavery in this country. We had years of lynching, which involved, black men in particular, being dragged from their homes and hung on a tree, often castrated. We\u2019ve had the years of Jim Crow and institutional racism that included redlining and systemic racism that lingers today. And then, you know, we also have our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who still, under the law, do not have full equality. These are all injustices, but to start comparing one group\u2019s pain to the other is misguided, and I think that anyone who wants to actually build the coalition around the country and bring people together should not be in the position of saying that one group\u2019s pain is equal to or less than or greater than another\u2019s.",

Nonetheless, the socialist senator continued, adding that the fossil fuel industry is \u201cprobably criminally liable\u201d because they have \u201clied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet.\u201d Because of that, Sanders said, we should \u201cthink about prosecuting them as well.\u201d Sanders said: We don\u2019t have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don\u2019t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\u2019re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\u2019re talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances. The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world. What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet, and maybe we should think about prosecuting them, as well. This is not the first time Sanders has floated prosecuting the fossil fuel industry. He included the idea as part of his $16 trillion Green New Deal released in August, calling to \u201cprosecute and sue the fossil fuel industry for the damage it has caused.\u201d Per his plan (emphasis added): When it was revealed in 2015 that the fossil fuel industry knew their actions were contributing to climate change decades ago, Bernie sent a letter to then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her to open a federal investigation to find out whether the industry violated the law. President Bernie Sanders will ensure that his Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigate these companies and bring suits \u2013 both criminal and civil \u2013 for any wrongdoing, just as the federal government did with the tobacco industry in the 1980s.These corporations and their executives should not get away with hiding the truth from the American people. They should also pay damages for the destruction they have knowingly caused. . \u201cFossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused,\u201d Sanders tweeted in August alongside the hashtag #GreenNewDeal: ",

      "content": " The poll, which coincided with\u00a0the seventh public impeachment hearing in the nation\u2019s capital, found that opposition to the partisan impeachment effort is growing, while support is slipping. Conducted\u00a0November 17-20, 2019, among\u00a01,092 registered voters, the poll found that a greater percentage of people now oppose impeachment than support it. \u201cSupport for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support,\u201d Emerson found. The greatest shift in opinion occurred among independent voters, who now\u00a0oppose impeachment 49 percent to 34 percent. Last month, independents supported impeachment 48 percent to 39 percent. More via Emerson: The impeachment hearings are being watched or followed by 69% of voters. A plurality (26%) is getting their information from Fox News, 24% are getting their information from 1 of the 3 network stations (ABC, NBC, CBS), 16% are watching CNN, 15% MSNBC and 19% are going somewhere else for their information. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent. The results coincide with a\u00a0Politico-Morning Consult poll\u00a0released\u00a0this week, which showed support for impeachment dropping and opposition growing, particularly among independents. As Breitbart News reported: The survey was taken November 15-17 among\u00a01,994 registered voters and found that 47 percent of independents actively oppose the impeachment inquiry. This figure is a 10-point increase from last week, as\u00a0noted\u00a0by the\u00a0Hill. Independent support for the inquiry fell to 40 percent \u2013 a seven-point drop. Overall, support for the inquiry dropped by two points and opposition grew by three points. Nonetheless, some left-wing politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), believe the public impeachment hearings are actively convincing the American people that \u201cwe have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d \u201cBut what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who\u2019s violated the emoluments clause,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law,\u201d he added:",

      "subtitle": "A majority of registered voters in Wisconsin oppose the impeachment and removal from office of President Trump, according to a poll released by Marquette University Law School Poll on Wednesday.",
      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17. The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president. President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Trump\u2019s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here: President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders 45 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent\n\nPresident Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters. Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent. Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation. Only 32 percent of respondents said they \u201cfollowed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives\u201d very closely. Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all. The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president. Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president\u2019s conduct in office. Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don\u2019t know. Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump\u00a0held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid. On the bigger question of whether he did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt. While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong,\u00a0 while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so. The president\u2019s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters. Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president\u2019s job performance either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat,\u201d while 47 percent approve of his job performance \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat.\u201d The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it. Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent.",

      "content": " Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken\u00a0November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid. The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters. Per Emerson: Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. \u2026 Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%. No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:  \u201cBiden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months \u2013 yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,\u201d Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said. The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren\u2019s 18.5 percent. Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in.",

      "content": " Bloomberg, 77, was born on February 14, 1942, making him nine months older than former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, who was born in November 1942. However, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, born in September 1941, remains the oldest candidate by about five months. President Donald Trump, 72, was born in 1946 and was 69 years old when he launched his presidential campaign. Democrats now have four major candidates in their seventies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) turned 70 in June this year. In contrast, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is only 37 years old \u2014 roughly half the age of the three national frontrunners. (He leads the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two first states to vote in the primary process.) In an announcement on his campaign website, Bloomberg declared: We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\u2019s reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America. I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead. As a candidate, I\u2019ll rally a broad and diverse coalition of Americans to win. And as president, I have the skills to fix what is broken in our great nation. And there is a lot broken. Bloomberg is apparently going to skip the four early primaries and spend heavily on advertising in the hope of picking up a large number of delegates on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. Joel B.
