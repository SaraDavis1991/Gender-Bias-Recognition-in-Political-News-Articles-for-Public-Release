Y\u2019all fought us on every tooth and nail, you sent guard dogs on us, firehouses, you killed Martin Luther King.\u201d \u201c\u2018We\u2019 ain\u2019t elect no-damn-body. I promise you, your ass did not vote for him,\u201d Harvey said in response to McConnell\u2019s reminder that America elected a black president \u2013 Barack Obama \u2013 twice. \u201cYou did nothing but try to destroy him,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, what would you expect this hillbilly to say other than what he said?\u201d \u201cYou say that you don\u2019t want to be responsible for something that happened I think he said 150 years ago,\u201d Harvey added. \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t there when they wrote this Constitution that you love to throw up in everybody\u2019s face.\u201d On Tuesday, McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill that paying reparations for \u201csomething that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible\u201d is a bad idea. We\u2019ve tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We\u2019ve elected an African-American president. I think we\u2019re always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive is responsible for that and I don\u2019t think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it. McConnell added that issuing reparations would be logistically impossible. It\u2019s hard to figure out who to compensate,\u201d the Republican leader said. \u201cWaves of immigrants who\u2019ve come to the country as well and experiences dramatic discrimination of one kind or another. So no, I don\u2019t think reparations are a good idea.\u201d  On Wednesday,\u00a0former Oakland Raider Burgess Owens testified before the\u00a0House Judiciary Subcommittee and blasted the Democrat Party for its role in\u00a0slavery, segregation, and the systemic oppression of black Americans. \u201cLet\u2019s pay restitution,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHow about the Democratic Party pay for all the misery brought to my race?\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " \u201cYou know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe both oppose reparations and we both are the descendants of slaveholders\u201d:  An NBC report published Monday cited a U.S. census record, which reportedly indicated that two of McConnell\u2019s great-great-grandfathers \u2013 James McConnell and Richard Daley \u2013 owned \u201cat least 14 slaves in Limestone County, Alabama.\u201d NBC News reported, \u201cThe two great-great-grandfathers, James McConnell and Richard Daley, owned a total of at least 14 slaves in Limestone County, Alabama \u2014 all but two of them female, according to the county \u2018Slave Schedules\u2019 in the 1850 and 1860 censuses.\u201d NBC used McConnell\u2019s rejection of issuing reparations as a backdrop for the piece, adding that the discovery \u201ccame in the wake of recent hearings on reparations before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\u201d The Senate Majority Leader told\u00a0media on Capitol Hill last month that reparations are nonsensical because\u00a0\u201cno one currently alive was responsible for that.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\u201d he told a reporter June 18. He continued: We\u2019ve tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We\u2019ve elected an African American president. I think we\u2019re always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive is responsible for that, and I don\u2019t think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it. First of all, it\u2019s hard to figure out who to compensate. Waves of immigrants who\u2019ve come to the country as well and experiences dramatic discrimination of one kind or another. So no, I don\u2019t think reparations are a good idea:  While the fact remains that McConnell was not complicit in his family\u2019s purported entanglement in slavery, progressive critics argue that he and others like him are benefitting from their ancestor\u2019s actions and should, therefore, be more sympathetic to issuing reparations. Notable figures have rejected McConnell\u2019s stance on reparations. Television star and radio host Steve Harvey went off on McConnell, calling him a \u201chillbilly\u201d on\u00a0The Steve Harvey Morning Show\u00a0last month. \u201c\u2018We ain\u2019t elect no-damn-body. I promise you, your ass did not vote for him,\u201d Harvey said in response to McConnell\u2019s remark about Barack Obama. \u201cYou did nothing but try to destroy him,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo what would you expect this hillbilly to say other than what he said?\u201d \u201cYou say that you don\u2019t want to be responsible for something that happened, I think he said, 150 years ago,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t there when they wrote this Constitution that you love to throw up in everybody\u2019s face.\u201d This appears to be a relatively new attack against McConnell, as NBC noted that \u201cno news articles were found in which McConnell has previously spoken of his ancestors being slave owners.\u201d Obama, as McConnell noted, never truly pursued reparations. The former president told the Atlantic in 2016: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader\u2019s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multi-billion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we can debate the justness of that. But I feel pretty confident in that assessment politically. As for the other claim, McConnell cited a report rooted in 2008 findings from a genealogist, who claimed that Obama\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather owned slaves in Kentucky. NBC News reported: During the 2008 election, an amateur genealogist found that on his white mother\u2019s side, Obama had a great-great-great-grandfather named George Washington Overall who owned two male slaves in Kentucky. The genealogist, William Reitwiesner, also found that Obama\u2019s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Duvall, also owned a pair of slaves.

Many of us were spurred into action by what happened in 2016, the labeling of each other as \u2018They\u2019re all communist,\u2019 or \u2018They\u2019re all this,\u2019 or \u2018They\u2019re all that,\u2019 and the fake news, the divisiveness of our country, was something I\u2019d never seen before.\u201d My husband is a Republican, I\u2019m a Democrat. We took stock of that after the election and we said \u2018Where are we as a country?\u2019 And that way, it was the same thing, for me, was looking at that tragic event and taking stock of where are we as a country. And I can see why folks might be upset about that. The 2001 terrorist attack orchestrated by Osama bin Laden\u2019s al Qaeda slew 2,996 Americans, and injured more than 6,000 others. It has been leveraged for political gain every year since. McGrath called McConnell out for helping to \u201cbit by bit, year by year, [turn] Washington into something we all despise.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running for Senate because it shouldn\u2019t be like this,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " McGrath\u00a0told\u00a0The Courier-Journal Wednesday that she would have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation hearing was dominated by baseless accusations from accuser Christine Blasey Ford. McGrath said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Kavanaugh and his \u201cfar-right\u201d stances but added that there was nothing in his record that she thought would \u201cdisqualify\u201d him. While she found Blasey Ford \u201ccredible,\u201d she said: \u201c\u2026given the amount of time that lapsed in between and from a judicial standpoint, I don\u2019t think it would really disqualify him.\u201d \u201cI think that with Judge\u00a0Kavanaugh, yeah,\u00a0I probably would have voted for him,\u201d she told The\u00a0Courier-Journal. After a flurry of backlash, McGrath reversed positions less than 24 hours after her original remarks went public.  \u201cI was asked earlier today about Judge Brett Kavanaugh and I answered based upon his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday evening. \u201cBut upon further reflection and further understanding of his record, I would have voted no.\u201d \u201cI know I disappointed many today with my initial answer on how I would have voted on Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d she continued. \u201cI will make mistakes and always own up to them. The priority is defeating Mitch McConnell.\u201d   Notable personalities on both sides of the aisle swiftly jumped on her reversal, making a clear note of it on social media and reminding everyone of her position last year. \u201cI echo the concerns over the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. He\u2019s been against women\u2019s reproductive rights, workers\u2019 rights, consumer protections, and is a hardcore partisan,\u201d she tweeted July 2018. \u201cBut we are reminded, again, that elections have consequences, and this will be with us for a generation,\u201d she added.  Reactions were swift:       McGrath announced her bid Tuesday and saw overwhelming support from some of the most notable leftists in Hollywood, like Bette Midler, Chelsea Handler, Patton Oswalt, and Alyssa Milano.",

      "subtitle": "House Republicans have created a political headache for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he tries to keep GOP control of the Senate.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " On Wednesday, House Republicans allowed the Democrats to pass an outsourcing bill which dangles citizenship in front of hundreds of thousands of Indian graduates if they take more jobs from American graduates. The House bill, HR.1044, passed Wednesday by 365 to 65 after a multi-year, stealthy lobbying campaign by Silicon Valley lobbyists which was fronted by ethnic advocacy groups. The lobbies were led by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019 s network of Silicon Valley investors and other technology companies, including Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon, and were aided by a near-total blackout by establishment media outlets, such as Bezos\u2019\u00a0Washington Post. The bill now goes to the Senate where the tech lobbyists and investors have already pushed a similar job-outsourcing, salary-cutting, American-replacement bill to the Senate floor. This outsourcing push is very unpopular among the Republicans\u2019 MAGA base who have felt first-hand the painful impact of legal and illegal immigration on their own incomes, families, and status. The HR.1044 bill is not an amnesty, but it and the Democrats\u2019 DACA amnesty are \u201ccrucial,\u201d said one of the Zuckerberg lobbyists who pushed HR.1044. The bill is also a threat to the careers and prosperity of the many swing-voting college graduates needed by President Donald Trump and GOP Senators in November 2020. The GOP\u2019s share of those college-graduate voters lurched down in 2018, giving the Democrats control of the House. The bill also extends and deepens the federal government\u2019s implicit policy of rewarding coastal states with imported labor. That regional favoritism discourages investment in the heartland states, including McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky and Sen. Susan Collins\u2019 home state of Maine. Democrats are successfully using the graduate-employment crisis to squeeze many votes from American graduates. In effect, Democrats promise direct government fixes to the problems that they impose on graduates, such as college debt, housing costs, and stalled wages. That tactic is being used in Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s Texas where cheap-labor migration has swelled the Democratic-voting cities and has sucked investment and jobs from the state\u2019s GOP-leaning smaller cities and towns. The House\u2019s outsourcing vote leaves McConnell is a political jam: He can take the heat from business lobbyists by blocking the Senate\u2019s bill, or he can let the bill pass and hope that the betrayed blue-collar voters and the nowhere-to-go middle-class voters somehow vote for the small-government side of a unified, pro-outsourcing Congress in 2020. McConnell has \u201cto evaluate this legislation on several different levels,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. Vaughan continued: He ought to be considering the [economic] impact on his homestate of Kentucky. As Majority Leader, he has to consider also how damaging it will be to Republicans to allow this through as a victory for [Sen.] Kamala Harris and Democrats in general, but also for the large Republican constituency which is going to be the air beneath the wings of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.  Federal Policy The federal government already allows companies to keep a foreign workforce of roughly 1.5 million foreign graduates in the United States. This non-immigrant workforce holds jobs in a wide variety of promising careers such as therapists, professors, doctors, engineers, managers, software programmers, fashion designers, pharmacists, statisticians, Wall Street analysts, and recruiters. Ths resident population of foreign workers arrives via the government\u2019s many border loopholes, including the H-1B, Optional Practical Training, H4EAD, L-1, TN, and J-1 programs. The biggest loophole is the H-1B program for foreign graduates. Roughly 100,000 H-1B workers arrive each year for jobs in every state, and most go home when their six-year visas terminate, ensuring a churning resident H-1B workforce of around 500,000. An additional 350,000 H1Bs are being allowed to stay in jobs long past their departure dates because their employers have nominated them for green cards. In 2015, President Barack Obama ordered work permits be given to 100,000 of their spouses. This resident foreign workforce of 850,000 H-1Bs is larger than the number of Americans who graduate from colleges and universities each year with skilled degrees. This federal decision to flood the college-graduate labor market with H-1Bs and other contract-workers has a huge impact on how company revenue is divided among employees and investors, and among economic classes and geographic regions.  Voters Lose, Investors Gain Most of the imported white-collar workers are Indians, and most are eager to take jobs at wages far below what American graduates need to pay their debts, get married, and buy starter homes. Nearly all foreign graduates will work for less than Americans because work in America is better than work in India\u2019s caste-divided society. Also, many Indians hope to leverage their temporary work permits into hugely valuable green cards and citizenship for themselves, their children, and all of their descendants. This national difference means that U.S. investors and their Indian subcontractors can cut their U.S. payroll costs by hiring imported Indians graduates instead of skilled Americans. The extra labor also means that expanding employers generally do not need to offer extra salaries to lure American graduates away from other companies. It also reduces companies\u2019 incentive to illegally prevent marketplace competition, which they describe as \u201cpoaching.\u201d The existence of the H1B program helps outsource large business operations to India, saving more money for U.S. investors.\u00a0For example, in 2017, CBS\u2019\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0showed\u00a0how Disney transferred one of its computer divisions in Florida to an Indian firm, which then replaced the American workers with Indian H-1B workers and gradually moved the division\u2019s work over to India. Many American graduates say they lose job opportunities to Indians whenever American firms delegate hiring decisions to Indian subcontractors or Indian managers. They lose jobs because nepotism is normal in India\u2019s caste-divided culture, and the payoffs almost are almost impossible to track because they can be made on the Indian side of the U.S.-Indian cultural divide. On July 4, the Times of India reported that a major Indian firm attributed fake claims to Apple Inc. as it tried to smuggle more white-collar workers into the U.S. labor market.  Many middle-class parents spend a fortune educating their few children, yet find their children\u2019s progress blocked by foreign managers, temporary workers, and outsourcing, Vaughan said. \u201cThey\u00a0have been having [their child] go to science camps all her life, and they want her to be an engineer or a medical researcher, yet the jobs are not going to be there for her.\u201d For example, Congress has failed to add funding for the residency training of Americans doctors since 1997. The policy failure means many young Americans cannot become doctors. But the failure is being hidden by visa programs which import doctors from western Africa, the Middle East, and India, often via the H-1B program. The imported doctors in Kentucky, Iowa, and other states are now leading the push for passage of the far-reaching HR.1044 legislation, even though legislators in Congress could vote for a smaller-scale proposal which pairs extra funding for U.S. students with a focused fix for the foreign doctors. Overall, the H-1Bs and the vast supply of legal and illegal migrants in American workplaces force down Americans\u2019 salaries nationwide, even as they also create some extra jobs selling goods and services to migrants. Additional immigrant labor needs to eat and to sleep \u2014 so it serves as cheap workers, consumers, and renters for many companies and real-estate investors. The extra sales are doubly useful for Amazon, Wal-Mart, the construction industry, and landlords from Maine to San Diego. But it does little to raise American employees\u2019 average productivity, skills, or wealth. The bottom line is that the flow of all immigrants and visa workers transfers roughly $500 billion a year in employees wages up to CEOs and investors. The $500 billion estimate is based on the formula used by a September 2016 study by the National Academy of Sciences. That huge economic transfer explains why investors and business groups fight so hard for extra immigration \u2014 and why so many investors and companies quietly pushed HR.1044 through the House this week. The economic transfer is so large that it helps explain why employees\u2019 share of the new wealth in economy has dropped by 10 percent, or six points, since 2000. The legislation, HR.1044, claims to promote fairness for high-skilled contract-workers, dubbed \u201cimmigrants\u201d by the advocates. The bill removes \u201ccountry caps\u201d which limit Indians\u2019 share of the 120,000 green-cards awarded each year to employees nominated by their companies. That change would allow Indians to get roughly 100,000 green cards each year, up from roughly 23,000. The change would allow the 300,000 Indian workers \u2014 and their 300,00 family members \u2014 get on a fast track to green cards, citizenship, and the voting booth. The bill would also accelerate the citizenship reward for the next wave of Indians who choose to become a contract-worker. That next wave of Indian outsourcing may be huge because there are no caps for non-profit employers in the H-1B program or in the Optional Practical Training program \u2014 and there are many good jobs in the healthcare sector that can be profitably transferred to Indian graduates. The legislation will also create many new political fights once the accelerated Indian migrants push important employees \u2014 such as nurses \u2014 and other national groups to the back of the line. If the bill become law, the legislators and lobbyists will be back at work the next day trying to win advantage from the policy wreckage.  Kentucky and Heartland States Lose, Coastal States Gain The huge number of immigrants and H-1B workers also shifts wealth and economic growth from the heartland over to the coasts. In 2017, companies in Kentucky asked the federal government for approval to import almost 5,000 foreign H-1B graduates, according to government data.\u00a0The data suggests Kentucky has a population of roughly 5,500 H-1B workers and that the vast majority are paid less than $70,000 a year. The population saves money for the Kentucky CEOs who hire the 5,000 contract-workers. But if Kentucky graduates had won those jobs, they would have earned more money, spent more money and paid more taxes in the state \u2014 and would also have encouraged the next generation of Kentucky students to stay in the state. Moreover, the H-1B population in Kentucky comprises just 5,000 workers out of a national H-1B workforce of at least 800,000. This means very few investors in Kentucky are boosting their profits by using H-1B labor \u2014 while thousands of investors in other states are boosting their profits with wage-cutting H-1B workers. While companies in Kentucky asked for almost 5,000 H-1B visa workers in 2017, New York companies asked for 83,000 H-1B contract workers\u00a0and New Jersey companies asked for 62,000 H-1B contract workers. The skewed distribution of H-1B workers and investors has enormous knock-on economic effects. For example, the huge supply of H-1B workers in California ensures that investors in Silicon Valley never face a labor shortage which would require them to establish operations outside the state where skilled Americans are graduating from college. Instead, they can locate their investments and create jobs close to their homes in California, New York, or Seattle, far from Kentucky. The San Jose Mercury News reported in January 2018: About 71 percent of tech employees in the [Silicon] Valley are foreign born, compared to around 50 percent in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward region, according to a new report based on 2016 census data. Immigrant techies tend to go to \u201cthe center of the action,\u201d [said] Seattle venture capitalist S. \u201cSoma\u201d Somasegar \u2026 FWD.us is one of the leading business groups behind the stealthy HR.1044 push. The group is led by wealthy anti-Republican\u00a0West Coast investors, including Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt and Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith. The H-1B policy is the college-graduate version of the federal government\u2019s immigration policy, which puts a far bigger thumb on the scale. Each year, four million Americans turn 18 and start looking for a job in California, the Dakotas, Colorado, or other states, including Kentucky. But the government inflates each year\u2019s natural labor supply of 4 million young Americans by importing roughly 500,000 working-age immigrants, and by \u201crefreshing\u201d the resident population of 1.5 million white-collar visa workers, 2 million work-permit holders, and 8 million-plus working illegal immigrants, Overall, the resident population of temporary, legal, non-immigrant workers in the United States is at least 4 million, including the white-collar H-1Bs and the blue-collar H-2Bs, the H-2A agricultural workers, J-1 visa workers, plus asylum seekers, and various forms of temporary workers. The 4 million workers in the temporary legal workforce provide roughly one-seventh the size of the overall legal immigrant workforce of 28 million\u00a0within the larger population of 45 million legal and illegal immigrants. That combined foreign-born population of roughly 45 million has a huge impact on states, and it tends to move a large share of the nation\u2019s growth, income and wealth from low-migration states \u2014 such as Kentucky \u2014 to high-migration states, such as California, Chicago, and New York. For example, renters pay real-estate owners roughly $1,500 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in Kentucky\u2019s biggest city. In crowded New York, real-estate investors get $6,000 a month for a decent two-bedroom apartment. Ownership of a home boosts personal wealth in Kentucky by roughly $145,000, according to Zillow. But an average home in New York state makes the owner richer by roughly $300,000. People who own homes in California have seen their value spike to $550,000 in the last 20 years. This government-accelerated shift of wealth from rural to urban, from the heartland to the coasts, is being decried by establishment critics as \u201cthe next big inequality crisis.\u201d But those critics decline to recognize a huge part of the problem \u2014 the government policy of skewing wealth by flooding the U.S. free market with imported labor. Of course, there are other causes for this wealth shift, such as luck, climate, and technological trends. But the government\u2019s immigration policy has shortcircuited the normal economic factors that would help spread the new wealth to Kentucky and other heartland states, including Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, and Kansas. Those factors \u2014\u00a0 rising real-estate prices, congested roads, a shortage of local workers, pressure for wage increases \u2014 would normally redistribute some investment and wealth back to the low-wage, low-unemployment, low-traffic, low-crime heartland states, such as Kentucky. But the federal government discourages investment in Kentucky and other heartland states by delivering a continual supply of migrant workers \u2014 including the H-1B contract-workers \u2014 to coastal investors.\u00a0Federal immigration policy \u201csmothers what would otherwise be a competitive advantage for Kentucky,\u201d said Vaughan. Unfortunately for Sen. Susan Collins and the high-school graduates in Maine, the coastal state lags behind other states in productivity and income growth because investors know they can earn more profits by hiring the migrants who prefer to settle in warmer California or even other New England states. On July 7 the New York Times described the same government-skewed development process\u00a0within high-immigration Texas, where GOP Sen. Cornyn is up for election in 2020: Nearly all of the net growth in jobs and new businesses in Texas over the last decade, Labor Department data show, has been concentrated in four large metropolitan areas \u2014 Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. Those areas accounted for more than four out of every five jobs created in the state since the recession ended, their populations swelling with surges of young and talented workers. Collectively, the four saw double the rate of job growth as the rest of Texas. A similar geographic inequality is playing out in other places in America,\u00a0alarming officials at the Federal Reserve. While the\u00a0latest jobs report\u00a0showed the economy\u2019s continued strength after 10 years of expansion, the effects have been uneven, with the wealthiest parts of the country\u00a0reaping a disproportionate share\u00a0of the gains. The economy has evolved toward more technology and service jobs, favoring areas with highly educated workers and high-end professional service industries \u2014 and leaving smaller, traditionally blue-collar towns like Longview at a disadvantage. While the richest neighborhoods in Texas\u2019 most dynamic cities have grown much richer as the recovery wore on, the poorest parts of the state fell even further behind. The Economic Innovation Group, a Washington think tank, sorts ZIP codes across the country on a five-point scale, with \u201cprosperous\u201d at the top and \u201cdistressed\u201d at the bottom. Research from the group found that from 2008 to 2016, the most prosperous ZIP codes in Texas \u2014 heavily concentrated in those star metro areas \u2014 accounted for more than two-thirds of the state\u2019s net growth in jobs and business establishments. \u2026 There were only 1,800 more jobs in the Longview area in April than there were 10 years ago, according to the Labor Department, an annual growth rate of less than 0.2 percent. Gregg County, which includes Longview, lost more businesses than it created from 2012 to 2016, the innovation group\u2019s data show. Nationally, the counties that flipped from President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2016 to Donald Trump in 2016 have shown little gain in population or jobs in the last few years, according to the Economic Innovation Group: The country\u2019s political landscape is being changed by economic, demographic, and technological trends that are decades in the making. The national economy continues to enjoy record growth even as \u201cleft behind\u201d places fail to see the same gains. The outsized political power of these \u201cleft behind\u201d places, embodied in the group of flipped counties, was apparent in the 2016 election. Had voters in counties that switched party allegiances between the Obama and Trump eras hoped for a change in economic trajectory, their hopes have so far been unfulfilled. What, if anything, has changed over the first two years of the Trump administration? Employment growth has continued, albeit at a slower pace. Business establishments have proliferated faster among the rural, exurban, and flipped counties that President Trump carried relative to before the election. But the gaps between left behind places and the rest have not meaningfully narrowed. Places don\u2019t change overnight, and any president has limited power to reorganize local economies. Historic trends like flatlined population growth and shrinking workforces require sustained, meaningful economic growth to see any kind of reversal. However, among voters there is a strong belief in the power of the executive branch. To the extent that flipped counties\u2019 political swing reflected voter dissatisfaction with the status quo, the latest data provide no evidence that their trajectories will have meaningfully changed by 2020. Currently, there is little reason for coastal investors to put their money into these high-unemployment districts. Since November 2016, the federal government has provided them with roughly 2 million legal migrants, roughly 400,000 working-age migrants from Central America, 200,o00 new H-1Bs, and many additional H-2Bs, L-1, OPTs, refugees, H4EADs, etc., plus many illegals who were not deported. The EIG is run by investors, so its proposed fix for those flip districts is a scheme to funnel more migrants into those districts \u2014 which would also flip those districts blue.  Politics One political result of this economic skew is growing pessimism among college graduates \u2014 and a resulting turn leftwards. The Associated Press reported: A college degree has long been a ticket to the U.S. middle class \u2026 a collaborative analysis of the 2018 General Social Survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and GSS staff \u2026 found that 35% of graduates described themselves as working or lower class, up from just 20% who felt that way in 1983. By contrast, only 64% of college grads say they feel they belong to the middle or upper class. This pain among the graduates is reshaping the Democrats\u2019 2020 pitch. Democrats oppose any fix to migration, so they are eagerly offering to spend taxes ameliorating the damage. The damage includes a wide-scale return by American graduates to their parents\u2019 houses and the widespread use by migrants of cheap tenements close to their l0w-wage jobs which support the winners in the high-tech cores of the nation\u2019s economy.  So Democrats and progressives in New York have imposed their own solution \u2014 more rent control. HousingWire reported: \u201cThese reforms give New Yorkers the strongest tenant protections in history,\u201d Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said in a joint statement. \u201cFor too long, power has been tilted in favor of landlords and these measures finally restore equity and extend protections to tenants across the state.\u201d The Editorial Board of The Wall Street Journal had a different view. In a\u00a0piece\u00a0titled, \u201cAlbany goes wild,\u201d the newspaper said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ruin in New York, but progressives who control the state and city governments are intent on showing how much. Law by law, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democrats are chipping away at the policies that made New York City livable after decades of decline and returning to the bad old days.\u201d Similarly, Democrats jostling for the 2020 nomination are promising more housing aid, and a rollback of college loans. For example, Sen. Liz Warren wants to solve the housing problems created by migration with a new tax on suburban homeowners. Democrats are exploiting graduates\u2019 worries and anxiety, Vaughan said: They want to tap into that anxiey, but they have already denied that immigration has any thing to do with these problems and the will not adopt any immigration fixes because that would anger key [pro-migration] constituencie. So\u00a0the Democrats have to find other issues to talk about\u00a0 \u2014 trade, student loans, jobs, education, equal pay and minimum wages \u2014 while they ignore the elephant in the room which is immigration. In the medium term\u2013 by 2030 \u2014 the GOP will also lose more seats as the Indian migrants become citizens and vote Democratic. The HR.1044 legislation will add roughly 600,000 Indian voters to the rolls during the next 10 years.\u00a0Indians are\u00a0highly likely\u00a0to donate to Democratic causes and to vote Democratic. For example, the chief Senate sponsor of the bill is Sen. Kamala Harris, whose mother is Indian. Roughly 77 percent of Indians supported Democratic candidates in 2016, while only 16 percent said they voted for President Donald Trump, according to a post-election\u00a0survey\u00a0funded by the National Science Foundation. A growing population of skilled migrants in a district also tends to pull American-born voters into the Democratic camp, said an April 2018 study. \u201cOur strongest and most significant finding is that an increase in high-skilled immigrants as a share of the local population is associated with a strong and significant decrease in the vote share for the Republican Party,\u201d\u00a0said the\u00a0report, authored by pro-migration economist Giovanni Peri,\u00a0Anna Maria Mayda, a Georgetown University professor now at the U.S. State Department, and\u00a0Walter Steingress, an economist at the Bank of Canada. \u201cIf Republicans get on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d said Vaughan, \u201cand go along with this special interest legislation, unwittingly they will be weaving the rope that will hang them.\u201d ",

As Breitbart News\u2019s AWR Hawkins reported: USA Today\u00a0reports\u00a0universal background check legislation has been sitting in the Senate since being passed by the Democrat-controlled House in February of this year. Demands for Senate passage of the checks has been made again and again following high profile, firearm-based crimes. Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0Hollywood calls for \u201cuniversal background checks\u201d following the July 29, 2019, Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting in California. But the majority of shooters\u2013like the Gilroy Garlic Shooter\u2013acquire their guns at retail, which means they are already passing background checks to get their guns. Universal checks would not change that. \u2026 On August 4, 2019, Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Dayton, Ohio, shooter acquired his gun \u201clegally.\u201d Dayton Police Chief\u00a0Richard Biehl made clear the attacker had no criminal history to prevent the purchase of a gun. On Monday, President Trump proposed tying \u201cstrong background checks\u201d to \u201cdesperately needed immigration reform.\u201d:  ",

      "subtitle": "On August 8, 2019, NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre issued a statement taking exception with the gun control push currently emanating from the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).",
      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " On Monday, President Donald Trump voiced his support for \u201cstrong background checks,\u201d saying, \u201cRepublicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!\u201d On Wednesday, Trump followed up by pushing background checks again. The Associated Press\u00a0quoted\u00a0him saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a great appetite, and I mean a very strong appetite, for background checks. And I think we can bring up background checks like we\u2019ve never had before.\u201d At the same time, Democrats were pressuring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to allow a vote on the Democrat-controlled House\u2019s universal background check bill. The U.S. has had background checks on retail sales sine 1998. This means purchases at gun stores, large retailers, pawn shops, etc., are conducted only after the would-be purchaser passes an FBI background check via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Universal background checks expand those point-of-sale checks to cover private sales too. And \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban and numerous other controls are also being considered in the current gun control push. On August 8, 2019, McConnell told\u00a0the Louisville, Kentucky,\u00a0Terry Meiners Show that an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban and other gun controls will be \u201cfront and center\u201d when the Senate reconvenes in September. The problem with an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban is that the very phrase, \u201cassault weapons,\u201d is a politically driven moniker used to ban whole categories of firearms. But the moniker applies to cosmetic features of firearms \u2014 heat shield, thumbhole stock, collapsible stock, flash hider, etc. \u2014 rather than the firearms themselves. This focus on cosmetics allows proponents of an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban to cover everything from commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles, to pump shotguns, to pistols with the ability to accept magazines holding more than ten rounds. That same day, the NRA\u2019s LaPierre put forward a statement condemning the gun control push. The statement said: I\u2019m not inclined to discuss private conversations with President Trump or other key leaders on this issue. But I can confirm that the NRA opposes any legislation that unfairly infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens. The inconvenient truth is this: the proposals being discussed by many would not have prevented the horrific tragedies in El Paso and Dayton. Worse, they would make millions of law-abiding Americans less safe and less able to defend themselves and their loved ones. LaPierre added: \u201cThe NRA will work in good faith to pursue real solutions to the epidemic of violence in America. But many proposals are nothing more than \u2018soundbite solutions\u2019 \u2014 which fail to address the root of the problem, confront criminal behavior, or make our communities safer.\u201d The NRA supported the creation of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the heart of the current background check system. The system was designed to prevent felons and other criminals from acquiring guns. The Democrat\u00a0approach is a broader one intent on making it harder for everyone \u2014 particularly law-abiding citizens \u2014 to exercise a constitutional right that the Left simply does not like. California has had universal background checks since the mid-1990s and an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban since 1989. The state continues to witness high-profile public shooting after high-profile public shooting. The U.S. had an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban at the federal level from 1994-2004. Breitbart News reported a Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice report showing that the ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime. Despite the clear failures of these gun controls, Trump will most likely be criticized by Democrats if such controls are not adopted. NRA board member Ken Blackwell spoke to this, saying: The NRA has had a great relationship with President Trump, and simply made clear to all policymakers\u2014including every congressman and senator\u2014that the NRA supports legislation that makes communities safer for law-abiding Americans, and opposes legislation that does not actually solve problems. The reality is that the Far Left opposes both the Second Amendment and the president, and whatever he might agree to, Democrats will still condemn him for not going far enough. NRA members want safe communities, but know that gun controls from Pelosi and Schumer will not make them safer. The Democrats\u2019 gun-control bill is a trap that would demoralize the president\u2019s supporters while not earning him any support from those on the Left.

      "content": " During Friday\u2019s Democratic Weekly Address, Representative\u00a0Jim McGovern (D-MA) criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for not calling the Senate back to vote on gun legislation by saying McConnell would \u201crather keep taking the NRA\u2019s blood money in exchange for his silence.\u201d McGovern also said Republicans are waiting \u201cfor another tweet from the president to distract the American people and change the topic.\u201d Transcript as Follows: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Congressman Jim McGovern and I\u2019m grateful to represent the people of Massachusetts\u2019 Second Congressional District in Congress. Our country is still reeling from mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Our hearts break for the victims, for their families, and everyone who has been impacted by this violence. We\u2019ll learn more about these horrific acts in the days and weeks to come. But here\u2019s what we already know: thoughts and prayers are not enough. It\u2019s time for action. America is the only developed country in the world where massacres like these happen on a regular basis. It seems like any time a family member leaves home, we\u2019re left to wonder if we\u2019ll ever see them again. Whether it\u2019s at a movie theater, a concert, their elementary school, their church, or their synagogue. No place seems safe. It has to stop. Now. President Trump and Republicans can blame video games or mental illness all they want. Other countries play video games and deal with mental illness, but only here, in America, have mass shootings become the new normal. I wish they would just tell the truth: this is about guns. You know, in many states, it\u2019s easier to get a gun than it is to register to vote. And weapons of war can be bought in virtually the blink of an eye \u2013 without a background check. This isn\u2019t by accident. The gun lobby has spent millions bankrolling their allies in Congress so they can slash any kind of sensible gun safety laws. Look, I wish this issue wasn\u2019t political \u2013 that Democrats and Republicans in Congress could all agree with the overwhelming majority of Americans that want tougher gun laws. But you deserve to know the truth. It has been five months since the Democratic House passed a pair of commonsense bills that would simply close a loophole and ensure comprehensive background checks on gun sales and transfers. Five Months! And what has the Republican Senate done under Mitch McConnell? No hearings. No debates. No votes. Nothing. Mitch McConnell ought to call the Senate back into session right now and pass the Gun Safety bills which have been sitting on his desk for five months. But instead, he\u2019d rather keep taking the NRA\u2019s blood money in exchange for his silence. All the while, Republicans wait for another tweet from the president to distract the American people and change the topic. Well, I\u2019ve got news for Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate: the American people have been down this road before. What\u2019s different now is that this House Majority is not bought and paid for by the gun lobby. Mitch McConnell may take pride in the Senate being called a legislative graveyard. But mothers are burying their kids. And babies are growing up without their parents. And the days of inaction are over. While Republicans refuse to do any work at all to end gun violence, they seem to be working overtime to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Right now, a lawsuit filed by the Trump Administration is working its way through the courts. If it\u2019s successful, the entire Affordable Care Act could be struck down. Think about that. If President Trump gets his way, 2.3 million young people would be kicked off their parents\u2019 plans, insurance companies would be allowed to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes and asthma, and insurance CEOs would be able to use your premiums to pay for their bonuses instead of your health care. It would be catastrophic. That\u2019s why on day 1 of our new majority, we voted to throw the full legal weight of the House of Representatives against this lawsuit. House Democrats have also passed and sent to the Senate strong bills to strengthen protections for people with pre-existing conditions even further. And we\u2019ve passed five bills that confront big pharma\u2019s unfair practices that keep drug prices high and prevent lower-cost generic versions of drugs from getting to the market. You know, for most people, this is just common-sense stuff. I\u2019ve held over a dozen town halls over the last year, and I hear the same stories over and over again. Seniors who can\u2019t afford their medications, so they split pills or skip a dose altogether. Doctors and nurses who are worried about what will happen if they can\u2019t provide their patients the care they need. People with pre-existing conditions like cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure who have no idea what they would do if they were denied or dropped by their insurance when they need it the most. As Members of Congress, we weren\u2019t elected just to hear people\u2019s problems \u2013 we were sent here to solve them. While Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate continue to sit on their hands, I am proud that House Democrats are taking action on behalf of the American people. From combating gun violence, to protecting people with pre-existing conditions, to lowering the cost of prescription drugs, we will continue working For The People to deliver a safer, healthier future for all Americans.\u201d Follow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

Unfortunately, for the past decade or so, you\u2019ve had members coming into the United States Senate, young members, thinking that it was nothing more than a stepping stone to the presidency, not realizing that the power in Washington, D.C. often rests in large part with the United States senators that go, stay and make a difference.\u201d He continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the front of my mind right now is a Senate majority leader who has been told by the FBI and CIA and the United States military that the Russians are interfering with American democracy, and yet this Senate majority leader from Kentucky keeps killing every effort by Republicans and Democrats to protect and defend the United States of America against these attacks on our democracy.

And we\u2019re infuriated, and we want action. We want Mitch McConnell to get off his ass and do something in the United States Senate. How you can watch the stories of fathers getting killed with two kids, a 17-month-old kid getting damage from shrapnel, 15-year-old high school kid, and do absolutely nothing is infuriating to every American who has common sense and 90 percent with the polling who want something done. And to push this off on mental health \u2014 then why the hell is the president\u2019s \u2014 both of his health care initiatives, one from the House and one from the Senate last year, kick 20 million people off their health care, that includes mental health coverage? So, he\u2019s completely full of it as well.\u201d \u201cAnd to push it off on that and then cut people\u2019s health care shows me he\u2019s trying to do the Potomac two-step\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying the water of the NRA. Mitch McConnell is emboldening him and as a sycophant to Donald Trump. And this stuff has got to stop, Steve. We\u2019re tired \u2014 the American people are tired of it.

Trump pushed for bipartisan action on background checks on August 5 and August 7, just days after the heinous attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. However, on September 1, Trump told reporters that the recent history of mass public shootings suggests more background checks would not have prevented the attacks.

      "subtitle": "On Wedneday the Washington Post ran a full-page editorial designed to pressure Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) into passing gun control.",
      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " The editorial, titled, \u201cDo Something, Mr. McConnell,\u201d begins by listing the victims of the 1999 Columbine High School attack then weaves its way to today, listing other high profile shootings along the way.  The Post editorial board asked, \u201cWhat if there was a mass shooting in the United States not once or twice or four or six times monthly, but every single day, a big one, the kind that electrifies social media and squats for days on Page 1 \u2014 would that be enough to move Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from his insistent inertia on gun safety?\u201d They continued, \u201cWould any volume of bloodshed convince the Kentucky Republican that Congress faces a moral imperative to act? Thirty-eight people were slain in three such shootings in August \u2014 in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, as well as West Texas \u2014 and still Senate Republicans and President Trump refuse to act.\u201d They then list the names of victims, beginning with those killed in the 1999 Columbine attack and continuing through 28 others, ending with the August 4, 2019, Dayton, Ohio, attack. They do not mention that at least 20 of examples they provided were ones in which the guns used in the attacks were acquired legally and two were attacks attacks in which stolen and/or borrowed guns were used. That means the universal background check bill McConnell is being pressured to pass would have been powerless to stop those 22 attacks. The Post also lists the April 3, 2009, Birmingham, New York, immigration services shooting.\u00a0Everytown for Gun Safety reports\u00a0that the crime was carried out by a man with a New York pistol license and that guns he used were \u201cregistered\u201d under his license. The bottom line is that the Post is using myriad examples that gun control would not have stopped in hopes of pressuring McConnell into supporting gun control.

      "subtitle": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Tuesday joined the chorus of lawmakers condemning the National Basketball League for apologizing to communist China after one of the league\u2019s general managers expressed support for\u00a0the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.",
      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cThe people of Hong Kong have risked much more than money to defend their freedom of expression, human rights, and autonomy. I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line,\u201d McConnell wrote on Twitter.  McConnell\u2019s condemnation is especially significant not only because he is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lawmakers, but because\u00a0his wife, Elaine Chao, who serves as Trump\u2019s Transportation Secretary, is\u00a0Chinese-American. As senior Breitbart News contributor Peter\u00a0Schweizer writes in his #1\u00a0New York Times bestselling book Secret Empires, McConnell and Chao\u2019s financial ties to China run deep. Notably, the couple\u00a0has\u00a0received between $5 million to $25 million from her Chao\u2019s father, James Chao, whose shipping firm, Foremost Group, has done business with the Chinese government. Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey set off a firestorm over\u00a0his deleted tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. A short time after Morey posted that statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that the deleted tweet offended many in China. And all that followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet. Morey tweeted an image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d referring to the four-month-old protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. That led to Houston owner Tilman Fertitta turning to Twitter to say that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and sparking an outcry that included the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets star center \u2014 saying it was suspending its relationship with the team. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey wrote on Twitter Monday.\u00a0 \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.  \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA,\u201d he added. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) on Monday sent\u00a0a letter\u00a0to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver blasting the league\u2019s apology to the Chinese government and demanded it cancels its upcoming exhibition games in the country. \u201cI write today to express my disgust about the position of the National Basketball Association (NBA) with respect to Hong Kong and the freedom of the Chinese people. Doing business in China is one thing, but for the NBA to kowtow to the demands of one of the world\u2019s most brutal regimes in the pursuit of profit is, frankly, revolting. You know better. And the people of this country deserve better,\u201d the senator wrote. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": " McGrath, who lost a House race in 2018 to an incumbent Republican, launched her campaign in July and raised $2.5 million within the first 24 hours of doing so. According to her campaign, McGrath received 299,000 contributions, with the average donation being $36. McGrath\u2019s third-quarter\u00a0fundraising total outpaces that of several presidential candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who raised $4.8 million in the third quarter, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who raised $6 million in the third quarter. In a statement, Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager, claimed, \u201cChange is coming.\u201d \u201cMitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations-from all 120 Kentucky counties-have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,\u201d said Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager. McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the United States Senate since 1985, has received an endorsement from President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won the state of Kentucky by 30 percentage points. Shortly after announcing her bid to unseat McConnell, McGrath received praise from many of Hollywood\u2019s far-left figures, including Bette Midler, Chelsea Handler, Patton Oswalt, and Stephen King.

      "subtitle": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has gone silent on the Democrat-led House impeachment inquiry, largely avoiding public statements on the subject in recent days.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The Republican leader told\u00a0CNBC\u2019s\u00a0Squawk Alley last month that the Senate would have no choice but to\u00a0take up an impeachment resolution if it proceeds in the House. \u201cIt\u2019s a Senate rule related to impeachment, it would take 67 votes to change, so I would have no choice but to take it up,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHow long you\u2019re on it is a whole different matter.\u201d However, as the impeachment inquiry continues to heat up, McConnell has become increasingly withdrawn. According to The Hill, the Kentucky senator has largely\u00a0refrained from making public statements on the subject in recent days: McConnell held an event last week in Kentucky with Defense Secretary\u00a0Mark Esper, a day after Trump publicly floated that China and Ukraine should investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. But reporters were removed from the event before the audience was allowed to ask questions. The GOP leader also skipped taking questions reporters this week when speaking at a Federalist Society meeting in Kentucky, as well as a separate event with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touting a grant for the University of Kentucky. Asked about McConnell\u2019s thinking and why he\u2019s decided not to weigh in directly on Trump\u2019s calls for Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden, a spokesman declined to comment beyond what McConnell has said on the record. It was reportedly McConnell who urged the White House to release the transcripts of Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to reports, McConnell said the release would \u201cbolster the claim that the conversation was not improper because the speculation about what happened was becoming politically untenable,\u201d the Washington Post reported. The transcript of the call does not show any such \u201cpressure\u201d or quid pro quo, as Democrats suggest. The president said McConnell described the conversation as \u201cthe most innocent phone call,\u201d and the lawmaker told Politico in September that it is\u00a0\u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve read the summary of the call. If this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand,\u201d McConnell told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for.\u201d McConnell released an ad this month, slamming Democrats for their impeachment efforts and vowing to stop it as majority leader. \u201cNancy Pelosi is in the clutches of a leftwing mob,\u201d McConnell said in the ad. \u201cThey finally convinced her to impeach the president.\u201d \u201cAll of you know your Constitution,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe way that impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\u201d While it remains clear that McConnell disagrees with the impeachment inquiry, his refusal to elaborate on his position has piqued interest. However, GOP strategists do not view his silence as a reason for alarm. \u201cMitch McConnell has learned there is no point in weighing in on every story,\u201d GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell said, according to The Hill. Another GOP strategist, Matt Mackowiak, told\u00a0The Hill that McConnell does not want to add difficultly for GOP incumbents in at-risk districts. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to ever get ahead of the conference, and he always wants to be in a place that\u2019s helpful to both ends,\u201d Mackowiak said. \u201cAnd look he\u2019s obviously very much attuned to the risk that some of those incumbents face and he doesn\u2019t want to make their job harder,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cOn the other hand, he also knows the facts are developing.\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " McConnell, who has largely refrained from making grandiose public statements on the House impeachment\u00a0effort in recent days, briefed GOP senators during a luncheon on Wednesday on the impeachment process via a PowerPoint presentation and urged them to gear up for an impeachment trial in the Senate. He expects this process could heat up next month, around Thanksgiving. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you\u2019d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas \u2014 which would be wonderful because there\u2019s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said, according to the Washington Post. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) led the meeting alongside McConnell and, according to the Post, urged colleagues to consider penning a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), declaring that Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which is serving as a basis for the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry \u2014 contains nothing worthy of impeachment. Graham failed to get everyone on board, with some lawmakers expressing concern over Trump\u2019s potential reaction to the members who would opt out of signing the letter. \u201cSome senators, however, pushed back against that idea, arguing that Trump would assume that those who did not sign the document would be persuadable on a vote to oust him,\u201d the Post explained. The meeting followed Tuesday\u2019s Democrat debate, in which every single candidate on stage signaled support for pursuing an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi announced this week that the lower chamber will not yet hold a full House vote on the inquiry despite the White House vowing to refrain from participating in the \u201cillegitimate\u201d inquiry until proper steps are taken. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote: Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances. \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs. We\u2019re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is not a game for us; this is deadly serious.\u201d It is not yet fully known what impact late House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-MD) untimely death will have on the Democrat Party\u2019s continued impeachment effort. He was leading the inquiry charge alongside House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY). \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Elijah Cummings, a man of great consequence and significance on the Oversight Committee for the last twenty years,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAs Ranking Member and then as Chairman, he injected an unyielding passion and purpose into his work on the Committee,\u201d he continued, offering prayers to Cummings\u2019 wife, children, and loved ones. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) will replace Cummings as the \u201cacting\u201d House Oversight chair.",

      "content": " \u201cThis is going to be about process,\u201d McConnell said at the lunch, according to an unidentified Republican, who spoke to the Hill. \u201cWhat is clear and not in dispute, as Sen. [Roy] Blunt (R-MO) has pointed out, is the process in the House to which the president is being subjected is totally unprecedented and totally unfair,\u201d McConnell told reporters after the lunch meeting. McConnell and other lawmakers spoke of the difference between the impeachment process going on under Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Speaker Carl Albert (D-OK), who served during the impeachment of President Richard Nixon. The Hill reported on the contrast: Albert in 1973 and 1974 gave Republicans much more of an opportunity to participate in the process, they said.\n\nMcConnell also said Democrats in the minority were treated better by former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) during the impeachment of President Clinton than today\u2019s Republicans. \u201cSpeaker Albert laid out procedural guidelines during the Nixon episode \u2014 Speaker Gingrich during the Clinton impeachment episode \u2014 all of which included the kind of basic procedural safeguards that one associates in our country with being treated fairly,\u201d McConnell said. [McConnell is] telling his members they have plenty of reason to offer a vigorous defense of Trump, as the president publicly urged them to do Monday, by focusing on Democratic tactics that McConnell and Trump view as unfair. The Hill reported on the secrecy of the Democrats investigation and how difficult that makes it to formulate a way to respond to it on the president\u2019s behalf: Senate Republicans also privately make the point that it\u2019s difficult to defend Trump on the substance of the charges against him because so much remains unknown.\n\nGOP lawmakers don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against Trump or what exactly House Democrats have discovered in their investigation, which has been conducted largely behind closed doors. \u201cA Republican senator who spoke on condition of anonymity said McConnell gave his colleagues leeway to express opposition to various Trump actions, such as pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria, but urged them to stick together on process,\u201d the Hill reported. \u201cHe feels everybody is free to talk about issues like Ukraine or maybe the Kurds, but to try to conduct an impeachment without any process is very contrary to what happened before,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cThat pretty much sums it up.\u201d \u201cA second Republican senator said McConnell and Blunt thought it made sense to give the Senate GOP conference a primer on past impeachment proceedings,\u201d the Hill reported. \u201cIt was a logical second place to go after the informational hearing on how impeachment will work in the Senate so members will know when they are talking about this process why it\u2019s different than the way this has been done before,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s another thing to say here are all the boxes that were checked for Clinton and Nixon, and none of these boxes have been checked for this president.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

However, McConnell said during the ceremony that Cummings, who had served his district since 1996, \u201cdid not just represent Baltimore, he embodied it.\u201d He continued: He knew there was only one reason why a son of sharecroppers, a child who had literally had to bear the injuries of bigotry and segregation, could graduate from law school and eventually chair a powerful committee in Congress. Only one reason, because principled leaders had fought to give kids like him a chance. Chairman Cummings made it his life\u2019s work to continue that effort. He climbed the ranks here in the Capitol, not because he outgrew his hometown but because he was so committed to it. On Thursday, Breitbart News reported that Cummings was the first black American lawmaker to lie in state inside National Statuary Hall on Capitol Hill. \u201cCivil rights icon Rosa Parks, who died in 2005, and Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut, who was killed by a gunman in 1998, were also given the honor\u00a0bestowed upon only a small number of private citizens in years past,\u201d the report noted. Pelosi said during Cummings\u2019 funeral in Baltimore on Friday that \u201cElijah brought people together in life of different parties and in his death of different parties,\u201d and added that \u201cit took bipartisan agreement for Elijah to lie in repose on the same catafalque that Abraham Lincoln lied in repose at the Capitol.\u201d Also speaking at the funeral, former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Cummings\u00a0\u201chad little tolerance for those who put party ahead of country or partisanship ahead of truth. But he could find common ground with anyone willing to seek it with him.\u201d \u201cAnd he liked to remind all of us that you can\u2019t get so caught up in who you are fighting that you forget what you are fighting for,\u201d she concluded.",

The world\u2019s most wanted man has been brought to justice. The world is a safer place today. This victory for the U.S. and our many counterterrorism partners is a significant step for the campaign against ISIS, for the future of the Middle East, and for the safety of the American people and free people around the world. A victory like this is only possible because of the expertise, skill, and courage of those who work to keep the United States safe. I am grateful for the intelligence professionals who laid the groundwork for this raid, for the brave American service members who risked everything to carry it out, and to President Trump and his team for their leadership. While we welcome the fact that al-Baghdadi has been brought to justice, we know we cannot underestimate the resilience of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. The important counterterrorism work of the United States, our international coalition partners, and local forces will not end with this significant victory. To the contrary, history shows us how vital it is to keep building on this victory and continue our work to set the conditions for the enduring defeat of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorists in Syria, in Afghanistan, and around the world. Democrats have also been tweeting and speaking out on the raid with many of them failing to even mention Trump\u2019s role in the operation. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "content": "  House Democrats on Tuesday released the text of a resolution they plan to vote on later this week to formalize impeachment inquiry procedures for President\u00a0Trump. The resolution establishes procedures for open hearings, authorizes the release of deposition transcripts, and outlines how the intelligence community can transfer evidence to the House judiciary committee It directs \u201ccertain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, president of the United States of America, and for other purposes,\u201d\u00a0the document reads. The document gives Schiff\u00a0the lead role in the investigation, giving him power to organize the questioning of witnesses. The committee will take over the probe, which until now has been handled by three committees, including intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight and reform. The resolution also gives House Republicans the power to request their own documents and testimony. The document will go to the House Rules Committee for markup before the Thursday vote. As Breitbart News\u2019 senior editor Joel Pollak writes, the measure\u2019s proposed rules raise red flags about the probe\u2019s fairness: 1. The resolution gives authority to the House\u00a0Intelligence Committee that it has never had before. 2. The resolution does not provide the minority with equal subpoena power, as in the past. 3. The resolution waters down minority powers over the release of Intelligence transcripts. 4. The resolution does not compel the release of past testimony. 5. The resolution restricts the president\u2019s right to be represented. Following the text\u2019s release, White House press secretary\u00a0Stephanie Grisham issued a statement unloading on House Democrats,\u00a0branding their impeachment probe a \u201csham.\u201d \u201cThe White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the judiciary committee. Even then, the White House\u2019s rights remain undefined, unclear and uncertain \u2014 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written,\u201d\u00a0Grisham said.

The resolution outlined the rules and procedures moving forward but did not, despite popular belief, authorize the inquiry itself.

However, transcripts from Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment proceedings have been trickling out, and they have yet to demonstrate\u00a0any such quid pro quo, as Democrats suspected.

Jeanne Shaheen inserted an amendment into the bill to provide support to groups that promote abortions overseas \u2013 a move that would have clearly undermined the Trump administration\u2019s pro-life policies. A coalition of 44 national pro-life leaders sent a letter in October to McConnell and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) voicing their vehement opposition to the Shaheen amendment. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), chairman of the Senate pro-life caucus, joined with these leaders in asking McConnell to amend the bill before it advanced. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to protect the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Daines said, according to C-Fam. \u201cI am deeply concerned about how this amendment undermines pro-life policies abroad and I will continue to work to defeat it.\u201d SFOPs was part of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement reached by Congress and the White House in July. The agreement clearly stipulated, \u201c[T]here will be no poison pills, additional new riders\u2026unless agreed to on a bipartisan basis by the four leaders with the approval of the President.\u201d C-Fam reported Shaheen\u2019s longstanding attempts to force American taxpayers to fund promoting abortion overseas: Shaheen, a longtime member of the subcommittee tasked with funding overseas diplomacy, development and humanitarian assistance, annually proposes an amendment that undermines U.S. funding restrictions on abortion and abortion-related activities and increases funding to family planning groups abroad that are known to promote abortion. The Shaheen amendment routinely passes due to support from two Republican senators who promote abortion\u2014Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). In addition, Shaheen introduced this year in her amendment a non-discrimination policy, reported C-Fam, that bars \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d Thus, the amendment would have not only promoted abortion overseas, but the radical LGBT agenda. Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, said in a statement sent to Breitbart News the Shaheen amendment would have undercut the pro-life initiatives of the Trump administration: Through the adoption of\u00a0the Mexico City Policy, or the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy,\u00a0the United States has successfully prevented foreign organizations from using tax-payer money for abortion services. However, PLGHA does not prevent funds from being used by domestic organizations working overseas. \u201cThe Senate majority proved that they are not willing to compromise on life\u00a0by rejecting the Shaheen amendment\u00a0which allocated these overseas-based American organizations $665 million dollars to continue their atrocious life-ending work,\u201d\u00a0she added.",

      "content": " McConnell, who has refrained from offering in-depth analysis of the ongoing public impeachment hearings, tweeted during Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony and noted that Democrats\u2019 claim that \u201cimpeachment won\u2019t keep them from legislating,\u201d appears to be patently false, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has \u201crefused to allow a vote on USMCA for months.\u201d \u201cIt appears there\u2019s no governing priority \u2013 no matter how bipartisan, no matter how beneficial to Americans \u2013 that won\u2019t take a back seat to impeachment,\u201d McConnell wrote:  McConnell expressed\u00a0the same view two weeks ago, slamming Democrats for forgoing their legislative duties in pursuit of impeachment and other \u201cfar-left schemes.\u201d He wrote: Senate Democrats have voted twice to block funding for our nation\u2019s armed forces. Our competitors are growing stronger. America and our allies are threatened. But Senate Democrats would rather fight with the White House than deliver bipartisan funding for our military. Meanwhile, House Democrats are blocking the USMCA while they pursue their three-year-old impeachment obsession. 176,000 new American jobs are being held up because this major new trade deal might interfere with House Democrats\u2019 political theater. On the campaign trail, leading Democrats are rallying around far-left schemes to take away Medicare, take away the existing health insurance that Americans get on the job, and leave American families with no options except an untested one-size-fits-all government insurance plan. We need our Democratic colleagues to put aside socialist daydreams and fulfill their basic governing responsibilities. Republicans are ready and waiting to fund our servicemembers. We are ready and waiting to pass the USMCA. We just need Democrats to show up.   On Tuesday, McConnell\u00a0expressed\u00a0doubt that an impeachment trial in the Senate would ultimately lead to President Trump\u2019s removal: \u201cI will repeat what I\u2019ve said in the past. It\u2019s inconceivable to me that there would be 67 votes to remove the president from office,\u201d McConnell stated. \u201cA number of Democratic senators are running for president. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to be excited to be here in their chairs, not being able to say anything during the pendency of this trial,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, hopefully, we\u2019ll work our way through it and finish it in not too lengthy a process,\u201d he added.",
