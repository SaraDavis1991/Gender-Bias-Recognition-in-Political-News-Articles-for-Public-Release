      "subtitle": "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is praising President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Betsy DeVos\u00a0to run the Department of Education.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Bush described DeVos, who is a major contributor to the Republican Party, as an \u201coutstanding pick\u201d for the cabinet position, reports The Hill. Bush said he looked forward to DeVos\u2019 \u201cbold leadership.\u201d \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms,\u201d he said. DeVos, who supports school vouchers for charter schools as a means to bring about school choice, is chairwoman of the American Federation for Children (AFC), a charter school promotion group, and is also a board member of Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE). Bush and his foundation have served as champions for the Common Core standards. Dick and Betsy DeVos are also major donors to FEE. In 2015, they donated between $50,000 and $100,000. Bush was severely criticized by Trump during the primary for the former governor\u2019s support for Common Core, which Trump described as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump vowed to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education to get Washington, D.C. out of education. \u201cThe last thing we need is another Bush,\u201d Trump said in January. \u201cHe\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core \u2013 that\u2019s a disaster \u2013 it\u2019s bad. It should be local and all of that.\u201d In announcing his nominee, Trump said, \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\u201d he added. Trump did not mention in his announcement the two things he vowed repeatedly to parents he would work to eliminate: the federally coerced program known as Common Core, and the U.S. education department. No mention was made that DeVos shared his vision of Common Core being a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that the days of the U.S. Education Department were now numbered. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller, however, said in a statement, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team\u00a0said Saturday, however, the discussion between the president-elect and DeVos when they met \u201cwas focused on the Common Core mission, and setting higher national standards and promoting the growth of school choice across the nation.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an education establishment euphemism for Common Core,\u201d writes The Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullmann at Conservative Review. \u201cNational standards are what Common Core was designed to be. Pursuing them is how we got Common Core.\u201d Pullmann continues, explaining how the use of taxpayer-funded vouchers to bring about school choice brings about more regulation into the private and charter schools that accept them: Setting \u201chigh standards\u201d is the job of parents and local communities, not the U.S. education nanny. Tying \u201chigh standards\u201d to school choice is also troubling, because this is again bureaucrat-speak for \u201crequiring all private schools to teach Common Core using the control mechanism of tests.\u201d When DeVos touts \u201cschool choice,\u201d she\u2019s pushing an education agenda that includes\u00a0requiring all the schools that take voucher money to use state-determined curriculum, like Common Core. This is how she has used her millions of dollars in the past. If she\u2019s education secretary, we have every reason to believe it\u2019s how she\u2019d use even more power. On what appears to be a new website, DeVos answers a question about whether she can \u201cprovide some straight talk\u201d on the topic of Common Core. She responds: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that\u2019s not my position. Sometimes it\u2019s not just students who need to do their homework. However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle.  Gov. Mike Huckabee and now Vice President-elect Mike Pence both got into hot water with anti-Common Core activists as well. Huckabee became known for recommending that the Common Core standards simply be \u201crebranded\u201d with a different name since the reform had grown so politically \u201ctoxic.\u201d Gov. Pence apparently heeded Huckabee\u2019s advice and then drew the ire of parents in his state of Indiana when he turned around and approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of Common Core soon after achieving a repeal of the standards. It\u2019s not clear how DeVos can respond \u201ccertainly\u201d and with a definitive \u201cperiod\u201d that she does not support Common Core when she never articulated such views against it in the past, or came to the aid of parents fighting the \u201cboondoggle\u201d in her state of Michigan. Though DeVos minimizes her associations with pro-Common Core organizations, they are readily visible and most would assume if she gives considerable financial and time and talent support to a group of people, she probably believes what they believe. As a member of the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s national education foundation, DeVos was likely aware that the \u201creform agenda\u201d of the organization she has been helping to guide includes college and career readiness; digital learning; utilizing student standardized assessment to determine teacher performance ratings; outcome-based funding; and standards and accountability \u2013 which include \u201chigh academic standards with their progress measured.\u201d This agenda is nearly identical to that of the Common Core \u201creform\u201d and is what Bush\u2019s foundation has sought to thrust upon the nation. And Bush has been an ardent supporter of the Core in other ways. Another of his education groups \u2013 Chiefs for Change \u2013 a bipartisan coalition of state education chiefs \u2013 consisted of some members who were also members of the PARCC Common Core test consortium \u2013 one of the two federally funded interstate groups that developed tests aligned with the Common Core standards. A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos was also an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich \u2013 like Jeb Bush \u2013 received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The Ohio governor referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign,\u201d just as Bush said Republicans didn\u2019t need anti-Common Core conservatives to win the White House. Buzzfeed also reported DeVos has \u201cclose ties to many on Capitol Hill\u201d and \u201cis closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander,\u201d an association that is not likely to endear her to grassroots parent activists. Alexander rammed through a massive \u201cbipartisan\u201d bill to replace No Child Left Behind that gives the U.S. Education Secretary significant control over standards and testing. President Barack Obama took such a liking to Alexander\u2019s legislation that he signed it immediately into law last December, praising it as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d Pullmann observes about DeVos\u2019 claim she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not a Common Core supporter: That\u2019s sure news to all the grassroots folks she\u00a0pit her big money against\u00a0during their legislative battles to reject Common Core. Grassroots folks report to me that DeVos\u2019 husband personally called state senators in Michigan to get them to vote against a Common Core repeal bill. DeVos\u2019 American Federation for Children also contributed\u00a0huge sums of money\u00a0for state school board races in Alabama on the side of Common Core supporters trying to oust Common Core opponents.  Michigan parent activist Karen Braun tells Breitbart News DeVos never used any of her time or wealth to assist parents in her state in their efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cDeVos prefers to be out of the limelight and let others like the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) do the heavy lifting,\u201d Braun says. \u201cBut activists and lawmakers in Michigan know her pro-Common Core position very well.\u201d She continues: I had a discussion with former Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin about the DeVos appointment.\u00a0He and I worked closely to try and get Common Core out of Michigan.\u00a0He said he had a terse conversation with her in 2013 in the heat of our efforts to repeal Common Core \u2026 she was very clear she loved Common Core and all the high-stakes testing and central planning.\u00a0Her recent statement claiming to be against it is disingenuous. She never did anything to help the efforts to get rid of Common Core and did many things behind the scenes to hinder us.\u00a0We have a repeal and replace bill in Michigan that GLEP opposes and have worked over lawmakers to make sure it doesn\u2019t pass.\u00a0We\u2019ve done our homework and we know that DeVos is pro-Common Core despite any statement she puts out today. Shane Vander Hart at Truth in American Education confirms, \u201cFormer Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin said to me, \u2018[DeVos] and GLEP were one of the main leaders defending Common Core when I was fighting it in the legislature. In 2013 I know she was strongly supportive of Common Core and high stakes testing.\u201d Perhaps parent activists can take heart that DeVos has suddenly turned over a new leaf and is now against Common Core and the federal control of education it represents since her new boss says he is committed to its demise. In that case, talk of \u201cnationalized high standards\u201d will need to disappear, and instead take a turn toward Trump\u2019s plan to finally dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and return education policy to the states and local school districts where the Constitution says it belongs.

      "subtitle": "U.S. Education Department (USED) Secretary Betsy DeVos made her first official announcement of senior staff hires Wednesday.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Constitutionalists and anti-Common Core grassroots activists have expressed disapproval at the number of USED hires with links to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his foundation, as well as to other supporters of Common Core. Among the new hires, for example, is Josh Venable, who will serve as DeVos\u2019s chief of staff. Like DeVos, Venable worked with Bush at his Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE). Jason Botel has been named as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education and acting assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education. Botel served as executive director of the Maryland education advocacy group MarylandCAN \u2013 which was financed by Bill Gates \u2013 and has a history of support for Common Core. Trump has also formally nominated Carlos Mu\u00f1iz to the post of general counsel at the USED, one that requires Senate confirmation. Mu\u00f1iz served as former attorney to Jeb Bush when the latter was governor of Florida. James Manning will serve as senior adviser to the undersecretary and acting undersecretary. Manning led the landing team at the USED throughout the Trump transition. At least one new USED hire, however, has the approval of anti-Common Core constitutionalists: Robert Eitel, who will serve as senior counselor to DeVos. Eitel authored \u2013 along with Kent Talbert and Bill Evers \u2013 the Pioneer Institute\u2019s report titled \u201cThe Road to a National Curriculum: The Legal Aspects of the Common Core Standards, Race to the Top, and Conditional Waivers.\u201d \u201cThe Department has designed a system of discretionary grants and conditional waivers that effectively herds states into accepting specific standards and assessments favored by the Department,\u201d Eitel noted. When one of the Common Core test consortia stated that it intends to use federal funds to support curriculum materials and create a \u201cmodel curriculum\u201d and instructional materials aligned with the Core, Eitel responded, \u201cFrankly, this makes sense. How can one design assessments without taking into\u00a0account what is taught? But the legal concern is that these federally funded assessments will ultimately direct the course of elementary and secondary course content across the nation.\u201d \u201cBob Eitel is an attorney with an impeccable record of public service, previously serving as deputy general counsel at the U.S. Department of Education,\u201d Jamie Gass, director of the Center for School Reform at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, tells Breitbart News, adding that Eitel\u2019s paper \u201cwas among the best papers Pioneer Institute has produced in its nearly 30-year history, and was punctuated by its understanding of and fidelity to the proper implementation of federal laws.\u201d \u201cAny public administration would want an attorney of Bob\u2019s experience and integrity making legal decisions at the highest levels of government,\u201d Gass adds. The USED has also confirmed that Candice Jackson will serve as the deputy assistant secretary in the Office for Civil Rights and acting assistant secretary. Jackson recently represented Kathy Shelton, who was 12-years-old in 1975 when Hillary Clinton defended the rapist who assaulted her. Shelton attended a news conference prior to one of the presidential debates in October. Jackson\u00a0told\u00a0American Thinker\u00a0that Clinton, \u201cunethically and immorally blamed a twelve-year-old victim.\u201d A report in the New York Times cites Jackson\u2019s appointment, as well as the nomination of\u00a0Mu\u00f1iz: The posts are among the most high profile in the department. Staffing in the Office for Civil Rights has been a source of concern for civil rights advocates ever since the Trump administration\u00a0rescinded protections for transgender students\u00a0as one of its first education policy moves. \u2026 The appointments have been met with trepidation from advocates who are anxious about the future of the Office for Civil Rights, which gained a higher profile under President Barack Obama as it focused policy as much on equity in education as on achievement. The USED says it will announce\u00a0additional hires\u00a0in the near future.",

      "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/05/17/homeschool-advocates-betsy-devos-want-left-alone-federal-government/",
      "subtitle": "Homeschool advocates\u00a0say they informed U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that homeschooling should not be included in any school voucher programs since government regulation could be tied to acceptance of taxpayer funds.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos met with leaders from the Home School Legal Defense Association\u00a0(HSLDA) Monday, who conveyed to the secretary their concerns about regulation of homeschooling tied to school vouchers and discrimination against homeschoolers by higher education programs that refuse to accept homeschool diplomas. HSLDA president Mike Smith, vice presidents Jim Mason and Chuck Hurst, and director of federal relations William Estrada met with DeVos, along with Tricia Powell, a homeschooling parent. Estrada posted on Facebook Tuesday about the meeting: We discussed the successes of homeschooling, the work that HSLDA is doing to support homeschoolers and state and local homeschool support groups, and how homeschoolers just want to be left alone by the federal government (homeschoolers don\u2019t want to be included in any federal k-12 voucher programs due to the threat of government regulations down the road.) We discussed how homeschool graduates still face discrimination, usually in the form of federally funded higher education programs that refuse to accept their homeschool high school diploma. Estrada noted the homeschooling leaders also \u201cdiscussed how the Common Core and other federal overreach in public education has driven more families to choose homeschooling.\u201d \u201cSecretary DeVos strongly agreed with us that the federal government does not have the authority to dictate curriculum decisions to states and local schools,\u201d he said. Estrada observed, nevertheless, the seeming paradox between his praise of DeVos as a \u201ctrue friend and ally\u201d to homeschoolers and his own view that there is no place for the federal government in education issues. He wrote: Some may find this post to be interesting as my personal position is well known that I believe the federal department of education is nowhere found in the Constitution, and should be closed, and all education decisions returned to the states and local school boards. That hasn\u2019t changed. However, Congress created the federal Department of Education lawfully, and only Congress can close it down. And until that happens, I want someone as Secretary of Education who understands the limited federal role in education, and who respects family freedom in education. And Betsy DeVos does. In February, Iowa Rep. Steve King created a firestorm when he introduced H.R. 610, the Choices in Education Act of 2017, a bill that Estrada asserted \u201cwould be a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.\u201d Estrada explained the bill would essentially create a \u201cfederal right to homeschool\u201d: While this sounds good, HSLDA has fought \u2014 successfully\u2014for decades to make sure that there is no \u201cfederal right to homeschool\u201d because what could be created by a favorable Congress could be regulated by a future, hostile Congress. It is far better (and far more constitutionally sound) for education decisions\u2014and homeschool freedom\u2014to be protected at the state level. We ask our friends at the federal level to simply leave homeschooling families alone. After a fierce backlash from homeschoolers throughout the country, Estrada wrote last month that the Choices in Education Act \u201cis dead for all practical purposes.\u201d \u201cThe high level of attention this bill received from\u00a0homeschoolers across the country\u00a0proved how strong opposition to federal money is in the homeschooling community,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has served as a \u2018shot across the bow\u2019 of our friends (and opponents) in Washington, D.C., reminding them that homeschoolers do not want education vouchers from the federal government.",

      "subtitle": "A Politico report states education secretary Betsy DeVos blames the Trump transition team for her confirmation process difficulties that overshadowed the fact she had been recommended for her post by both Jeb Bush and Mike Pence.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Within days of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, Betsy DeVos\u2019s good friend Jeb Bush asked her if she would be interested in the top federal education post, and then asked Vice President-elect Mike Pence to recommend her for the job, the report says. \u201cHe was really the only person I knew in the transition,\u201d Bush told Tim Alberta, writing for Politico Magazine. \u201cHe was the best person, because he was running it.\u201d Bush added it turned out both he and Pence \u2013 two former GOP governors \u2013 had the same thought since both had worked with DeVos to advance their education agendas in their home states of Florida and Indiana, respectively. \u201cHe made it clear that he was already thinking about Betsy, too,\u201d Bush said of Pence. Once DeVos was formally nominated by Trump, Bush announced publicly he was \u201cexcited.\u201d DeVos has been widely criticized by the conservative base of the Republican Party \u2013 a fact often left out when the focus is simply on condemnation of her school choice policies by teachers\u2019 unions. Though once nominated by Trump, DeVos announced she was \u201ccertainly \u2026 not a supporter\u201d of Common Core, she made\u00a0contributions\u00a0of both her time and personal wealth to support pro-Common Core organizations that fought repeal of the controversial standards, including the Great Lakes Education Project in her home state of Michigan and Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education. As Indiana governor, Pence signed a bill repealing Common Core in his state but then drew the ire of anti-Common Core parent groups when he approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of the unpopular reform \u2013 basically Common Core with a few tweaks. In addition to supporting Bush and his foundation, DeVos ultimately became an at-large delegate at the Republican National Convention last year for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, another supporter of Common Core. DeVos has since angered conservative parents further by her statements that because of the new massive federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u201cthere isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore\u201d in the country\u2019s schools. Most states, however, have continued to use the controversial standards, including those that have changed the name or \u201crebranded\u201d them. Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, observes at Truth in American Education, that Bush has given DeVos every reason to be proud: DeVos \u2026 populated USED with bureaucrats from the Bush wing of education policy, including Democrat and Black Lives Matter supporter Jason Botel (since departed, after angering DeVos\u2019s Michigan friends over that state\u2019s ESSA plan). Conservative activists were disappointed and mystified by these choices, especially since there\u2019s no shortage of solid, highly qualified Common Core opponents who were available. Despite the support of Bush and Pence, DeVos\u2019s Senate confirmation was far from smooth sailing, and ultimately required Pence as vice president to break a tie vote. According to Alberta, DeVos says she was taken aback by the intensity of the confirmation process: Teachers unions remain the most organized cell of the Democratic coalition, but much of the outcry over her performance was organic and owed to self-inflicted wounds: showing no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; fumbling straightforward questions about accountability, proficiency and growth; citing grizzly bears in Wyoming as the reason some schools should be free to keep guns on premises. \u201cI think I was undercoached,\u201d DeVos said, referring to the Trump transition team as the source of her difficulties with the Senate. She reportedly added: The transition group was very circumspect about how much information they gave me about then-current policy and \u2026 it was in their view a balance between being prepared for a confirmation hearing and not having well-formed opinions on what should or shouldn\u2019t change, so as not to get caught in a confirmation hearing making commitments that then I wouldn\u2019t want to or be able to keep. And in hindsight, I wish I had a whole lot more information. DeVos further expressed \u201cirritation,\u201d as Alberta notes, about being banned by the transition team from doing interviews. \u201cDuring the confirmation process, I wasn\u2019t able to talk with the media at all. I wasn\u2019t able to express anything from my perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it gave weeks and weeks of open shots for my opponents to take.\u201d While discussing various education policy changes since DeVos has assumed her post, Alberta observes the secretary has been blamed by some for the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of former President Barack Obama\u2019s public school transgender bathroom policy: But that decision was made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2014who had jurisdiction on the matter\u2014and one, according to people close to DeVos, she vehemently disagreed with. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel the timing was appropriate,\u201d she tells me, measuring her words, in her first public break with the administration. Immediately following a New York Times report in February suggesting that DeVos was at odds with Trump and Sessions over changing the transgender bathroom policy, DeVos released a statement that her department was \u201ccommitted\u201d to protecting LGBT students. \u201cI have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America,\u201d DeVos said. According to the report, DeVos may be disappointed that her budget request for school choice funding was not honored by Congress, but says, \u201c\u201cWell, let\u2019s keep in mind that this is only the first budget cycle. There are other budget cycles.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The Washington Examiner\u2019s Jason Russell reports GOP megadonor DeVos endorsed Rubio in the primary and that her family \u2013 heirs of the Amway fortune \u2013 backed Mitt Romney in 2012. Russell adds the DeVos family\u2019s financial support \u201cmay have been crucial for [Romney] as he squeaked past Rick Santorum by three points to notch a crucial win before Super Tuesday.\u201d During an interview in March, DeVos told Russell, \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump represents the Republican Party.\u201d She continued with comments on the GOP primary race: We as a family decided to, as many did, see how things unfolded nationally. There were a number of candidates that we felt would be very capable, that we could easily embrace and support. As the field has continued to narrow, after Gov. [Jeb] Bush exited the race, we felt it appropriate and an important time to lend our voice, whatever impact that might have, particularly with Michigan\u2019s primary coming up. That was our impetus to embrace and publicly support Sen. Rubio. Describing Trump as \u201can interloper\u201d who is \u201cnot winning the support of traditional Republicans,\u201d DeVos said: I continue to be very optimistic that as we get further along into the process, the more voters know about him, and the more informed they are, the more they\u2019re going to continue to break away. That\u2019s even held true in the primaries held to date. I think he has underperformed compared to public polls just days before the Super Tuesday contests. I think more and more people are going to realize that they really don\u2019t trust him. The more they learn about his record, they\u2019re going to break away and go to an alternate. I continue to think that Rubio is a very strong and viable candidate that will represent our party and the future for our country very, very well. Asked about whether she would support Trump if he eventually won the GOP nomination, DeVos responded: I\u2019m still confident that he is not going to be the nominee. We have a long way to go. As you noted, he has a quarter of the necessary delegates, but that\u2019s a long way from 100 percent of the delegates needed. As we start to get into winner-take-all primaries, Florida is going to be a strong place for Marco Rubio. I think the dynamics will continue to evolve and change. The more people understand the totality of Donald Trump and what he stands for, I am confident and convinced they are going to look to an alternative to support. Several months later, during the Republican National Convention \u2013 where DeVos was an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 Russell wrote the proponent of charter schools and school choice was waiting to hear Trump talk about school choice before she would back him. Up until that point, Trump\u2019s talk about education had been fairly limited to pronouncing Common Core a \u201cdisaster\u201d and recommending that Washington, D.C. get out of education, leaving it to the states instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been happily surprised to hear [school choice] mentioned as many times as it has been, because it hasn\u2019t been part of the conversation nationally to date,\u201d DeVos said, according to Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty understandable because on the other side, Hillary is clearly in the camp of the status quo and the teachers\u2019 unions. But I\u2019m very hopeful Mr. Trump will begin talking about this as part of his campaign rhetoric going into the fall.\u201d DeVos added that she would be \u201ccontinuing to watch and listen and observe\u201d whether Trump began to speak of school choice. Her decision to support him, however, would require \u201ca greater focus on the issues that are of import to all of the American people. \u2026 I need to see more of a refinement on that. And to see a more presidential demeanor.\u201d According to Russell, the billionaire added that Trump\u2019s rhetoric also would need to be refined. Author Jane Mayer reports that, in a column at Roll Call in 1997, DeVos wrote about the power of \u201csoft money\u201d and its influence on politicians. DeVos said: I know something about soft money, as my family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party.\u00a0I have decided, however, to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect some things in return. Trump officially won DeVos\u2019 state of Michigan last\u00a0week, the first Republican to do so since George H.W. Bush in 1988.",

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " But Attorney General Jeff Sessions prevailed in the closed-door dispute, and with aid from Trump,\u00a0persuaded\u00a0Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to support a reform of the Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy. The reform, which may be unveiled tomorrow, will junk Obama\u2019s May 2016 directive which effectively\u00a0declares that children can change their sex by simply declaring they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the other sex. That rule, if imposed nationwide by judges, would give federal police power to the nation\u2019s small population of \u201ctransgender\u201d men and women, and would prevent Americans from assembling in single-sex groups and institutions \u2014 such as athletic leagues and shower rooms \u2014 or from expressing their preference for single-sex institutions. Critics say that the endorsement of \u201cgender identity\u201d by federal judges would also kill laws and civic practices which evolved to help the two equal and different sexes complement each other in a heterosexual\u00a0society built on families and child rearing. That anti-heterosexual process has already started in the states and has forced the Boy Scouts to accept girls. According to the New York Times, DeVos managed to ensure that the new policy includes an indirect federal endorsement of the idea that children have a right to have school officials support their desire to live as members of the other sex.\u00a0The new policy, says the New York Times, declares that\u00a0\u201cSchools must ensure that transgender students, like all students, are able to learn in a safe environment.\u201d The future courtroom impact of this endorsement is unclear. A very small proportion of Americans tries to live as members of the opposite sex. For example, only\u00a0about 1-in-2,400 Americans have changed their names from one sex to the other, according to a study of the 2010 census. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration has decided to let states decide how to handle the demand for legal rights for people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\u00a0\u201cSo while we have further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president\u2019s view has been for a long time, that this is not something the federal government should be involved in, that this is a states\u2019 rights issue,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Spicer downplayed the reported conflict over DeVos\u2019 support for the claim of \u201cgender identity.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no daylight between anybody \u2014 between the president, between any of the secretaries,\u201d he told reporters at the midday press conference. I think there\u2019s been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations \u2014 or between the exact wording. But as far as the conclusions go, I\u2019ve made this clear and the president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer of states\u2019 rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level. The New York Times released only a small fragment of Trump\u2019s pending policy document: School administrators, parents and students have expressed varying views on the legal issues arising in this setting. They have also struggled to understand and apply the statements of policy and guidance. Trump\u2019s deference to the states will force the cancellation of the federal\u00a0\u201cgender identity\u201d\u00a0policy announced\u00a0in May 2016 by Obama\u2019s deputies. Numerous states are already debating how sex should be defined. In North Carolina, for example, the GOP-drafted HB2\u00a0law says sex is determined by biology, and that people can change their legal sex after surgery. That clear biology-based distinction is strongly\u00a0opposed by gay advocacy groups, who say government should enforce individuals\u2019 flexible \u201cgender identity\u201d preferences.\u00a0The gay groups helped lead an economic boycott of the state in 2016. Other states,\u00a0such as Oregon\u00a0and Washington have decided that people \u2014 including children \u2014 have a fundamental right to change their legal sex, regardless of the impact on civic society. Also, Texas is leading a coalition of states which has persuaded a lower-court judge to freeze Obama\u2019s May directive. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a lawsuit from a young woman in Virginia who wants the federal government to order school officials \u2014 and the youths in her school \u2014 to agree that she is a he, even in science class. The court has not revealed where it stands on the \u201cgender identity\u201d issue, but in 2015, the Court changed the definition of marriage nationwide so that states could not define marriage as a mixed-sex relationship. Since\u00a0Trump\u2019s election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped defeat Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Less than one-quarter of Americans support the \u201cgender-identity\u201d plan pushed by gay groups and by Obama, which would allow transgender\u00a0activists to sue single-sex institutions \u2014 such as sports leagues, public shower-rooms, and women\u2019s shelters \u00a0\u2014 until they treat both biological sexes as interchangeable.

The secretary said: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak directly with these families, students and community leaders about their concerns, thoughts, fears and suggestions. Every school and every school leader has a moral responsibility to protect all students and ensure every child is respected and can learn in an accepting environment. I remain committed to advocating for and fighting on behalf of all students. Today\u2019s meeting was compelling, moving and welcomed, and part of an ongoing dialogue with families and students throughout the country. DeVos met with transgender students and their parents; Stephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan \u2013 from DeVos\u2019s home state; Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN; Nathan Smith, director of public policy of GLSEN; and Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.  The LGBT rights leaders reportedly discussed their concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to rescind the Obama administration\u2019s directive that caused school bathroom and locker room use to be an issue under the oversight of the federal government. Trump said policy about bathrooms and other private spaces should be under the purview of the states. \u201cWe highlighted the pervasive violence and discrimination that the majority of transgender students face across the country, including being prevented from using their correct name and pronouns and appropriate school facilities, Byard said in a press release statement about the meeting with the secretary. \u201cWe told DeVos about the immediate impact of withdrawing the guidance, and discussed ways that she might be able to mitigate the pain, fear, and confusion that decision has caused.\u201d Keisling said in a recent C-SPAN interview that parents who oppose their children and teenagers being forced to share bathrooms and shower rooms with children of the opposite sex must begin \u201cputting aside their prejudices.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos has contributed both her wealth and influence to the creation of more charter schools in her home state of Michigan, but national test scores show the state has not fared well as a result, says a report in Politico.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The report, published Friday, says, \u201cDespite two decades of charter-school growth, the state\u2019s overall academic progress has failed to keep pace with other states.\u201d It continues: Michigan ranks near the bottom for fourth- and eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading on a nationally representative test, nicknamed the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card.\u201d Notably, the state\u2019s charter schools scored worse on that test than their traditional public-school counterparts, according to an analysis of federal data. MI NAEP by Breitbart News on Scribd  From 2009 to 2015, for example, Michigan\u2019s state average score on the NAEP mathematics assessment was below the national public school average, and from 2003 to 2007, the state\u2019s average score was \u201cnot significantly different from the national public school average.\u201d Michigan fared better in math on the Nation\u2019s Report Card from 1996 to 2000. DeVos\u2019 supporters, however, point to research from Stanford University\u2019s CREDO, which scrutinizes education reform and student performance: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows that, on average, students in Michigan charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. Thirty-five percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while two percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, forty-two percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and six percent perform worse. These findings position Michigan among the highest performing charter school states CREDO has studied to date. Charter students in the city of Detroit (27% of the state\u2019s charter students), are performing even better than their peers in the rest of the state, on average gaining nearly three months achievement for each year they attend charter schools. Despite the \u201cthree months achievement\u201d progress in Michigan, it is noteworthy to look at CREDO\u2019s assessment of charter schools in Massachusetts, which rate the highest in the nation: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows on average that students in Massachusetts charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. At the school level, 44 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while 13 percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, 56 percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and 17 percent perform worse. The impact of charter schools in Boston are also analyzed separately. Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in TPS, the analysis shows on average that students in Boston charter schools have significantly larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. In fact, the average growth rate of Boston charter students in math and reading is the largest CREDO has seen in any city or state thus far. At the school level, 83 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading and math, while no Boston charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. What we can learn from this is that there are good charter schools and bad charter schools, just as there are good public schools and bad ones. States should be able\u00a0to make a difference in the quality of their schools. The Politico report then moves to the issue of school vouchers, which is a totally different issue. School vouchers are the transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to a private or religious school. Most on the left who oppose DeVos \u2013 particularly teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 do so for several reasons, not the least of which is the claim that vouchers will suck taxpayer funds from traditional public schools and destroy them. Some on the other side say public schools are already destroyed, despite billions of taxpayer dollars poured into them over the past several decades in the name of \u201ceducation reform\u201d and \u201cclosing the achievement gap.\u201d Additionally, however, the left takes significant issue with public money going to religious schools. Grassroots constitutionalists, who have been fighting against establishment Republicans and Democrats over federal intrusion into education through Common Core, know that school vouchers, as a means to bring about \u201cschool choice,\u201d are associated with the greatest amount of regulation for the private and religious schools that agree to accept them. In some states with hefty voucher systems, private and religious schools that accept vouchers have been forced to use the same Common Core standards and have their students take the same Common Core-aligned tests as their counterparts in the public schools. This is done in the name of \u201caccountability\u201d for use of public money. This situation, however, begs the question, \u201cWhy bother, then, to move a child from a public school to a private school?\u201d Neal McCluskey, education director at Cato Institute, says his concern about DeVos is that she will attempt to direct \u201cschool choice\u201d from Washington, D.C. At a time when most grassroots parents groups across the country had hoped to find a Trump administration finally getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, DeVos could still be running the show from D.C. \u2013 though from a different angle. \u201cEven though choice is great, it is not something people should want Washington providing,\u201d McCluskey, said in an interview with Caffeinated Thoughts. He added: Nor\u2014outside of the DC voucher program, military families, and maybe Native American reservations\u2014is it something that the feds can constitutionally provide. My fear is that DeVos and Trump might not recognize the myriad problems with taking private school choice national. More concerning, the American Federation for Children, which DeVos chairs, has tended to favor more rules and regulations on choice than I would prefer. That could become a much bigger concern were rules and regs attached to national-level vouchers. Writing at the American Spectator, Robert Holland of the Heartland Institute echoes that same concern: Although the Constitution empowers the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of laws, it does not provide for Congress, the White House, or federal agencies to control education by statute or regulation. Under the Tenth Amendment, sway over education is left to the states and to the people. The strongest step the Trump Administration could take on behalf of real choice in education would be to devise a plan for dismantling or phasing out the U.S. Education Department (USED), which came into being in 1980 as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s payoff to the largest teacher union, the National Education Association, for supporting his election campaign. USED has done nothing but impede educational progress with senseless No Child Left Behind edicts and costly Race to the Top boondoggles. Finally, Oklahoma parent activist Jenni White writes about DeVos\u2019 nomination that school vouchers are only part of the problem. \u201cPart of the reason we fought so hard against Common Core was the seepage of its tentacles into every nook and cranny of the education world \u2013 including source materials,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no such thing as \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2013including those using traditional education methods such as homeschool \u2013 when federal policy is allowed to dictate state education function.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201cThis agreement will build upon ongoing collaboration between the United States and Switzerland to encourage businesses and stakeholders to promote the value of apprenticeship programs and develop effective strategies to increase awareness of and access to work-based learning,\u201d the Education Department\u00a0wrote\u00a0at its website blog. The agreement comes after DeVos\u2019s announcement earlier this year about her desire to merge\u00a0the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. After a subsequent European tour, DeVos wrote\u00a0in an op-ed at\u00a0Education Week\u00a0that during her international tour, she found the centralized approach to education and workforce development in European countries similar to what she envisioned with a merger of the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cSwitzerland is known for its robust apprenticeship program, with more than two-thirds of high school students engaged in one of the roughly 300\u00a0government-recognized apprenticeships,\u201d DeVos wrote:  DeVos, Labor secretary Alexander Acosta, Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser,\u00a0represented the United States at the \u201csigning ceremony\u201d with Swiss officials. \u201cThe Swiss approach is one from which we can all learn a great deal,\u201d DeVos said\u00a0in remarks at the signing event, reports Education Week. \u201cOne important take-away\u00a0from my visit to Switzerland is that Swiss business leaders\u00a0didn\u2019t ask for a\u00a0permission slip from government to partner with educators.\u201d Since her tour of European countries earlier this year, DeVos has expressed\u00a0admiration for the type of education and workforce development practices countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.K embrace. In June, DeVos said it was her hope that adopting some of the education policies of these nations would \u201chelp catch us up\u201d to students from other countries:  In its blog post, the Education Department lists 15 facts about the Swiss Apprenticeship Program, including that \u201cnearly 2/3 of young people in Switzerland choose to pursue a vocational program.\u201d \u201cA defining feature of the Swiss vocational education system is its close correlation with the labor market,\u201d the department continues. \u201cTraining is geared to actual demand for vocational qualifications and to available jobs.\u201d The department writes that Swiss companies spend nearly one percent of GDP annually on apprenticeships and that 50 to 80 percent of apprentices are retained in the reported companies. \u201cCompanies start recruiting students in the 7thgrade with apprenticeships starting in 10the grade,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cEven at a cost of $50K-$150K over 3-4 years, the businesses get a full return on their investment\u201d:  Some education policy analysts, however, assert federal promotion of a workforce development model of education encourages a view of children as prospective laborers who can fulfill the needs of big business for inexpensive, local workers. While some students may opt for apprenticeships on their own, these analysts are concerned about students being pigeon-holed in middle school for a particular industry favored by the government when they might develop other interests later in their education. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling that so many education policy-makers, including Secretary DeVos, are drawn to the European system of the school-to-work pipeline,\u201d Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, told Breitbart News. \u201cRevamping our entire system to create cogs for politically connected companies isn\u2019t the way to \u2018catch up.\u2019\u201d Similarly, Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, told Breitbart News she was concerned the type of education a child receives \u201cwould be influenced by crony corporations dictating to schools the skills needed for future workers.\u201d \u201cCentralized, government-planned economies do not work, and that\u2019s not the free market system under which America and our economy have prospered,\u201d Smith explained.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201cParents deserve to know what is happening in their child\u2019s school,\u201d DeVos said in a statement announcing the new guide. She added: They should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children\u2019s education. This guide demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing parents with user-friendly tools and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Informed parents become empowered and engaged parents\u00a0who are able to better advocate on behalf of their children. Ironically, the federal \u201cguide\u201d is titled \u201cA Parent Guide to State and Local Report Cards.\u201d DeVos is advertising the guide as a means to achieve \u201ctransparency\u201d about the accountability requirements of the federal law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In the guide, the education department explains that ESSA requires student report cards to display information about how much money from federal, state, and local sources is spent per student for each school. The law also mandates that report cards provide results of annual statewide tests in reading, English language arts, math, and science, and results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). According to the department, ESSA states report cards must also provide parents with information about school disciplinary measures such as number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests, and incidents of violence in schools. Additionally, the federal education law requires all parents to receive information about English-language learners, children with disabilities, and foster and homeless children in their schools on their children\u2019s report cards. DeVos has touted ESSA as the means to bring about more state flexibility in control of education, though state education plans must still be approved by the federal government. The secretary has also said on several occasions that ESSA has done away with the Common Core standards, though some 42 states are still\u00a0using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands.\u201d In a recent article at the Federalist, Utah parent organizer Autumn Foster Cook wrote\u00a0about ESSA: Contrary to lawmakers\u2019 promises, ESSA did not free states to pursue independent educational goals, nor reduce reliance on testing. DeVos\u2019s administration seems inclined to enforce the constraints as rigidly as possible, with little deference to state law and parental rights, despite precisely opposite rhetoric from DeVos, the Trump administration, and Republican congressional leadership that rushed ESSA into passage shortly before Barack Obama left office. Shane Vander Hart also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at Truth in American Education that ESSA essentially\u00a0cemented\u00a0Common Core \u2013 and its standardized tests \u2013 into every state in the country. \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vander Hart explained. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d  The education department is hosting a \u201cdesign challenge\u201d contest for the new report cards.",

I mean, like, belly flop \u2014 bam.\u201d Upon DeVos\u2019 nomination, Bush said, \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms.\u201d At Townhall, American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins writes that Trump\u2019s choice of DeVos to run the federal education department could even be viewed as \u201cJeb\u2019s revenge.\u201d Robbins continues: Jeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \u201cgovernment-foundation cartel\u201d model of educational policy-making. Private foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals. The government relies on \u201cresearch\u201d funded by these foundations to support the preferred policies, and if Congress or state legislatures are involved, their members are assured these ideas are terrific because of all this research. Even the new \u201cbipartisan\u201d education law \u2013 the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u2013 pushed through Congress by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), will provide DeVos, if confirmed, with continued power to manage the nation\u2019s schools and students. Robbins notes ESSA \u201censhrines the progressive-education agenda of national standards, workforce development, competency-based education (the modern term for discredited outcome-based education), digital training, government preschool, and non-academic \u2018social emotional learning.\u2019\u201d Though, upon her nomination, DeVos quickly dismissed any notion that she has been supportive of Common Core, her statement that she calls for \u201chigh standards\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d are \u201csleight of hand\u201d words that describe the unpopular nationalized standards, says Robbins. Grassroots Common Core opponents in DeVos\u2019 home state of Michigan also noted\u00a0the philanthropist had never contacted them to ask how she might assist them in their efforts to repeal Common Core in their state. Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core while on the campaign trail, referring to it as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He also said he would work to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement following the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos\u2019 nomination moved to the full Senate after the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee voted 12-11 along party lines to confirm her. Two liberal Republican senators, Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), however, said they could not support her and would vote only to advance her nomination to the floor of the Senate. \u201cI will not, I cannot vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next secretary of education,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI was trying to get to yes,\u201d said Murkowski. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d As Roll Call reports, since the GOP has a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence would likely break a tie if only Collins and Murkowski vote against DeVos. However, if Sessions is confirmed by the Senate next, the GOP would be left with one less senator, leaving DeVos with a failing vote of 49-50. According to the report, Senate leadership has scheduled the DeVos nomination to precede that of Sessions since she might need his vote in order to pave the way for Pence to break a tie. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, however, said he is still encouraged, says the New York Times. \u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education,\u201d he said. DeVos has been one of the most controversial picks of President Donald Trump. Democrats \u2013 largely ignoring national test scores showing the continued downturn of performance by the nation\u2019s public school students \u2013 have portrayed DeVos as unqualified to run a department that oversees the nation\u2019s public schools, since she has largely been an advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. Democrat senators also spent considerable time during committee debate discussing concerns that DeVos would not continue President Barack Obama\u2019s expansion of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Teachers\u2019 unions have strongly opposed DeVos\u2019 nomination. \u201cIf confirmed, DeVos would become the first secretary of education with zero experience with public schools,\u201d National Education Association (NEA) president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cShe\u2019s never worked in a public school. She\u2019s never been a teacher, a school administrator, nor served on any public board of education.\u201d Republicans, however, portray DeVos as a generous devotee of school choice and of giving parents the opportunity to remove their children from failing public schools through voucher systems. Senators such as Tim Scott (R-SC) say DeVos\u2019 skills in developing school choice programs would offer low-income, disadvantaged students an opportunity to get out of failing public schools that leave them without the opportunity to advance into higher education and meaningful careers. Anti-Common Core grassroots groups, however \u2013 largely the base of the GOP \u2013 have been critical of DeVos\u2019 nomination because she has financed and served on the boards of many organizations that promote Common Core. Additionally, one of DeVos\u2019 main supporters is Jeb Bush, a prominent promoter of Common Core. Among the U.S. Department of Education staffers who have already been sworn in are supporters of Common Core and individuals with\u00a0connections to both Bush and Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who served as the primary source of private funding for Common Core. Dr. Karen Effrem, a Florida-based education activist and president of Education Liberty Watch, tells Breitbart News the staffers already on board in the Trump administration\u2019s education department are a concern. \u201cThis list of Bush, Clinton, and Obama cronies is just another kick in the gut to parents who voted for Donald Trump in droves in the great hope that he would do as he promised,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of a smaller Department of Education, fewer Common Core and testing mandates, and protection of student privacy,\u201d she states, \u201cwe will have more regulated private and home schools with their autonomy sacrificed to Common Core on the altar of \u2018choice,\u2019 data collected on our children without consent, expanded preschool, and the continued wasteful ineffectiveness and harm of the U.S. Education Department.\u201d",

      "content": " \u201cThe rumors are just that \u2026 rumors,\u201d DeVos\u2019s press secretary Elizabeth Hill reportedly said in an email statement, reports\u00a0USA Today. \u201cThe Secretary has no plans of stepping down.\u201d DeVos has critics on both the left and the right, but Democrats who will soon control the House say they plan to call the secretary before key committees for questioning. Democrats have long supported a strong federal education department that heavily funds public schools, holds them accountable to carry out the Party\u2019s social justice agenda, and keeps the teacher union base content. In a recent interview with the New American, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) noted, \u201cThe left understands that this is where you win or lose \u2013 in the schools and in the teaching of the children.\u201d While DeVos has changed the focus of the department to school choice, she has not, however, fulfilled what the conservative/libertarian base of the Republican Party had viewed as Donald Trump\u2019s plan to gradually dismantle the department. The Constitution does not give the federal government authority to decide education policy. Additionally, DeVos has hired\u00a0many education staffers with ties to her longstanding colleague, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lost in the 2016 GOP primary race, in part, because of his advocacy for the Common Core standards. The secretary also recently appointed\u00a0former Democrat Gov. Beverly Perdue of North Carolina, to head the National Assessment Governing Board. Like Bush, Perdue is a longtime champion of Common Core. Among the issues Politico reported\u00a0House Democrats will aggressively address with DeVos is the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmoves to stop state-led scrutiny of federal student loan servicers.\u201d The report observed that Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, \u201cis expected to lead the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing education funding.\u201d DeLauro had \u201cclashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the issue earlier this year,\u201d noted Politico. Teachers\u2019 unions are eager to have their newly elevated Democrat representatives interrogate DeVos. The National Education Association (NEA) said in a statement after the midterm elections that Democrats are now \u201cpositioned to shift the balance of power in state capitals and the U.S. Congress, where victories will add a critical check on policies that have hurt students, their families and communities.\u201d \u201cLawmakers learned an important lesson \u2026 You can either work with educators to address the needs of students and public education, or they will work to elect someone who will,\u201d said NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda. \u201cCandidates across the country witnessed unprecedented activism by educators in their races. Standing up for students and supporting public education were deciding factors for voters, and educators will hold lawmakers to their promises.\u201d Education Week\u00a0also noted\u00a0that, with Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott now about to take the helm of the House education committee, \u201cincreased oversight of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u201d is a given. ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " https://twitter.com/transition2017/status/801489495338188800 Anti-Common Core grassroots groups of parents and teachers urged Trump to abandon DeVos as his choice, citing her support for the education reform policies of pro-Common Core Jeb Bush and her influence through the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) in favor of Common Core. Karen Braun who writes at\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan noted: GLEP is a strong supporter of the Common Core and its continued implementation in Michigan. They are part of the\u00a0Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards\u00a0which opposes SB 826 to Repeal and Replace Common Core, science, social studies, and aligned assessments with pre-common core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan believes there is a high correlation between candidates who accept the GLEP endorsement and their future votes on legislation. GLEP claims NOT to have a litmus test on Common Core.\u00a0This allows candidates to say they are against common core and still gain the endorsement of GLEP.\u00a0\u00a0But DeVos\u00a0is a champion for \u201cschool choice\u201d while at the same time continuing the implementation of common national standards.\u00a0The DeVos definition of \u201cschool choice\u201d is the freedom to choose which common core school will track your child from cradle-to-career (P20).\u00a0All Michigan charters must use common national standards. That\u2019s NOT true choice. Like Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos has some money and has some things she\u2019d like to see different.\u00a0Like all good investors, DeVos likely expects a return on her investment. And if you don\u2019t play the game under their rules and vote the way you want her to vote, you may find yourself challenged the next time you run for office. DeVos, whose family founded Amway, was\u00a0an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a\u00a0grade\u00a0of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The former presidential candidate referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign.\u201d Trump likely chose DeVos because of her support for public/private partnership charter schools. While on the campaign trail, Trump said Common Core was a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and criticized Jeb Bush for his support for the standards. Trump also said he would get Washington, D.C. out of education, and said he favored local control of education and the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education. Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, said in a statement prior to the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination: President-elect Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very Jeb-like pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely. https://twitter.com/transition2017/status/801489495338188800 In a news release, the campaign says: \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families. I am pleased to nominate Betsy as Secretary of the Department of Education. I am honored to accept this responsibility to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again,\u201d said Ms. DeVos. \u201cThe status quo in education is not acceptable. Together, we can work to make transformational change that ensures every student in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential.\u201d",

DeVos\u00a0is the former chairwoman of AFC, which promotes school vouchers and tax credit scholarships.

Ought we not to have a no-buy list for students who are obviously troubled, have been expelled, are in mental health programs and who post YouTube videos of the sort that this kid did? Don\u2019t we need a superintendent to be able to go to a police chief and say this kid can\u2019t have a gun? The secretary responded: [T]here have, apparently were lots of signs. And I think it\u2019s critically important that we have a much more robust conversation around tracking and tackling mental health issues, and really bringing this all together, because it\u2019s clear that, it seems to be clear that this young man put up lots and lots of signals and warning signs. Hewitt asked whether the department of education should use its \u201cspending authority\u201d to incentivize school districts to develop systems in which they work with local law enforcement to observe someone who is believed to be a threat. DeVos replied that while such an idea \u201cwould be a very important part of the conversation,\u201d she would ultimately like to see Congress hold hearings on the issues. She continued: And we\u2019ve seen lots of discussion about this every time we\u2019ve had another incident, we\u2019ve seen you know, lots of finger pointing back and forth. But we need to have a conversation at the level where lawmakers can actually impact the future, because going back to and putting myself in the seat of one of those families impacted, you know, one of these shootings is one too many. And we have got to have an honest conversation, and Congress has to lead on this. It\u2019s their job. Asked by Hewitt if the education department would consider withholding funding from school districts that do not hire military officers \u201cwho are credentialed at the federal level,\u201d DeVos replied the question \u201clends itself to a broader conversation around the notion that too many kids today are really stuck in schools that are not working for them.\u201d The secretary, who has made school choice a primary goal, said, \u201c[W]e need the kind of freedom in education that is going to allow parents to find schools that fit their child\u2019s learning styles, their personality, and bring about a lot more creativity in how we actually help kids learn and get educated.\u201d Alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz, 19, was a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who had been expelled.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos\u2019s statement\u00a0follows a report in the New York Times which suggests she was at odds with the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions over changing Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy. The education secretary, whose confirmation was the subject of unprecedented controversy, released the following statement Wednesday evening: We have a responsibility to protect every student in America and ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment. This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools. The statement continues that \u201cno immediate impact\u201d will be experienced by students due to the reform of the Obama era pro-transgender guidance since a federal court issued a nationwide injunction against the policy last August. In her statement, DeVos echoes the comments of White House spokesman Sean Spicer earlier in the day regarding the Trump administration\u2019s decision to leave the issue of transgender students\u2019 bathroom and locker room use to the states. The secretary said: This is an issue best solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find \u2013 and in many cases have found \u2013 solutions that protect all students. I have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America. We owe all students a commitment to ensure they have access to a learning environment that is free of discrimination, bullying and harassment. As Breitbart News reported, Trump is planning to reform the Obama directive which declares children can change their gender simply by announcing they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the opposite sex and, therefore, should be permitted to use the bathrooms and shower rooms of whichever sex they identify with at any given time. The Times reports an apparent dispute between DeVos and Trump and Sessions over the transgender bathroom issue: The question of how to address the \u201cbathroom debate,\u201d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. According to Breitbart News, however, Spicer minimized the dispute between DeVos and the president\u00a0and Sessions. \u201cThere\u2019s no daylight between anybody \u2014 between the president, between any of the secretaries,\u201d Spicer said during a press conference, adding: I think there\u2019s been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations \u2014 or between the exact wording. But as far as the conclusions go, I\u2019ve made this clear and the president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer of states\u2019 rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level. Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Ryan Anderson\u00a0applauded the Trump administration\u2019s decision to reverse the Obama era transgender bathroom directive. \u201cThe Trump administration today corrected Obama\u2019s unlawful directives that violated the rights of students\u2013particularly girls,\u201d Anderson said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThis move returns authority over the issue to parents and teachers in the states, allowing them to work through to find a win-win solution for all students.\u201d Anderson further urged Congress to clarify that \u201csex\u201d does not mean \u201cgender identity\u201d with regard to interpretation of civil rights statutes. \u201cThis would ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges would not be allowed to reshape policy that affects women and girls,\u201d he added. A very small proportion of Americans attempts\u00a0to live as members of the opposite sex. Only\u00a0about 1-in-2,400 Americans, for example, have changed their names from one sex to the other, according to a study of the 2010 census. The American College of Pediatricians\u00a0maintains that gender ideology is harmful to children and that transgendered children are psychologically confused and at risk for mental health disorders. The College states: No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one\u2026 A person\u2019s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V)\u2026 \u201cAccording to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,\u201d the College asserts. \u201cConditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\u201d Youth Trans Critical Professionals\u00a0\u2014 a group of self-described \u201cleft-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights\u201d professionals, says it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies. \u201cOur concern is with medical transition for children and youth,\u201d say Youth Trans Critical Professionals on their website. \u201cWe feel that unnecessary surgeries and/or hormonal treatments which have not been proven safe in the long-term represent significant risks for young people.\u201d \u201cPolicies that encourage \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,\u201d says\u00a0the organization, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals. The professionals express \u201calarm\u201d that, because of the current trendiness of being transgendered, many young people have decided they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of \u201cbinges\u201d on social media sites. They describe a process of transgender activists recruiting these young people for their \u201ccult.\u201d \u201cThere is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,\u201d the professionals say. Despite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children who claim to be the opposite sex are no longer legally permitted to see a therapist to receive\u00a0\u201cconversion therapy\u201d in some states. Youth Trans Critical Professionals sees such state prohibitions as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex. \u201cWhile the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans,\u201d argue the professionals. \u201cThis would mean we can\u2019t ask why; we can\u2019t explore underlying mental health issues; we can\u2019t consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can\u2019t look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "In her strongest address since assuming her post, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asserted that the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed policy that forced colleges and universities to conduct \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d in dealing with accusations of sexual assault has \u201cfailed.\u201d",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos addressed students and faculty at George Mason University Thursday in long-awaited remarks on the enforcement of Title IX and the need to establish a regulatory framework that serves the needs of all students. The secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures. DeVos said: The era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago. DeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d Unlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process. \u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d She said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused. \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\u201d DeVos said, describing the Obama administration\u2019s approach: Here is what it looks like: a student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn\u2019t urged to keep quiet or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. Whatever witnesses\u2014if allowed to be called\u2014may or may not be cross-examined. And Washington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof. And now this campus official\u2014who may or may not have any legal training in adjudicating sexual misconduct\u2014is expected to render a judgment. A judgment that changes the direction of both students\u2019 lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party. And no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. It\u2019s no wonder so many call these proceedings \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d DeVos said \u201ceveryone loses\u201d in the current system which some say \u201cprotects survivors and thus must remain untouched.\u201d \u201cBut the reality is it doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d she added. \u201cSurvivors aren\u2019t well-served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process.\u201d The secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d She said: Schools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment. Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes. Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation. But if everything is harassment, then nothing is. Punishing speech protected by the First Amendment trivializes actual harassment. It teaches students the wrong lesson about the importance of free speech in our democracy. Harassment codes which trample speech rights derail the primary mission of a school to pursue truth. DeVos said her department will launch \u201ca transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\u201d \u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise, and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective, and fair system,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cTo implement sustainable solutions, institutions must be mindful of the rights of every student. No one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust\u2014not survivors, not accused students, not institutions and not the public.\u201d DeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance. Under the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions. To promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college. \u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism. According to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " \u201cParents, educators, and grassroots activists across the state of Michigan know exactly who DeVos is and her position on Common Core,\u201d Karen Braun tells Breitbart News the day after DeVos joined Trump in Grand Rapids at a \u201cThank You\u201d tour stop in her state. \u201cWe\u2019re not fooled by a single, carefully parsed statement on a webpage that she is \u2018not a supporter \u2013 period,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the truth.\u00a0We experienced it first hand.\u00a0So have many Michigan lawmakers; but for some reason they continue to stay silent and give DeVos a complete pass. Loyalty to DeVos trumps loyalty to the truth, apparently.\u201d DeVos told the crowd at the rally that \u201cmaking education great again\u201d means \u201cfinally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d But Michigan Common Core opponents want to know when she will come to the aid of parents and educators who have been trying to repeal the standards in her own state. An advocate primarily of school choice and school vouchers, DeVos said that putting \u201ckids first\u201d means \u201cexpanding choices and options to give every child the opportunity for a quality education regardless of their zip code or their family circumstances.\u201d \u201cThis means letting states set their own high standards and finally putting an end to the federalized Common Core,\u201d she added. Braun responds: DeVos\u2019 parsing on Common Core is going to become harder to maintain the more she speaks on education\u2026[Her] use of the qualifier \u201cfederalized\u201d is telling.\u00a0DeVos likely believes Common Core is a high standard and a quality choice for states; otherwise she would be with us at Stop Common Core in Michigan, fighting it to get it out, and replacing it with the pre-Common Core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0She\u2019s not. Neither is GLEP [Great Lakes Education Project.]\u00a0GLEP opposes SB 826 through their partnership with the Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards. DeVos has funded and served on the board of GLEP, an organization that promotes school choice and is a supporter of Common Core. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013. DeVos\u2019 website says she was chairman of the GLEP board from 2001-2008, and has remained a board member since then. Yet, upon her nomination as education secretary, DeVos launched a new website, and noted immediately, \u201cCertainly. I am not a supporter\u201d of Common Core. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Braun explains to Breitbart News how DeVos\u2019 vision of education reform intersects \u201cschool choice\u201d with \u201cCommon Core.\u201d \u201cIn a DeVos system of \u2018choice,\u2019 parents will choose WHERE their child is educated but WHAT they are taught is not up to them,\u201d Braun continues, quoting from a report from the American Federation for Children,\u00a0on which DeVos has served as a board member since 2008 and has been its chairman since 2009. \u201cThrough educational choice, parents are empowered with the ability to choose the environment\u2014whether it is a traditional public school, charter school, private school, virtual school, home school or blended learning\u2014that best suits their children\u2019s needs,\u201d the report read. \u201cThat\u2019s not true choice and will result in the destruction of educational freedom for all parents,\u201d Braun states. Braun\u2019s assertion is shared by many homeschoolers as well. In May of 2015, Breitbart News featured comments from homeschooling parents across the country who reject the idea of school vouchers, the transfer of taxpayer funds from public schools to private, religious, or even homeschools. In January of 2015, the Wisconsin Parents\u2019 Association, a grassroots homeschooling organization, expressed its adamant opposition to school vouchers for homeschoolers in an open letter: Programs that give public moneys to homeschoolers would undermine our freedom to homeschool, as would legislation that attempts to guarantee our rights and freedoms. Government \u201cfavors\u201d would require that homeschools be accountable to the government, which would make homeschools more like public schools. Our goal is to make your job as easy as possible and our homeschooling as successful as possible. No new homeschooling legislation is needed, and essentially any legislation would have drawbacks and risks. \u201cParents already have rights and responsibilities,\u201d continued WPA. \u201cThey come from God or nature, not the government. Proposals that supposedly guarantee parental rights backfire because they give the government a way to define and control fundamental rights.\u201d Tina Hollenbeck, a homeschooling parent in Wisconsin, underscores that sentiment for Breitbart News: It\u2019s really imperative that homeschoolers remember there is never, ever, ever a \u201cfree lunch.\u201d In other words, the offer of vouchers for homeschoolers is a Trojan horse and will \u2013 at some point by someone \u2013 undoubtedly result in increased regulation that will steal parents\u2019 academic freedom. This already happens in private religious schools that take voucher students \u2013 i.e., bureaucrats require that \u201cparochial\u201d content in such schools be removed from instruction \u2013 and there is no reason to believe that similar restrictions would not be strongly enforced on homeschoolers, too. We should not be fooled. Our parental freedom to educate our children according to our own convictions is worth far more than the bowl of pottage represented by voucher dollars. Braun says that she has been in touch with parent activists in Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and other states, who know well how influential and wealthy special interests like the DeVos family and their funded organizations have\u00a0blocked efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cThey all have the same sentiment, that DeVos is not against Common Core and has done nothing to help our state remove it,\u201d she says, and adds: SB 826, I\u2019m told,\u00a0is dead. No one wants to touch it.\u00a0State Senate Majority Leader Meekhof will not move it. DeVos through GLEP will make sure of it.\u00a0Or it will be so watered down so we have a bill that pro-Common Core Gov. Rick Snyder will sign.\u00a0A bill that he will sign is a bad bill and does nothing. Braun notes the companion bill in the state House \u2013 HB 5444 \u2013 could be reintroduced in January. \u201cBut unless there are a few more people willing to cross DeVos, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going anywhere,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cHB 5444 is sponsored by Rep. Gary Glenn who I believe is principled and against Common Core. But will he be able to break through the loyalty so many in Lansing have for the DeVos machine?\u00a0I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d \u201cThe fact that so many lawmakers in Lansing know the truth about DeVos and are giving her a pass tells me it is an uphill battle,\u201d she concludes.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Sunday night\u2019s installment of 60 Minutes found the struggling education secretary responding to a question by Stahl as to why she has become \u201cthe most hated Cabinet secretary,\u201d and agreeing that, yes, \u201cMaybe I should\u201d visit underperforming schools in the United States, after admitting she has not. On the issue of arming qualified teachers who want such a duty as a means of keeping schools safer, DeVos responded such an option should be available, but then volunteered, \u201cI hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn\u2019t ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\u201d \u201cThe problem with the interview was that Secretary DeVos accepted the slanted premises of every question and simply tried to apologize or answer within them,\u201d Manhattan Institute senior fellow Max Eden tells Breitbart News. During one portion of the interview, Stahl questions DeVos about the state of schools in her home state of Michigan, where DeVos was actively involved in promoting school choice and charter schools: Lesley Stahl: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We\u2019re in Michigan. This is your home state. Betsy DeVos: Michi\u2013Yes, well, there\u2019s lots of great options and choices for students here. Lesley Stahl: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better? Betsy DeVos: I don\u2019t know. Overall, I\u2013 I can\u2019t say overall that they have all gotten better. Lesley Stahl: The whole state is not doing well. Betsy DeVos: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this\u2013 the students are doing well and\u2014 Lesley Stahl: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. Betsy DeVos: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Lesley Stahl: The public schools here are doing worse than they did. Betsy DeVos: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. Lesley Stahl: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they\u2019re doing? Betsy DeVos: I have not\u2013 I have not\u2013 I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. Lesley Stahl: Maybe you should. Betsy DeVos: Maybe I should. Yes. Eden explains to Breitbart News how DeVos should have responded to these questions. \u201cWhen Lesley Stahl says, \u2018What about your awful record in Michigan with school choice?\u2019 the answer should be, \u2018Actually, Michigan charters performed substantially better than traditional public schools there,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019And we\u2019ve seen great successes there. And there are obviously problems in Detroit \u2013 huge problems in Detroit \u2013 but the charter schools are doing so much better than the pubic schools there, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame the problems we see in public schools on these other schools that are doing better.\u2019\u201d  Eden and the Cato Institute\u2019s Jason Bedrick wrote at EducationNext in January 2017 about the data from Stanford University\u2019s Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO), which shows that Michigan\u2019s charter schools performed better than public schools. CREDO states: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows that, on average,\u00a0students in Michigan charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. Thirty-five percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while two percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, forty-two percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and six percent perform worse. These findings position Michigan among the highest performing charter school states CREDO has studied to date. Regarding charter schools in Detroit, CREDO says: \u201cCharter students in the city of Detroit (27% of the state\u2019s charter students), are performing even better than their peers in the rest of the state, on average gaining nearly three months achievement for each year they attend charter schools.\u201d \u201cSo, there\u2019s a clear answer to that question,\u201d Eden continues. \u201cIt\u2019s to deny the premise and to put forward an alternative interpretation, to put forward her own philosophy. Unfortunately, DeVos answered the questions as they were asked, rather than articulating her own philosophy and beliefs.\u201d On the issue of the Obama-era school discipline policy of incentivizing school districts to reduce suspensions, expulsions, and arrests for minority students based on the premise that teachers engage in \u201cinstitutional racism,\u201d Stahl asked DeVos, \u201cDo you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully,\u201d responded DeVos. \u201cAnd are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.\u201d \u201cSo Stahl said to DeVos,\u201d explains Eden, \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t you think that when white and black students do the same thing, and black students are punished more severely, that that\u2019s institutional racism?\u2019 On the one hand, obviously, even when that happens, that\u2019s racist, and that was illegal before the Obama-era \u2018guidance.\u2019 But, the guidance is not about disparate treatment. It\u2019s about disparate impact. The guidance is not about providing supports. It\u2019s about forcing school districts to adopt loose discipline policies. But, DeVos simply accepted the false premise of the question, and then you can\u2019t provide a good response.\u201d Erin Tuttle, a parent activist from Indiana and a co-author of the book Deconstructing the Administrative State: The Fight for Liberty, notes to Breitbart News, \u201cAs Secretary of Education,\u00a0it\u2019s DeVos\u2019s job to make the case to the American people on the need to reverse the Obama-era guidance on school discipline policies referenced by Stahl.\u201d \u201cDespite the numerous legal and practical arguments for reversing such guidance, which, according to Sen. Marco Rubio allowed the Florida shooter to go undetected by law enforcement, DeVos offered none,\u201d she adds. \u201cHer lack of answers isn\u2019t doing this Administration any favors.\u201d Eden observes the Trump presidency and his administration have had a major theme of not accepting premises set by the media. \u201cTo not just answer the question as asked, but try to tell the public what you think is true, what you believe, and how you believe it,\u201d he adds. \u201cSecretary DeVos has not been able to draw the connection between her beliefs in choice and deregulation. She believes in choice, not because it\u2019s a market thing, but because teachers should have freedom. And that\u2019s what deregulation is, too. It\u2019s about that the best way to go is to give teachers the freedom to do what they think is right. And that\u2019s the missing link in her philosophy in which she believes, but has not articulated forcefully enough.\u201d \u201cShe needs to deny the premise,\u201d Eden asserts, stating the media at this point is very hostile toward her. \u201cThey want to paint her into a corner and she is insisting on coloring within the lines.\u201d The left-wing media has largely ignored conservatives\u2019 issues with DeVos from the announcement of her nomination to her post, including her avid support for organizations that have promoted the Common Core standards, her insistence that the massive federal Every Student Succeeds Act has ended Common Core \u2013 when most states are still using the standards even if under a different name, and her decision to surround herself with advisors who have also worked for her close friend, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.",

The policy distinguishes between situations in which children are born with \u201csexually ambiguous genitalia\u201d and those in which \u201cthe gender identity question is psychological in origin.\u201d \u201cCatholic educators as well as all other members of the school staff and community are called to be witnesses to Jesus Christ and His Church,\u201d the Harrisburg Roman Catholic diocese states, and continues: In the first instance, where the sex of a child may be indeterminate at birth, one requiring time and medical testing before establishing an existing or dominant sex, it is common pastoral practice to collaborate with parents and medical professionals as they try to make a prudential determination on their child\u2019s actual biological sex. This policy addresses the circumstances where there is a clear biological determination of a person\u2019s sex and subsequent efforts to chemically and/or surgically alter the given biology. This is understood in Catholic moral terms as self-mutilation and therefore immoral. To attempt to make accommodations for such persons would be to cooperate in the immoral action and impose an unacceptable burden on others in the school community. In a recent interview with The College Fix, noted Johns Hopkins psychiatrist Dr. Paul McHugh warned\u00a0that many in the medical and psychiatric industries \u201cwill come to regret\u201d the ease with which they are now experimenting on children who claim to be transgender. McHugh said treating young people with hormones and surgeries to change their appearance to be more in keeping with the opposite sex is \u201cexperimental\u201d and \u201ccomparable to doing frontal lobotomies.\u201d He agrees that gender identity dysphoria and confusions \u201care mostly driven by psychological and psychosocial problems these people have.\u201d The Harrisburg Catholic school policy continues that parents who choose to enroll their children in a Catholic school understand that they will not act in opposition to Catholic teaching. \u201cNotification of a student\u2019s determination to undergo a sex change procedure or that a student has undergone the procedure (condition #2 as described above) would violate that agreement,\u201d the policy adds. \u201cThe student would be ineligible to attend or remain in attendance in a Catholic school.\u201d CNN described DeVos\u2019s visit to the Catholic school \u2013 part of her annual tour promoting school choice \u2013 as another \u201cbrush with controversy over transgender rights.\u201d Another member of the Trump administration, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson, also angered\u00a0the left when he expressed concern about biological men claiming to be women inserting themselves into homeless women\u2019s shelters. The Washington Post\u00a0based its report on the matter on the comments of \u201cthree [anonymous] people present who interpreted the remarks as an attack on transgender women.\u201d The report continued: While visiting HUD\u2019s San Francisco office this week, Carson also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, two of the agency staffers said. Carson\u2019s remarks visibly shocked and upset many of the roughly 50 HUD staffers who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, and prompted at least one woman to walk out in protest, the staffers said. Carson has a history of making dismissive comments about transgender people. While running for president, he referred to transgender people as \u201cabnormal\u201d and said they should not be in the military. As HUD Secretary, he weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people, saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights.\u201d According to the Post, one of the anonymous HUD staffers said Carson conveyed the sentiment that biological men claiming to be women \u201cwere not women.\u201d \u201cLike we shouldn\u2019t force people to accept transgender people in this context because it makes other people uncomfortable,\u201d the staffer reportedly said.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  The summit will take place November 29-December 1 in Nashville, Tennessee. DeVos and Bush are old friends since DeVos was both a donor and a board member of Bush\u2019s foundation prior to being confirmed to her current post. Common Core advocate Bush championed DeVos\u2019s nomination as federal education secretary with the Trump administration within days of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Bush asked DeVos if she would be interested in the top federal education post and then asked Vice President-elect Mike Pence to recommend her for the job. \u201cHe was really the only person I knew in the transition,\u201d Bush told Tim Alberta, writing for Politico magazine. \u201cHe was the best person, because he was running it.\u201d Bush added that it turned out that both he and Pence \u2013 two former GOP governors \u2013 had the same thought since both had worked with DeVos to advance their education agendas in their home states of Florida and Indiana, respectively. \u201cHe made it clear that he was already thinking about Betsy, too,\u201d Bush said of Pence. Once Trump formally nominated DeVos, Bush announced publicly he was \u201cexcited.\u201d The foundation will feature a session titled \u201cReal Faces of Education Choice.\u201d DeVos has been an ardent advocate of school choice and charter schools. In announcing DeVos\u2019s address at the summit, Bush\u2019s foundation described the secretary as an \u201cadvocate for children and a voice for parents.\u201d \u201cAs secretary, DeVos continues to advocate for returning control of education to states and localities, giving parents greater power to choose the educational settings that are best for their children, and ensuring that higher education puts students on the path to successful careers,\u201d the announcement continued. In the new federal budget, DeVos\u2019s department had requested an additional $1.4 billion into school choice programs by increasing funding for charter schools by $168 million, instituting a new $250 million private school voucher program, and boosting the Title I program by $1 billion for states and school districts that allow students to use the funding at the public school of their choice, Breitbart News reported. The House, however, did not include DeVos\u2019s requests in its budget. According to her interview with Politico, DeVos said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s keep in mind that this is only the first budget cycle. There are other budget cycles.\u201d Bush\u2019s foundation\u2019s summit is convening in a state that has consistently rejected school vouchers to enable students in low-performing public schools to attend school elsewhere, reports Chalkbeat: Even as money has increasingly flowed into Tennessee to promote vouchers and voucher candidates,\u00a0including cash\u00a0from DeVos\u2019s American Federation for Children, the proposal to provide students with state-funded tuition to attend private schools\u00a0failed again\u00a0this year to clear the state\u2019s House of Representatives. (The Senate has passed the legislation three times. Lawmakers will take up the matter again in January.) Sponsors of the Bush foundation summit include\u00a0the College Board, whose president is Common Core \u201carchitect\u201d David Coleman; the Walton Family Foundation; ExxonMobil; textbook publishers Pearson and McGraw Hill; digital learning corporation Amplify; Charter Schools USA; and State Farm.",

      "content": " According to a report from Politico, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has launched an investigation into the colleges and universities that were named in the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation into bribery in college admissions. Several big-name universities were included in the department\u2019s report, included the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, Yale University, Wake Forest University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Stanford University. \u201cThe allegations made and evidence cited by the Department of Justice raise questions about whether your institution is fully meeting its obligations,\u201d an education department official wrote in a statement. The Education Department has demanded that the named schools turn over various documents related to their admissions process. Some of the requested documents, such as marketing materials, are available to the public. Other requested information, such as internal policies and procedures, are private to the universities. The Department of Justice reported earlier this month that dozens of parents had allegedly used bribes and other tactics to deceitfully earn admission for their children to some of the nation\u2019s top universities. Celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman were two of the parents named in the report. Loughlin was accused of fabricating an athletic profile for her daughter, Olivia Jade. Jade was ultimately admitted to USC as a crew recruit. The scheme was allegedly organized by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, who ran a college preparatory business that appeared to help students with the college admissions process. In reality, Singer funneled money from parents to various university contacts in exchange for help in the admissions process. In some instances, Singer helped students cheat on exams by placing them in controlled testing facilities in which hired proctors would correct the student\u2019s incorrect answers before the exam was submitted. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.",

The consortium was established to combine the resources of each university\u2019s Middle East Studies departments. The Department of Education received a complaint from Rep. George Holding (R-NC) over alleged antisemitic rhetoric at a federally-funded conference hosted by the consortium on Gaza. In a letter to Rep. Holding, Betsy DeVos stated that the UNC-Duke Consortium risks losing its federal funding if it cannot present a fair and unbiased perspective on the information that it presents. \u201cThis includes a requirement under Section 602 (e)(1) of the HEA that grantees must use funds to support activities that \u201creflect diverse perspectives and a wide range of views and generate debate on world regions and international affairs,'\u201d DeVos wrote. DeVos went on to argue in the letter that she will move to pull the funding from the UNC-Duke Consortium if it cannot comply with the law. I am troubled by the concerns outlined in your letter. In order for the Department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant, Department regulations, or the HEA. It is critical that recipients of grants use funds in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as for purposes of the program for which they are funded. Rep. Holding thanked Secretary DeVos for her action on the issue. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Secretary DeVos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,\u201d Representative Holding said on the investigation. \u201cI hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.\u201d ",

      "content": " Education media Chalkbeat reports Neil Ruddock has been working for the federal education department since early February after four years as regional advocacy director at Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE), where DeVos also served as a board member and to which she provided financial contributions. Ruddock\u2019s name appears on a ProPublica list of Trump administration officials who do not require scrutiny by the U.S. Senate. Chalkbeat reports: Before joining Bush\u2019s\u00a0foundation (where DeVos served on the board) in 2012, Ruddock headed school choice programs in Indiana\u2019s education department policy and research office for three years. During his tenure, the state launched and then expanded a school voucher program that could be a model as DeVos seeks to expand school choice across the country. On his LinkedIn page, Ruddock describes his work at Bush\u2019s FEE: Connected Foundation policy experts to state legislators, executive branch staff and local education advocacy groups; While serving as director of school choice programs in the Indiana Department of Education, Ruddock says he: Ruddock also served as a policy analyst for Educational Testing Service (ETS) from 2005 to 2008, where he \u201cserved as a liaison between ETS executives in Princeton and its lobbyists in key state capitols,\u201d and \u201canalyzed state policy trends in assessment.\u201d Other U.S. education department staffers who worked for Bush\u2019s pro-Common Core foundation and for the Indiana education department include Andrew Kossack, who is listed as a \u201cspecial assistant to the secretary.\u201d Kossack is an attorney who was appointed as Indiana Department of Revenue commissioner under former Gov. Mike Pence. Prior to that position, he served as general counsel to Indiana\u2019s ousted\u00a0superintendent of education, Tony Bennett, who championed the adoption of the Common Core standards in the state. Bennett then became the Florida commissioner of education and was\u00a0later investigated for fraud and resigned\u00a0after allegations\u00a0that he intervened in the grading system in Indiana to favor\u00a0a charter school run by a prominent Republican Party donor. Rob Goad, an aide to Indiana Rep. Luke Messer, served as the main advisor to the Trump administration on education policy during the transition, reports Politico. Messer, a supporter of school choice, backed\u00a0Bush in the GOP primary, as reported by The Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this primary carefully and believe Jeb Bush is uniquely qualified to lead our nation out of the morass created by the current administration,\u201d Messer said November 2015. \u201cJeb\u2019s record in Florida proves he\u2019s a man of his word, a true conservative reformer who can change Washington and fix the big things that are broken with our federal government. I\u2019m all in for Jeb, and think he would make a terrific Commander-in-Chief.\u201d Another current U.S. education department staff member who worked with Bush at his foundation is Josh Venable, listed now as \u201csenior advisor to the secretary.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " But parent activists are suggesting Trump is getting the wrong advice from his transition team. Writing at Townhall, Indiana activist and researcher Erin Tuttle and American Principles Project education fellow Jane Robbins assert Trump\u2019s transition team \u201cmay be ignoring the concerns of the most populist movement American politics has seen since Reagan: the parents and teachers fighting Common Core.\u201d Citing many of the reported potential candidates\u2019 associations with ardent Common Core supporter Jeb Bush, Tuttle and Robbins note: DeVos has served on [Jeb Bush\u2019s] foundation\u2019s board of directors. Among these \u201cexperts\u201d from Jebworld are alumni of Bush\u2019s Chiefs for Change (Gerard Robinson and Tony Bennett) and former members of Bush\u2019s gubernatorial education team (Hanna Skandera). All of these candidates predictably support progressive education in general and Common Core in particular. Indeed, Bennett was booted out of his position as Indiana State School Superintendent for that very reason. Why would Trump even consider someone coming out of the environment on which he heaped such scorn during the campaign? West Michigan Politics reported that, like Donald Trump himself, the DeVos family has donated to the Clinton Foundation: According to a WMP analysis of Clinton Foundation records, the DeVos family donated between $60,000-$130,000. The Doug and Maria DeVos Family Foundation donated between $50,000-$100,000. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation donated between $10,000-$25,000 Dave DeVos donated between $1,000-$5,000. Bloomberg also reported in July of 2015 that former President Bill Clinton \u201coften earned higher speech fees, especially abroad. Amway paid him $700,000 for a February 2013 speech in Japan.\u201d A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos, a former Michigan Republican Party chair, was an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The former presidential candidate referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I will be a more than interested bystander at the convention,\u201d DeVos said. The Detroit News continued: DeVos is attending the Republican National Convention as an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich while her wealthy and influential West Michigan family backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during the primaries. \u2026 DeVos acknowledged she has some misgivings with Trump but did not elaborate on why she\u2019s withholding her support for the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Meanwhile, a Buzzfeed report states \u201cRepublican mega donor\u201d Betsy DeVos has \u201cdeclared herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative.\u201d Buzzfeed continues: DeVos is in most ways a conventional choice for the position: a longtime advocate of alternatives to the public school system, with close ties to many on Capitol Hill, she is closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander and serves on the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s education foundation. She has also proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative, which Trump often denounced at his rallies with promises of a \u201crepeal,\u201d though she initially supported the standards. Shane Vander Hart, however, writes at Truth in American Education that Molly Hensley-Clancey\u2019s report at Buzzfeed that DeVos is an opponent of Common Core is less than accurate. \u201cYes she is very much part of the Republican education establishment, but where Hensley-Clancey got the idea that she proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative is beyond me,\u201d Vander Hart writes. \u201cBetsy DeVos through the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) and Michigan Freedom Fund tried to influence Michigan\u2019s Republican primaries.\u201d Karen Braun who heads up Stop Common Core in Michigan wrote: GLEP is a strong supporter of the Common Core and its continued implementation in Michigan. They are part of the\u00a0Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards\u00a0which opposes SB 826 to Repeal and Replace Common Core, science, social studies, and aligned assessments with pre-common core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan believes there is a high correlation between candidates who accept the GLEP endorsement and their future votes on legislation. GLEP claims NOT to have a litmus test on Common Core.\u00a0This allows candidates to say they are against common core and still gain the endorsement of GLEP.\u00a0\u00a0But DeVos\u00a0is a champion for \u201cschool choice\u201d while at the same time continuing the implementation of common national standards.\u00a0The DeVos definition of \u201cschool choice\u201d is the freedom to choose which common core school will track your child from cradle-to-career (P20).\u00a0All Michigan charters must use common national standards. That\u2019s NOT true choice. Like Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos has some money and has some things she\u2019d like to see different.\u00a0Like all good investors, DeVos likely expects a return on her investment. And if you don\u2019t play the game under their rules and vote the way you want her to vote, you may find yourself challenged the next time you run for office. \u201cDeVos\u2019 involvement with GLEP which supports Common Core and with the Foundation for Excellence in Education should make any denunciation of Common Core from DeVos\u2019 lips suspect,\u201d Vander Hart concludes. Braun also tells Breitbart News because DeVos refused to support Trump at the Republican National Convention, she is skeptical of whether she would commit to Trump\u2019s stated goal of removing the federal government from education. \u201cDisloyalty should not be rewarded with a cabinet post,\u201d Braun asserts. \u201cHer lobby group, GLEP, supports common core and P-20 competency based education or so called \u201cschool choice. I hope President-Elect Trump and the rest of the transition team think long and hard about this appointment.\u201d Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, also released the following statement: From the very beginning of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised an end to the failed Common Core standards. He repeatedly assured parents across the heartland that he intended to return power over education to local schools. It is puzzling, then, to see reports that the Trump transition team is considering an establishment, pro-Common Core Secretary of Education \u2013 this would not qualify as \u2018draining the swamp\u2019 \u2013 and it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point. President-elect Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very Jeb-like pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely. We remain hopeful that Trump will pick a Secretary of Education who will return control over education to parents and local school districts \u2013 someone like Bill Evers, Sandra Stotsky, or Larry Arnn \u2013 and not someone who will simply rebrand and repackage the failed Common Core standards that were so thoroughly rejected by voters in both the GOP primary and in the November election. Similarly, Tuttle and Robbins conclude, \u201cConservatives in the anti-Common Core movement are beginning to fear that the transition team\u2019s agenda has replaced Trump\u2019s, and that the grassroots activists will once again be sold out to the education establishment.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The House Education and the Workforce Committee heard complaints for more than two hours Tuesday from state education officials about the DeVos department\u2019s criticism of their state education plans \u2013 still required to be submitted under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), a bill that was passed in December of 2015 as a replacement for No Child Left Behind. As Education Week reports, for example, federal officials told Delaware it could not use Advanced Placement courses as a measure of \u201ccollege- and career-readiness,\u201d although the same plan was accepted for Louisiana and Tennessee. Delaware was also told its stated long-term academic goals were not \u201cambitious\u201d enough, though that term is not defined in ESSA, and that its plan to use science and social studies test scores for accountability purposes would violate the federal law. A Nevada education official said his state was told to revise its education plan by removing its science tests as indicators of core academic achievement, school quality, and student success. Federal education officials told New Mexico the state should specify its plan to ensure low-income and minority students do not have disproportionately higher rates of less experienced or ineffective teachers. Additionally, DeVos\u2019s department said the state should more clearly describe its plan to ensure all students are prepared for advanced math in 8th\u00a0grade, as ESSA requires. Similarly, Connecticut, Louisiana, and Tennessee were told they could not use their science test scores to prove accountability in the same way as their reading and math scores, and federal officials informed New Jersey it must be more specific about the criteria for removing schools from the \u201clowest performing\u201d list. At one point, as Education Week reports, the federal education department released what was considered a clarifying statement, that its review feedback to states \u201cis not an approval or denial of a state plan; however, a state is still required to submit a plan that complies with all statutory requirements.\u201d To date, 16 states and the District of Columbia have filed their education plans, seeking approval from the federal government under ESSA. In a statement about her department\u2019s review of state plans, DeVos said: I am committed to returning decision-making power back to states and setting the Department up to serve the support and monitoring roles intended by Congress. The Department worked with states to ensure their plans included all statutorily required components laid out in the Department\u2019s revised template. I commend officials from these states for their efforts to ensure their plans were ready for the peer-review process, and for their continued work to improve education for all students. The New York Times noted irritation with the DeVos department\u2019s actions on the education plans, particularly on the matter with Delaware: In the department\u2019s letter to Delaware\u2014which incited the most outrage from conservative observers\u2014[Acting Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Jason] Botel took aim at the state\u2019s plan to halve the number of students not meeting proficiency rates in the next decade. Such a goal would have resulted in only one-half to two thirds of some groups of students achieving proficiency, he noted. The department deemed those long-term goals, as well as those for English-language learners, not ambitious, and directed the state to revise its plans to make them more so. Cato\u2019s education policy director Neal McCluskey writes he would have thought the Trump administration would have been more deferential to states with ESSA. He concludes: And so we remain pretty much where we were\u00a0under the Obama administration\u00a0in education, and where we are with every law that leaves it to regulatory agencies to fill in the meaning of crucial terms: with states, localities, and the people at the mercy of bureaucrats and secretaries. Government increasingly of men and not laws. Like many Republican lawmakers who voted in favor of ESSA, DeVos has been promoting the law as a vehicle to eliminate the federalized Common Core standards and return education policy back to the states and local governments. However, under ESSA \u2013 as it was passed by Congress \u2013 states are required to seek approval from the federal government for their accountability systems and plans for how they will show they are meeting criteria for accepting\u00a0the federal government\u2019s taxpayer funds. These plans must include an expansive array of activities, such as how states will assess the success of teachers, students, schools, and school districts, and what they propose to do if they are not successful in achieving their goals. ESSA tasks the education department with reviews of these state plans as well as the power to approve or deny them. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the Senate\u2019s education committee, proudly boasted ESSA was passed in \u201cbipartisan\u201d fashion, and that former President Barack Obama signed Alexander\u2019s bill\u00a0almost immediately into law. \u201cWe have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0called \u2018the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\u201d Alexander\u00a0announced upon the passage of the bill. In April, citing ESSA, DeVos\u00a0said, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore,\u201d adding the federal law \u201cdoes away with the whole argument about Common Core.\u201d According to\u00a0Education Week, however, \u201cat least 37 states\u201d were\u00a0still using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its rebrands as of the end of last year. Senior fellow at American Principles Project Emmett McGroarty\u00a0at The National Pulse, following the approval of ESSA,\u00a0wrote: Anti-Common Core activists tried for months to warn Congress that the new federal education bill \u2026 was a disaster that would cement, not overturn, the odious progressive-education philosophies of the Obama Administration. Now comes confirmation that the activists were dead on \u2014 and that Republican leadership, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kline, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, carried out a cynical scheme to betray their constituents and give the Administration everything it wanted. Parent activists and education scholars who studied ESSA prior to its passage sounded the alarm that the federal law neither repeals the Common Core mandate nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. \u201cWithin the other 1,060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at The National Pulse. \u201cThe Secretary won\u2019t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for \u2026 \u2018high standards,\u2019\u201d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. Robbins and Tuttle quote the ESSA law and translate the Common Core rhetoric: \u201cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards.\u201d This is simply another way of saying states must have \u201ccollege- and career-ready\u201d standards. And as made clear by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s own\u00a0materials, \u201ccollege- and career-ready\u201d means Common Core. To help states with their ESSA plans, DeVos\u2019s department released in March a \u201crevised consolidated State plan template\u201d and a guide that refers states to two private organizations, the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association \u2013 both of which are the sole owners of the Common Core State Standards \u2013 for assistance \u201cto support the plan submission process.\u201d When President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to roll back Obama-era education department regulations, DeVos said about ESSA, \u201cWe\u2019re going to implement this law as Congress intended, not how the previous administration dictated. When we give decision-making power back to states and communities, students benefit.\u201d The key phrase, however, is \u201cas Congress intended.\u201d [TWEET]  Establishment Republicans have attempted a narrative that, with ESSA, they have turned education policy back to the states and negotiated a darn good \u201cbipartisan\u201d deal with their Democrat colleagues. The problem is that, as with Obamacare, continued federal overreach into education is exactly what \u201cCongress intended.\u201d These same Republican lawmakers are now hearing a multitude of complaints and are distancing themselves from DeVos\u2019s department. \u201cI think we have a case of an assistant secretary [Jason Botel] who hasn\u2019t read the law carefully,\u201d Alexander\u00a0told Education Week regarding the complaints. \u201cThe heart of the entire law \u2026 was that it\u2019s the state\u2019s decision to set goals, to decide what \u2018ambitious\u2019\u00a0means, to make decisions to help schools that aren\u2019t performing well.\u201d The report continues: So why is Alexander speaking out now?\u00a0He opened the\u00a0New York Times recently and saw that Botel had been quoted\u00a0saying that, because ESSA doesn\u2019t explain exactly what \u201cambitious\u201d means with respect to state student achievement goals, it\u2019s up to the secretary to define it for states. That doesn\u2019t jibe with Alexander\u2019s understanding of the law. \u201cNot only did we not authorize the Department of Education to define the word ambition, we specifically prohibited it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the law says, in plain terms.\u201d And the education chairman is also unhappy that DeVos has told some states that they may not be able to use Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses to measure college-and-career readiness. Botel\u00a0served\u00a0as executive director of the Maryland education advocacy group\u00a0MarylandCAN\u00a0\u2013 which was\u00a0financed\u00a0by Bill Gates \u2013 and has a history of support for Common Core. DeVos will be testifying to the House Education and the Workforce Committee about the state ESSA plans, among other issues. Following a hearing in which she heard the testimony of state education officials on the ESSA plans, current committee chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who also supported ESSA, said, according to U.S. News & World Report: Part of [the education law\u2019s] goals for state and school district autonomy was to force Washington to remain at arm\u2019s length from states and school districts when it comes to education, and rest assured that this committee will be watching to ensure Washington keeps its distance. \u201cI think that a lot of what it boils down to is a subject we deal with a lot in this committee \u2026 and that is the role of the federal government in education,\u201d she added. Joy Pullmann, author of The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, tells Breitbart News the core problem \u201cis the fact that we have a federal Education Department at all, which Congress has charged with executing a swamp full of counterproductive and fanciful mandates that nobody, not angels themselves, could improve student achievement by carrying out.\u201d The managing editor at The Federalist explains: The simple truth is that Congress is ill-suited to tell the nation\u2019s 35 million schoolkids and 3.2 million teachers what they should all be doing. Nobody except God knows that, and Congress isn\u2019t God. It needs to get a big dose of humility and strip federal law of ineffective trillion-dollar unicorn-land education programs, and send it all back to the states. Congress can\u2019t pass hopes into law and expect bureaucrats to fill in the blanks without becoming a major pain in the petunias. Pullmann recommends the Trump education department simply stop enforcing \u201cCongress\u2019s vague mandates.\u201d \u201cIt should also compile a list of the unenforceable and counterproductive programs it has overseen now for nearly sixty years to no measurable benefit to Americans, and send the whole lot to Congress for repeal,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey can start with the work of the Independence Institute\u2019s Vicki Alger, whose latest book will give them a rock-solid roadmap for precisely that endeavor.\u201d Robbins also observes to Breitbart News that, thus far, there is not much difference between the Obama and Trump education departments: There have been a few hopeful signs of policy changes under DeVos, but even those have been tentative. Overall, the new sheriff looks a lot like the old sheriff. It\u2019s baffling to the conservative grassroots that DeVos and many of her appointees seem to be completely disregarding what President Trump repeated again and again during the campaign \u2014 no to Common Core, yes to restoring local control over education. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to look a little insulting,\u201d she adds.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " \u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA], which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,\u201d DeVos said, adding: Each state can set the standards for their state. They may elect to adopt very high standards for their students to aspire to and work toward. That will be up to each state to be able to ascertain what is right for that state. We hope that all of them will have very high expectations.\u201d The secretary\u2019s comments come in sharp contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s statement at a CEO Business Town Hall several weeks ago. During that meeting, Trump returned to his campaign promise to end the Common Core standards and once again make education policy the domain of state and local governments. \u201cCommon Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe can\u2019t be managing education from Washington.\u201d The president continued: When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and they\u2019ll do a much better job\u2026 And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I\u2019ve always said it, I\u2019ve been saying it during the campaign, and we\u2019re doing it. DeVos\u2019s statement is similar to that of other establishment Republicans in Congress. In December of 2015, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, touted that he and Democrat Sen. Patty Murray (WA) had facilitated the \u201cbipartisan\u201d passage of the ESSA measure that would replace the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind (NCLB). President Barack Obama signed the bill into law almost immediately, referring to it as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d \u201cWe have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0called \u2018the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\u201d Alexander\u00a0said. A\u00a0statement\u00a0on Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s (R-NC) website following the signing of ESSA into law also said the measure had succeeded in \u201crepealing the common core mandate.\u201d \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d Burr said about the new law. \u201cIt will bring an additional $24 million per year in funding to poorest children in North Carolina and put a stop to the Common Core mandate.\u201d Establishment Republicans based their pronouncements on the portion of ESSA that\u00a0states, \u201cThe federal government is prohibited from \u2026 Mandating, directing, controlling, coercing, or exercising any direction or supervision over academic standards that states develop or adopt, including Common Core State Standards.\u201d Parent activists and education scholars who have studied the law, however, assert ESSA neither repeals the Common Core mandate, nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. In fact, those who have been battling against Common Core in the states say ESSA actually does the opposite: it keeps states anchored to the controversial education reform. \u201cWithin the other 1,060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project (APP) education fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle\u00a0wrote\u00a0at The Pulse 2016. \u201cThe Secretary won\u2019t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for \u2026 \u2018high standards,\u2019\u201d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. ESSA also requires every state to submit its education plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Education. Robbins and Tuttle assert: That plan must be \u201ccoordinated\u201d with 11 federal statutes, including the Soviet-style\u00a0Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\u00a0passed a year ago; the\u00a0Education Sciences Reform Act,\u00a0which is all about collecting student data for research; the\u00a0Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which adds to the Head Start requirements on preschool standards; and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Authorization Act, which governs the\u00a0NAEP test\u00a0that will almost certainly be\u00a0aligned to Common Core\u00a0to hide the fact that Common Core-trained students perform poorly on NAEP. Requiring state plans and therefore state standards to coordinate with all these federal statutes means, as a practical matter, states will keep Common Core. The\u00a0ESSA law also says,\u00a0\u201cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards.\u201d \u201cThis is simply another way of saying states must have \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 standards,\u201d say Robbins and Tuttle. \u201cAnd as made clear by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s own\u00a0materials, \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 means Common Core.\u201d Upon Trump\u2019s comments earlier this month that \u201cwe have to end Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty said, \u201cToday\u2019s comments show that President Trump has not forgotten his promise to end Common Core and return to local control of education.\u201d McGroarty added that Trump\u2019s leadership on the elimination of Common Core in the states is vital from this point forward. \u201cEvery Swamp creature will unite to fight against the president on this, so his leadership will be critical,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe look forward to seeing what steps the Trump Administration will take in the coming months to take power away from Washington D.C. and return it to parents.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos unveiled a plan Thursday that would provide $5 billion to federalize school choice by setting up a nationwide federal tax-credit scholarship program.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos is taking her federalized school choice plan to Congress where it will be introduced in legislation in the Senate by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and in the House by Rep. Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. Many who have been urging the Trump administration to dismantle the federal education department, however, warn\u00a0another federalized program will further expand overreach into education. The U.S. Constitution provides for no federal role in education, except in the nation\u2019s capital, in the military, and among Native American tribes. \u201cWhile school choice is\u00a0critical\u00a0and often undervalued, a federal school choice program reaches beyond the constitutional mandate of the federal government, and presents a real danger to private education in the future,\u201d wrote\u00a0Inez Feltscher Stepman at the Federalist Thursday. \u201cIf it passes, this latest example of federal overreach could be the Trump administration\u2019s equivalent to the Common Core debacle, and worse, could taint one of the most important reforms advanced by conservatives in the states.\u201d As U.S. News & World Report\u00a0observed, under DeVos\u2019s proposal, individuals and companies would obtain a federal tax credit if they donate to organizations offering scholarships to students to attend the schools of their choice. Individuals and companies would be allowed to donate up to ten percent of their adjusted gross income. Many of the details of the federalized program, such as who is eligible, education providers permitted to participate, and accountability for the federal taxpayer funds would be given to the states \u2013 although, as with Common Core, the incentive to create such programs would come from the federal government. \u201cThis is an opportunity for states to take advantage of money that would be available to them, for programs that they design,\u201d said\u00a0an unnamed education department official, according to Education Week. In her prepared remarks announcing the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, DeVos said her plan was not a \u201cmandate,\u201d but then focused\u00a0on her vision of how the federal government would incentivize states to sign onto her new plan: The key element of the proposal is freedom. Freedom for everyone involved. Students, families, teachers, schools, states can choose to participate in the program. Or they can elect not to participate. That\u2019s what freedom is all about. Let me be clear: I firmly believe every state should embrace education freedom. But those are decisions families and communities must make. This is not another mandate. We know gaining this freedom will require more work in some states than others. But as more states offer more options to families, demand will rise and pressure will mount on those who have not yet embraced the opportunity. While conservatives and constitutionalists heartily support parental choice of education options, they draw a bold line where the federal government takes over the project or incentivizes states to enact it through federal taxpayer funds. Neal McCluskey, Cato Institute\u2019s director of the Center for Educational Freedom, tweeted the title of his blog post that spells out his concerns about the new federalized plan:  \u201cSchool choice is about individualization and freedom, and almost certainly that is what DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne want,\u201d McCluskey wrote. \u201cBut federal initiatives are a terrible way to deliver that. The reality is that what the feds fund, even indirectly, they inevitably want to control.\u201d He continued: DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne are looking to skirt the control problem, sticking with tax credits instead of vouchers, and letting states opt in. But not only is this unconstitutional\u2014taxes are authorized to execute specific, enumerated powers, not to lightly engineer state policy\u2014it won\u2019t, ultimately, prevent encroaching federal control. If enacted, the credit would spur people to demand their states participate, and as more schools benefited from federally connected scholarships all schools would be financially pressured to use them. But the federal government will have the power to decide which state programs are or are not eligible, and on what grounds. Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck told Breitbart News the proposal is \u201cwell-meaning, but misguided.\u201d \u201cDeVos even alluded to the fact that the federal government would use pressure to \u2018encourage\u2019 every state to take these \u2018scholarships,\u2019 which means she\u2019d also \u2018encourage\u2019 eventual collection of data on all homeschoolers, not just the ones taking the credit,\u201d Hollenbeck said. \u201cThat should chill every homeschooler to the bone! I do not believe such a consequence is part of Sen. Cruz\u2019s motivation, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. \u201d Lindsey Burke, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Education Policy, and\u00a0Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, warned such an effort could actually reverse the school choice gains already made as well as recent tax policy reforms. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that the Administration wants to advance school choice but a nationwide federal tax-credit scholarship program is the wrong way to do it,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cThis could open the door for further education regulations down the road that neutralize the advantages of private education as well as impede future tax reform efforts.\u201d Burke and Michel highlighted the concerns voiced often by the conservative base of Trump\u2019s Party, including that such a proposal \u201cwould grow, rather than reduce, federal intervention in education.\u201d \u201cFuture administrations could use a federal tax-credit scholarship to require that schools adhere to certain admissions and accountability policies,\u201d they added. \u201cThat would mean the federal government could further dictate testing, reporting, academic content, and even bathroom policies for all schools involved.\u201d Stepman also warned that because parental choice of education options is so important, \u201cwe should be loathe to expose it to the heavy hands of federal regulators.\u201d \u201cEven if Republicans get a perfectly clean version of the tax credit through Congress\u2014a tall order given the composition of the House\u2014the door would be open for future Democratic administrations to extend a regulatory toehold into every private school that accepted students on scholarship,\u201d she asserted.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  In an op-ed at Education Week, DeVos writes\u00a0that during a recent international trip, she found these European countries have a centralized approach to education and workforce development, similar to what she hopes to achieve through a merger of the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, as announced\u00a0last week via a federal government reform plan.  DeVos asserts that in these countries, \u201cfreedom in education isn\u2019t controversial \u2013 it\u2019s common sense.\u201d The secretary is a proponent of school choice \u2013 the provision of federal funds for both public and private schools \u2013 as well as personalized and social and emotional learning (SEL), in which personality, psychological, and attitudinal data are collected on students to improve education outcomes.    DeVos highlights some of the key features she observed on her tour: In the countries I visited, education is oriented around the distinct needs of each student. In the Netherlands, freedom in education is enshrined in the constitution, which requires that the state provide equal funding for both publicly run and private schools. Two-thirds of students in the Netherlands attend schools that are privately run and taxpayer funded. \u2026 In England, greater autonomy at the school level has been encouraged with the creation of \u201cacademies,\u201d similar to charter schools in the United States, and \u201cfree schools,\u201d both of which are granted significantly more flexibility for educators. Under Prime Minister David Cameron, the number of academies greatly increased, and free schools were created to serve as incubators of innovation and improve student achievement. Today, more than 70 percent of secondary schools in England have adopted the academy or free school model. \u2026 Switzerland is known for its robust apprenticeship program, with more than two-thirds of high school students engaged in one of the roughly 300 government-recognized apprenticeships.  The secretary bemoans the fact that U.S. students have been falling behind on international standardized tests. \u201cIn science and math, students in Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom outperformed U.S. students on the most recent Program for International Student Assessment,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe United States ranked 23rd in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math. If we finished 40th in the Olympics there\u2019d be a national outcry!\u201d While DeVos\u2019s comments are directed principally toward those public school advocates who continually want more federal funding funneled into a public education system that appears to be failing, the conservative and constitutionalist base of the Republican Party maintains a federal role in education and workforce development not only does not exist in the Constitution, but its continued presence means greater regulation and more data collection of students in order to meet the workforce needs of big corporations. Additionally, though DeVos has stated publicly that the Common Core standards are \u201cdead,\u201d education policy watcher Shane Vander Hart of Truth in American Education wrote earlier this year that the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), \u201cengineered by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) \u2013 essentially cemented\u00a0Common Core into every state in the country.\u201d \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done.\u00a0They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, told Breitbart News: It\u2019s troubling that so many education policy-makers, including Secretary DeVos, are drawn to the European system of the school-to-work pipeline. Revamping our entire system to create cogs for politically connected companies isn\u2019t the way to \u201ccatch up.\u201d If she\u2019s really concerned about math scores on international tests, it would be more effective to assure states they won\u2019t be penalized for replacing the deficient Common Core math standards with good standards. Similarly, during a Breitbart News interview, Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, expressed her concerns about a merger of the Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cThe type of education the individual receives would be influenced by crony corporations dictating to schools the skills needed for future workers,\u201d she warned. \u201cAnd the preferences of big business are already disproportionately represented in \u2018the swamp.\u2019 Officially blending the education and labor systems would raise cronyism to new levels.\u201d Smith also observed the concerns about the privacy of student data.\u00a0She said her own state of Alabama has a longitudinal data system that combines the data from at least ten different agencies of state government into one centralized state data base. \u201cThat\u2019s a minefield for anybody who gets into that data base,\u201d she said, adding that the economy President Donald Trump says he wants will not happen with a merger of the two departments. \u201cCentralized, government-planned economies do not work, and that\u2019s not the free market system under which America and our economy have prospered,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cOur president knows that. But this is contrary to that. And even though the proposed merger of the Departments of Education and Labor is going to be presented as a downsizing of the federal government, it\u2019s not going to play out that way, and we will have a move toward government-planned economy.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  The declaration, which was produced at this first gathering of the \u201cEducation Working Group\u201d of the G-20 governments and dictatorships, was titled \u201cBuilding Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,\u201d and calls for globalization of education, inclusiveness, social and emotional learning, and increasing data collection on students throughout their educations and well into their careers. In her prepared remarks\u00a0to the G-20 education ministers in Argentina, DeVos brought forward her goal for workforce development, or government management of the workforce, which the Trump administration has recently stressed in its proposal\u00a0to merge the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cIndeed, education and the economy are indivisible, especially given the interconnectedness of the world today,\u201d DeVos said, emphasizing that while each child is \u201can individual,\u201d governments should approach education by acknowledging \u201cthe realities of today\u2019s economy, with an eye toward tomorrow\u2019s opportunities.\u201d \u201cSo, students must be prepared to anticipate and adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to acquire and master broadly transferrable and versatile educational competencies like critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity and cultural intelligence.\u201d The secretary also stressed her signature issues of school choice and vocational apprenticeships in her remarks. The declaration specifically states the G-20 education ministers are \u201cin line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda,\u201d and continues: It is important that education keeps pace with societal and technological innovations such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Internet of Things. We recognise that changes in the economy and labour markets have profound implications for education and training systems even though many of them remain unpredictable. Acknowledging the autonomy and diversity of national, regional and local governments and contexts, emerging knowledge and 21st century skills should be considered in curriculum development and pedagogical approaches at all levels of education. The curricula should be highly responsive to evidence-based practices, future employment trends, and design in collaboration with key stakeholders. The education ministers note that while \u201cincreased investments in education above certain thresholds do not necessarily entail better outcomes,\u201d the way to achieve their goals is through \u201cstrengthening governance, management, monitoring and accountability,\u201d methods that involve greater government control of education. The G-20 education ministers continue: We commit to facilitating the internationalisation of education, including the cross-border recognition of qualifications and skills, and the mobility of students, teachers, academic and non-academic staff, trainers and researchers, with a view to improving quality education and research, and in accordance with the respective national laws, rules and policies. We support the promotion of exchange and scholarships programmes among G20 members and other countries, in particular with developing countries around the globe. \u201cUnderstanding and appreciating other parts of the world, different religions, cultures, languages and points of view are essential elements of global and cultural competence,\u201d the education leaders say. In addition to urging \u201cdigital literacy,\u201d the education ministers say they will \u201cfoster the inclusion of non-cognitive skills such as socio-emotional skills across the curriculum [\u00a0SEL].\u201d Following the summit, DeVos told reporters the declaration is \u201cvery consistent with all of the themes that we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d\u00a0reported\u00a0Education Week. \u201cUltimately, the meeting resulted in a declaration that calls for putting education \u2018at the center of the global agenda,\u2019\u201d the report added. \u201cIt says the G-20 nations will work to \u2018ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u2019\u201d DeVos said the United States can learn from other G-20 countries, who are making more progress in the area of developing the 21st\u00a0Century skills. \u201cThere are too many other countries that are\u00a0further down the path of adopting some of these themes and embracing some of these opportunities,\u201d she said. U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE) \u2013 an organization of parents, taxpayers, and educators who are committed to ending the U.S. Department of Education, has called for the dismissal of DeVos. On Tuesday, USPIE sent a letter\u00a0to President Donald Trump in which the group called for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, per the Constitution, and the end to federal education programs. In its letter, USPIE reminded Trump of his campaign promises to eliminate Common Core and begin dismantling of the federal education department. \u201cSince her appointment, Secretary DeVos has used the hammer of the Federal government to broaden its authority and disregard the rights of states and parents,\u201d USPIE wrote, adding: Three actions in particular demonstrate this disregard: \u201cWe do not believe these actions are consistent with your \u2018America First\u2019 philosophy nor your campaign promises that generated so much enthusiasm,\u201d the grassroots education group told Trump. \u201cGiven these concerns, we call for the immediate dismissal of Secretary DeVos and for the appointment of an American education leader who will prioritize the fulfillment of your campaign promises.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "In interim guidance released Friday, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ended the campus sexual misconduct policies put forward by former President Barack Obama, stating\u00a0that, while colleges must continue to combat sexual misconduct on campus, the process must be \u201cfair and impartial,\u201d and inspiring \u201cconfidence in its outcomes.\u201d",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Following up on her announcement earlier this month that she is scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses, DeVos stressed in a new \u201cinterim Q & A\u201d that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations. A statement from the department says it is withdrawing both Obama-era documents concerning campus sexual misconduct: the Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence of April 4, 2011, and the Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence of April 29, 2014. \u201cThe withdrawn documents ignored notice and comment requirements, created a system that lacked basic elements of due process and failed to ensure fundamental fairness,\u201d the education department states. Moving forward, DeVos\u2019s department plans to solicit comments from stakeholders and members of the public as it prepares new rules for the handling of sexual misconduct cases in schools. The secretary said: In the coming months, hearing from survivors, campus administrators, parents, students and experts on sexual misconduct will be vital as we work to create a thoughtful rule that will benefit students for years to come. We also will continue to work with schools and community leaders to better address preventing sexual misconduct through education and early intervention. \u201cAs I said earlier this month, the era of rule by letter is over,\u201d DeVos added. \u201cThe Department of Education will follow the proper legal procedures to craft a new Title IX regulation that better serves students and schools.\u201d As Breitbart News reported, in a strong address on September 7, DeVos asserted\u00a0the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed policy \u2013 that forced colleges and universities to conduct \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d in dealing with accusations of sexual assault \u2013 \u00a0has \u201cfailed.\u201d The secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures. DeVos said: The era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago. DeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d Unlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process. \u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d She said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused. The secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d DeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students to \u201clistening sessions\u201d who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance. Under the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions. To promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college. \u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism. According to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.",

      "subtitle": "Education secretary Betsy DeVos \u201cis not eager\u201d to go along with other departments in the Trump administration regarding the possible establishment of a legal definition of sex that would ensure individuals\u2019 identification as either male or female, says a new report.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos may be at odds with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) when it comes to defining sex as either male or female under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination. Transgender ideology, promoted during the Obama administration, however, demands the federal government enforce rules that help people easily switch their legal sex, regardless of biology. In a piece Wednesday, the Washington Post suggested\u00a0divisiveness within the Trump administration over a potential decision to dismiss gender ideology when it comes to identifying individuals. \u201c[T]he Education Department, which implements civil rights law regarding sex discrimination in the nation\u2019s schools and colleges, is not eager to follow HHS\u2019s lead, and the Justice Department is deferring to HHS, according to administration officials,\u201d reported the Post. The report continued: The Health and Human Services Department has been pushing for the change, a fresh and direct aim at transgender rights, hoping other departments embrace that approach for sweeping impact. But it is unclear whether there is support for the broader effort or whether the regulation would be issued at all, as some in the administration are pushing back. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear what the Education Department\u2019s specific concerns are, but for many years, Secretary Betsy DeVos has privately supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights and has been reluctant to dial back their protections. According to the Post\u00a0report, President Donald Trump said his administration is \u201clooking at\u201d the issue. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now,\u201d Trump reportedly said. \u201cThey have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now. And we\u2019re looking at it very seriously.\u201d When asked about protecting LGBT individuals, the president said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody.\u201d The report comes in the wake of a story published\u00a0at the New York Times Sunday that stated\u00a0the newspaper had obtained a memo indicating HHS is \u201cspearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX.\u201d The Times\u00a0continued: The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined \u2018on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.\u201d The agency\u2019s proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with, according to a draft reviewed by [t]he Times. Any dispute about one\u2019s sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing. Supposedly, a proposed rule reflecting the definition would be presented to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by the end of the year. Caitlin Oakley, national spokesperson and senior advisor to the office of the assistant secretary for public affairs at HHS, noted in a statement that the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cbroad definition of \u2018sex\u2019 was enjoined by a federal court on a nationwide basis in December 2016 and the Obama administration did not appeal.\u201d Oakley added: That court found that the Obama administration regulation was overbroad and inconsistent with the text of the 1972 Title IX law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The court order remains in full force and effect today and HHS is bound by it as we continue to review the issue. In February 2017, DeVos released\u00a0a statement asserting her department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights \u201cremains committed to investigating claims of discrimination, bullying, and harassment\u201d against \u201cvulnerable\u201d LGBT students. The statement followed a report in the Times\u00a0that suggested\u00a0the education secretary was at odds with Trump and Sessions over a change in former President Barack Obama\u2019s transgender policy. The change would affect\u00a0individuals\u2019 ability to use whichever public bathrooms and other facilities they wish based on whichever gender identity they were adopting at any given time. The Times\u00a0reported: The question of how to address the \u201cbathroom debate,\u201d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. \u201cEveryone deserves to be treated with respect and HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights will continue to vigorously enforce all laws as written and passed by Congress, prohibiting discrimination in healthcare on the basis of\u00a0race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, and disability,\u201d Oakley said. Addressing privacy and safety concerns, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow\u00a0Ryan Anderson\u00a0has urged\u00a0Congress to clarify that \u201csex\u201d does not mean \u201cgender identity\u201d with regard to interpretation of civil rights statutes. \u201cThis would ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges would not be allowed to reshape policy that affects women and girls,\u201d he said in a statement. Breitbart News reached out to the Education Department for comment but did not receive a reply. ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk facilitated the discussion with DeVos in a Q&A format. The conversation pivoted to a discussion of the failure of the education system\u2013 subpar public schools specifically\u2013 to properly teach students basic civics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how few students are exposed to the brilliance of these documents and our Founding Fathers,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cHow are you planning to continue to address this problem as we move forward?\u201d \u201cWell, it is a huge problem,\u201d DeVos said before citing a recent statistic demonstrating the severity of the issue. \u201cThe latest statistic that I saw suggested that only about 18 percent of high school seniors had a reasonable understanding of civics and U.S. history,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a frightening figure when you think about it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for the federal government to mandate a specific curriculum nationally to address this,\u201d she added. \u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to talk very widely and loudly about the need to have robust civics and American history courses taught in every school across the country and for states, frankly, to adopt the requirement in their state to do so\u201d:  Civics is not the only issue, DeVos said. According to an international assessment cited by DeVos, American schools are falling behind in many other areas as well. \u201cJust to put it in a little bit more in context as well, there\u2019s an international assessment that\u2019s done every three years and countries around the world\u2013 developed and developing countries. Results are compared for academic achievement,\u201d DeVos said earlier in the conversation. \u201cAnd in the latest one, the United States was 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, if we had results like that in the Olympics, do you think anyone in our country would stand for that?\u201d she asked. DeVos believes \u201cschool choice\u201d is part of the answer, which she plans to pursue with the establishment of a federal tax credit. \u201cIndividuals and companies could voluntarily donate to 501(c) charitable organizations that would be designated by the states that chose to participate in this tax credit,\u201d DeVos explained. She said: If a state chose to participate and individuals and companies gave voluntarily to that fund, the state would then be able to take a portion of that federal pot and develop or augment programs that they already have in their state to extend scholarship opportunities to families and students in the state. That way, parents would have the opportunity to \u201cchoose a better fit\u201d for their child\u2019s K-12 education, DeVos explained. ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " \u201cI agree \u2013 and have\u00a0always\u00a0agreed \u2013 with President Trump on this: \u2018Common Core is a disaster,\u2019\u201d DeVos allied herself with Trump last week during a major policy speech at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \u201cAnd at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is\u00a0dead.\u201d The secretary\u2019s statement led Alex Newman of the Freedom Project to write: Despite blasting federal overreach in education and making other statements sure to delight conservatives and constitutionalists, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to mislead Americans on Common Core last week. Indeed, despite the dumbed-down national standards still being in place in almost every state, DeVos falsely claimed that Common Core was \u201cdead\u201d at the Department of Education. In yet another address that at least superficially put forward sound statements reflecting the Constitution\u2019s lack of mention of any federal role in education, DeVos has again failed to convince the base of her party that she actually believes this fact.  Indeed, the education secretary gave a good conservative run-down of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations\u2019 contributions to entrenching the federal government further into education policy via No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Common Core: Where the Bush administration emphasized NCLB\u2019s stick, the Obama administration focused on carrots. They recognized that states would not be able to legitimately meet the NCLB\u2019s strict standards. Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation\u2019s schools would likely\u00a0fail\u00a0to meet the law\u2019s requirements \u2014 thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the \u201cRace to the Top\u201d competition, and the grant-making process not so subtly encouraged states to adopt the Common Core State Standards. With a price tag of nearly four and a half billion dollars, it was billed as the \u201clargest-ever federal investment in school reform.\u201d Later, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB\u2019s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration\u2019s preferred policies \u2014 essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. However, as Shane Vander Hart writes at Truth in American Education, the \u201creauthorization of ESEA,\u201d i.e., the \u201cbipartisan\u201d Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 engineered by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) \u2013 essentially cemented Common Core into every state in the country: Sure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to. The standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core. At best, DeVos\u2019s views on Common Core are murky, and conservatives have never been sold on her statement that she has \u201calways agreed\u201d with Trump that Common Core is a \u201cdisaster.\u201d In fact, DeVos never was a fan of Trump and actually served as an at-large delegate of Common Core supporter John Kasich at the GOP convention in 2016. American Principles Project senior fellows Jane Robbins and Emmett McGroarty write at Townhall: Especially in her home state of Michigan, conservatives were\u00a0discouraged\u00a0by DeVos\u2019s nomination because of her past support of Common Core and her\u00a0efforts\u00a0(through organizations she founded and/or funded) to thwart the parents who opposed them. She\u00a0disavowed\u00a0her previous support and then sought to put the issue to bed by simply\u00a0declaring,\u00a0mistakenly, that \u201cthe Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA] . . . essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core.\u201d As Robbins and McGroarty note, in April 2017, the secretary actually said during a Fox News interview, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore.\u201d \u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act, which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,\u201d she added. DeVos\u2019s pronouncements that Common Core is \u201cdead\u201d seem disconnected from reality to parents across the country. Education Week\u00a0reported, \u201cat least 37 states\u201d are\u00a0still using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands\u201d \u2013 renaming the Core with a state-friendly title \u2013 as of the end of 2016. Meanwhile, Education Dive notes Timothy Shanahan, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago \u2013 and one of the authors of the Core, says the standards are still in effect in 42 states. \u201cEven if Common Core were ripped out from the roots, the federally controlled government \u2018education\u2019 system in America would continue to dumb down and indoctrinate students on an industrial scale\u2014literally threatening the future of the nation,\u201d Newman writes. In dulcet conservative tones, DeVos also announced during her AEI address that federal mandates are not working to improve education. The thousands of parents fighting against Common Core in their states for years now have been saying that to establishment Republican and Democratic lawmakers \u2013 but to no avail. DeVos herself, however, continues to plug ESSA \u2013 a federal mandate. \u201cUnder ESSA, school leaders, educators and parents have the latitude and freedom to try new approaches to serve individual students,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to them is simple: do it!\u201d Vander Hart asserts DeVos should heed her own advice. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice sentiment, but what is Secretary DeVos going to do about it?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf this is something she truly believed she would support the repeal of ESEA instead of touting it in its current form as the Every Student Succeeds Act.\u201d A big part of conservatives\u2019 problem with DeVos\u00a0is the fact that she has invited many followers of her close friend Jeb Bush to advise her. Bush has been a primary supporter of Common Core and school choice. Robbins and McGroarty observe that while DeVos has declared Common Core \u201cdead,\u201d she has followed Bush\u2019s lead in the areas of school choice \u2013 without detailing the mechanisms for bringing about the \u201cchoice,\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d or \u201cpersonalized\u201d learning \u2013 which is a major platform for student data collection. \u201cShe didn\u2019t mention the central problem with [school choice],\u201d the authors write. \u201c[T]he danger that when the money follows the child, government regulations will be close behind to strip private schools of the characteristics that made them appealing to parents in the first place.\u201d The authors add: [S]o-called personalized learning is actually depersonalized, computerized training rather than genuine education. It replaces a liberal arts education with pared-down workforce-development training that concentrates on \u201cskills\u201d corporations deem necessary for the (current) job market. It props children in front of computer screens that feed them curricula (probably not available for parental review) that children can click through without really learning anything. It indoctrinates children with government-approved attitudes, mindsets, and beliefs. It collects literally millions of data points on children that will allow the government and vendors to create profiles and algorithms that may control each child\u2019s future life path. It minimizes human interaction, converting professional educators into data clerks. Of course, ESSA is fully on board with digital learning and DeVos is fully on board with ESSA. Constitutionalists note that until DeVos can put into action the words she apparently believes make sense to Trump\u2019s constituents, she will continue to have battles with both the left and the conservative wing of her own party. \u201cIf DeVos is sincere about her philosophical rhetoric, she will devote her efforts to three things: freeing the states from all federal mandates to the extent she can under the law; working with Congress to revise ESSA to eliminate all mandates; and creating a workable plan to shut down her department,\u201d Robbins and McGroarty write. \u201cThat would be something conservatives can cheer.\u201d Newman warns, however: \u201cT]he fact that DeVos continues to dishonestly try to mislead Americans into believing Common Core is \u2018dead\u2019 should alarm everyone. It\u2019s way past time to shut down the whole unconstitutional Education Department.\u201d",

Thank you Betsy DeVos,\u201d Stabenow told the NAACP convention in Detroit. \u201cI really wish she was not from Michigan. I think we should send her back,\u201d the lawmaker added.  DeVos, a native of Holland, Michigan, is married to Richard DeVos, a member of the powerful DeVos family with deep roots in the\u00a0Great Lakes State. Stabenow\u2019s comment was a shot at\u00a0chants of \u201csend her back\u201d about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) heard at President Donald Trump\u2019s Wednesday evening rally in Greenville, North Carolina. The chant broke out as the president went through a laundry list of controversial statements by Omar, including her minimization of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks. Last Sunday, President Trump took aim at Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), challenging them to leave the if they continue to bash the United States. On Monday, the president doubled down on his remarks, writing on Twitter: \u201cThe \u201cSquad\u201d is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left, and were against humanitarian aid at the Border\u2026And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!\u201d",
