      "content": " Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker came out fighting for school vouchers Monday at a national conference of education reform advocates, where Walker said vouchers are a \u201cmoral and economic imperative.\u201d The likely 2016 Republican contender keynoted the conference presented by charter school champion American Federation for Children (AFC). The group is chaired by Betsy DeVos, a major Republican donor who is also a board member of Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education. The foundation\u00a0became an education reform empire supporting charter schools and the Common Core standards initiative. The Alliance for School Choice is the \u201csister organization\u201d of AFC, with a goal to expand school choice and to \u201crevolutionize the nation\u2019s education system.\u201d According to the Washington Post, DeVos and her husband have financially supported Walker throughout his political career, particularly during his recall election in 2012. DeVos said Monday her family has contributed to the political action committees (PACs) of several presidential candidates or potentials, but that they have not selected a favorite candidate yet. William E. Oberndorf is chairman emeritus of Alliance for School Choice/AFC and is also a current board member of Bush\u2019s education foundation. U.S. News & World Report indicated that during his visit to New Hampshire in March, Bush said he is \u201call in\u201d on moving to expand vouchers to allow more children access to private schools. In his address at the AFC summit, Walker said young people in the United States need access to a good education whether that is in a public school, a charter school, a private school, a virtual school or in a homeschool environment. \u201cOur goal should be to provide as many quality educational choices for parents as possible,\u201d Walker said, \u201cbecause I trust parents, and I know in the end that if you give them the best choices possible, they\u2019re going to make the choice that is best for their son or daughter\u2026\u201d Walker spoke as Wisconsin lawmakers continue to work to lift the cap on the number of students in the state who can participate in its school voucher program, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. In his keynote address, Walker also touted the benefits of limiting collective bargaining for public school teachers. \u201cSchools can hire and fire based on merit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can pay based on performance. That means we can put the best and the brightest in our classroom and we can keep them here.\u201d In an ironic twist, though Walker ultimately\u00a0signed a \u201cRight To Work\u201d bill passed by the Wisconsin state legislature in March, he resisted the legislation, stating it would be a \u201cdistraction.\u201d As the Journal Sentinel reports, Walker has received steady financial support from school voucher advocates. Scott Jensen, the former Wisconsin Assembly Speaker, is a lobbyist for AFC and one of its senior advisers. Regarding Common Core in Walker\u2019s budget proposals for his state, on May 8, the governor\u2019s public relations firm sent the following statement to Breitbart News: Governor Walker\u2019s budget calls for local control over education, freeing up local school boards to decide how best to educate their children. This is consistent with the view he holds in his book, Unintimidated: A Governor\u2019s Story and a Nation\u2019s Challenge, where he said any decisions that can be made at the local level should, and any decisions that cannot should be made at the state level before leaving it up to the federal government because local governance is most accountable to the people it serves. The budget affirms that no school district must adopt Common Core educational standards, and bars the use of a national assessment test associated with these standards. Walker\u2019s government office press secretary, however, said in an email statement to Breitbart News: The Governor\u2019s budget prohibits the State Superintendent from requiring any school board to adopt or \u201cgive effect\u201d to any Common Core standard.\u00a0The budget also defunds the Smarter Balance assessment and prohibits the State Superintendent from adopting or approving an assessment developed by the Smarter Balance Assessment Consortium, which is aligned with Common Core assessments. Under the proposal, school districts will be able to choose an assessment approved by VARC. See language from the budget specifically addressing this below: This bill requires the UW\u2212Madison Value\u2212Added Research Center (VARC) to approve at least three but no more than five alternative examinations determined to be acceptable for statistical comparison with the examination approved by the state superintendent. Beginning in the 2015\u221216 school year, a school may administer an alternative examination approved by VARC instead of the examination approved by the state superintendent if the school notifies the state superintendent that it intends to do so. Wisconsin\u2019s laws already give local school boards the power to decide their own academic standards. However, if VARC only approves tests that are aligned with the Common Core, many school districts could be motivated to adopt the controversial standards to ensure students have the best chance of performing well on the tests. In fact, Common Core supporters are hoping that is what \u201clocal control school districts\u201d choose to do. Critics say that should private and parochial schools that agree to accept school vouchers be required to submit to state mandates, it will be the end of truly \u201cprivate\u201d schools. Brian Medved, a member of the Germantown, Wisconsin school board \u2013 the only district in the state to elect not to use the Common Core standards \u2013 spoke with Breitbart News as a private citizen regarding Walker\u2019s statement. Medved said that while he agrees with Walker\u2019s overall sentiment, he believes the governor\u2019s rhetoric has not matched his actions. Though he is an ardent supporter of local control of schools, Medved said the devil is in the details. \u201cThe problems come in when \u2018they\u2019 decide what decisions should be under local, state, and federal control,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI would like to see much less state and federal intervention in education.\u201d Medved described that what is happening in Germantown is essentially a community that \u201chas embraced its local decision-making and is building creative learning centers.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see much local control going on in many districts, when you see that we are the only district in the state that has made the proper decision to move away from Common Core and \u2018standards-based\u2019 assessments,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\u201cThere are many reasons for this, not the least of which is the carrot and stick of federal and state money controls.\u201d \u201cThe problems I hear about in nearby local districts are that they cannot move away from Common Core mainly because of costs involved in making another change, or fear of poor testing results that would cause a bad \u2018report card,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMany superintendents are afraid of admitting the mistake of signing on to the standards in the first place, or feel they have no real choice in the matter.\u201d Medved said he would like to see the state education funding formula \u201cblown up\u201d with more money given back to the districts for true local control. \u201cIf a district wants to spend more money on nice buildings, that should be up to them; if a community wants to pay more in taxes, that should be up to them as well,\u201d he said. \u201cParents should have the ability to chose any school they would like their children to attend \u2013 this would be real local control.\u201d Medved added that he is wary that charter or choice schools will be \u201cturned into the same factory model of education through the imposition of the heavy hand of government regulation.\u201d \u201cI do not want to see more control of private schools,\u201d he asserted.\u00a0\u201cThere needs to be much more autonomy for schools to experiment and try something different without the fear of punishment. Parents can decide for themselves if a school is performing for their own child.\u201d The push for more school vouchers has been the subject of intense criticism in Indiana as well. As Breitbart News reported in January, a coalition of at least 40 groups of grassroots conservatives signed onto an education agenda that would cut regulations for schools that agree to accept school choice vouchers, as well as freedom to reject the state\u2019s rebranded Common Core-aligned standards. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) had worked to turn his state\u2019s school choice initiative into the most extensive in the nation, and Pence said he was hoping to see school choice extended to preschools as well, with more state funding for charter schools. While many establishment Republicans, however, tout \u201cschool choice\u201d programs as a sign of their \u201cconservative\u201d credentials, in reality, many rank and file conservatives are against the idea when the school choice is driven by vouchers that come with \u201cstrings\u201d attached, i.e., requiring the voucher-accepting schools to conform to state regulations. \u201cAs conservatives and activists who have been at the forefront of the education debates in Indiana for the past two years, the groups represented here reject recent media reports that the expansion of school vouchers is a major priority for grassroots conservatives,\u201d said Heather Crossin, co-founder of Hoosiers Against Common Core. \u201cSchool choice needs freedom to thrive; therefore our\u00a0first\u00a0priority is to free voucher schools from the stifling regulations which bind them.\u201d Crossin\u2019s coalition declared in its platform: Because of these regulations, Indiana\u2019s voucher program has one of the lowest private-school participation rates in the nation, at one-third of Indiana private schools. State lawmakers should cut all but the most basic of transparency requirements on private voucher schools, given that parents and private accreditation agencies already place higher demands on private schools than any bureaucrat can generate. Particularly egregious is the requirement that voucher-accepting schools administer the new assessment aligned to Indiana\u2019s rebranded/Common Core-aligned standards. Even states such as Florida, a leader in national reform efforts, grant voucher-accepting schools freedom in the selection of standardized assessments, since tests direct curriculum.\u00a0If true school choice is to be realized, this issue must be addressed so that parents may have genuine and competing curriculum options. \u201cI am in favor of putting the money and choice into the hands of the parents and students, not adding more regulation to private schools,\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s Medved emphasized.\u00a0\u201cI believe the best option would be for the money to go to the parents in the form of an education savings account, that can then be used at the school of their choice and the money follows the students.\u201d \u201cEducation is best done when you have an active, involved local community or school community making good use of their local control,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " But parent activists are suggesting Trump is getting the wrong advice from his transition team. Writing at Townhall, Indiana activist and researcher Erin Tuttle and American Principles Project education fellow Jane Robbins assert Trump\u2019s transition team \u201cmay be ignoring the concerns of the most populist movement American politics has seen since Reagan: the parents and teachers fighting Common Core.\u201d Citing many of the reported potential candidates\u2019 associations with ardent Common Core supporter Jeb Bush, Tuttle and Robbins note: DeVos has served on [Jeb Bush\u2019s] foundation\u2019s board of directors. Among these \u201cexperts\u201d from Jebworld are alumni of Bush\u2019s Chiefs for Change (Gerard Robinson and Tony Bennett) and former members of Bush\u2019s gubernatorial education team (Hanna Skandera). All of these candidates predictably support progressive education in general and Common Core in particular. Indeed, Bennett was booted out of his position as Indiana State School Superintendent for that very reason. Why would Trump even consider someone coming out of the environment on which he heaped such scorn during the campaign? West Michigan Politics reported that, like Donald Trump himself, the DeVos family has donated to the Clinton Foundation: According to a WMP analysis of Clinton Foundation records, the DeVos family donated between $60,000-$130,000. The Doug and Maria DeVos Family Foundation donated between $50,000-$100,000. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation donated between $10,000-$25,000 Dave DeVos donated between $1,000-$5,000. Bloomberg also reported in July of 2015 that former President Bill Clinton \u201coften earned higher speech fees, especially abroad. Amway paid him $700,000 for a February 2013 speech in Japan.\u201d A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos, a former Michigan Republican Party chair, was an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The former presidential candidate referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I will be a more than interested bystander at the convention,\u201d DeVos said. The Detroit News continued: DeVos is attending the Republican National Convention as an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich while her wealthy and influential West Michigan family backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during the primaries. \u2026 DeVos acknowledged she has some misgivings with Trump but did not elaborate on why she\u2019s withholding her support for the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Meanwhile, a Buzzfeed report states \u201cRepublican mega donor\u201d Betsy DeVos has \u201cdeclared herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative.\u201d Buzzfeed continues: DeVos is in most ways a conventional choice for the position: a longtime advocate of alternatives to the public school system, with close ties to many on Capitol Hill, she is closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander and serves on the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s education foundation. She has also proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative, which Trump often denounced at his rallies with promises of a \u201crepeal,\u201d though she initially supported the standards. Shane Vander Hart, however, writes at Truth in American Education that Molly Hensley-Clancey\u2019s report at Buzzfeed that DeVos is an opponent of Common Core is less than accurate. \u201cYes she is very much part of the Republican education establishment, but where Hensley-Clancey got the idea that she proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative is beyond me,\u201d Vander Hart writes. \u201cBetsy DeVos through the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) and Michigan Freedom Fund tried to influence Michigan\u2019s Republican primaries.\u201d Karen Braun who heads up Stop Common Core in Michigan wrote: GLEP is a strong supporter of the Common Core and its continued implementation in Michigan. They are part of the\u00a0Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards\u00a0which opposes SB 826 to Repeal and Replace Common Core, science, social studies, and aligned assessments with pre-common core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan believes there is a high correlation between candidates who accept the GLEP endorsement and their future votes on legislation. GLEP claims NOT to have a litmus test on Common Core.\u00a0This allows candidates to say they are against common core and still gain the endorsement of GLEP.\u00a0\u00a0But DeVos\u00a0is a champion for \u201cschool choice\u201d while at the same time continuing the implementation of common national standards.\u00a0The DeVos definition of \u201cschool choice\u201d is the freedom to choose which common core school will track your child from cradle-to-career (P20).\u00a0All Michigan charters must use common national standards. That\u2019s NOT true choice. Like Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos has some money and has some things she\u2019d like to see different.\u00a0Like all good investors, DeVos likely expects a return on her investment. And if you don\u2019t play the game under their rules and vote the way you want her to vote, you may find yourself challenged the next time you run for office. \u201cDeVos\u2019 involvement with GLEP which supports Common Core and with the Foundation for Excellence in Education should make any denunciation of Common Core from DeVos\u2019 lips suspect,\u201d Vander Hart concludes. Braun also tells Breitbart News because DeVos refused to support Trump at the Republican National Convention, she is skeptical of whether she would commit to Trump\u2019s stated goal of removing the federal government from education. \u201cDisloyalty should not be rewarded with a cabinet post,\u201d Braun asserts. \u201cHer lobby group, GLEP, supports common core and P-20 competency based education or so called \u201cschool choice. I hope President-Elect Trump and the rest of the transition team think long and hard about this appointment.\u201d Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, also released the following statement: From the very beginning of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised an end to the failed Common Core standards. He repeatedly assured parents across the heartland that he intended to return power over education to local schools. It is puzzling, then, to see reports that the Trump transition team is considering an establishment, pro-Common Core Secretary of Education \u2013 this would not qualify as \u2018draining the swamp\u2019 \u2013 and it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point. President-elect Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very Jeb-like pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely. We remain hopeful that Trump will pick a Secretary of Education who will return control over education to parents and local school districts \u2013 someone like Bill Evers, Sandra Stotsky, or Larry Arnn \u2013 and not someone who will simply rebrand and repackage the failed Common Core standards that were so thoroughly rejected by voters in both the GOP primary and in the November election. Similarly, Tuttle and Robbins conclude, \u201cConservatives in the anti-Common Core movement are beginning to fear that the transition team\u2019s agenda has replaced Trump\u2019s, and that the grassroots activists will once again be sold out to the education establishment.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Bush described DeVos, who is a major contributor to the Republican Party, as an \u201coutstanding pick\u201d for the cabinet position, reports The Hill. Bush said he looked forward to DeVos\u2019 \u201cbold leadership.\u201d \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms,\u201d he said. DeVos, who supports school vouchers for charter schools as a means to bring about school choice, is chairwoman of the American Federation for Children (AFC), a charter school promotion group, and is also a board member of Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE). Bush and his foundation have served as champions for the Common Core standards. Dick and Betsy DeVos are also major donors to FEE. In 2015, they donated between $50,000 and $100,000. Bush was severely criticized by Trump during the primary for the former governor\u2019s support for Common Core, which Trump described as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump vowed to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education to get Washington, D.C. out of education. \u201cThe last thing we need is another Bush,\u201d Trump said in January. \u201cHe\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core \u2013 that\u2019s a disaster \u2013 it\u2019s bad. It should be local and all of that.\u201d In announcing his nominee, Trump said, \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\u201d he added. Trump did not mention in his announcement the two things he vowed repeatedly to parents he would work to eliminate: the federally coerced program known as Common Core, and the U.S. education department. No mention was made that DeVos shared his vision of Common Core being a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that the days of the U.S. Education Department were now numbered. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller, however, said in a statement, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team\u00a0said Saturday, however, the discussion between the president-elect and DeVos when they met \u201cwas focused on the Common Core mission, and setting higher national standards and promoting the growth of school choice across the nation.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an education establishment euphemism for Common Core,\u201d writes The Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullmann at Conservative Review. \u201cNational standards are what Common Core was designed to be. Pursuing them is how we got Common Core.\u201d Pullmann continues, explaining how the use of taxpayer-funded vouchers to bring about school choice brings about more regulation into the private and charter schools that accept them: Setting \u201chigh standards\u201d is the job of parents and local communities, not the U.S. education nanny. Tying \u201chigh standards\u201d to school choice is also troubling, because this is again bureaucrat-speak for \u201crequiring all private schools to teach Common Core using the control mechanism of tests.\u201d When DeVos touts \u201cschool choice,\u201d she\u2019s pushing an education agenda that includes\u00a0requiring all the schools that take voucher money to use state-determined curriculum, like Common Core. This is how she has used her millions of dollars in the past. If she\u2019s education secretary, we have every reason to believe it\u2019s how she\u2019d use even more power. On what appears to be a new website, DeVos answers a question about whether she can \u201cprovide some straight talk\u201d on the topic of Common Core. She responds: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that\u2019s not my position. Sometimes it\u2019s not just students who need to do their homework. However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle.  Gov. Mike Huckabee and now Vice President-elect Mike Pence both got into hot water with anti-Common Core activists as well. Huckabee became known for recommending that the Common Core standards simply be \u201crebranded\u201d with a different name since the reform had grown so politically \u201ctoxic.\u201d Gov. Pence apparently heeded Huckabee\u2019s advice and then drew the ire of parents in his state of Indiana when he turned around and approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of Common Core soon after achieving a repeal of the standards. It\u2019s not clear how DeVos can respond \u201ccertainly\u201d and with a definitive \u201cperiod\u201d that she does not support Common Core when she never articulated such views against it in the past, or came to the aid of parents fighting the \u201cboondoggle\u201d in her state of Michigan. Though DeVos minimizes her associations with pro-Common Core organizations, they are readily visible and most would assume if she gives considerable financial and time and talent support to a group of people, she probably believes what they believe. As a member of the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s national education foundation, DeVos was likely aware that the \u201creform agenda\u201d of the organization she has been helping to guide includes college and career readiness; digital learning; utilizing student standardized assessment to determine teacher performance ratings; outcome-based funding; and standards and accountability \u2013 which include \u201chigh academic standards with their progress measured.\u201d This agenda is nearly identical to that of the Common Core \u201creform\u201d and is what Bush\u2019s foundation has sought to thrust upon the nation. And Bush has been an ardent supporter of the Core in other ways. Another of his education groups \u2013 Chiefs for Change \u2013 a bipartisan coalition of state education chiefs \u2013 consisted of some members who were also members of the PARCC Common Core test consortium \u2013 one of the two federally funded interstate groups that developed tests aligned with the Common Core standards. A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos was also an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich \u2013 like Jeb Bush \u2013 received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The Ohio governor referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign,\u201d just as Bush said Republicans didn\u2019t need anti-Common Core conservatives to win the White House. Buzzfeed also reported DeVos has \u201cclose ties to many on Capitol Hill\u201d and \u201cis closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander,\u201d an association that is not likely to endear her to grassroots parent activists. Alexander rammed through a massive \u201cbipartisan\u201d bill to replace No Child Left Behind that gives the U.S. Education Secretary significant control over standards and testing. President Barack Obama took such a liking to Alexander\u2019s legislation that he signed it immediately into law last December, praising it as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d Pullmann observes about DeVos\u2019 claim she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not a Common Core supporter: That\u2019s sure news to all the grassroots folks she\u00a0pit her big money against\u00a0during their legislative battles to reject Common Core. Grassroots folks report to me that DeVos\u2019 husband personally called state senators in Michigan to get them to vote against a Common Core repeal bill. DeVos\u2019 American Federation for Children also contributed\u00a0huge sums of money\u00a0for state school board races in Alabama on the side of Common Core supporters trying to oust Common Core opponents.  Michigan parent activist Karen Braun tells Breitbart News DeVos never used any of her time or wealth to assist parents in her state in their efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cDeVos prefers to be out of the limelight and let others like the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) do the heavy lifting,\u201d Braun says. \u201cBut activists and lawmakers in Michigan know her pro-Common Core position very well.\u201d She continues: I had a discussion with former Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin about the DeVos appointment.\u00a0He and I worked closely to try and get Common Core out of Michigan.\u00a0He said he had a terse conversation with her in 2013 in the heat of our efforts to repeal Common Core \u2026 she was very clear she loved Common Core and all the high-stakes testing and central planning.\u00a0Her recent statement claiming to be against it is disingenuous. She never did anything to help the efforts to get rid of Common Core and did many things behind the scenes to hinder us.\u00a0We have a repeal and replace bill in Michigan that GLEP opposes and have worked over lawmakers to make sure it doesn\u2019t pass.\u00a0We\u2019ve done our homework and we know that DeVos is pro-Common Core despite any statement she puts out today. Shane Vander Hart at Truth in American Education confirms, \u201cFormer Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin said to me, \u2018[DeVos] and GLEP were one of the main leaders defending Common Core when I was fighting it in the legislature. In 2013 I know she was strongly supportive of Common Core and high stakes testing.\u201d Perhaps parent activists can take heart that DeVos has suddenly turned over a new leaf and is now against Common Core and the federal control of education it represents since her new boss says he is committed to its demise. In that case, talk of \u201cnationalized high standards\u201d will need to disappear, and instead take a turn toward Trump\u2019s plan to finally dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and return education policy to the states and local school districts where the Constitution says it belongs.

      "content": " On Friday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d school choice advocate, former Obama education transition team member, the Education Policy Committee for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, and former DC City Councilman\u00a0Kevin Chavous (D) praised Education Secretary nominee\u00a0Betsy DeVos as someone who will make \u201ca huge difference\u201d for education and touted her support of school choice, and stated that there was a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for Dr. Ben Carson to make a difference if he was selected as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Chavous said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked closely with Betsy DeVos. I\u2019m very excited about her being there. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of people who are going to come out against it, but the most important thing to know about Betsy is she cares about kids, and she puts kids first. This idea of having expanded school choice, quality options for working and low-income minority parents, is a big deal. I mean, I think if we fix education, we fix poverty in America. Betsy gets that, and I think one of things that she\u2019s also going to bring to the table, this is very important, on the heels of a divisive campaign, she\u2019s a natural consensus builder, and she understands the need to collaborate. She\u2019s worked for folks like [Sen.] Cory Booker and [fmr. Sen.] Joe Lieberman (I-CT), some on our board. So, I think having this collaborative approach to promoting school choice, she\u2019s going to make a huge difference for school and education in America.\u201d He added that there was \u201ca real good opportunity for Ben Carson to make a huge difference. As you said, his background in Detroit, he understands what it feels like to grow up poor in a working-class inner city community. \u2026\u00a0If President-Elect Trump is serious about helping to fix what\u2019s going on in our inner cities, you can do some really good things with HUD. I remember Jack Kemp years ago, created this approach where he empowered low-income public housing residents into home ownership, made a big difference in our cities around america, and when I was on the City Council in DC, I worked with [fmr. HUD Secretary and current New York Governor] Andrew Cuomo (D) for block grant funding for targeted development. I think that Ben Carson can do a lot of those kinds of things.\u201d Chavous concluded, \u201c[T]here are a lot of folks, and you know, I fall into that category somewhat myself, that are somewhat concerned, because I did not support the president-elect, but I do that think that now, we\u2019ve got to fly the plane while we fix it, and i think if \u2014 with some of his advisers, if Dr. Carson would really look at some of these opportunities, you can stimulate some amazing things in inner through HUD block grant opportunities, and I think we have to give him a chance, if he gets in there, and I think it\u2019s a two-way street. He can work with elected leaders. He can empower the clergy to work with him. There is all these kind of opportunities. We need to excite possibilities and not destroy them before they happen.\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

      "content": " Common Core backer Gov. Rick Snyder applauded Trump\u2019s choice of former GOP party chair in his state of Michigan, Betsy DeVos. \u201cBetsy\u2019s appointment will mean great things for Michigan and for children around the nation as she takes her no-nonsense commitment to empowering parents to the highest levels in Washington,\u201d Snyder said, reports the Detroit News. In 2013, Snyder denied the Common Core originated with the federal government, though states were coerced into adopting the standards/testing package through a competitive grant program that appeared in President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus bill. Snyder said Common Core is a \u201cgood thing\u201d and that his state should \u201cstand up for it,\u201d reported NBC25 News. He added the goal of Common Core is setting higher standards and blamed opposition to it on \u201cpolitics.\u201d Similarly, Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce president Sandy Baruah said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have someone from Michigan in this critical role. We believe she will be an advocate for high academic standards and accountability.\u201d Business and industry groups such as the Chamber of Commerce have been ardent backers of Common Core. The Detroit Regional Chamber\u2019s statement on Common Core says: As business leaders, educators, advocates, and parents we understand that in order for students to compete in a global economy, Michigan needs consistent standards that will provide appropriate benchmarks for all students, regardless of where they live. Michigan Common Core Standards are grounded in evidence, benchmarked against peers, and focused on ensuring that students graduate career and college ready. Tonya Allen, president and CEO of the Skillman Foundation, and co-chair of Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren, said she is grateful DeVos is a supporter of Common Core, reports the Detroit News. \u201cWe have to focus on setting consistent standards so every child in our country, whether rural or suburban, will be able to compete nationally,\u201d Allen said. On what appeared to be a new website, however, DeVos, who has been known mostly in Michigan, denied that she supports the federally incentivized Common Core state standards. Similar to national figures such as former Gov. Mike Huckabee, DeVos says Common Core \u201cgot turned into a federalized boondoggle.\u201d DeVos stated: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense.

However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle. \u201cThat\u2019s an education establishment euphemism for Common Core,\u201d writes The Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullmann at Conservative Review, however. \u201cNational standards are what Common Core was designed to be. Pursuing them is how we got Common Core.\u201d In addition, Huckabee became known for recommending that the Common Core standards simply be \u201crebranded\u201d with a different name since the reform\u2019s name had grown so politically \u201ctoxic.\u201d Indiana\u2019s Gov. Pence \u2013 now the Vice President-elect \u2013 drew the ire of parents in his state when he turned around and approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of Common Core soon after achieving a repeal of the standards. On Friday, in response to DeVos\u2019 statement that she was not a supporter of Common Core, Karen Braun posted at Stop Common Core in Michigan that \u201cIt was a huge surprise\u201d to the parent activists on their team \u201cand MANY in the grassroots to read her claim that she was AGAINST Common Core.\u201d \u201cAt Stop Common Core in Michigan we have been working hard to repeal and replace common core in Michigan for many years,\u201d Braun writes.\u00a0\u201cDeVos has never contacted us to ask how she may assist us in our efforts to stop common core.\u201d DeVos serves as a board member of Common Core champion Jeb Bush\u2019s foundation. Bush also praised Trump\u2019s decision to nominate her for the top education official in the country. \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms,\u201d he said. Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core while on the campaign trail, referring to it as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He also said he would work to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement following the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The Washington Examiner\u2019s Jason Russell reports GOP megadonor DeVos endorsed Rubio in the primary and that her family \u2013 heirs of the Amway fortune \u2013 backed Mitt Romney in 2012. Russell adds the DeVos family\u2019s financial support \u201cmay have been crucial for [Romney] as he squeaked past Rick Santorum by three points to notch a crucial win before Super Tuesday.\u201d During an interview in March, DeVos told Russell, \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump represents the Republican Party.\u201d She continued with comments on the GOP primary race: We as a family decided to, as many did, see how things unfolded nationally. There were a number of candidates that we felt would be very capable, that we could easily embrace and support. As the field has continued to narrow, after Gov. [Jeb] Bush exited the race, we felt it appropriate and an important time to lend our voice, whatever impact that might have, particularly with Michigan\u2019s primary coming up. That was our impetus to embrace and publicly support Sen. Rubio. Describing Trump as \u201can interloper\u201d who is \u201cnot winning the support of traditional Republicans,\u201d DeVos said: I continue to be very optimistic that as we get further along into the process, the more voters know about him, and the more informed they are, the more they\u2019re going to continue to break away. That\u2019s even held true in the primaries held to date. I think he has underperformed compared to public polls just days before the Super Tuesday contests. I think more and more people are going to realize that they really don\u2019t trust him. The more they learn about his record, they\u2019re going to break away and go to an alternate. I continue to think that Rubio is a very strong and viable candidate that will represent our party and the future for our country very, very well. Asked about whether she would support Trump if he eventually won the GOP nomination, DeVos responded: I\u2019m still confident that he is not going to be the nominee. We have a long way to go. As you noted, he has a quarter of the necessary delegates, but that\u2019s a long way from 100 percent of the delegates needed. As we start to get into winner-take-all primaries, Florida is going to be a strong place for Marco Rubio. I think the dynamics will continue to evolve and change. The more people understand the totality of Donald Trump and what he stands for, I am confident and convinced they are going to look to an alternative to support. Several months later, during the Republican National Convention \u2013 where DeVos was an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 Russell wrote the proponent of charter schools and school choice was waiting to hear Trump talk about school choice before she would back him. Up until that point, Trump\u2019s talk about education had been fairly limited to pronouncing Common Core a \u201cdisaster\u201d and recommending that Washington, D.C. get out of education, leaving it to the states instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been happily surprised to hear [school choice] mentioned as many times as it has been, because it hasn\u2019t been part of the conversation nationally to date,\u201d DeVos said, according to Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty understandable because on the other side, Hillary is clearly in the camp of the status quo and the teachers\u2019 unions. But I\u2019m very hopeful Mr. Trump will begin talking about this as part of his campaign rhetoric going into the fall.\u201d DeVos added that she would be \u201ccontinuing to watch and listen and observe\u201d whether Trump began to speak of school choice. Her decision to support him, however, would require \u201ca greater focus on the issues that are of import to all of the American people. \u2026 I need to see more of a refinement on that. And to see a more presidential demeanor.\u201d According to Russell, the billionaire added that Trump\u2019s rhetoric also would need to be refined. Author Jane Mayer reports that, in a column at Roll Call in 1997, DeVos wrote about the power of \u201csoft money\u201d and its influence on politicians. DeVos said: I know something about soft money, as my family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party.\u00a0I have decided, however, to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect some things in return. Trump officially won DeVos\u2019 state of Michigan last\u00a0week, the first Republican to do so since George H.W. Bush in 1988.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " On Monday, Stop Common Core in Michigan posted the following request for Betsy DeVos not to be considered for education secretary on its website: We, the leadership team at Stop Common Core in Michigan, respectfully ask President-elect Donald Trump to immediately remove Betsy DeVos\u2019s name from consideration as Secretary of the Department of Education. We do not make this request lightly but with considerable knowledge regarding her negative influence in Michigan as a proponent of Common Core. The group leaders \u2014 Melanie Kurdys, Deborah DeBacker, Tamara Carlone, and Michelle Frederick \u2014 point not only to Trump\u2019s \u201cemphatic message against Common Core,\u201d but also the reality that \u201cmost Republicans in our state say they are against Common Core but do nothing to stop it.\u201d \u201cDeVos is part of \u2018the swamp\u2019 in Michigan,\u201d the leaders state in a post written by Karen Braun.\u00a0\u201cShe represents both a special interest AND as an influential Republican fought EVERY effort to stop Common Core in Michigan with her money and political influence.\u201d DeVos \u2014 whose family is an heir to the Amway fortune \u2014 is a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and a party mega-donor. A champion of charter schools and \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2014 a concept that even many pro-Common Core individuals and groups support \u2014 DeVos released the following statement on a new website when the Trump transition team announced her nomination to the top education post: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that\u2019s not my position. Sometimes it\u2019s not just students who need to do their homework. However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle. The Michigan Common Core opponents, however, say DeVos\u2019s \u201crecent claim that she is against Common Core is not an accurate representation of her actions regarding\u00a0Common Core or the competency-based centralized education system the standards help build from prenatal to career.\u201d \u201cWe have done our \u2018homework,\u2019\u201d the Michigan Common Core opponents respond to DeVos, and they support their claim with more than several observations: Betsy DeVos funds and serves on the board of the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP). DeVos founded GLEP in 2001 and served as chair until 2008; she currently serves as a board member.\u00a0GLEP is a special-interest education political action committee. One of the stated priorities of GLEP is \u201cimplementing\u201d and \u201cmaintaining\u201d Common Core \u201chigh standards\u201d reform.\u00a0The GLEP document \u201cThe Conservative Case for Common Core\u201d clearly articulates their support of Common Core.\u00a0No retraction has been issued.\u00a0Only after President-elect Trump nominated DeVos for Secretary did she attempt to distance herself from the pro-Common Core position of organizations such as GLEP. Betsy DeVos and GLEP are lobbyists for Common Core. DeVos and GLEP lobbied the Michigan legislature to implement and maintain Common Core and related reforms. Former MI State Representative, now State School Board member-elect Tom McMillin, recently spoke to our team about DeVos and her claim that she is against Common Core.\u00a0 McMillin, a strong opponent of Common Core, recalled that in 2013 DeVos specifically told him she was for Common Core during the very contentious legislative debate to stop implementation.\u00a0With the help of DeVos and GLEP, resolution (HR-11) was abruptly passed through the Senate on a voice vote.\u00a0The hasty vote allowed Common Core to continue.\u00a0GLEP publicly applauded the resolution and the continued implementation of Common Core. The Michigan leaders assert that DeVos and GLEP are still seeking to influence elections in their state to help continue the \u201cimplementation of a Common Core-aligned centralized education system.\u201d \u201cCandidates who receive a GLEP endorsement face intense pressure to continue the reforms she desires,\u201d they explain.\u00a0\u201cThose reforms include the continued implementation of Common Core or so-called \u2018high standards,\u2019 accountability, and school choice.\u201d DeVos, who backed Sen. Marco Rubio during the primary, and then served as an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u00a0at the Republican National Convention, was opposed to Trump\u2019s nomination for president, referring to him as an \u201cinterloper\u201d who would never achieve the nomination because he didn\u2019t \u201crepresent the Republican Party.\u201d In the photo below, taken by Tamara Carlone, DeVos is seated at the RNC in July while all others stand to applaud Trump during his acceptance speech:  DeVos said she would not support Trump until he began talking about school choice, which he eventually did. The Michigan leaders write that DeVos shares a view of Common Core that is shared by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: The DeVos definition of school choice is the freedom to choose which Common Core aligned charter school will test and track your child from cradle-to-career. Local and parent control do not exist in DeVos\u2019s education reform model.\u00a0Data and government funding drive the decision.\u00a0In a nutshell, school choice is centralized control to meet the demands of the state and regional business not the dreams of the child.\u00a0If confirmed, DeVos will hire people who share the same vision of common core aligned centralized education system to help her run the Department of Education.\u00a0The exact opposite of his goal to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The Michigan anti-Common Core activists also point to emails they received from GLEP director Gary Naeyaert, who reportedly threatened their group with legal action for tracking whether political candidates in Michigan were supported by GLEP. \u201cLet me be as clear as possible,\u201d the group leaders say Naeyaert wrote to them in an email. \u201cIf you continue to make false statements about [our] organization, you will be hearing from our legal counsel.\u201d The grassroots leaders say that while DeVos released a statement asserting she was \u201ccertainly\u201d not in support of the controversial standards, neither she nor GLEP has reached out to their organization to offer assistance in efforts to repeal Common Core in their state. \u201c[O]ne would think that after fighting us for so long and threatening legal action that either DeVos or Naeyaert would have made some attempt to reach out and let us know they changed their position,\u201d they say. \u201cThey have not.\u201d \u201cIn fact, GLEP\u00a0partnered with pro-Common Core Governor Snyder and others in the Michigan Coalition for Higher Standards to OPPOSE the bills,\u201d they add. \u201cThe bill quickly passed the Senate Education Committee but has not been voted on by the full Senate. We believe that GLEP and the coalition\u2019s opposition to SB 826 is a significant reason it has not passed.\u201d In requesting Trump rescind his nomination of DeVos as education secretary, the group leaders say, \u201cBetsy DeVos\u2019s recent statement against Common Core is insufficient to counter the weight of evidence over many years during which she worked to see Common Core and related reforms implemented in Michigan.\u201d \u201cWe have no confidence that she will stop Common Core at the national level and every reason to believe she will continue to \u2018fill the swamp,\u2019\u201d they conclude. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The president of Hillsdale College\u00a0tells Breitbart News about the importance of getting the federal government out of education and back into the hands of parents and teachers who know their children and students best.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Dr. Larry Arnn explains that because Hillsdale rejects federal funding, it enjoys the freedom to teach its students what they need to know without interference and mandates from the centralized bureaucracy that is the U.S. Department of Education. \u201cFederal monies became available to colleges for general purposes around 1960,\u201d Arnn says. \u201cAnd we started not taking the money back then. By a series of steps they began to offer money directly to colleges and they began to attempt to regulate them more comprehensively.\u201d Rumored to have been among potential nominees for education secretary in the new Trump administration, Arnn explains that Hillsdale \u2013 which was founded in Michigan in 1844 \u2013 would not accept federal funds, a situation that came to a head during the Jimmy Carter administration, when some of the school\u2019s students were given some form of federal aid. Eventually, Hillsdale \u2013 along with some other schools \u2013 received a demand letter from the federal government for compliance with regulations in return for the aid given to their students. \u201cThe threat was a department of education official said, \u2018We\u2019re going to close these colleges down,\u2019\u201d Arnn continues, noting that, in response, Hillsdale sued the department and won the lawsuit in an administrative court. Then-Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare Joseph Califano, however, overturned the administrative judge\u2019s ruling. After a decade of legislation, Hillsdale ultimately lost its argument in the Supreme Court in 1984. The college had already decided, however, that rather than comply with federal demands and unconstitutional regulation, it would replace student federal taxpayer aid with private donations. Arnn explained Hillsdale officials at the time said they \u201cbelieve in the free market, and we don\u2019t want to be a creature of the federal government, and we never have been.\u201d \u201cOver the years, look what\u2019s happened,\u201d Arnn says, \u201cthe regulation of colleges and the regulation of everything else is very comprehensive now.\u201d Asked by Breitbart News about the danger of taxpayer-funded school vouchers bringing in more regulation to private and religious schools, Arnn replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. My position on that is what I understand to be a constitutional position.\u201d Arnn explained a provision in Article 3 of the Northwest Ordinance \u201cgives the biggest subsidy to education that\u2019s ever been given.\u201d In addition to providing the greater part of the land described in the Ordinance for private use, it also provided for a section of land to be used for public purposes for education in each township to be controlled by the states. \u201cSo, that means the founders believed in education and subsidized it,\u201d he states. \u201cBut, the question is how did they do that. The way the schools used to work in America is that they were run in the towns. Giving control of education to people who are a long way off from the process is a bad idea. And that\u2019s what we do now.\u201d \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with public education,\u201d Arnn continues, \u201cbut it shouldn\u2019t be centralized and bureaucratized in the way the whole government has been.\u201d Arnn says he is supportive of charter schools and, in fact, Hillsdale College currently operates 16 nonprofit charter schools around the country that provide a classical education. In 2014, Breitbart News reported on the Hillsdale Barney Charter School Initiative. \u201cWe don\u2019t take any money from those charter schools,\u201d Arnn says, adding: Whatever we do for them we raise or have. But we believe in those schools, we provide the curriculum, and we help their headmasters, we train their teachers, etc. But we only put those charter schools in states where the charter law enables the independence of the school under a local board to run the school as they please. \u201cThe federal charter law, under the new Secretary of Education, should say the contract should allow the schools to have wide latitude to run themselves the way they want,\u201d Arnn says, acknowledging that Betsy DeVos, President-elect Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, is someone he \u201cknows and admires.\u201d \u201cIf you get a charter law like that \u2013 and there are states today where the charter law is very good \u2013 then you can run a charter school under roughly the same terms schools were originally founded under in America,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t object to charter schools if they\u2019re not centralized and bureaucratized.\u201d Breitbart News asked Arnn about states that have experienced difficulties with over-regulation of private and religious schools when vouchers are used and the state demands \u201caccountability\u201d of taxpayer funds, often through outcome measures such as standardized test results \u2013 the same ones required of public schools. \u201cJust remember, of course we have to have a government, and of course we have to have a strong government,\u201d Arnn says. \u201cBut there\u2019s more than one kind of such government. And what we have today is nosy government.\u201d \u201cThe government has the force of law, and the way it should regulate is to leave as much discretion as is possible in the hands of the people actually doing the work,\u201d he asserts, \u201cand that is the parents and the teachers who have much greater reason to care about the education of the kids than anybody in the federal bureaucracy.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric regarding the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, Arnn said Congress could pass a measure to end the department and Trump could sign it. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I think what they should do is something else that will lead to that.\u201d He explains: The way the system works, and remember it is a very significant fact that you can read the Constitution all day long and not find the word \u201ceducation\u201d in there. And yet, in the same summer they were writing the Constitution, Congress passed a law that we know the leading founders all supported reserving land to benefit education. So, we know education was very important to them. And we also know they did not include it in the Constitution. And that\u2019s the reason the federal government doesn\u2019t have direct power to just pass a law and tell everybody the things they have to study. Arnn continued that if DeVos, who is a known proponent of charter schools, is confirmed as the education secretary, she should ensure that states allow charter schools to be run independently under local boards. \u201cWe have to instead pass laws that give general guidance, introduce variety, and let the competition happen,\u201d he suggests, adding that media should then report on the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to fix education, and I think the way you fix it is by introducing the option of doing good schools,\u201d he says. Arnn agrees with the assertion that the new \u201cbipartisan\u201d Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which replaced No Child Left Behind, still provides the education secretary with substantial power over the states\u2019 education policy and standards. \u201cThis will be an opportunity for her [DeVos] to put a system in place for options and establish that for a long time, and then I would make the obvious comment, \u2018What are we even doing here anymore? Let\u2019s get rid of this department,\u2019\u201d he recommends, adding that if the plan goes well, he could foresee the education department being dismantled in five years. \u201cIf Betsy DeVos has a lot of power, then her successor would have that, too,\u201d he observes. \u201cSo, it would be better to get rid of her successor.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) was a guest on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily, where he joined SiriusXM host Matt Boyle in critiquing the legacy media\u2019s coverage of the 2016 election.",
      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " \u201cYou know, I think they\u2019re so openly partisan that I can\u2019t even hardly turn on CNN in the morning, that they\u2019re going on and on about potential conflicts of interest,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNot that they\u2019ve said\u00a0this is a conflict of interest. They just go on and on and on, so it\u2019s clearly a partisan network, and there\u2019s no news.\u201d \u201cDuring the campaign cycle, they must have spent hours of media time talking about how, \u2018No, Donald Trump really wasn\u2019t against the Iraq War because he nodded his head one time during an interview with Howard Stern on a question with the Iraq War,\u2019\u201d Paul recalled. \u201cWhat they missed by doing that, by being so partisan, what they miss is, there really was a substantive difference between Trump and Clinton on the Iraq War, regime change, and nation-building.\u201d He noted that \u201cTrump has reiterated, as recently as in the last week or two\u00a0\u2026 that we don\u2019t have enough money to build nations overseas; we need to rebuild our country.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s talked about infrastructure here, and this is a profound difference between him and Clinton because you know Clinton kept talking about how she was still for regime change in Syria, getting rid of Assad. She was for regime change in Libya, and Trump was opposed to that, but the media \u2013 because they\u2019re so partisan \u2013 never, ever got to that substantial point because they were too busy trying to point out, \u2018Oh, we got Donald Trump because he did say at one time he was for the war.\u2019 When in reality, what made the most difference was that he learned the lesson that the Iraq War was a mistake,\u201d Paul said. He said that Trump \u201cwon on a different kind of message\u201d and hoped Trump would fill his administration with \u201cpeople who are consistent with the kind of message he ran on.\u201d He cited Betsy DeVos as a \u201cgood pick\u201d for secretary of education, and Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) as a good choice for Health and Human Services secretary. Paul said one of Trump\u2019s first tasks should be repealing the \u201cjob-killing regulations\u201d put forward by President Obama, which are \u201cchasing American companies overseas.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see us repeal a hundred regulations in a hundred days, if we could,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these things can be done by executive order because President Obama put them all in place by executive order. So as much as I\u2019m not a fan of a big, powerful presidency, I am a fan of the presidency undoing the power grabs that the previous president did, and I think they will. All the signs we\u2019ve been hearing is that he\u2019s going to be bold and decisive, and that he will get rid of these job-killing regulations.\u201d Paul stressed that \u201clower taxes and less regulations\u201d would be key to making America a competitive business environment and preventing companies from moving jobs overseas. The Senator was humorously frank when Boyle invited him to offer some party-rebuilding advice for the Democrats: \u201cYou know, being a partisan, I hope they keep doing what they\u2019re doing because it certainly isn\u2019t working.\u201d \u201cThey keep re-choosing leaders from decades ago,\u201d he noted. \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s been in charge for decades now. She\u2019s been part of the extreme liberal wing of the Democrat Party that is really the wealthy elite. These people are disconnected from the working class. They probably don\u2019t know anybody that\u2019s ever gotten their hands dirty. If they keep appointing and having their leadership be the wealthy elite, I think their disconnect with the American people will only grow, and hopefully those of us who want more freedom to go back to the individual and to the states, I think we\u2019ll keep winning as long as they keep the old elite guard in place.\u201d Paul said the Republican Party has taken the lead because it has \u201cconnected the working class to the small businessperson, to those who are American business versus people who leave us and go overseas.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always said that that\u2019s when we become the dominant party, and that\u2019s when we connect the worker to the boss, and say, you know what, we\u2019re not going to have a shrinking American pie. We\u2019re not going to have a smaller economy where you have to grab yours before somebody else grabs their share. What we want is an expanding American pie, where workers and business owners and everyone is enjoying a bigger slice of the pie because the economy is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can grow like crazy,\u201d Paul predicted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been limping along under the Obama economy at like maybe 1 percent\u00a0growth, if we\u2019re lucky. If we really do cut taxes, if we cut the corporate income tax and cut the regulatory burden, this economy is ready to really grow and create millions of jobs. So I think you\u2019ll see not only a transformation of the political landscape, but I think we\u2019re poised to see a transformation of our economy, where we could really be a vibrant nation that leads the world in job creation.\u201d He advised his fellow Republicans to be on guard against the \u201cgiddiness\u201d that can come when a single party controls the White House and both houses of Congress, and to remember what the party stands for. \u201cWe are a party that not only believes in lower taxes and less regulation; we\u2019re a party that believes, and says we believe, in balancing the budget,\u201d he noted. \u201cNo matter who proposes it, I\u2019ll continue to be an advocate for balancing the budget. I\u2019ll continue to be somebody \u2013 and I may be alone in this \u2013 but I won\u2019t vote for budgets that never balance. We\u2019re going to have a fight early on in January. People want to repeal Obamacare, and so do I, but I want to repeal it passing a budget that actually is a fiscally conservative budget that balances. Right now, the tussle in the Senate is, people want to pass any old budget, whether it ever balances or not, whether it\u2019s fiscally conservative or not. They just want to get it done because they\u2019re going to then use that to repeal Obamacare.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a physician. I hate Obamacare. I want to do anything we can to get rid of it. But at the same time, I\u2019m not willing to vote for a budget, even if it\u2019s a Republican budget, that never balances and is not fiscally conservative,\u201d Paul declared.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Bush said last week at the National Summit on Education Reform, sponsored by the\u00a0Foundation for Excellence in Education, which Bush founded and chairs and on which DeVos serves as a board member. \u201cPresident-elect Trump made an extraordinary choice with Betsy DeVos,\u201d he added, reports the SunSentinel. In his address at the summit, Bush, a strong proponent of Common Core and school vouchers, discussed the importance of taking a moral stand on school choice. The former GOP candidate did the same for amnesty for illegal immigrants when he described crossing the U.S. border illegally as an \u201cact of love.\u201d \u201cPolitically, the challenge in this really kind of crude environment is to go beyond being against what\u2019s not working and being for things that will work, that will lift people up,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I tried that and totally failed, miserably. I mean, like, belly flop \u2014 bam.\u201d Upon DeVos\u2019 nomination, Bush said, \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms.\u201d At Townhall, American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins writes that Trump\u2019s choice of DeVos to run the federal education department could even be viewed as \u201cJeb\u2019s revenge.\u201d Robbins continues: Jeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \u201cgovernment-foundation cartel\u201d model of educational policy-making. Private foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals. The government relies on \u201cresearch\u201d funded by these foundations to support the preferred policies, and if Congress or state legislatures are involved, their members are assured these ideas are terrific because of all this research. Even the new \u201cbipartisan\u201d education law \u2013 the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u2013 pushed through Congress by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), will provide DeVos, if confirmed, with continued power to manage the nation\u2019s schools and students. Robbins notes ESSA \u201censhrines the progressive-education agenda of national standards, workforce development, competency-based education (the modern term for discredited outcome-based education), digital training, government preschool, and non-academic \u2018social emotional learning.\u2019\u201d Though, upon her nomination, DeVos quickly dismissed any notion that she has been supportive of Common Core, her statement that she calls for \u201chigh standards\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d are \u201csleight of hand\u201d words that describe the unpopular nationalized standards, says Robbins. Grassroots Common Core opponents in DeVos\u2019 home state of Michigan also noted\u00a0the philanthropist had never contacted them to ask how she might assist them in their efforts to repeal Common Core in their state. Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core while on the campaign trail, referring to it as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He also said he would work to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement following the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos has contributed both her wealth and influence to the creation of more charter schools in her home state of Michigan, but national test scores show the state has not fared well as a result, says a report in Politico.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The report, published Friday, says, \u201cDespite two decades of charter-school growth, the state\u2019s overall academic progress has failed to keep pace with other states.\u201d It continues: Michigan ranks near the bottom for fourth- and eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading on a nationally representative test, nicknamed the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card.\u201d Notably, the state\u2019s charter schools scored worse on that test than their traditional public-school counterparts, according to an analysis of federal data. MI NAEP by Breitbart News on Scribd  From 2009 to 2015, for example, Michigan\u2019s state average score on the NAEP mathematics assessment was below the national public school average, and from 2003 to 2007, the state\u2019s average score was \u201cnot significantly different from the national public school average.\u201d Michigan fared better in math on the Nation\u2019s Report Card from 1996 to 2000. DeVos\u2019 supporters, however, point to research from Stanford University\u2019s CREDO, which scrutinizes education reform and student performance: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows that, on average, students in Michigan charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. Thirty-five percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while two percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, forty-two percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and six percent perform worse. These findings position Michigan among the highest performing charter school states CREDO has studied to date. Charter students in the city of Detroit (27% of the state\u2019s charter students), are performing even better than their peers in the rest of the state, on average gaining nearly three months achievement for each year they attend charter schools. Despite the \u201cthree months achievement\u201d progress in Michigan, it is noteworthy to look at CREDO\u2019s assessment of charter schools in Massachusetts, which rate the highest in the nation: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows on average that students in Massachusetts charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. At the school level, 44 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while 13 percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, 56 percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and 17 percent perform worse. The impact of charter schools in Boston are also analyzed separately. Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in TPS, the analysis shows on average that students in Boston charter schools have significantly larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. In fact, the average growth rate of Boston charter students in math and reading is the largest CREDO has seen in any city or state thus far. At the school level, 83 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading and math, while no Boston charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. What we can learn from this is that there are good charter schools and bad charter schools, just as there are good public schools and bad ones. States should be able\u00a0to make a difference in the quality of their schools. The Politico report then moves to the issue of school vouchers, which is a totally different issue. School vouchers are the transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to a private or religious school. Most on the left who oppose DeVos \u2013 particularly teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 do so for several reasons, not the least of which is the claim that vouchers will suck taxpayer funds from traditional public schools and destroy them. Some on the other side say public schools are already destroyed, despite billions of taxpayer dollars poured into them over the past several decades in the name of \u201ceducation reform\u201d and \u201cclosing the achievement gap.\u201d Additionally, however, the left takes significant issue with public money going to religious schools. Grassroots constitutionalists, who have been fighting against establishment Republicans and Democrats over federal intrusion into education through Common Core, know that school vouchers, as a means to bring about \u201cschool choice,\u201d are associated with the greatest amount of regulation for the private and religious schools that agree to accept them. In some states with hefty voucher systems, private and religious schools that accept vouchers have been forced to use the same Common Core standards and have their students take the same Common Core-aligned tests as their counterparts in the public schools. This is done in the name of \u201caccountability\u201d for use of public money. This situation, however, begs the question, \u201cWhy bother, then, to move a child from a public school to a private school?\u201d Neal McCluskey, education director at Cato Institute, says his concern about DeVos is that she will attempt to direct \u201cschool choice\u201d from Washington, D.C. At a time when most grassroots parents groups across the country had hoped to find a Trump administration finally getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, DeVos could still be running the show from D.C. \u2013 though from a different angle. \u201cEven though choice is great, it is not something people should want Washington providing,\u201d McCluskey, said in an interview with Caffeinated Thoughts. He added: Nor\u2014outside of the DC voucher program, military families, and maybe Native American reservations\u2014is it something that the feds can constitutionally provide. My fear is that DeVos and Trump might not recognize the myriad problems with taking private school choice national. More concerning, the American Federation for Children, which DeVos chairs, has tended to favor more rules and regulations on choice than I would prefer. That could become a much bigger concern were rules and regs attached to national-level vouchers. Writing at the American Spectator, Robert Holland of the Heartland Institute echoes that same concern: Although the Constitution empowers the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of laws, it does not provide for Congress, the White House, or federal agencies to control education by statute or regulation. Under the Tenth Amendment, sway over education is left to the states and to the people. The strongest step the Trump Administration could take on behalf of real choice in education would be to devise a plan for dismantling or phasing out the U.S. Education Department (USED), which came into being in 1980 as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s payoff to the largest teacher union, the National Education Association, for supporting his election campaign. USED has done nothing but impede educational progress with senseless No Child Left Behind edicts and costly Race to the Top boondoggles. Finally, Oklahoma parent activist Jenni White writes about DeVos\u2019 nomination that school vouchers are only part of the problem. \u201cPart of the reason we fought so hard against Common Core was the seepage of its tentacles into every nook and cranny of the education world \u2013 including source materials,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no such thing as \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2013including those using traditional education methods such as homeschool \u2013 when federal policy is allowed to dictate state education function.\u201d",

      "content": " Trump\u2019s pick is the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and one of the party\u2019s most influential donors. DeVos is a proponent of charter schools and school vouchers. \u201cIn deference to the U.S. Senate confirmation, I\u2019m not giving interviews, but just between us let me share this,\u201d DeVos said to the crowd, speaking from prepared remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make education great again in this country.\u201d Mlive.com reports DeVos initially had planned to skip Trump\u2019s stop in Grand Rapids. The report states: DeVos family spokesman John Truscott said earlier this week that preparing for those hearings would keep her too busy to attend Friday\u2019s event. But only a day later, Truscott said her attendance at the event was more uncertain. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of up in the air,\u201d Truscott said on Wednesday, Dec. 7. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. But nothing is set in stone.\u201d But on the afternoon of the event, Truscott confirmed that both Betsy and Dick DeVos would be attending alongside Dick\u2019s parents, Richard and Helen DeVos. During her address, DeVos charged the media with spreading \u201cfalse news\u201d about her. \u201cAll I ask for is an open mind and the opportunity to share my heart,\u201d she said to those in attendance. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in education issues for 28 years, as an activist, a citizen-volunteer and an advocate for children.\u201d DeVos told the crowd it was time to put \u201ckids first every single day.\u201d She added, \u201cThis means expanding choices and options to give every child the opportunity for a quality education regardless of their zip code or their family circumstances. This means letting states set their own high standards and finally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d DeVos said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be Washington, D.C. that unlocks that potential\u201d in each child, and continued: It won\u2019t be a giant bureaucracy or a federal department. Nope. The answer isn\u2019t bigger government. The answer is local control. It\u2019s listening to parents and it\u2019s giving more choices. And if I\u2019m fortunate enough to be confirmed as your secretary of education, our kids, your kids will have someone fighting for them every single day. Prior to introducing DeVos, Trump said the choice of education secretary was one of his \u201cmost important decisions,\u201d and that DeVos was one of the \u201ctop education reformers in our nation, someone\u2026who has devoted decades to helping disadvantaged students.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to reform our broken education system to put students and families first,\u201d he said. Trump added his administration\u2019s \u201creform plan includes eliminating Common Core, bringing education local, and providing school choice.\u201d He continued that all children should be \u201cable to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, or religious school that is right for them.\u201d DeVos was not a supporter of Trump until he began raising the issue of school choice on the campaign trail. A member of the board of directors of Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education, DeVos brought her support to Sen. Marco Rubio once Bush exited the primary race. At the Republican National Convention in July, she was an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Ultimately, according to the Washington Post, DeVos and her family donated a total of $1.8 million to the Republican Party and the Trump campaign.",

      "content": " \u201cParents, educators, and grassroots activists across the state of Michigan know exactly who DeVos is and her position on Common Core,\u201d Karen Braun tells Breitbart News the day after DeVos joined Trump in Grand Rapids at a \u201cThank You\u201d tour stop in her state. \u201cWe\u2019re not fooled by a single, carefully parsed statement on a webpage that she is \u2018not a supporter \u2013 period,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the truth.\u00a0We experienced it first hand.\u00a0So have many Michigan lawmakers; but for some reason they continue to stay silent and give DeVos a complete pass. Loyalty to DeVos trumps loyalty to the truth, apparently.\u201d DeVos told the crowd at the rally that \u201cmaking education great again\u201d means \u201cfinally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d But Michigan Common Core opponents want to know when she will come to the aid of parents and educators who have been trying to repeal the standards in her own state. An advocate primarily of school choice and school vouchers, DeVos said that putting \u201ckids first\u201d means \u201cexpanding choices and options to give every child the opportunity for a quality education regardless of their zip code or their family circumstances.\u201d \u201cThis means letting states set their own high standards and finally putting an end to the federalized Common Core,\u201d she added. Braun responds: DeVos\u2019 parsing on Common Core is going to become harder to maintain the more she speaks on education\u2026[Her] use of the qualifier \u201cfederalized\u201d is telling.\u00a0DeVos likely believes Common Core is a high standard and a quality choice for states; otherwise she would be with us at Stop Common Core in Michigan, fighting it to get it out, and replacing it with the pre-Common Core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0She\u2019s not. Neither is GLEP [Great Lakes Education Project.]\u00a0GLEP opposes SB 826 through their partnership with the Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards. DeVos has funded and served on the board of GLEP, an organization that promotes school choice and is a supporter of Common Core. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013. DeVos\u2019 website says she was chairman of the GLEP board from 2001-2008, and has remained a board member since then. Yet, upon her nomination as education secretary, DeVos launched a new website, and noted immediately, \u201cCertainly. I am not a supporter\u201d of Common Core. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Braun explains to Breitbart News how DeVos\u2019 vision of education reform intersects \u201cschool choice\u201d with \u201cCommon Core.\u201d \u201cIn a DeVos system of \u2018choice,\u2019 parents will choose WHERE their child is educated but WHAT they are taught is not up to them,\u201d Braun continues, quoting from a report from the American Federation for Children,\u00a0on which DeVos has served as a board member since 2008 and has been its chairman since 2009. \u201cThrough educational choice, parents are empowered with the ability to choose the environment\u2014whether it is a traditional public school, charter school, private school, virtual school, home school or blended learning\u2014that best suits their children\u2019s needs,\u201d the report read. \u201cThat\u2019s not true choice and will result in the destruction of educational freedom for all parents,\u201d Braun states. Braun\u2019s assertion is shared by many homeschoolers as well. In May of 2015, Breitbart News featured comments from homeschooling parents across the country who reject the idea of school vouchers, the transfer of taxpayer funds from public schools to private, religious, or even homeschools. In January of 2015, the Wisconsin Parents\u2019 Association, a grassroots homeschooling organization, expressed its adamant opposition to school vouchers for homeschoolers in an open letter: Programs that give public moneys to homeschoolers would undermine our freedom to homeschool, as would legislation that attempts to guarantee our rights and freedoms. Government \u201cfavors\u201d would require that homeschools be accountable to the government, which would make homeschools more like public schools. Our goal is to make your job as easy as possible and our homeschooling as successful as possible. No new homeschooling legislation is needed, and essentially any legislation would have drawbacks and risks. \u201cParents already have rights and responsibilities,\u201d continued WPA. \u201cThey come from God or nature, not the government. Proposals that supposedly guarantee parental rights backfire because they give the government a way to define and control fundamental rights.\u201d Tina Hollenbeck, a homeschooling parent in Wisconsin, underscores that sentiment for Breitbart News: It\u2019s really imperative that homeschoolers remember there is never, ever, ever a \u201cfree lunch.\u201d In other words, the offer of vouchers for homeschoolers is a Trojan horse and will \u2013 at some point by someone \u2013 undoubtedly result in increased regulation that will steal parents\u2019 academic freedom. This already happens in private religious schools that take voucher students \u2013 i.e., bureaucrats require that \u201cparochial\u201d content in such schools be removed from instruction \u2013 and there is no reason to believe that similar restrictions would not be strongly enforced on homeschoolers, too. We should not be fooled. Our parental freedom to educate our children according to our own convictions is worth far more than the bowl of pottage represented by voucher dollars. Braun says that she has been in touch with parent activists in Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and other states, who know well how influential and wealthy special interests like the DeVos family and their funded organizations have\u00a0blocked efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cThey all have the same sentiment, that DeVos is not against Common Core and has done nothing to help our state remove it,\u201d she says, and adds: SB 826, I\u2019m told,\u00a0is dead. No one wants to touch it.\u00a0State Senate Majority Leader Meekhof will not move it. DeVos through GLEP will make sure of it.\u00a0Or it will be so watered down so we have a bill that pro-Common Core Gov. Rick Snyder will sign.\u00a0A bill that he will sign is a bad bill and does nothing. Braun notes the companion bill in the state House \u2013 HB 5444 \u2013 could be reintroduced in January. \u201cBut unless there are a few more people willing to cross DeVos, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going anywhere,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cHB 5444 is sponsored by Rep. Gary Glenn who I believe is principled and against Common Core. But will he be able to break through the loyalty so many in Lansing have for the DeVos machine?\u00a0I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d \u201cThe fact that so many lawmakers in Lansing know the truth about DeVos and are giving her a pass tells me it is an uphill battle,\u201d she concludes.",

      "content": " Education Week writer Mark Walsh recently observed DeVos \u201chas a friend\u201d in Brown, who founded education news site The 74. He adds DeVos\u2019 selection puts Brown in \u201can awkward position\u201d in that The 74 is advertised as an independent education news site. Brown herself, however, advocates for school choice and charter schools \u2013 exactly the main causes DeVos espouses. The disclaimer on Brown\u2019s site reads as follows: The Dick & Betsy DeVos Family Foundation provides funding to The 74, and the site\u2019s Editor-in-Chief, Campbell Brown, sits on the American Federation for Children\u2019s board of directors, which was formerly chaired by Betsy DeVos. Brown played no part in the reporting or editing of this article. The American Federation for Children also sponsored The 74\u2019s 2015 New Hampshire education summit. In a recent column at The 74, Brown writes: Social media attacks aren\u2019t famous for accuracy, but it\u2019s a pity that Betsy DeVos has been so misleadingly caricatured since Donald Trump asked her to serve as secretary of education last week. Not just because she\u2019s a friend. Also because her attackers needlessly reopen late-NCLB fault lines and deepen the clamor that follows Trump everywhere. Brown adds that DeVos will work hard at \u201cpushing to improve whatever model is working \u2014 traditional or charter or voucher or something we haven\u2019t yet imagined.\u201d In February of 2015, Brown penned a column at the Washington Post in which she defended former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the Common Core standards. Brown wrote: Meanwhile, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has become a target for standing by Common Core as a voluntary minimum level of rigor for all states. His message to governors: Go ahead and set your own standards if you want; just make them at least as rigorous. \u2026 Let\u2019s be clear about what Common Core is. It spells out what students should know at the end of each grade. The goal is to ensure that our students are sound in math and literacy and that our schools have some basic consistency nationwide. But the standards do not dictate a national curriculum, and teachers are not told how or what to teach. Heather Crossin, co-founder of Hoosiers Against Common Core, responded to Breitbart News about Brown\u2019s remarks at the time: Campbell Brown makes the same, tired mistakes so many out of touch reporters and politicians do \u2014 wishfully dismissing the complaints of tens of thousands of parents across the country as being politically motivated or the result of misinformation. Politicians who turn such a blind eye to the fierce and growing band of parents opposing Common Core, as Brown would have them do, do so at their own peril. Bush\u2019s decision to exit the GOP primary race had much to do with conservatives\u2019 ire over his continued propping up of Common Core, as well as his soft approach to illegal immigration. Upon her nomination as secretary of education, DeVos herself denied she supports Common Core, though the organizations she has funded and served as either a board member or chairman have promoted the controversial standards. Joining President-elect Donald Trump at a \u201cThank You\u201d tour rally in her home state of Michigan last week, DeVos said in prepared remarks she would be \u201cfinally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d However, in another recent article at The 74, Allison Crean Davis, a senior advisor at Bellwether Education Partners, bemoans, \u201cPromising, well-intended initiatives, like the Common Core Standards, burn and struggle to survive even before there is a shared understanding of their potential, much less evidence of their impact.\u201d Davis continues in support as well of the integration of social emotional learning (SEL) into schools and criticizes Federalist writers Jane Robbins and Karen Effrem for their warning about the dangers of including psychological learning as part of the curriculum children are exposed to at school. Davis writes: This article is the journalistic equivalent of yelling \u201cfire\u201d in a theater, designed to have folks crawling across the floor to the nearest exit. It\u2019s as if the authors are saying: Don\u2019t think. There\u2019s danger. Escape! To which I say: Calm down. Harness one of the \u201csubjective\u201d social emotional skills in question, self-management. Instead of panicking, work to understand the rationale behind the push for more social emotional learning in schools and how the still-emerging science presents some limits to the work. Characterizing the inclusion of SEL into curriculum as another \u201cmarch of science,\u201d Davis encourages the \u201cexploration of the value of social emotional characteristics in schools.\u201d Robbins and Effrem, who assert the teaching of social and emotional qualities belongs not to the government, but firmly to parents who may be assisted by faith communities, respond: Davis is firmly in the \u201cgovernment\u201d camp. (So are the pro-Common Core and pro-SEL organizations working with her employer, Bellwether Education Partners, such as the Philanthropy Roundtable\u2014chaired by Betsy DeVos\u2014the Gates Foundation, and Jeb Bush\u2019s ExcelinEd.) Her article mentions parents only once, in connection with paraphrasing and dismissing our arguments. Instead, she emphasizes the need to focus on \u201cscience\u201d uber alles. Robbins, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, explains further at Townhall how philanthropists often support private foundations that fund \u201cscientific\u201d research that promotes their ideas. \u201cJeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \u2018government-foundation cartel\u2019 model of educational policy-making,\u201d she writes. \u201cPrivate foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals.\u201d While Robbins notes Congress or state lawmakers may rely on \u201cresearch\u201d funded by such foundations to make policy decisions, she also observes that often the actual decisions are made by the administrative state, i.e., unelected federal and state executive agencies.\u00a0This state of affairs explains\u00a0why so many parents and citizens want to see the U.S. Department of Education eliminated. \u201cThis process neatly excises the American public from education policy and ensures that children will be guinea pigs for elitist experimentation,\u201d Robbins says.",

      "content": " Doug Ross, also a former Democratic state senator from DeVos\u2019 home state of Michigan, said in an interview with WJR AM 760 in Detroit that the nominee\u00a0\u201cclearly cares about children and their education,\u201d displays a \u201cmoral commitment to make sure that low-income children have equal opportunity,\u201d and that she is \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d \u201cI mean she worked for some years with Jeb Bush on making sure we have really high internationally competitive performance standards for kids,\u201d Ross said, \u201cand she constantly is talking to different people in the education field so she\u2019s both committed to children and their education and she\u2019s knowledgeable and philosophically she\u2019s very consistent I think with where the front administration is.\u201d Many politicians have learned to avoid using the words \u201cCommon Core\u201d because of their political \u201ctoxicity.\u201d Instead, they frequently use phrases such \u201chigh\u201d or \u201crigorous standards,\u201d and \u201caccountability,\u201d to refer to Common Core. Grassroots parent activists who have been battling the Core in their states, however, say they have learned the meaning of these other terms as well. Upon her nomination as secretary of education, DeVos herself denied she supports Common Core, stating, \u201cCertainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period.\u00a0I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control.\u201d The organizations she has funded and served as either a board member or chairman, however, have promoted the controversial standards, including Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education, referenced by Ross. Ohio parent activist Heidi Huber observes to Breitbart News that Ross clearly \u201cconsiders DeVos\u2019 work with Jeb Bush as a top qualification.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Ross must have missed news of the really low international performance of the first Common Core generation,\u201d Huber states, and continues: Per the recently released TIMSS and PISA reports, American students are losing ground against their international peers since the introduction of the Common Core standards. Just a small application of discernment by the Trump transition team should disqualify anyone involved in this education reform disaster, much less a known leader and financier, from serving in the \u201cNo Common Core\u201d promised administration. The question that begs to be answered, \u201cWho would care what Betsy DeVos\u2019 opinions were on education if she wasn\u2019t a billionaire who could bankroll her supporters\u2019 special interests and think tanks?\u201d Louisiana parent activist Sara Wood notes to Breitbart News as well, \u201cCommon Core was never proven to be international or competitive.\u201d Wood states: As a parent, I would like to know what on earth qualifies DeVos with the knowledge required to develop \u201cinternationally competitive performance standards\u201d that were \u201cvoluntarily\u201d forced on all students of this nation, as we are experiencing with the disastrous Common Core? DeVos\u2019 resume seems more filled with experience in writing donor checks and in obtaining fancy board memberships, as a result of those donations, than anything that would qualify her to run the U.S. Department of Education or to develop standards for anything, least of all education. Wood says the choice of DeVos is disturbing to the thousands of parents who have been fighting the establishment elites and big business and industry groups that support Common Core: All of this should unsettle anyone who has been fighting the Common Core, not just as damaging standards, but as a Trojan horse disguising and distracting from the entire initiative to centralize education in America, leaving no choice but the choice of educating children to the lowest common denominator. Concerned citizens, like myself, who supported Trump because of his promise to get rid of Common Core and restore local control of education, should be alarmed by this decision. Praises from the likes of Ross and Jeb Bush only puts us on notice that those promises are in jeopardy and that the battle for the minds of our children is far from over. New Hampshire education activist with Cornerstone Ann Marie Banfield also recognizes the Common Core references in Ross\u2019 responses. \u201cHe referenced her working on high, internationally competitive performance standards in collaboration with Jeb Bush,\u201d she tells Breitbart News. \u201cWhat high performing countries, do the Common Core Standards align to?\u00a0I asked this question directly to Marc Tucker \u2013 one of the chief architects of Common Core when he came to New Hampshire \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t name one.\u201d Banfield continues: How are we supposed to have confidence in a person who worked against parents fighting for better quality standards for their children? Common Core is a complete redesign of public education in America. DeVos hasn\u2019t mentioned the data-mining on students or the dumbed down competency based workforce training model that is eroding academic content in our local schools. Any person appointed to the U.S. Department of Education should offer a detailed plan to undo the failed Obama education reforms. Instead we received a brief statement from DeVos stating she opposes Common Core. That contradicts her position on Common Core in the past. The endorsements by Jeb Bush and former Clinton official Ross offer opponents of Common Core no real assurance that anything will improve. It actually makes me even more convinced this was the wrong choice. Joining President-elect Donald Trump at a \u201cThank You\u201d tour rally in her home state of Michigan last week, DeVos said in prepared remarks she would be \u201cfinally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d \u201cDeVos\u2019 parsing on Common Core is going to become harder to maintain the more she speaks on education\u2026[her] use of the qualifier \u2018federalized\u2019 is telling,\u201d\u00a0Karen Braun, who writes at Stop Common Core in Michigan, says. \u201cDeVos likely believes Common Core is a high standard and a quality choice for states; otherwise she would be with us at Stop Common Core in Michigan, fighting it to get it out, and replacing it with the pre-Common Core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0She\u2019s not.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "New Mexico\u2019s secretary of education is reportedly being considered for a top post in the Trump administration\u2019s Education Department.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " A report in Politico Friday suggests the former Florida deputy education commissioner under Gov. Jeb Bush, Hanna Skandera, is being considered for education deputy secretary. Skandera was also a senior policy adviser and deputy chief of staff at the education department under former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, who served under President George W. Bush. Like Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards and head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core. \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s progress has been good overall, particularly among districts that embrace reform,\u201d Skandera said, according to the Albuquerque Journal.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged. On all measures, we are seeing the improvements.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump vowed to get rid of Common Core, which he frequently described as a \u201cdisaster\u201d while on the campaign trail. He also said he would dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Though his education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core \u2013 including Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education \u2013 since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards. At a rally with Trump in Michigan, she added\u00a0it was time to \u201cput an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d Upon DeVos\u2019 nomination, KOB4 in Albuquerque reported Skandera praised Trump\u2019s pick, saying that while she did not know her well, she believed DeVos\u2019 policies would not change Common Core in New Mexico. Jeb Bush responded to DeVos\u2019 nomination by saying\u00a0she was an \u201cextraordinary choice\u201d and exclaiming,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d The Politico report also indicated that former Louisiana Superintendent Paul Pastorek is under consideration for the post of general counsel with the DeVos Education Department. Pastorek is also closely associated with Common Core consortium PARCC. According to the report: He has held a number of education reform leadership positions, serving as co-executive director of The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, for example. Pastorek helped found the PARCC consortium and he\u2019s chairman of PARCC Inc.\u2019s board of directors. And \u2014 perhaps most importantly for this job \u2014 he has had a long legal career, and was appointed as general counsel to NASA in 2002. Education Week reports that other staffers for President Bush and former Gov. Jeb Bush are assisting Trump\u2019s education team with the transition. \u201cThese folks could just be helping the Trump team get up to speed on policy, choose staff, or brainstorm its early proposals,\u201d Education Week observes. \u201cBut some of them could also end up filling the ranks at the education department, which will need to hire 150 political appointees.\u201d Names included as Trump education team helpers are: Josh Venable, who \u2013 like DeVos \u2013 worked with Jeb Bush at his foundation, and Lauren Maddox, an assistant secretary for communications in the Education Department under George W. Bush, and currently a principal at the Podesta Group, an organization founded by Tony Podesta, the brother of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta. Terrell Halaksa, who served as an assistant secretary in the George W. Bush Education Department, is also reportedly assisting the Trump education team, as are Rob Goad, a staffer for Indiana Rep. Luke Messer, who is reportedly leading the education transition. Townsend McNitt is reportedly advising DeVos as she tours Capitol Hill. McNitt served as a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush Education Department, where she helped implement No Child Left Behind. Since then, she has been working as a \u201cstrategic consultant,\u201d and, in 2011, worked for Chiefs for Change, another of Jeb Bush\u2019s education organizations and an offshoot of his foundation that consists of key state education chiefs.",

      "subtitle": "As a former governor who has fought on the front lines for lower taxes, stronger borders and less government waste, I know what it means to fight on principle for the conservative values that make America great. That is why I am surprised to see some in our movement now questioning the conservative bona fides of Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as the next U.S. Secretary of Education.",
      "author": "Gov. Jan Brewer",
      "content": " No conservative in America has done more to promote school choice than Ms. DeVos. For the past 28 years, she has been a tireless and passionate advocate for policies that give parents more control over their children\u2019s educations. Ms. DeVos has taken on the\u00a0nation\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions in dozens of state capitals to promote education reforms that put the best interests of children ahead of the bureaucrats who dominate the education establishment in America. Most importantly, she will help President-elect Trump drain the swamp in Washington by sending control of our K-12 education system from Washington back to state and local decision makers. Ms. DeVos is a proponent of rigorous academic standards, and she believes those standards should be decided at the local level without federal interference. Some pot-stirrers purposely conflate any and all support for high standards with the Washington overreach\u00a0that occurred six years around Common Core State Standards. But the fact is the federal government today is prohibited from encouraging or coercing states to adopt any specific set of academic standards. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has been the law\u00a0of the land since 2015; its enactment effectively put an end to Common Core. If anyone still has questions about Ms. DeVos\u2019 commitment to pursuing conservative education reforms, I would ask them to consider the thunderous opposition her nomination is receiving from the political Left. The nation\u2019s teachers unions, their allies in the\u00a0media, and the national Democrat Party have attacked Ms. DeVos repeatedly for her efforts to give children the right to attend high-performing charter and private schools. Liberals have even attempted to vilify Ms. DeVos for being a Christian who is guided\u00a0by her faith, and they have ridiculously questioned her qualifications for the job, even though she has been on the frontlines, fighting for conservative education reforms for nearly three decades. The reality is there is no stronger conservative in America who is better prepared to usher in the education reforms required to equip our kids with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in the modern economy than Betsy DeVos. President-elect Trump\u00a0has made an inspired choice for Secretary of Education. Ms. DeVos is a strong conservative with an impeccable record of taking on liberal special interest groups and powerful unions to give kids the educations they deserve. I am confident she will work hand-in-hand\u00a0with Donald Trump to raise the bar on education, increase parental control in our schools and promote real choice in education that allows children greater access to private schools, while preserving the rights of parents to homeschool. I strongly urge the U.S. Senate to confirm one of the strongest and most dedicated conservatives I have known. Betsy DeVos will take on entrenched liberal special interests at every turn to advance a conservative education reform agenda that is rooted in an\u00a0unwavering commitment to always do what\u2019s best for children, especially at-risk students who have too often been failed by an unresponsive bureaucracy and the excuses of teachers\u2019 unions who care more about the job security of adults than the futures of the\u00a0children they are paid to educate. Jan Brewer is the former Governor of Arizona.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Dan Guernsey, who co-authored a Pioneer Institute/American Principles Project (APP) study titled \u201cAfter the Fall: Catholic Education Beyond the Common Core,\u201d said in an interview with National Catholic Register that he is skeptical of Trump pick Betsy DeVos. \u201cHer position seems to be that Common Core seemed like a good idea at the time, but that, according to her statement, \u2018along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle,\u2019\u201d Guernsey said. \u201cThis is the default position of virtually all former and even current Common Core supporters, including Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.\u201d \u201cHer position should have been from the start: Do not let the national government, businessmen, bureaucrats and billionaires (she now represents all four of these) design a national education program, and let the states decide on their own,\u201d he asserted. Though DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core \u2013 including Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education \u2013 upon her nomination, she launched a new website and said this about Common Core: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that\u2019s not my position. Sometimes it\u2019s not just students who need to do their homework. However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle. The Cardinal Newman Society is a vocal opponent of the Common Core standards in Catholic schools. In his column at the Newman Society, Matt Archbold writes, \u201cAs Catholics, we welcome all converts. Let\u2019s hope DeVos\u2019 conversion away from Common Core is genuine.\u201d \u201cAnd, to be clear, Common Core didn\u2019t get boondoggled along the way,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt was a federally supported bureaucratic know-it-all one size fits all boondoggle from the beginning.\u201d In \u201cAfter the Fall,\u201d co-authors Guernsey, Providence College professor Anthony Esolen, APP senior fellow Jane Robbins, and Boston University professor emeritus of education Kevin Ryan, write, \u201c[T]he Common Core is undoubtedly and unacceptably workforce-oriented, thereby misinforming student character and impoverishing academic content.\u201d The authors continue: At the heart of the Common Core agenda is a century-old dream of Progressive educators to redirect education\u2019s mission away from engaging the young in the best of human thought and focusing instead on preparation for \u201creal life.\u201d While a reasonable but quite secondary goal, workforce-development is dwarfed by Catholic schools\u2019 transcendent goals of human excellence, spiritual transformation, and preparation for \u201cthe next life\u201d as well. Noted Catholic educator and Notre Dame law professor Gerard Bradley also recently\u00a0wrote, \u201cIt is time to refocus President Trump\u2019s attention upon Common Core and persuade him to ignite a national movement to roll it back.\u201d \u201cThe stated objective of Common Core is to produce \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 high school graduates,\u201d Bradley continued. \u201cYet even its proponents concede that it only prepares students for community-college level work. In truth, Common Core is a dramatic reduction of the nature and purpose of education to mere workforce preparation.\u201d Bradley led some 130 Catholic scholars in a letter to the United States Catholic bishops, urging that they abandon implementation of the Common Core in Catholic dioceses. The letter asserted that Common Core does \u201ca grave disservice to Catholic education\u201d and is \u201ccontrary to tradition and academic studies on reading and human formation.\u201d Describing Common Core as \u201cso deeply flawed,\u201d the scholars continued: Promoters of Common Core say that it is designed to make America\u2019s children\u00a0\u201ccollege and career ready.\u201d We instead judge Common Core to be a recipe for\u00a0standardized workforce preparation. Common Core shortchanges the central goals of all\u00a0sound education and surely those of Catholic education: to grow in the virtues necessary\u00a0to know, love, and serve the Lord, to mature into a responsible, flourishing adult, and to\u00a0contribute as a citizen to the process of responsible democratic self-government. \u201cThe contrast between a sound Catholic education and Common Core could scarcely be sharper,\u201d Bradley wrote. Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core, which he frequently described as a \u201cdisaster\u201d while on the campaign trail, and criticized Jeb Bush for his support of the controversial reform. He also said he might cut the U.S. Department of Education.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Jim Barrett writes in a column at the Lansing State Journal that the national media is spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about DeVos and that he is \u201chere to set the record straight\u201d about her. \u201cFor nearly 30 years, Betsy DeVos has been leading the charge for expanded choice, improved quality and enhanced accountability in education,\u201d he continues. Barrett now chairs the board of the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) \u2013 a pro-school choice organization that DeVos has funded and served as a board member. Both the Chamber of Commerce and GLEP have promoted the Common Core standards. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013. DeVos\u2019 website says she was chairman of the GLEP board from 2001-2008, and has remained a board member since then. Upon her nomination as education secretary, DeVos stated immediately, \u201cI am not a supporter\u201d of Common Core. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Barrett continues his defense of DeVos: On accountability, Betsy DeVos and GLEP have been pushing for a simple A-F letter grading system to use for school accountability, so that parents receive meaningful information about school performance in order to make informed school choice decisions. We support local control, but also believe failing schools should get better or be closed. Period. He points out as well that DeVos and GLEP promoted Democrat Gov. Jennifer Granholm\u2019s \u201cMichigan Merit Curriculum.\u201d \u201cWe continue to defend and support high standards and high expectations for all students,\u201d he adds. Karen Braun, a member of the leadership team at Stop Common Core in Michigan tells Breitbart News, \u201cA quick read of this statement might make most nod their heads and say, \u2018DeVos and GLEP support local control.\u2019\u00a0Not so fast.\u201d Braun refers to DeVos\u2019 statement at a Michigan rally with Trump that it is time to \u201cput an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d \u201cLike Betsy DeVos stating she is against \u2018federalized\u2019 Common Core, Barrett works in a caveat that gives insight into what DeVos actually believes about local control,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cHe adds,\u00a0\u2018failing schools should get better or close. Period.\u2019\u201d Braun continues: Failing by what standard of measure?\u00a0What are the A-F grades based upon?\u00a0The new ESSA [federal education law] requires accountability in areas that include more than just student performance measures based on common national standards. They would also include social emotional learning or so called \u201csoft skills\u201d that they believe determine success.\u00a0Things like grit, tenacity, gratitude, enthusiasm, and the culture of the school would all be measured and factored into the career readiness of the student and the letter grade of the school. The students and school that measure up get to move on or stay open; those that don\u2019t shut down. \u201cDeVos, Barrett, and GLEP do not support local control but a new model of education,\u201d Braun warns.\u201d It is a centralized competency-based education system for workforce development \u2013 which kills creativity and destroys local and parent control.\u201d \u201cBig data \u2013 not parents \u2013 drive the decisions and the direction of their student\u2019s future,\u201d she concludes.\u00a0\u201cIt is a system to meet the demands of the state and the workforce, but leaves the dreams of the child out in the cold.\u201d Recently, the Boston-based Pioneer Institute and the Washington D.C.-based American Principles Project published a study, titled \u201cAfter the Fall: Catholic Education Beyond the Common Core.\u201d The paper focused on how the mission of the Common Core standards \u2013 to provide a school-to-work force of young people who will ultimately satisfy the need for low-pay workers within the United States \u2013 is not in keeping with the goals of Catholic education. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business and industry groups, however, have been vocal\u00a0champions of the Common Core. \u201c[T]he Common Core is undoubtedly and unacceptably workforce-oriented, thereby misinforming student character and impoverishing academic content,\u201d authors Anthony Esolen, Dan Guernsey, Jane Robbins, and Kevin Ryan write. \u201cCatholic schools typically embrace character education and rely heavily on language arts, history, and religion curricula as crucial means to educate and inspire students toward a virtuous life. Adopting the new standards may seriously compromise this essential effort.\u201d The study\u2019s authors continue: The workforce educational model currently being promoted by the government relies heavily on the concept of training. It aims to train students in certain skills of information-processing and mathematical abilities that transfer rather directly to today\u2019s world of work. Training consists of learning how to accomplish a task and \u201cgetting the job done.\u201d At the heart of the Common Core agenda is a century-old dream of Progressive educators to redirect education\u2019s mission away from engaging the young in the best of human thought and focusing instead on preparation for \u201creal life.\u201d While a reasonable but quite secondary goal, workforce-development is dwarfed by Catholic schools\u2019 transcendent goals of human excellence, spiritual transformation, and preparation for \u201cthe next life\u201d as well. While officials of both parties \u2013 such as Republican Jeb Bush and Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2013 are now avoiding any association with \u201cCommon Core\u201d due to the standards\u2019 political toxicity, establishment politicians continue to espouse the \u201chigh standards\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d rhetoric that characterizes the unpopular reform. Wisconsin-based Kirsten Lombard, editor of Common Ground on Common Core: Voices from across the Political Spectrum Expose the Realities of the Common Core State Standards, told Breitbart News, \u201cWhere the true customers for education should be the parent and the child, school-to-work (STW) programs have replaced them with government and business, increasingly making of the classroom a career-tracking and a labor-fulfillment center.\u201d Lombard explains that\u00a0classical education \u2013 the kind promoted by the Catholic scholars at Pioneer Institute \u2013 allows children and teens to think critically and prepares them for a variety of opportunities in careers or higher education. That kind of education, she says, has been replaced by the STW mentality. \u201cWhere we used to talk about equipping children to determine their own futures through real and solid education, we now talk almost exclusively about strengthening the workforce through education and ensuring that our classrooms are producing students ready to work,\u201d she said. While some students will choose vocational training based on\u00a0their own interests, Lombard says big business and government should not be making that decision for them. \u201cThe bottom line is that,\u00a0in a truly free society, business takes care of itself,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither the state nor the federal government has any legitimate role in either facilitating or managing the job training of private enterprise.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "President-elect Donald Trump changed the direction of the nation\u2019s education conversation with a single name \u2013 Betsy DeVos. By nominating a champion of school choice and local control for Secretary of Education, Trump sent the teachers\u2019 unions into panic.",
      "author": "William J. Bennett",
      "content": " Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted, \u201cTrump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since the creation of the Dept of Education.\u201d With that kind of backlash, it\u2019s obvious that DeVos is a threat to the unions, and indeed, she is. She is a bona fide education reformer. She\u2019s a private citizen who has made her career in education challenging the status quo and protectors of the status quo. She fits Trump\u2019s agenda as an outsider intent on taking on the establishment and \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d Lest we forget, this election was not about tweaking the direction of the country or subtle shifts in the nation\u2019s political landscape. Rather, it was a wholesale rejection of the Washington establishment and a call for dramatic change. According to the exit polls, when asked which candidate quality mattered the most in determining their vote for president, 39 percent of voters said \u201ccan bring change\u201d \u2013 by far the highest category of voter concerns. Among these voters yearning for change, Trump won by a margin of 82 percent to 14 percent. DeVos embodies that type of change. For the past 28 years, DeVos has been one of the most outspoken conservative voices for expanded school choice. She helped Michigan pass its first charter school legislation in the early 1990s. She believes parents should have a much larger voice in how and where their children are educated. DeVos has fought against the teachers\u2019 unions in dozens of state capitals for charter schools and private school vouchers, and she has stood with parents who decide to home school their children. Her philosophy on education is simple: public dollars should serve the public. By allowing K-12 dollars to follow children to the best school available to them, whether it is a traditional public school, private school or virtual school, all schools in our K-12 system will be held accountable and forced to improve their performance. President-elect Trump has promised to cut Washington bureaucracy and send more federal education dollars back to governors so they can expand school choice in their states. There is no one better in America to help our new President make his case that more school choice will lead to better outcomes for our school children than Betsy DeVos. She has helped thousands of school children find access to better schools. Her impact has been felt in the lives of at-risk children who have been able to escape underperforming and dangerous public schools because of access to private and charter schools of choice. Another way DeVos will bring change to Washington is by greatly reducing the federal government\u2019s role in K-12 education. DeVos is a strong supporter of state and local control. She understands that the heavy hand of Washington has imposed layers of costly red tape on our schools, wasting tax dollars on bureaucracy instead of driving improvement in student learning. In picking Betsy DeVos to champion his education agenda, President Trump has shown that he is committed to reducing the power of the federal government over local education policy and decision making. Conservatives should also have no doubts about DeVos\u2019 opposition to federalized Common Core. She has stated unequivocally that she is opposed to Washington imposing the Common Core or any other set of standards on the states. President-elect Trump ran and won on a promise to end Barack Obama\u2019s intrusion into our kids\u2019 classrooms. There is a reason that the teacher\u2019s unions have launched a vicious series of misleading attacks on DeVos since her nomination was announced in November. They have smeared her for being a devout Christian and for wanting to give children the right to attend private schools that teach religion. They have attacked her for using her personal resources to fight for conservative education reform. They have even falsely attacked her as a racist. The union leaders know full-well that she is a tough, courageous and principled conservative reformer who will take them on every day to fight for the interests of parents and students. That\u2019s why they are resorting to every ugly tactic in their playbook. Betsy DeVos is highly regarded in the conservative education reform movement. And for good reason. The Republican majority in the Senate should confirm her so she can go about the business of getting Washington, D.C. out of our children\u2019s classrooms and getting learning back in. Mr. Bennett served as Secretary of Education from 1985-1988 under Ronald Reagan.",

The confirmation hearings are scheduled to start next week. The 115th Congress will be sworn in on Tuesday. Schumer has reportedly said he wants at least two days of hearings for each Cabinet pick and stated that no more than two choices should face hearings in the same week \u2014 a move that will likely push confirmations into March. The Post\u00a0and several Republicans have pointed out that his demand is in stark contrast to 2009, when Democrats controlled the 111th Congress \u00a0and seven of President Barack Obama\u2019s cabinet confirmations were unanimously approved on\u00a0Inauguration Day. Trump\u2019s\u00a0incoming press secretary Sean Spicer shot back on CNN\u2019s New Day program with Alisyn Camerota Monday, saying it was \u201cfrankly sad\u201d that Schumer is planning to target the Cabinet nominees. \u201cIt\u00a0is sad that Sen. Schumer has chosen to politicize everything, because each of these individuals is an unbelievable agent of success and change that is going to help this country move forward,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd the idea that the Democrats\u2019 choice is to figure out, from day one, how to oppose every one of these individuals is frankly sad.\u201d  Nominations for the positions of secretary of Veterans Affairs, Council of Economic Advisors, Trade Representative, Secretary of Agriculture, and director of National Intelligence have not yet been announced.

      "content": " United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) say they they will lead a national demonstration on January 19 with a two-fold message: \u201cSchools are safe zones and we reject the Trump/DeVos privatization agenda.\u201d The L.A. teachers union calendered\u00a0this action for \u201cbefore school.\u201d Participants intend to photograph protest letters and tweet them to the President-Elect\u00a0plus \u201cmarch to the street holding up symbolic shields to protect our schools, students, and communities from privatization, attacks on immigrants, union-busting, and more.\u201d This protest reflects opposition to Trump\u2019s campaign promises that include\u00a0building a wall along the U.S. southern border and banning sanctuary cities. Although it links the anti-illegal immigrant narrative to PEOTUS, the district originally declared \u201csafe zone\u201d status last February in response to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdown under the Obama Administration, the Los Angeles Times reported. UTLA also rejects\u00a0Trump\u2019s proposal of\u00a0placing\u00a0school choice at the center of his education plan and his pro-charter pick for U.S. Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos. In their December 16 newsletter, UTLA asserts a\u00a0\u201cspirited message\u201d unites members against alleged \u201cbigotry given voice during the campaign, including racism, ableism, homophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and anti-immigrant attacks.\u201d The union that serves teachers in the nation\u2019s second largest school district maintains it defends \u201caccess to quality public education for students.\u201d Union President Alex Caputo-Pearl fears\u00a0so-called \u201cTrump ripples\u201d affecting LAUSD. In a December 20 online \u201cperspective,\u201d he declared UTLA must organize on January 19 to \u201cshow our students, our families, our communities, and our co-workers that we intend to protect each other, protect the civic institution of public education, and protect what public schools are about: inclusion, learning, safety, and diversity.\u201d The UTLA chief criticized the\u00a0California Charter Schools Association\u2019s \u201chigh praise\u201d for DeVos, who he calls \u201ca non-educator billionaire.\u201d Caputo-Pearl denounced\u00a0L.A.-based philanthropist Eli Broad\u2019s ambitious plan to expand charter schools and\u00a0Walmart\u2019s Walton family.\u00a0The Washington Post reported teachers unions blasted the Walton Family Foundation for backing charter schools. While UTLA called dibs on leading\u00a0the tweetstorm, the national organizer, the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools\u00a0(AROS), disapproved of DeVos, too. The alliance\u00a0declared\u00a0it will not \u201ccooperate\u201d with Trump\u2019s pro-school choice agenda or with his alleged \u201chateful rhetoric and bullying of immigrant children, LGBT students, Muslims, and others.\u201d AROS\u00a0consists of\u00a0progressive community organizations and unions that oppose charter schools, tax credits, and vouchers. Anti-school choice critics complain\u00a0that charters undermine traditional public schools by diverting \u201cbillions\u201d of public taxpayer dollars away from their coffers, are run by private entities, are not held to the same accountability standards and, are not unionized. One of the AROS partners,\u00a0the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD), received $900,000 from billionaire George Soros through his foundation, to organize social justice movements ahead of the 2016 GOP and DNC political conventions, the\u00a0Washington Times reported in July. The Center for Popular Democracy opposes public charters and instead\u00a0advocates for community schools. In\u00a02009, the Soros-bankrolled\u00a0Center for American Progress (CAP) issued \u201cA Look at Community Schools,\u201d which touted\u00a0\u201cpartnering\u201d with nonprofits and local agencies for these then fledgling unionized public education alternatives to charter schools.\u00a0In 2012,\u00a0CAP sponsored\u00a0the report,\u00a0Achieving Results Through Community School Partnerships,\u201d by the Institute for Educational Leadership\u2019s (IEL) Coalition for Community Schools (CCS). It also promoted seeking public and private funding streams. Additionally, the report stated: Any\u00a0type of public school can become a community school, including traditional, charter, alternative, magnet or others. The vision of a community school must be at the heart of emerging place-based initiatives, including Promise Neighborhoods, Choice Neighborhoods, cradle-to-career programs, and P-20 networks integrating educational opportunities from preschool through college. Full-service community schools pack wrap-around\u00a0academic, social, emotional, and behavioral health programs, family support, youth development, service learning, wellness, social justice, purported achievement gap closing methodologies, and even parenting classes into this \u201chub\u201d of family life.\u00a0The Coalition for Community Schools considers\u00a0the public-private partnership one of its four required components. They\u00a0list\u00a0affiliated philanthropic nonprofits\u00a0as\u00a0United Way of The National Capital Area, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, JP Morgan Chase Foundation, the Mott Foundation, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, named for the same breakfast cereal company that pulled advertising from the Breitbart News site. In\u00a02012, Arne Duncan, former Obama administration education secretary, affirmed his support for community school, which are\u00a0akin to \u201cpromise\u00a0schools,\u201d the co-initiative between AFT President Randi Weingarten\u2019s Reclaiming the Promise and the Albert Shanker Institute. Caputo-Pearl believes LAUSD sits at \u201cground zero\u201d in a battle with pro-charter school forces. He leaned on \u201cthose California and Los Angeles Democrats\u201d who have supported charters\u00a0to make a \u201cclear and public choice\u201d and rally around the \u201cunions behind a vision for Community Schools,\u201d which he calls\u00a0high-quality, equitable, and accessible education for all students. Although\u00a0UTLA persistently lobbies against school vouchers, tax credit programs, and \u201cattempts to break up the school district,\u201dthey represent\u00a01,000 teachers and other certificated staff at unionized LAUSD charters schools. UTLA\u00a0traces its activism\u00a0back to the 1970\u2019s; however, a backlash against taxes in\u00a01978 ended with the\u00a0passage of Proposition 13 which, to this day, limits the amount of property tax dollars California public schools can capture. The union is affiliated with the California Federation of Teachers (CFT), which boasts 120,000 members, and the 325,000 member California Teachers Association (CTA). The latter dubs itself the \u201cpreeminent voice\u201d for the state\u2019s educators, public schools, and colleges. Through its state-level affiliations, UTLA is part of national powerhouse teachers unions the National Education Agency (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) AFL-CIO. Online, UTLA\u00a0houses the\u00a0downloadable protest flyer to #SchoolTrump in both English and Spanish. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.",

Trump\u2019s cabinet Jan. 10, with the goal of having at least Rex Tillerson for State Department and retired Marine Gen. James N. \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis at Pentagon in place upon the start of the new administration.",
      "author": "Neil W. McCabe",
      "content": " The other top priorities are Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.) at the Justice Department and Steven Mnuchin at Treasury. Senate Republicans are conscious of stiffer Democratic opposition to those two names. Although the entire hearing schedule is not yet public, the GOP senators are keen to stagger the hearings, so that each nominee gets his own time in the spotlight and senators are spared the need to pop in and out of hearings that are often held in different buildings on the Capitol grounds. Working in favor of Trump getting his people on the clock are two changes pushed by Democrats to help President Barack Obama overcome Republican opposition. The first was legislation in 2011 that exempted 200 presidential appointments from Senate confirmation, and the second was the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d The nuclear option was slang for how Majority Leader Harry Reid (D.-Nev.)\u00a0changed Senate rules in November 2013, eliminating the 60-vote threshold when the chamber votes to end debate and force a vote on a confirmation\u2013except for nominees to the Supreme Court. Often the vote to end debate is the real battle, because it allows a faction of 41 senators to block or delay a vote. Mattis\u2019s nomination for Secretary of Defense does not appear to have a political obstacle, as he has been praised by Democrats and Republicans alike, but there is the legal obstacle, which prevents\u00a0an individual from becoming the Pentagon chief within seven years of his leaving military service. The restriction is part of the National Security Act of 1947, which created the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council, and combined the War and Navy Departments to create the Department of Defense. The only man granted a waiver from this restriction was Gen. George C. Marshall, who led DOD from 1950-to-1951. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. Reid\u2019s nuclear option made ending debate on confirmations subject to a simple majority threshold, but the 60-vote requirement exists for legislation, such as the legislation to grant Mattis the waiver. These are the confirmation hearings announced so far: Betsy DeVos Jan. 11 at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.) Jan 10 at the Senate Judiciary Committee",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " In an op-ed at USA Today, Pioneer executive director Jim Stergios and senior fellow Charles Chieppo said\u00a0that, if confirmed, DeVos needs a \u201cdifferent plan\u201d from past U.S. Education Department (USED) secretaries hoping to \u201ctransform\u201d American K-12 education. The authors pointed out the \u201coxymoronic\u201d education goal of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration of incentivizing states \u201cto adopt federally defined, one-size-fits-all approaches to school \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d Stergios and Chieppo revealed the results: As the 2015 results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress demonstrate, taxpayers spent tens of billions\u00a0of dollars annually on \u201cfederal innovation\u201d without improving the academic performance of our public schools.\u00a0Just-released scores from the Trends in International Math and Science Study assessment show that, again, the U.S. was a below-average performer.\u00a0Since 2009, our scores have also declined on the international PISA test. The authors urged DeVos, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 11, to learn the \u201cimportant lesson\u201d that \u201cpolicies hatched by the federal government and its inside-the-Beltway partners\u00a0like\u00a0the National Governors Association, Council of Chief State School Officers, the Fordham Institute, and Achieve, Inc. have failed repeatedly, and at great taxpayer expense.\u201d The National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers are the creators of the Common Core standards, and both the Fordham Institute and Achieve, Inc. were funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help promote and implement Common Core. The Fordham Institute is just one example of a Washington, D.C., elite organization that supports both Common Core and school choice. In a column at Breitbart News in 2014, Pioneer\u2019s Jamie Gass described Fordham\u2019s place in the Washington, D.C. \u201cedu-blob\u201d: The institute continued to take money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested over $200 million in drafting the Common Core standards, evaluating the same standards Gates paid to develop, and building public support for them. Thus far, Fordham\u2019s Gates haul is at least $3,461,116. In 2010, Fordham used some of that Gates money to compare each state\u2019s standards to Common Core. As you might expect, they found Common Core\u2019s English standards superior to their counterparts in 37 states and the math standards better than those in 39 states. Fordham described the comparison as \u201ctoo close to call\u201d in most of the remaining states. \u2026 Fordham gave the Common Core mathematics standards an \u201cA-\u201d despite the failure to organize the high school standards by grade level, grade span, or course. Instead, they are listed in five unordered categories of \u201cmathematical constructs,\u201d leaving it unclear which standards belong to algebra and which to geometry. Upon DeVos\u2019 nomination as USED secretary, Fordham Institute President Michael Petrilli wrote: I suspect Trump will also come to appreciate DeVos\u2019s political savvy\u2014something that comes in handy for all cabinet secretaries. She was one of the first people in ed-reform to understand that we weren\u2019t going to beat the teachers unions with op-eds and policy papers (as much as it pains me, a think-tank guy, to say that). She pushed the private school choice movement to invest in serious political giving much earlier than the mainstream reform groups did, and, so far, with far greater success. Fordham senior visiting fellow Jason Crye also urged fellow supporters of school choice to support DeVos: Whether parents should be able to be able to choose schools that others consider bad is a reasonable question\u2014and worthy of debate. But let\u2019s not allow that to blind us from the fact that a school choice advocate has been nominated to a cabinet position. That\u2019s \u201chuge\u201d for our movement. We need to support Betsy DeVos. Give her a chance! Let\u2019s not allow Utopia to get in the way of real change. Though DeVos has financed and served on the boards of organizations that openly support Common Core, upon her nomination as education secretary, DeVos stated immediately, \u201cI am not a supporter\u201d of Common Core. \u201cPeriod.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to the national K-12 English and math standards known as Common Core, DeVos has undergone a post-nomination conversion,\u201d Stergios and Chieppo wrote.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s hope that is true.\u201d \u201cThe D.C.-driven Common Core standards reflect a view of public education as just another workforce development program,\u201d they added.\u00a0\u201cResearch and data show that focusing on academic content and the liberal arts produces both better citizens and more skilled workers.\u201d Stergios and Chieppo pointed out that while DeVos has been a champion of charter schools in her home state of Michigan, the results have been far less than stellar. \u201cThe incoming secretary is an avowed charter public school advocate,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0\u201cHer advocacy should be shaped by results.\u00a0Lax rules for determining who can open a school are among the reasons why charters in her home state of Michigan perform only slightly better than the traditional public schools there.\u201d The writers urged the USED nominee to \u201csupport state and local innovation and state policies\u201d that actually boost student achievement, much like those developed in Boston, where charter schools have outperformed other groups of public schools. Stergios and Chieppo advised DeVos, as well, to \u201cstop support for the federal consortia that are developing Common Core-based tests,\u201d and to \u201ccurb the collection of non-academic student data.\u201d \u201cDeVos would be wise to revisit the 2013 amendments\u00a0that gutted the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the faddish \u2018social emotional learning\u2019\u00a0provisions promoted by\u00a0the Every Student Succeeds Act\u00a0signed last year by Obama,\u201d they added. The writers said\u00a0DeVos should avoid surrendering to the \u201cD.C.-based education policymakers and lobbyists,\u201d an act that would ultimately \u201cset American education on a path of mediocrity and decline.\u201d \u201cHowever well-intentioned\u00a0Beltway bureaucrats and lobbyists may be, DeVos\u00a0needs to understand that the best school innovation comes from states, localities, and parents,\u201d they concluded.",

      "author": "Neil W. McCabe",
      "content": " Cory Booker once served with DeVos on the board of the Alliance for School Choice, and the two had been considered political allies in the education reform debate. However, Booker also has political ambitions, and at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, no one challenges the dominance of the public school teachers and their unions. Ideas like \u201cschool choice\u201d or support for alternative and charter schools are heresies to the teachers and their unions, and it is becoming awkward for Booker to stay true to his previous positions and his relationship with DeVos. In a Dec. 14 interview with The 74, a childhood education blog, the senator said he was not comfortable with DeVos: \u201cIt is no secret that I strongly believe we have a lot of work to do to ensure that every child in America has access to a high-quality public education. I greet Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination with a healthy skepticism, and I have serious early concerns,\u201d Booker said. \u201cLike all of Trump\u2019s nominees, I will approach her nomination with deep scrutiny, especially because I am alarmed by President-elect Trump\u2019s overall education agenda and fear that he has little respect for \u2014 or interest in \u2014 the critical work that the Department of Education performs for our children. But Booker was not always so concerned. The senator and former Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, has carved out for himself a niche where he is less doctrinaire on educational issues and often speaking at educational reform events focused on changing an education establishment and practices dominated by unionized public school teachers \u2014 a group that is among the top financial supporters of Booker\u2019s own Democratic Party. When Booker spoke at the May 16 meeting of the American Federation for Children, an advocacy group led by DeVos, Booker was anything but \u201cconcerned.\u201d So happy to be here, this\u00a0is the first time I\u2019ve gotten to come back to this incredible organization since I\u2019ve been elected to\u00a0United States Senate; and my experience over the years coming to this to this conference, coming to\u00a0meetings, meetings of incredible folks who really believed in me when I was at the start of my career\u00a0there are some people in this room who really were the difference makers as I was climbing the ladder\u00a0in Newark, New Jersey, with a vision for transforming that city. After the President-elect named DeVos, teachers unions and other Democrats were quick to call DeVos \u201cright-wing.\u201d When Booker spoke at AFC\u2019s 2012 policy summit, he said the \u201cright-wing\u201d label was all wrong: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018right-wing?\u2019 I said, \u2018First of all,\u00a0I got lots of Democrats that are involved in this organization.'\u201d Booker told the summit he was tired of all the partisanship surrounding the education movement: \u201cThis\u00a0country\u2019s become much more about what party you\u2019re a part of than about the progress, and the\u00a0possibilities, the dreams, the plans. I\u2019m tired of partisanship. Partisanship doesn\u2019t serve my city;\u00a0we\u2019ve had Democrats representing our city for as long as I can remember,\u201d he said: I cannot ever stand up and stand against a parent having options because I\u00a0benefited from my parents having options. And when people tell me they\u2019re against school choice,\u00a0whether it\u2019s the Opportunity Scholarship Act or charter schools, I look at them and say, \u201cAs soon as\u00a0you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re willing to send your kid to a failing school in my city or in Camden or\u00a0Trenton, then I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d DeVos testifies Jan. 11 in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee as part of her confirmation process. Booker is not a member of the committee. Watch Sen. Cory A. Booker (D-NJ) speak at the 2016 American Federation for Children Policy Summit: ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " In an op-ed at the Washington Post, Romney asserts that DeVos would challenge \u201cthe education establishment,\u201d which has a \u201cfinancial stake\u201d in the current system. The former Massachusetts governor also observes that \u201ca lot of money is at stake\u201d in the debate over DeVos, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 11. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a debate between those in the education establishment who support the status quo because they have a financial stake in the system and those who seek to challenge the status quo because it\u2019s not serving kids well,\u201d he writes. Romney portrays DeVos as \u201csomeone who isn\u2019t financially biased shaping education,\u201d and as \u201csomeone who will challenge the conventional wisdom and status quo.\u201d Parent and education activists who have been battling against the \u201cestablishment\u201d of both political parties, however, are reacting to Breitbart News about Romney\u2019s views of DeVos. \u201cMr. Romney seems confused about what constitutes the education establishment in this country,\u201d states Jane Robbins, senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based American Principles Project. \u201dMrs. DeVos and the organizations she has either founded, funded, or helped lead are an integral part of the establishment that many thousands of parents have been fighting for years now,\u201d Robbins adds. \u201cThose parents are the real anti-establishment heroes, but they\u2019ve been consistently ignored. We hope Mrs. DeVos will start to listen to them.\u201d Ohio parent activist Heidi Huber tells Breitbart News that Romney\u2019s endorsement of DeVos as an \u201canti-establishment\u201d maverick of sorts is \u201claughable,\u201d given that he has been an \u201canti-Trumper.\u201d \u201cIf the establishment\u2019s history of self-awareness deficit wasn\u2019t so widely known, one might think Romney was trying to sabotage the confirmation,\u201d Huber asserts. \u201cOne can only hope that Romney\u2019s endorsement of DeVos will be as inversely effective as his public denouncement of Trump.\u201d A leader of grassroots parents, teachers, and citizens against federal control of education, Huber\u2019s observation is that Romney is \u201cunaware of the contradiction of his case,\u201d and cites his boasting of the education successes in his home state of Massachusetts. In his op-ed, the former governor wrote: Massachusetts has consistently ranked No. 1\u00a0among all 50 states on the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress exams. I believe that there are many reasons for this success. Among them are a statewide curriculum developed by our own educators; a state exam in math, science and English required to graduate from high school; extensive school choice among standard public schools, charter schools, public exam schools, private schools, Catholic schools and cyber schools; superb teachers; and involved parents. Massachusetts has also benefited from creative political leadership on both sides of the aisle and from remarkable flexibility by our education unions. However, as Huber notes, Romney cites the successes in the Bay State prior to Gov. Deval Patrick (D)\u2019s decision to force the social justice education reform known as Common Core upon Massachusetts students. Jamie Gass, education director at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, described at Breitbart News the results once Common Core became the state\u2019s standards: Today Massachusetts\u2019 SAT scores are down 20 points from their 2006 highs. Third-grade reading scores are the best predictor of future academic success. Last year, after several years of stagnation, the percentage of Massachusetts third-graders who scored proficient or advanced on MCAS reading tests fell to its lowest level since 2009. At 57 percent, the portion of third-graders reading at or above the proficient level is 10 points lower than it was in 2002. Results from the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the nation\u2019s report card, tell a similarly disturbing story. Massachusetts\u2019 five-point decline in fourth-grade reading was the largest in the country. Weaker national standards are unlikely to staunch the bleeding. \u201cRather than reaching the natural conclusion that a leader familiar with the Massachusetts overhaul would be the ideal nominee,\u201d Huber continues, \u201cRomney\u2019s conclusion is: \u2018The answers for improving our nation\u2019s schools will come from people who have no financial stake in the outcome and study the most successful education systems here and around the world.\u2019\u201d Huber responds: Wrong, Mitt. As Massachusetts\u2019 success proves, the answers lie within our local communities and states, not with a billionaire known for buying political influence. If Betsy DeVos was the right nominee, she would be recommending that the states look to the pre-Common Core Massachusetts\u2019 design as their blueprint and then she\u2019d get to work on dismantling the corrupt FedEd complex known as the U.S. Dept. of Education. That\u2019s when the interests of our children will finally prevail. As Robbins and Huber suggest, Romney\u2019s review of the \u201cdebate\u201d over DeVos makes no mention of the grassroots base of the Republican Party that has been battling against the Common Core standards and what the reform represents \u2013 greater federal control of education. Oklahoma parent activist Jenni White says DeVos is clearly a member of the \u201cRepublican Establishment.\u201d \u201cIn fact, that may be my biggest concern with DeVos \u2013 her track record of \u2018buying\u2019 legislation and growing government in the name of education,\u201d White tells Breitbart News. \u201cHow will this past (and her current associations with Common Core supporters like Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and others) translate to a job in the public sector at an agency that doesn\u2019t even have a Constitutional mandate to exist yet sucks massive amounts of dollars out of our pockets to justify its existence?\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The hearing, originally slated for January 11, has been rescheduled for January 17 at 5:00 p.m., according to an announcement by HELP chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN). A tweet Monday evening from HELP Committee GOP said Alexander and ranking committee member Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) will \u201cmove Betsy DeVos hearing to Jan 17 at request of Senate leadership to accommodate Senate schedule\u201d:  According to a report at the Washington Post, Alexander said the postponement of DeVos\u2019 confirmation hearing would not change the HELP committee\u2019s schedule for a vote on her nomination on January 24. \u201cBetsy DeVos is an outstanding nominee who has complied with all of the committee\u2019s requirements and no one doubts that she will be confirmed as Education Secretary,\u201d an aide to Alexander reportedly said. \u201cThis hearing delay is simply to accommodate the Senate schedule.\u201d The delay follows a vocal, three-way debate over billionaire DeVos\u2019 nomination. Establishment Democrats, who support increased taxpayer funding for public schools, have expressed concern that DeVos, a supporter of charter schools and school vouchers, has no experience with the public school system in the country. Establishment Republicans, however, are supportive of DeVos and share her passion for expanding \u201cschool choice\u201d and school voucher systems in which taxpayer funds are transferred from public schools to private and religious schools. The establishment of both parties has been supportive of the Common Core standards reform and its associated data collection that enhances a \u201cworkforce development\u201d model of education. The goal of \u201cworkforce development\u201d is a top priority of business and industry groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, which has supported amnesty for illegal immigrants and basic education that can create a low-cost workforce within the United States. The grassroots constitutionalist base of the Republican Party \u2013 many of whom voted for Donald Trump, at least in part, because he promised to eliminate Common Core and work to get the federal government out of education \u2013 have provided a third voice in the debate about\u00a0DeVos. For years, thousands of grassroots parents have worked with their state legislatures in an attempt to repeal the Common Core standards and educate lawmakers about the continued encroachment of the federal government into an area reserved by the Constitution for parents, the states, and local governments. This grassroots base asserts that, while DeVos announced upon her nomination that she is not a supporter of Common Core, she has spent years financing and serving organizations that support the standards \u2013 and, therefore, greater federal control of education. The parents\u2019 groups also have expressed concern about an expanded school voucher system that may be tied to greater regulation, in the name of \u201caccountability,\u201d for the private and religious schools that agree to participate in these programs. Establishment Democrats, as the Post reports, pushed for the postponement of DeVos\u2019 hearing until the Office of Government Ethics has more time to review the Michigan heiress\u2019 significant financial holdings and search for potential conflicts of interest. Writing at The Federalist, however, managing editor Joy Pullmann, author of the soon-to-be-released The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, observes\u00a0that the case of DeVos is a bit different: DeVos doesn\u2019t particularly make money from education. She gives money to education. Since her husband is a billionaire, she\u2019s got lots to give, and to her credit she does. A review of her financial forms reveals that her ethics challenges are less likely (at least so far) in personally benefitting from government favors, but from her pre-existing influence over the Senate that has to confirm her. Pullmann notes one of DeVos\u2019 financial disclosures, which covers only the last five years. The\u00a0nominee, she says, has donated \u201ctens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of senators who now are supposed to review her fitness for public office.\u201d Some of DeVos\u2019 contributions are as follows to these members of the Senate HELP\u00a0Committee: Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA): $7,800 Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK): $5,400 Sen. Todd Young (R-IN): $5,400 Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC): $7,400 Politico reports that the \u201cgrand total\u201d of DeVos\u2019 political contributions during\u00a0the past five years is \u201cjust under $5.3 million.\u201d DeVos\u2019 financial affidavit shows she has also donated to the following campaigns, many of whom have come out publicly in support of the nominee, and/or will be voting on her confirmation: Justin Amash for Congress: $8,900 SuperPAC American Crossroads, associated with Karl Rove: $200,000 Carly for President: $2,700 Citizens for Rauner, Inc.: $1,000 Comstock for Congress: $8,000 Cory Gardner for Senate: $5,200 Cotton for Senate: $5,200 Deal for Governor, Inc: $1,000 Ducey 2014: $1,000 Eric Holcomb for Governor of Indiana: $10,000 Friends of Pat Toomey: $5,400 Friends of Scott Walker: $10,000 Grassley Hawkeye Fund: $5,400 House Republican Campaign Committee: $300,000 Illinois Republican Party: $10,000 Indiana Republican Party: $10,000 Jeb 2016: $2,700 Jindal for President: $2,700 John Kennedy for US Senate: $2,700 John McCain for Senate: $1,000 Joni for Iowa: $2,600 Kasich for America: $2,700 Kirk for Senate: $5,400 Marco Rubio for President: $2,700 Marco Rubio for US Senate: $5,400 Martinez for Governor: $1,000 McConnell Senate Committee \u201914: $2,600 Michigan Chamber PAC: $30,000 Michigan Republican Party: $652,000 National Republican Senate Committee: $114,200 New Mexico Republican Party: $5,000 Perdue for Senate: $2,600 Portman for Senate Committee: $5,400 Republican Governor\u2019s Association: $125,000 Republican Legislative Campaign Committee: $50,000 Republican National Committee: $215,000 Republican Party of Florida: $10,000 Rick Scott for Governor: $5,000 Romney for President: $5,000 Ron Johnson for Senate: $5,400 Rounds for Senate: $5,200 Roy Blunt for Senate: $2,700 Ryan for Congress: $5,400 Scott Walker, Inc: $2,700 Senate Republican Campaign Committee: $160,000 Steve Daines for Montana: $5,200 Sullivan for US Senate: $2,600 The Richard Burr Committee: $5,400 Thom Tillis for Senate: $5,200 \u201cGiven all the DeVos money floating around Washington, how likely are Republican senators to ask her some fair but critical questions about a woman who would oversee some $70 billion in annual public funding and 5,000 public employees?\u201d asks Pullmann.",

      "content": " According to a column from Mic, the multimedia social media campaign is asking DeVos to promise to enforce Title IX rights for students, particularly in regards to prosecuting alleged cases of sexual assault. The column makes no mention of the widely-documented miscarriages of justice that have occurred as a result of Title IX. In Partnership with Know Your IX, End Rape on Campus launched the multimedia campaign #DearBetsy\u00a0imploring DeVos to promise to protect and enforce Title IX rights for all students regardless of gender identity, gender expression and\u00a0sexual orientation, Sofie Karasek, director of education for End Rape on Campus, said in the YouTube video. The campaign also asks DeVos to keep public all lists of educational institutions under investigation for Title IX violations and to uphold the Title IX rights for sexual violence and harassment. #DearBetsy \u2013 don't weaken enforcement of Title IX. Students shouldn't be forced out of college because they feel unsafe. @BetsyDeVos \u2014 Grace Rogers (@TheGraceRogers) January 9, 2017  #DearBetsy, \"In 2013 we held the institution we love accountable, in 2017 we hold the country we love accountable.\" https://t.co/2OaqahokC4 pic.twitter.com/rLV2eBfKw5 \u2014 End Rape on Campus (@endrapeoncampus) January 9, 2017  Feminists began their campaign after it emerged that DeVos donated $10,000 to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which fights to protect\u00a0the due process rights of those accused of sexual assault on college campuses. FIRE also defends free speech on campus, which has become a hot-button issue in recent years. In a statement, FIRE argued that protecting civil rights shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. \u201cThe basic protections for which FIRE argues \u2014 the right to the active participation of counsel; the right to see the evidence in one\u2019s case and to meaningfully question witnesses; and the right to an impartial tribunal, among others \u2014 benefit all parties and do not impede the pursuit of justice,\u201d the group said. \u201cOutside of the campus context, nobody would argue that reducing due process protections, including the burden of proof, is necessary to secure a just outcome.\u201d Criminal prosecutions of sexual assault are based on the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt standard,\u201d while civil cases use a lesser standard called \u00a0\u201cthe preponderance of the\u00a0evidence,\u201d in which the court decides whether or not the incident was more likely than not to have occurred. Most campus sexual assault cases are decided in civil court, and because of this some activists believe that individuals are being\u00a0charged with crimes that they didn\u2019t commit. In the past few years, buoyed by a media-fuelled panic over \u201crape culture,\u201d there were several notable rape hoaxes on campus. Emma Sulkowicz, a radical student at Columbia University, defamed one of her peers after a university investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing. Sulkowicz, or \u201cmattress girl,\u201d as she was often referred, eventually made a pornographic film in which she reenacted her version of the alleged rape incident. Despite the fact that her alleged attacker was cleared in a campus court, Sulkowicz became a media celebrity and progressive heroine. She was even invited to attend President Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address by Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the more well-known advocates of kangaroo courts on campus. Another notorious example of the campus-rape panic going wild was\u00a0Rolling Stone\u2019s\u00a0fake story about an alleged gang-rape at the University of Virginia, in which\u00a0reporter\u00a0Sabrina Rubin Erdely published a fictitious account of a gang-rape at the university. The hoax received widespread media attention, especially after Rolling Stone refused to terminate Erdely. The reporter was nonetheless ordered by the court to pay $2 million to the University of Virginia for defamation. Senator Bob Casey (D-Penn.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) wrote a letter to President-elect Trump last week in which they urged him to maintain the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard for campus sexual assault cases. Casey and Murray argued that it remains \u201cthe correct and appropriate standard to use\u201d in this type of case. \u201cIt is critically important that these policies remain in effect in order to protect students from sexual violence and promote healthy learning communities,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe respectfully urge you to strongly support these efforts to end campus sexual assault.\u201d Nevertheless, on the issue of Title IX overreach, Democrats are increasingly in the minority.\u00a0In 2015, a California judge issued a blow\u00a0to faulty campus sexual assault investigations, when he decided that a student at UC-San Diego wasn\u2019t afforded fair due process.\u00a0In his hearing, the student was denied the right to cross-examine his accusers and adverse witnesses were limited. The Court determines that it is unfair to Petitioner that his questions were reviewed by the Panel Chair for her alone to determine whether or not the question would be asked and then answered by the witness. While the Court understands the need to prevent additional trauma to potential victims of sexual abuse, this can be achieved in a less restrictive manner. The limiting of the questions in this case curtailed the right of confrontration [sic] crucial to any definition of a fair hearing. A 2014 article from columnist Emily Yoffe at the progressive Slate Magazine, argued that \u201cefforts to protect women from a putative epidemic of violence have led to misguided policies that infringe on the civil rights of men.\u201d Yoffe, writing after the unraveling of the Rolling Stone hoax, told the story of a University of Michigan student nearly had his life destroyed as a result of faulty policies designed to protect women from sexual violence. Yoffe also questioned the legitimacy of the now-common claim that one in four female students will be raped. \u201cThe one-fifth to one-quarter assertion would mean that young American college women are raped at a rate similar to women in Congo, where rape has been used as a weapon of war.\u201d The idea that DeVos\u2019 Department of Education might protect both the rights of the accused and the accusers has clearly perturbed the feminist activists who helped bring about the rampant abuses of justice on campus.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " In a column Friday at the Portland Press Herald, Bush cites \u201ca real compassion for children and a proven record of championing reforms to improve literacy and learning\u201d as reasons for her support of DeVos. Bush, who is the founder of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, writes, \u201cWe need more leaders like Betsy DeVos who understand the stakes involved\u201d with the high illiteracy rate in the United States. She continues: Betsy DeVos has helped pass reforms to drive gains in literacy. The Great Lakes Education Project she founded in Michigan was instrumental in passing a comprehensive reading law last year that provides extra tutoring to struggling students and other intervention strategies to ensure that kids are leaving third grade with the literacy skills they will need to succeed in later grades. Reading is truly the building block of a successful education, and Mrs. DeVos has fought hard to ensure that elected officials in her home state and across the nation are giving literacy its proper attention. As Breitbart News has reported, while DeVos said, upon her nomination, that she is not a supporter of Common Core, she has funded and served on the board of the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP), an organization that promotes school choice and is a supporter of Common Core. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013. The former first lady continued, \u201cI also believe Mrs. DeVos has the right priorities on important issues such as school choice, early childhood development, and accountability in education.\u201d Upon her nomination, DeVos also said, \u201cI do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense.\u201d \u201cI have worked with Mrs. DeVos\u2019 advocacy organizations for years and I know that her commitment to children runs deep,\u201d writes Bush. \u201cShe believes passionately that children should have access to high performing schools regardless of their race, income or zip code,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat is why she has fought valiantly to give parents of at-risk children the right to send their kids to charter and private schools when the public school system is letting them down.\u201d \u201cI know Betsy DeVos is the right woman to help usher in an era of education reforms that can drive significant improvement in student achievement,\u201d Bush concludes. Barbara Bush\u2019s enthusiasm\u00a0for DeVos is shared by her son, Jeb, the former Florida governor and former 2016 presidential candidate. According to\u00a0the Tampa Bay Times,\u00a0Jeb Bush, a strong champion for the Common Core standards, writes in a letter to leaders of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,\u00a0\u201cBetsy is a champion of families, not institutions.\u00a0For her, local control of education decisions means local control. She trusts parents to choose what is in their unique child\u2019s best interests, and she believes in providing every parent with the resources to pursue those decisions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident that, as Secretary, Betsy will pursue every opportunity to improve all of our nation\u2019s schools and empower states, districts and parents to maximize the number of high-quality learning opportunities available to our kids,\u201d Jeb Bush states. The former GOP candidate told the National Summit on Education Reform recently he is \u201cso excited\u201d about\u00a0President-elect Trump\u2019s \u201cextraordinary choice with Betsy DeVos.\u201d Politico reported earlier this month that DeVos was serving as Jeb Bush\u2019s \u201cconsolation prize\u201d for his failure to secure the GOP nomination. According to the report: If DeVos is confirmed by the Senate as most expect, Bush could see his views on education \u2014 repeatedly ridiculed on the campaign trail by Donald Trump \u2014 given new life as she turns their shared vision into national policy. For years, the former Florida governor and DeVos worked side-by-side to push \u201cschool choice\u201d policies that steer taxpayer funding to charter and private schools \u2014 and which critics blame for undermining traditional public schools. They served together on the board of Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education, to which DeVos and her husband gave large contributions. The DeVoses also contributed to Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. At Townhall, American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins writes with a different view: that the choice of DeVos is \u201cJeb\u2019s revenge.\u201d \u201cHow ironic\u2026that Jeb\u2019s vision of education may triumph in a Trump administration after all,\u201d she says. \u201cJeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \u2018government-foundation cartel\u2019 model of educational policy-making,\u201d Robbins explains. \u201cPrivate foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals.\u201d Jeb Bush\u2019s former Florida deputy education commissioner Hanna Skandera \u2013 the current secretary of education in New Mexico \u2013 is also reportedly being considered for a top post in the federal education department under DeVos. DeVos\u2019 confirmation hearing was postponed and is now set to begin on Tuesday, January 17.",

Like DeVos, Hubbard is a school choice supporter\u2026And like DeVos, his background is in business. He co-founded and now serves as the chairman of E & A Industries, which has invested in companies that make everything from gluten-free foods to \u201cbody-slimming\u201d fashion, according to its website. Also like DeVos: He\u2019s a former state party chair (in Indiana, as opposed to Michigan). And like DeVos, he is a wealthy GOP donor. In fact, he was the 12th richest person in the executive branch in 2004, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Hubbard is a past chairman and director of the Indiana State Chamber of Commerce and Trustee Emeritus of the Hudson Institute. He also serves on the board of the Indiana-based Lumina Foundation, a pro-Common Core organization that is wed to workforce development, i.e., the use of student and worker data to enhance the goals of private industry and business in the United States. Lumina has funded grants to various groups for the sole purpose of promoting the Common Core standards, including: $200,000 October, 2012-September, 2013 Council of Chief State School Officers [one of the creators of the Common Core standards] Purpose: \u201cTo support an inquiry by McKinsey & Company concerning the sustainability and operations of the two Common Core State Standards/Assessment (CCSS/A) consortia post 2014.\u201d $900,000 July, 2012-June, 2015 National Governors Association Center for Best Practices [one of the creators of the Common Core standards] Purpose: \u201cTo improve higher education productivity, integrate education and workforce data and policies, streamline higher education transitions by implementing Common Core State Standards, and support the Foundation\u2019s work with governors.\u201d $75,000 November, 2014-October, 2015 National Public Education Support Fund Purpose: \u201cTo fund continued operations of and Lumina\u2019s membership to the Education Funder Strategy Group and the Common Core Funders Working Group.\u201d $75,000 November, 2013-October, 2014 National Public Education Support Fund Purpose: \u201cTo fund continued operations of the Education Funder Strategy Group and the Common Core Funders Working Group.\u201d $500,000 September, 2013-September 2015 Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers, Inc.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " With DeVos\u2019 confirmation hearing rescheduled\u00a0to begin January 17, members of Education Liberty Watch have sent a letter detailing their concerns to Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), ranking member Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), and the committee\u2019s other members. \u201cThis national coalition of grassroots parent and citizen organizations has many questions and concerns about Betsy DeVos,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Dr. Karen Effrem, tells Breitbart News. \u201cChief among them is her apparent very recent conversion to opposing Common Core when her activist and philanthropic record shows concrete evidence of strong support for the standards over many years.\u201d While, upon her nomination, DeVos launched a new website on which she stated she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not a supporter of Common Core, she has served on boards and funded organizations that have been vocal supporters of the standards. Additionally, she has been strongly endorsed by former GOP presidential candidate and Common Core promoter Jeb Bush, his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, former GOP presidential nominee and \u201canti-Trumper\u201d Mitt Romney, former education secretary William Bennett \u2013 who received compensation for promoting Common Core among conservatives, the pro-Common Core Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and the Bill Gates-funded Fordham Institute, which has also promoted Common Core. \u201cThere is also great concern about her support of voucher programs imposing Common Core on private and potentially home schools, and extensive student data mining,\u201d Effrem continues. \u201cThese concerns are especially acute given President-elect Trump\u2019s encouraging and repeated promises to get rid of Common Core, protect privacy and decrease or eliminate the federal role in education.\u201d Effrem summarizes the letter and the group\u2019s concerns: 1) From all the evidence we can find, her statement when she was appointed on November 23rd was her very first against Common Core. Her statements and record via organizations that she\u00a0has founded, funded, chaired, or on whose boards she has served and her political contributions have all been in support of Common Core and pro-Common Core candidates. Her statement and her interview with Donald Trump focused on \u201chigher standards\u201d which is a euphemism for Common Core, even though there is abundant evidence that the Common Core standards are anything but high. 2) Her American Federation for Children group has been strongly in support of state voucher laws in Indiana and Louisiana or federal Title I portability that imposes or would impose Common Core on private schools via the federally mandated state assessments. The education savings accounts that she touts could well place government regulations on home schooling for \u201caccountability\u201d purposes. 3)\u00a0Although a strong supporter of charter schools, it appears she has never financially supported classical charter schools like the Hillsdale model in her own home state, only charters that require the teaching and testing of Common Core. 4) The Philanthropy Roundtable that she chaired until her appointment put out a report that is strongly in favor of extensive data mining of children without transparency of what data is collected and who receives it or parental consent and never mentions the word \u201cprivacy.\u201d 5) We are also concerned about continued expansion of invasive, subjective social emotional learning programs at the federal level and need to know her position on those. \u201cWe strongly urge the Senate HELP Committee to closely question her about these critical issues,\u201d Effrem says.

Those senators include GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy (LA), Tim Scott (SC), Todd Young (IN), Lisa Murkowski (AK), and Richard Burr (NC). The nomination hearing will be held Tuesday. Adam Bozzi of ECU said his group has run ads about these senators in Washington, D.C. and in their home states, reports The Hill. Bozzi added that ECU has received some 23,000 petitions that will be delivered to the senators\u2019 offices. Constitutionalists, hoping ultimately to see the federal department of education dismantled, have raised concerns about DeVos\u2019 support and funding for pro-Common Core organizations. They, too, are apprehensive about her influence over senators to whom she has contributed. A review of DeVos\u2019 financial disclosures\u00a0during the past five years shows that \u201cher ethics challenges are less likely (at least so far) in personally benefitting from government favors, but from her pre-existing influence over the Senate that has to confirm her,\u201d said Joy Pullmann, author of the soon-to-be-released book,\u00a0The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids. Pullmann is the\u00a0managing editor\u00a0at The Federalist. The\u00a0nominee has donated \u201ctens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of senators who now are supposed to review her fitness for public office,\u201d Pullmann wrote. According to the disclosures, billionaire DeVos contributed $7,800 to Cassidy, $5,400 to Murkowski, $5,400 to Young, $7,400 to Scott, and $5,400 to Burr. Politico reports that the \u201cgrand total\u201d of DeVos\u2019 political contributions during\u00a0the past five years is \u201cjust under $5.3 million.\u201d DeVos\u2019 financial affidavit shows she has also donated to the following campaigns: \u201cGiven all the DeVos money floating around Washington, how likely are Republican senators to ask her some fair but critical questions about a woman who would oversee some $70 billion in annual public funding and 5,000 public employees?\u201d asks Pullmann. The Hill reports, however, a\u00a0spokesman for a group called Friends for Betsy DeVos says calls for senators who have received contributions from the nominee to recuse themselves are nothing more than a double standard.\u00a0Ed Patru observed\u00a0the two teachers unions who oppose DeVos\u2019 nomination have also contributed to the Democrats on the Senate HELP Committee.

Opportunity Scholarship Program (DCOSP), a school choice program in Washington, D.C. DCOSP was condemned by supporters of teachers unions who feared school choice legislation would deprive public schools of their federal funding. \u201cA champion for education reform, Betsy DeVos stood with us every step of the way, working side by side with me and many other proponents of equal opportunity in education to ensure the program continued,\u201d Boehner writes.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " According to a press release from the Trump transition team, which provides DeVos\u2019 anticipated remarks, the nominee will tell members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee about her primary goal of school choice and of bringing high quality education to all children in the United States, regardless of their \u201cincome or zip code.\u201d After being introduced by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and former Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Independent from Connecticut with close ties to the Democrat Party, DeVos will speak mainly about parents\u2019 right to choose the physical environment in which their children learn. DeVos is expected to say: Parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning meets the needs of every child, and they know other options exist, whether magnet, virtual, charter, home, religious, or any combination thereof. Yet, too many parents are denied access to the full range of options\u2026 choices that many of us \u2014 here in this room \u2014 have exercised for our own children. The nominee plans to tell the senators that she and her husband realized, when they had their own children, that other parents who were not as wealthy could not make the same education choices for their children as they could for theirs. She decided to make it her \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d to \u201cdo something about it.\u201d \u201cI share President-elect Trump\u2019s view that it\u2019s time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve,\u201d she plans to say, adding that she is \u201ca firm believer that parents should be empowered to choose the learning environment that\u2019s best for their individual children.\u201d \u201cIf confirmed, I look forward to working with you to enact solutions that empower parents and students, provide high quality options and spend tax dollars wisely,\u201d she is expected to\u00a0say. DeVos will continue that, under her leadership, current federal education laws will be enforced and new laws enacted, while at the same time she says she will advocate for \u201clocal control\u201d of education: We will work together to ensure the Every Student Succeeds Act is implemented as Congress intended \u2014 with local communities freed from burdensome regulations from Washington. And I look forward to working with Congress and all stakeholders to reauthorize the Higher Education Act to meet the needs of today\u2019s college students. President-elect Trump and I know it won\u2019t be Washington, D.C. that unlocks our nation\u2019s potential, nor a bigger bureaucracy, tougher mandates or a federal agency. The answer is local control and listening to parents, students and teachers. DeVos, who has been criticized by the teachers unions and their supporters for her promotion of school choice and taxpayer vouchers that transfer funds from public schools to private and religious schools, is expected to say America is \u201cblessed beyond measure with educators who pour themselves into students.\u201d She will continue: Our nation\u2019s schools are filled with talented, devoted professionals, who successfully meet the needs of many, many children. But even our best schools don\u2019t work for all. This isn\u2019t the fault of teachers, but a reality that all students are unique, learn differently, and excel at their own pace. DeVos will explain that there is significant \u201cdiversity\u201d in \u201ctoday\u2019s American public education, and that she has \u201cworked with many dedicated teachers who strive every day to help students achieve, fulfill their potential, and prepare them for the global challenges that they will face.\u201d Touching briefly\u00a0upon higher education and college affordability, DeVos will emphasize\u00a0that while college debt cannot magically disappear, transferring that debt to \u201cstruggling taxpayers without first addressing why tuition has gotten so high\u201d would be a \u201cmistake.\u201d The nominee is also expected to say not all students should pursue a four-year college education. \u201cPresident-elect Trump and I agree we need to support all post-secondary avenues, including trade and vocational schools, and community colleges,\u201d she plans to say, adding, \u201cOf course, on every one of these issues, Congress will play a vital role.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Democrats complained that committee members had not yet received the proper paperwork on DeVos from the Office of Government Ethics prior to the start of the hearing, and made every effort to protest to committee chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) that they should be permitted another round of questions. Democrats\u2019 questions for DeVos, who was introduced by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), were largely intended to have her appear inexperienced and unqualified to serve as head of the federal education department. The senators portrayed her as an extremely wealthy woman who might be entangled in multiple ethical conflicts due to her massive portfolio and contributions to the campaigns of many of the Republicans on the HELP committee. The senators also presented DeVos as having a mission to end federal funding to public schools through \u201cprivatization,\u201d i.e., allowing parents to utilize taxpayer-funded vouchers to \u201cfollow the child\u201d to a private or religious school of their choosing. DeVos responded that she believed in \u201cgreat\u201d public schools and intended to support all schools that are providing children with a good education based on \u201coutcomes.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (R-MA) had the following exchange with DeVos: Warren: Ms. DeVos, many of my Democratic colleagues have pointed out a lack of experience in K-12 public schools, but I\u2019d like to ask you about your qualifications for leading the nation on higher education. The Department of Education is in charge of making sure that the $150 billion that we invest in students each year gets into the right hands, and that students have the support they need to be able to pay back their student loans. The Secretary of Education is essentially responsible for managing a trillion dollar student loan bank, and distributing $30 billion in Pell grants to students each year. The financial futures of an entire generation of young people depend on your department getting that right. Now, Mrs. DeVos, do you have any direct experience with running a bank? DeVos: Senator, I do not. Warren: Aha, have you ever managed or overseen a trillion dollar loan program? DeVos: I have not. Warren: How about a billion dollar loan program? DeVos: I have not. Warren: Okay! So, no experience managing a program like this! How about participating in one? I think it\u2019s important for the person who is in charge of our financial aid programs to understand what it\u2019s like for students and their families who are struggling to pay for college. Mrs. DeVos, have you ever taken out a student loan from the federal government to help pay for college? DeVos: I have not. Warren: Have any of your children had to borrow money in order to go to college? DeVos: They have been fortunate not to. Warren: Aha, have you had any personal experience with the Pell grant? DeVos: Not personal experience, but certainly friends and, um, students with whom I\u2019ve worked. Warren: So, you have no personal experience with college financial aid or management of higher education. Mrs. DeVos, let\u2019s start with the basics. Do you support protecting federal taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse? DeVos: Absolutely. Warren: Oh, good. So do I. Because now we all know that President-elect Trump\u2019s experience with higher education was to create a fake university, which resulted in his paying $25 million to students that he cheated. So, I\u2019m curious about how the Trump administration would protect against waste, fraud, and abuse at similar for-profit colleges. So, here\u2019s my question: how do you plan to protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse by colleges that take in millions of dollars of federal student aid? DeVos: Senator, um, if confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant\u2026 Ranking member of the committee Sen. Patty Murray also asked DeVos if she would commit to not privatizing, or allowing taxpayer funding to \u201cfollow the child\u201d from public schools to private and religious schools. DeVos responded by saying she would commit to addressing the needs of \u201call parents and students,\u201d and added that some schools are not working for students. \u201cI take that is not being willing to commit to not privatize public schools?\u201d Murray asked. \u201cI guess I would not characterize it in that way,\u201d DeVos said. DeVos repeatedly mentioned that she intended to implement the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u201cas it was intended.\u201d Passed in December of 2015 and immediately signed into law by President Barack Obama, ESSA was pushed quickly through Congress by Sen. Alexander himself. He reminded the committee on several occasions during DeVos\u2019 hearing that the ESSA law was \u201cbipartisan\u201d and praised by Obama as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d Establishment Republicans contend the ESSA law \u201crepealed\u201d the Common Core mandate, however, many experts on the law say it actually cements the hotly debated standards in the states. ESSA, which replaced No Child Left Behind, requires every state to submit its plan for standards for approval to the U.S. Department of Education. Often referring to herself as a \u201cmom,\u201d DeVos portrayed herself during questioning as a \u201csensitive,\u201d concerned education reformer who wants only what\u2019s best for parents and children.",

My friend, and he\u2019s a dear friend of mine, and I\u2019m really surprised at his behavior, but my friend Senator Alexander limited senators to just one round of questions for Ms. DeVos and Mr. Price. With\u00a0 just five minutes for DeVos\u00a0 and seven minutes for Price. Ms. DeVos was at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon in a blatant attempt to prevent more Americans from watching the hearing and the news coverage of it.\u201d \u201cA senator and two members of the House were forced to wait until the end of the second day of Sen.

That\u2019s a direct contradiction of the same standard Senate Republicans asked for in 2009\u00a0 It\u2019s an affront to openness and transparency that the American people are entitled to.

      "content": " \u201cI worked with Betsy for years on school choice legislation, particularly regarding low-income students in the District of Columbia,\u201d said Joseph I. Lieberman, who stopped caucusing with Democratic senators after leading Democrats, including Sen. Barack Obama (D.-Ill.), worked against him in the 2006 primary. The former senator \u201cintroduced\u201d DeVos to the committee, along with Sen. Timothy E. Scott (R.-S.C.). Traditionally, senators from the nominee\u2019s home state introduce the nominee to a Senate committee, but neither Michigan Senator stepped up for the task. \u201cEverything I have seen tells me that Betsy is ready to take on this assignment and do it very well,\u201d Lieberman said in his introduction. \u201cI know some people are questioning her qualifications to be secretary of education. Too many of those questions seem to be based on the fact that she does not come from within the education establishment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, honestly, I believe that today, that is one of the most important qualifications you can have for the job.\u201d Lieberman told Breitbart News that after he left the Senate in 2013, he joined DeVos, who asked him to continue working with her as a member of the board of directors of the American Federation for Children. Then after her nomination was announced, he spoke to DeVos\u00a0and told her that if she thought it would help, he would testify on her behalf. \u201cI felt it was my responsibility. I know she is an educational reformer and that is what education needs.\u201d One of the disappointments about the DeVos confirmation process is that the nomination has become a partisan issue, with Democrats opposing the Michigan philanthropist based on politics, not policies, he said. Democrats used to be part of the school choice and school reform conversation, he said. \u201cI really regret that because, to me, school choice should at least be bi-partisan, especially when you think about how the Democratic Party in modern times has been the party of civil rights, women\u2019s rights, and gay rights, etc. We are talking about the rights of poor children to get a decent education; it ought to be a Democratic issue.\u201d Lieberman is now practicing law in New York City.",

      "author": "Neil W. McCabe",
      "content": " \u201cTrump is better than advertised,\u201d said Jerry Falwell Jr., an attorney who took over the Lynchburg, Virginia college his father founded in order to educate \u201cChampions for Christ\u201d and send them out into the secular world. \u201cI could not be more pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking the government from a bunch of incompetents, led by a bunch of amateurs, to being led by professionals from every industry and every walk of life.\u201d Falwell endorsed Trump just before the Iowa caucuses, despite the fact Trump\u2019s top rival for the GOP nomination, Texas Sen. R. Edward \u201cTed\u201d Cruz, launched his own bid for the White House at the Christian school. When Falwell made his decision, Trump had not fully articulated many of his positions and had not yet come down on what Falwell considered the right side of the issues, he said.\u00a0\u201cI just felt he had such a heart for the American people that I knew he would\u2013and sure enough he did. The lawyer, who was speaking to Breitbart News outside Washington\u2019s Trump International Hotel, said Trump\u2019s choice of Indiana Gov. Michael R. Pence was just one example of how the new president excelled expectations. \u201cConservatives on the Republican platform committee told me he was the first Republican candidate, since 2004, who allowed them to have free rein on the platform, \u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, he made it more conservative.\u201d Another example was when Trump released the names of serious conservatives he would consider for the Supreme Court, the Virginian said. Most Republicans politicians who claim to be pro-life are not, he said. \u201cYou see that in the last four decades in their court picks, you know those\u2013who when it came time to vote\u2013but, Trump? All a president can really do is choose the right people for the Supreme Court and he listed all the right ones.\u201d Falwell said he would not consider himself a candidate for an appointment to the federal bench because after 20 years of law practice, he took over Liberty 10 years ago, upon the passing of his father. It has been his consuming passion for the last decade. Now his focus is education and the nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education was another masterstroke by Trump, he said.\u00a0\u201cI think she has all the right ideas.\u201d DeVos understands that with a proper education, poor children trapped in sub-par public schools will have a chance to become independent adults, he said. Democrats oppose DeVos because they are afraid her reforms, such as supporting school choice and vouchers for private schools, will work, Falwell said. \u201cIf people in poverty start achieving on their own, then they don\u2019t need the Democrats anymore.\u201d Falwell\u2019s father was a pioneering television preacher and in 1980 led millions of Evangelical Christians into the political process to help elect President Ronald W. Reagan. The senior Falwell founded the Moral Majority to organize these Evangelicals. It should come as no surprise that he keyed in on Trump and his promise to repeal the so-called the Johnson Amendment. The Johnson Amendment is a provision in the federal law pushed by Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D.-Texas) that directs the IRS to take away a religious group\u2019s tax-free status if they get involved in politics. Falwell said Trump signaled to Evangelicals that he was serious about bringing them into the national conversation and lifting an unfair restriction on their speech rights. \u201cI endorsed early, but there were millions of Evangelicals who were way in front of their own leadership,\u201d he said. Everyday Evangelicals recognized that Trump was a flawed man, struggled to be a good man\u2013like them, Falwell said. \u201cEvangelicals vote based on all sorts of issues, not just a few social issues, but what the press did not understand is that Evangelical theology is based on the premise of forgiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what shocked them\u2013that the Evangelicals would push for someone who was not perfect\u2013but, that is the whole point of Christianity.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), says he is delaying the initial vote on Besty DeVos, nominee for secretary of education.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " His announcement that the vote on DeVos\u2019 nomination would be delayed by a week, until January 31, came Friday evening, reports the New York Times (NYT). Many Democrats, focused on DeVos\u2019 vast wealth and potential ethical conflicts of interest, objected to Alexander\u2019s insistence on only one round of questions for DeVos and argued they needed more time to have their questions answered. The Office of Government Ethics released its report for DeVos after her hearing last Tuesday. One of the concerns reported by the NYT\u00a0is that while DeVos said she had stepped down from the board of Neurocore, a Michigan company that operates biofeedback \u201cbrain performance centers\u201d that offer alternative treatment for children and adults with diagnoses of attention deficit disorder and autism, she says she will still keep her financial interest in the company, valued at between $5 million to $25 million. The NYT\u00a0continues: Ms. DeVos and her husband promote Neurocore heavily on the website for Windquest Group, a family office the couple use to manage some of their many investments. The website, for instance, includes a link to a Washington Post article about Kirk Cousins, a Washington Redskins quarterback who describes how he \u201cretrained\u201d his brain to better perform on the field by going to a Neurocore center. But the claims that Neurocore\u2019s methods can help children improve their performance in school could present a conflict for Ms. DeVos if she is confirmed as education secretary \u2014 especially given that the company is moving to expand its national reach. \u201cThis is not an appropriate investment for the secretary of education,\u201d Richard W. Painter, an ethics adviser to former President George W. Bush, reportedly told the NYT. He added: How schools respond to attention issues is a vitally important policy question and ties right into achievement. In my view, there should be support, including financial support, for alternatives to A.D.H.D. drug treatments that are covered by health insurance whereas alternatives often are not covered. \u201cThe secretary would be barred from participating in that important policy decision if she or her husband owned an interest in this company,\u201d he added. While Democrats\u2019 concerns about DeVos are centered on their support for increased federal funding for public schools and whether the nominee would be seeking to privatize the public education system, the grassroots base of the Republican Party say few of their questions were asked by Republican senators\u00a0during DeVos\u2019 confirmation. Dr. Karen Effrem, president of Florida-based Education Liberty Watch, observes to Breitbart News there was only one mention of the Common Core standards during DeVos\u2019 hearing, during a question posed by Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who asked DeVos if she intended to coerce Common Core in the states. The nominee answered, \u201cNo.\u201d While pleased with DeVos\u2019 answer to that single question, Effrem explains why it is not enough for the thousands of grassroots parents and other citizens who have been battling against the Common Core in their individual states: As stated in numerous writings by many anti-Common Core experts and activists, the foundation of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) mandates the Common Core by imposing secretarial veto of state plans and requiring states\u2019 compliance with eleven different federal laws all mandating statewide standards and tests that are Common Core even if not labeled such. Effrem continued that while DeVos said she would not support a federal school choice law, that response is in conflict to her other answers regarding \u201caccountability.\u201d Those answers \u201ccombined with her record of support for very regulated voucher plans in Indiana and Louisiana that require administration of the state (Common Core) tests \u2026 is extremely concerning for the autonomy and viability of private schools,\u201d she adds. Effrem says if DeVos is confirmed, she and her organization will closely monitor\u00a0how she implements ESSA; the ease with which she grants waivers for \u201cstate plans that seek to truly eliminate Common Core\u201d and its associated tests; and the degree to which she resists implementation of social and emotional learning (SEL) accountability schemes. \u201cThe Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was gutted by regulatory fiat during the Obama administration,\u201d Effrem notes. \u201cAt the very least, those privacy protections must be restored and preferably expanded to deal with all of the online data mining that is happening with technology-based education. Privacy was mentioned by Mr. Trump and was one of our questions.\u201d Parent activist Karen Braun, who writes at Stop Common Core in Michigan \u2013 DeVos\u2019 home state \u2013 says the nominee\u2019s hearing was \u201cpolitical theater and grandstanding by all involved.\u201d She notes that DeVos seems most concerned about parents\u2019 choice of the \u201clearning environment\u201d for their children, while the content of what is learned cannot be chosen. She continues: In her opening remarks DeVos made it clear what she believes: [DeVos said then,] \u201cWhy, in 2017, are we still questioning parents\u2019 ability to exercise educational choice for their children? I am a firm believer in parents choosing the learning environment that\u2019s best for their individual children.\u201d Choosing the learning environment is NOT true choice. For example, parents in a DeVos charter school in Grand Rapids wanted Common Core OUT of their school. The administration said it wasn\u2019t going to happen because \u201cwhat the state and Mr. DeVos want they are going to get.\u201d Braun observes that \u2013 though DeVos said on her new website that she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not a supporter of Common Core \u2013 she never supported the grassroots group that has been attempting to rid the state of the controversial reform. Ultimately, groups like Braun\u2019s and Effrem\u2019s would like to see the federal Education Department dismantled. \u201cI would have hoped to hear Mrs. DeVos say, in response to almost every question she was asked about education policy, \u2018That\u2019s none of my business \u2014 it\u2019s a state and local issue,\u2019\u201d senior fellow with American Principles Project Jane Robbins tells Breitbart News. \u201cShe gave the occasional nod to local control but didn\u2019t make it clear that under her guidance, the federal education establishment will be dismantled. That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d",

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " Boston Globe columnist Dante Ramos argued that the strong reaction from the left to Trump\u2019s nomination of DeVos reveals how irrational the debate on campus rape has become. You might not like DeVos\u2019s financial conflicts or her family\u2019s record on LGBT issues \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 but the #DearBetsy campaign and the controversy over her FIRE donations show how ideological and unmoored the campus rape debate has become. Many students accused of sexual assault aren\u2019t given legitimate legal hearings. Rather, schools investigate incidents internally, often times not telling offending students the details of the accusations against them. In the 2012 handbook, \u2018there was no requirement that copies of any \u2018substantiating materials\u2019 submitted by the accuser, or the names of any witnesses, be shown or provided to the accused any time,\u2019 wrote Judge F. Dennis Saylor, who reviewed Brandeis\u2019s procedures in connection with a lawsuit in federal court. Saylor went on, \u2018The accused had no right to confront or cross-examine the accuser, no right to call witnesses, and no right to confront or cross-examine the accuser\u2019s witnesses. The accused had no right to review all the evidence.\u2019 Ramos points out the simple reason why many, like DeVos, have been interested in ensuring that students accused of rape are given the fair due process proceedings that they deserve. This is so that innocent students aren\u2019t punished for crimes that they didn\u2019t commit. Campus disciplinary proceedings aren\u2019t court cases, but the underlying principle is the same: Standard rules of evidence and other protections for the accused keep things like false accusations or mistakes by authorities from hurting innocent people. Sexual assault is a real issue on college campuses. But the best way to protect all students would be to repeal the Obama-era policies that scaled back protections for students accused of sexual assault and replace them with fair due process investigations that protect the rights of both the accuser and the accused.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Indiana education activist Erin Tuttle says the nomination of Michigan school voucher supporter Betsy DeVos as department secretary and the cast of other Trump administration education staffers has turned out to be a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d to parent and citizen activists. These members of the Republican base voted for Donald Trump based on his promises to get the federal government out of education and back into the hands of local school districts and parents. Writing at Truth in American Education, Tuttle notes the pleas of the grassroots who put their faith in Trump \u201cwere not heard.\u201d \u201cA list of education staffers sworn in this past Friday indicates that the Department of Education (ED) will be aligned to DeVos\u2019 agenda, not Trump\u2019s,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven if DeVos is not confirmed, likeminded people will be controlling White House education policies.\u201d Though on the campaign trail Trump lambasted Jeb Bush for his promotion of Common Core, it turns out Bush couldn\u2019t be more \u201cexcited\u201d that DeVos, both a contributor to and board member of his Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE), is Trump\u2019s pick to run the federal education department. Somewhere toward the end of Trump\u2019s campaign, the candidate\u2019s rhetoric changed from referring to Common Core as a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and getting rid of the Department of Education, to school choice. And, while parents deciding their children\u2019s education is a goal for the grassroots, DeVos\u2019 statements about the topic indicate she is more concerned about parents choosing the actual physical location of their children\u2019s school, but not the content of what they learn. Tuttle writes that while DeVos is still in the midst of being confirmed as secretary, many of the new staffers already on board at the education department have connections to Bush and even Bill Gates, the philanthropist who served as the main source of private funding for Common Core \u2013 which Barack Obama supported and funded in his 2009 stimulus bill. She\u00a0explains: The grassroots are beginning to fear that Trump\u2019s criticism of Jeb\u2019s support for Common Core was all an act. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Jason Botel, executive director of the Maryland education advocacy group MarylandCAN (financed by Bill Gates), also joined the Trump administration as senior White House adviser for education. Like DeVos, he has a long history of supporting Common Core. Unlike DeVos, there is video to prove it. During a forum held by the Maryland Public Policy Institute in 2014, he stated that, not only was he \u201cexcited about Common Core,\u201d but that he would \u201cinsist on it\u201d as a tool to compare student data from state to state. Politico provides a list of new staffers in Trump\u2019s education department. Acting education secretary Phil Rosenfelt says Tuttle, is \u201ca career educrat who has worked as general counsel for the department for 40 years.\u201d Rosenfelt \u201cis considered to be the legal mastermind of No Child Left Behind\u2019s Title 1 program, Race to the Top, and the Obama waiver program which forced states into adopting Common Core,\u201d she adds. \u201cAs Arne Duncan\u2019s chief of staff once commented, Rosenfelt\u2019s \u201cfingerprints are all over education law and the federal role of education in this country.\u201d Also on board is Jim Manning, who worked in both the George W. Bush and Obama education departments and helped with the Trump transition team. Andrew Kossack, the former Indiana Department of Revenue commissioner and another former Jeb Bush foundation connection, is coming to work at the education department as well. \u201cThese people are not the change agents Trump promised,\u201d Tuttle writes. \u201cUnless something changes, education policy under a Trump presidency isn\u2019t going to be much different than Obama\u2019s.\u201d",

Expressing concerns about DeVos, two Republican senators \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins (ME) and Lisa Murkowski (AK) \u2014\u00a0said they would only vote for DeVos\u2019 approval in order to move her nomination to the full Senate. Both said they required further assessment in order to commit to approving her. The vote along party lines strikes a tense chord for the HELP Committee and its chairman, Sen.

Orrin Hatch (UT) voted by proxy to confirm DeVos. Committee chairman Alexander allowed ranking member Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) to make a motion to overrule the chair and to have the committee members vote on the motion. He then proceeded with another vote on DeVos\u2019 nomination with Hatch present. The official vote remained 12-11 in favor of her confirmation. The views of establishment Republicans and Democrats on DeVos\u2019 nomination have largely been the focus of mainstream media, while Breitbart News, the Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullmann, and conservatives such as Michelle Malkin have reported on opposition to DeVos by\u00a0the thousands of grassroots parent and citizen activists who have been battling establishment politicians over federal education overreach in programs such as Common Core. Though, upon her nomination, DeVos said she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not supportive of Common Core, she has supported, through funding and service on boards, many organizations that are vocal champions\u00a0of the federal initiative. Additionally, one of DeVos\u2019 main supporters is Jeb Bush, a prominent promoter of Common Core. Among the U.S. Department of Education staffers who have already been sworn in are supporters of Common Core and individuals with\u00a0connections to both Bush and Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who served as the primary source of private funding for Common Core. Democrats \u2013 largely ignoring national test scores showing the continued downturn of performance by the nation\u2019s public school students \u2013 have portrayed DeVos as unqualified to run a department that oversees the nation\u2019s public schools, since she has largely been an advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. Democrat senators also spent considerable time during committee debate discussing concerns that DeVos would not continue President Barack Obama\u2019s expansion of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Teachers\u2019 unions have strongly opposed DeVos\u2019 nomination. In a press release, the National Education Association (NEA) said, \u201cEducators, parents, students and public education advocates have emailed more than 1 million letters to the U.S. Senate urging senators to vote no on Betsy DeVos to become secretary of education.\u201d \u201cIn my years as a public education advocate, I have never witnessed this level of public outcry,\u201d said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, NEA president. \u201cClearly Betsy DeVos\u2019 nomination\u2014as unqualified and as unprepared as she is\u2014has touched a raw nerve not only with public education advocates like me but with the general public as well.\u201d \u201cIf confirmed, DeVos would become the first secretary of education with zero experience with public schools,\u201d she continued. \u201cShe\u2019s never worked in a public school. She\u2019s never been a teacher, a school administrator, nor served on any public board of education.\u201d Republicans, however, portray DeVos as a generous devotee of school choice and of giving parents the opportunity to remove their children from failing public schools through voucher systems. Senators such as Tim Scott (R-SC) say DeVos\u2019 skills in developing school choice programs would offer low-income, disadvantaged students an opportunity to get out of failing public schools that leave them without the opportunity to advance into higher education and meaningful careers. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) dismissed Democrats\u2019 concerns that DeVos would not work for a good public school system. \u201cI attended public schools, and my wife and I chose to send our children to public schools and universities,\u201d Roberts said in a statement following the committee\u2019s vote. \u201cI understand the importance and proud tradition of public schools in Kansas. I want to ensure every child receives a high-quality education.\u201d \u201cI welcome the opportunity to work with Mrs. DeVos to ensure Kansans can make their own decisions about the best way to improve education, free from federal interference,\u201d Roberts added. \u201cThe President and his team fully understand that a one-size-fits-all education system just does not work. I have spoken with Mrs. DeVos numerous times, and I am confident she is the right person for the job. I urge my colleagues to quickly confirm her.\u201d",

However, if Sessions is confirmed by the Senate next, the GOP would be left with one less senator, leaving DeVos with a failing vote of 49-50. According to the report, Senate leadership has scheduled the DeVos nomination to precede that of Sessions since she might need his vote in order to pave the way for Pence to break a tie. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, however, said he is still encouraged, says the New York Times. \u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education,\u201d he said.

      "content": " A spokesman for the vice president confirmed to Breitbart News that Pence would be in attendance for the U.S. Senate vote on DeVos. The Senate holds a 52-48 Republican majority, but on Wednesday, two Republican senators made known that each will vote against DeVos in a floor confirmation vote. Liberal Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are those two senators who\u00a0could force Pence to break a tie. Collins declared that she cannot and will not support DeVos. Murkowski said she tried to \u201cget to yes\u201d but could not. Should the vote come down 50-50, Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, could provide the tie-breaking vote on confirmation. Trump nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has yet to be confirmed. He is among the 52 Republicans in the Senate, and if\u00a0Collins and Murkowski stand firm in their determination to vote against DeVos, Sessions\u2019 positive vote to confirm DeVos would be needed just to reach a 50-50 tie, assuming remaining senators vote along party lines. The Senate will likely hold the vote to confirm Sessions until after the vote on DeVos, should his vote be needed to confirm her. It remains to be seen whether any Democrats will break ranks and vote for DeVos. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of DeVos\u2019 pending confirmation, \u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education.\u201d Opponents of Common Core curriculum have criticized a DeVos confirmation. She herself has vehemently denied support for Common Core since her nomination. Breitbart News reported that she does enjoy the support of Common Core proponent Jeb Bush. DeVos has also been described as an ardent supporter of school choice, a quality that has drawn sharp opposition from Democrats and teachers unions. As of Thursday afternoon, the vote on DeVos had been postponed until Monday,\u00a0according to the Hill. While the Senate will likely be able to vote on DeVos by Saturday, some Republican senators needed to secure the votes to confirm DeVos, or at least reach a tie, are expected to be absent. A vote in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee to advance DeVos\u2019s confirmation to a full Senate vote revealed straight party-line positions on selection for the secretary of education, 12-11.

There is also opposition by another billionaire in the school choice movement, Eli Broad, who has given money to both Democrats and Republicans.",

      "content": " Education historically works best when it is localized based on the challenges, needs and the possibilities for success. In short, it belongs at the state and local level. The battle in Washington, D.C. is new but the ongoing battle at the state level in Ohio is not. The teacher\u2019s union, supported by powerful players within the Ohio Department of Education (ODE), including some Republicans, mirrors the very public federal level battle under way at this moment. It\u2019s common thought that the Republicans are on the side of school choice, but in Ohio, the Department of Education and Senate Education Chairman Peggy Lehner (R-OH-6) are, in fact, cohorts in opposition to school choice and equal application of standards to the various types of charter schools in the state. An Ohio-based online investigative website, 3rd Rail Politics, has researched and developed a timeline that brings into question the associations between Republican State Sen. Peggy Lehner and the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. Over the course of several months, fact-based, direct and troubling ties have been established. Often when politics, policy and private sector collide one should follow the money and examine who would benefits from the particular policies or actions taken in the halls of government and government committees. Following the money and the familial connection, Peggy Lehner is the sister of\u00a0Kate Walsh\u00a0who has been paid by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute for policy work. It is fair to examine the rising influence of an outside third party, the Fordham Institute in this case, on the Ohio Department of Education and the Senate Education Committee. A key question for Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich, the Ohio Department of Education, and the Ohio Senate Education Chairman Peggy Lehner is why administrative rules are not being applied equally to all eSchools, and why these rules are being applied contrary to a\u00a0contract with the state\u2019s largest electronic classroom, ECOT. When reached for comment, ECOT\u2019s counsel, Marion H. Little, a partner with the law firm of Zeiger, Tigges & Little, LLP, had this to say: ODE is attempting to usurp the role of the Ohio legislature. Purposefully ignoring both the legislative and administrative law process, ODE is manufacturing its own law to achieve the apparent objective of effectively eliminating eSchools for most Ohio students. It\u2019s typical that Republicans stand on the side of choice and opportunity when it comes to education from grades K-12, but in Ohio, it seems many on all sides, including the teacher\u2019s union, stand on the side of money and profit over options and opportunity for students. A live in-depth on-air discussion will occur this Friday night on the David Webb Show on SiriusXM Patriot\u00a0at 9PM ET with Ohio state representatives and national spokespersons within the school choice movement. Listeners are encouraged to call in at 866-957-2874, because in the end this is about their children.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " It\u2019s unusual for an education secretary nominee to be so controversial. Here\u2019s why DeVos\u2019 nomination is the subject of much debate: 1 \u00a0Establishment politicians and traditional media have once again ignored grassroots activists who have been battling against federal overreach in education for nearly a decade. These conservative activists, however, are among the most vocal opponents to DeVos\u2019 nomination, and they want the federal Department of Education to be dismantled. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump talked about the same idea and also said Common Core was a \u201cdisaster.\u201d DeVos, however, has been a prominent supporter \u2013 with both her money and her service \u2013 of groups that have championed Common Core. Many establishment Republican politicians who have supported Common Core are endorsing DeVos. Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush failed to achieve his party\u2019s nomination mainly because of his stance on two issues: immigration and Common Core. Nevertheless, Bush says he is so \u201cexcited\u201d about the nomination of DeVos \u2013 who has been a generous contributor and board member to his education foundation. Many of those who assisted with the education transition team and some who are now already sworn in as education department staff members are Bush\u2019s colleagues \u2013 and Common Core supporters. Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 a vocal supporter of Common Core \u2013 has ramped up support for DeVos as her nomination appeared to be hanging by a thread. Kasich referred to the organized parents in his state who were fighting to repeal Common Core as \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201ca runaway internet campaign.\u201d During the Republican National Convention last year, DeVos was an at-large delegate for Kasich. DeVos\u2019 responses to questions from Senate Democrats show the education secretary nominee plans to make implementation of the massive federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) a priority \u2013 and that\u2019s what worries the thousands of grassroots education activists who are largely the base of the Republican Party. Though DeVos responded to a question about Common Core with the observation that \u201cit is the job of states to set\u201d their standards, she began her response with the statement, \u201cIf confirmed, I will implement the statutory requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\u2026\u201d As American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana education activist Erin Tuttle point out, ESSA requires every state to submit its plan for standards for approval to the U.S. Department of Education. \u201cESSA, which replaces NCLB, does mandate alignment,\u201d they write. \u201cIf she\u2019s confirmed, I hope Mrs. DeVos will realize that too many states have remained in Common Core because of all the federal pressure and threats \u2013 yes, including under ESSA \u2013 that incentivize them to do so,\u201d Robbins tells Breitbart News. \u201cShe should vow to remove those pressure points and make it clear to states that the feds won\u2019t penalize them in any way if they replace Common Core with good standards. If she does that, there may be a stampede for the exits. That would be a great thing for our students.\u201d 2 \u00a0Many Americans don\u2019t understand what \u201cschool choice\u201d means. Betsy DeVos, Jeb Bush, and many establishment politicians and education elites would have Americans believe \u201cschool choice\u201d automatically translates into \u201ceducation freedom.\u201d Various mechanisms, however, exist to create school choice, and school vouchers, one of the most oft-mentioned \u2013 if incentivized by the federal government \u2013 could increase regulation of private and religious schools and even homeschooling across the United States. Because vouchers are a transfer of taxpayer funds, the schools that accept them could open themselves up to more regulation regarding curriculum, testing, and federal mandates \u2013 all in the name of \u201caccountability.\u201d In a column at Truth in American Education, Robbins observes that Mike Petrilli of the pro-Common Core and Bill Gates-funded Fordham Institute \u201cthinks this increased regulation of private schools is a good thing, and a reason to support DeVos.\u201d \u201cOf course, if private schools must administer the state tests, they must teach Common Core \u2013 in other words, they must become just like the public schools parents are trying to escape,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat kind of \u2018choice\u2019 is this?\u201d Both parties want to be in control of education. The GOP would like to have control over the workforce that could be developed from students living in America in the same way the left wants to have control over\u00a0political ideology taught in public schools. In the end, however, neither group puts the needs of students and their parents\u2019 decisions for their education first. 3 \u00a0The left is hysterical about everything to do with Donald Trump. The left\u2019s meltdown over Trump\u2019s presidency is a common thread throughout many issues. Just as leftwing women\u00a0are\u00a0rushing to stock up on a four-year supply of birth control because they\u00a0believe Trump will ban contraceptives,\u00a0 media have focused on DeVos\u2019 fondness for Christian schools and have decided she will attempt to impose her Christian views on every student in America. However, the Washington Post reports that Fuller Seminary president Rich Mouw, who served on a committee with DeVos, said about her, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider her to be right wing. She\u2019s a classic free-enterprise conservative. She takes public life, art and politics very seriously.\u201d The report continues: DeVos did not support Trump\u2019s candidacy, telling the Washington Examiner in March that he \u201cdoes not represent the Republican Party.\u201d Her family foundation has\u00a0donated between $10,000-$25,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to an analysis by\u00a0The Washington Post. DeVos is like a mix between the philanthropic efforts of Melinda Gates and the business-mindedness of Mitt Romney, said Shirley Hoogstra, president of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities, an umbrella for Christian schools. It\u2019s unclear whether DeVos will fit in with Trump\u2019s other cabinet choice, like incoming White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. 4 \u00a0Democrats are receiving thousands of phone calls, emails, texts, and faxes from supporters of the teachers\u2019 unions fearful that DeVos will enact national privatization of public schools. According to The Hill: DeVos wasn\u2019t initially expected to be one of Trump\u2019s more controversial picks, but her nomination has been a lightning rod for criticism from both sides of the aisle as well as public school advocates, teachers unions and disability rights groups. \u2026 DeVos\u2019s nomination has rankled Democrats, who have framed her as an opponent of public schools. The billionaire GOP donor has been a vocal supporter of charter schools and school choice, which gives parents an alternative by opting for a charter or private school. 5 \u00a0DeVos has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican senators. Yes, Democrats are guilty of this, too. If nothing else, DeVos\u2019 donations to many of the Republicans who will be voting for her continues the image of the Beltway \u201cswamp\u201d that Trump has vowed to drain as president. \u201cGiven all the DeVos money floating around Washington, how likely are Republican senators to ask her some fair but critical questions about a woman who would oversee some $70 billion in annual public funding and 5,000 public employees?\u201d asks Joy Pullmann, managing editor\u00a0at The Federalist.",

Pence, who presided over the voting as the President of the Senate. A reporter asked Scott if he thought the Democrats won a moral victory because they forced the GOP to bring Pence to the Capitol to cast the deciding vote. \u201cNot unless you think the Falcons won a moral victory because they were leading for three-quarters,\u201d the senator said. The Atlanta Falcons were leading the New England Patriots in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl 28-3, before the Patriots came back to win the game in overtime, 34-28. Leading up to the vote, Senate Democrats kept the body in session by speaking against DeVos throughout the night and into the morning.\u00a0Shortly before the chamber was called to order for the confirmation confrontation, Scott got himself recognized and spoke in favor of President Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee. \u201cEducation is the closest thing to magic in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI experienced that magic as a kid growing up in a single-parent household, mired in poverty, disillusioned about life; I nearly flunked out as a freshman.\u201d The senator told his colleagues from the Senate floor public education is the reason he went from a kid about to drop out of high school to become a senator. But, other children will not get that opportunity if their schools are like the ones in Detroit, where nine percent of black students meet the standard for English, 13 percent of white students meet or exceed the standard for English, and only 12.5 percent meet or exceed the standard for English. \u201cBut far too many kids, too many millions of kids today, do not have a quality educational choice in their communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that every child in every zip code has a quality choice.\u201d The vice-president brought theater to the proceedings, but there was no drama. The GOP holds a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate and no Republican was willing to hand the Democrats a scalp as the third Republican to defect. After it was over, Scott told reporters that all that mattered was getting to 51 votes, the simple majority required. The vast majority of the opponents to DeVos were people who supported the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates, so the fight over the DeVos nomination was not really about education or DeVos, as much as it was about Senate Democrats responding to their base, he said. \u201cThe Democrats are synchronized, coordinated and animated.\u201d The senator said the Democratic campaign against DeVos was very impressive. \u201cThe use of misinformation leading to false conclusions has empowered their side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been an effective political tool\u2013I think it\u2019s been a little light on actual facts. But there is a lathering effect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be our responsibility\u00a0to get out the truth and the good information.\u201d Scott said now that DeVos is setting up shop he is confident that she will staff the department with quality people, who are equality reform-minded. \u201cI think she is going to do a very good job over there surrounding herself with the right folks that have expertise in their specific areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to be pleasantly surprised at how effective the Department of Education is under her leadership.\u201d",

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " But Attorney General Jeff Sessions prevailed in the closed-door dispute, and with aid from Trump,\u00a0persuaded\u00a0Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to support a reform of the Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy. The reform, which may be unveiled tomorrow, will junk Obama\u2019s May 2016 directive which effectively\u00a0declares that children can change their sex by simply declaring they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the other sex. That rule, if imposed nationwide by judges, would give federal police power to the nation\u2019s small population of \u201ctransgender\u201d men and women, and would prevent Americans from assembling in single-sex groups and institutions \u2014 such as athletic leagues and shower rooms \u2014 or from expressing their preference for single-sex institutions. Critics say that the endorsement of \u201cgender identity\u201d by federal judges would also kill laws and civic practices which evolved to help the two equal and different sexes complement each other in a heterosexual\u00a0society built on families and child rearing. That anti-heterosexual process has already started in the states and has forced the Boy Scouts to accept girls. According to the New York Times, DeVos managed to ensure that the new policy includes an indirect federal endorsement of the idea that children have a right to have school officials support their desire to live as members of the other sex.\u00a0The new policy, says the New York Times, declares that\u00a0\u201cSchools must ensure that transgender students, like all students, are able to learn in a safe environment.\u201d The future courtroom impact of this endorsement is unclear. A very small proportion of Americans tries to live as members of the opposite sex. For example, only\u00a0about 1-in-2,400 Americans have changed their names from one sex to the other, according to a study of the 2010 census. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration has decided to let states decide how to handle the demand for legal rights for people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\u00a0\u201cSo while we have further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president\u2019s view has been for a long time, that this is not something the federal government should be involved in, that this is a states\u2019 rights issue,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Spicer downplayed the reported conflict over DeVos\u2019 support for the claim of \u201cgender identity.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no daylight between anybody \u2014 between the president, between any of the secretaries,\u201d he told reporters at the midday press conference. I think there\u2019s been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations \u2014 or between the exact wording. But as far as the conclusions go, I\u2019ve made this clear and the president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer of states\u2019 rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level. The New York Times released only a small fragment of Trump\u2019s pending policy document: School administrators, parents and students have expressed varying views on the legal issues arising in this setting. They have also struggled to understand and apply the statements of policy and guidance. Trump\u2019s deference to the states will force the cancellation of the federal\u00a0\u201cgender identity\u201d\u00a0policy announced\u00a0in May 2016 by Obama\u2019s deputies. Numerous states are already debating how sex should be defined. In North Carolina, for example, the GOP-drafted HB2\u00a0law says sex is determined by biology, and that people can change their legal sex after surgery. That clear biology-based distinction is strongly\u00a0opposed by gay advocacy groups, who say government should enforce individuals\u2019 flexible \u201cgender identity\u201d preferences.\u00a0The gay groups helped lead an economic boycott of the state in 2016. Other states,\u00a0such as Oregon\u00a0and Washington have decided that people \u2014 including children \u2014 have a fundamental right to change their legal sex, regardless of the impact on civic society. Also, Texas is leading a coalition of states which has persuaded a lower-court judge to freeze Obama\u2019s May directive. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a lawsuit from a young woman in Virginia who wants the federal government to order school officials \u2014 and the youths in her school \u2014 to agree that she is a he, even in science class. The court has not revealed where it stands on the \u201cgender identity\u201d issue, but in 2015, the Court changed the definition of marriage nationwide so that states could not define marriage as a mixed-sex relationship. Since\u00a0Trump\u2019s election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped defeat Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Less than one-quarter of Americans support the \u201cgender-identity\u201d plan pushed by gay groups and by Obama, which would allow transgender\u00a0activists to sue single-sex institutions \u2014 such as sports leagues, public shower-rooms, and women\u2019s shelters \u00a0\u2014 until they treat both biological sexes as interchangeable.

Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) introduced the bill, H.R. 899, in February. The measure consists of only one sentence: \u201cThe Department of Education Shall Terminate on December 31, 2018.\u201d In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Massie said people are taking his bill seriously. \u201cI think the reason people have to take this bill seriously now, is because, for the first time since Ronald Reagan, we have a president in the White House who would conceivably sign this bill,\u201d he explained. Massie has considered the dismantling of the federal education department. \u201cWhat I would propose is \u2013 over the course of the next two years \u2013 Betsy DeVos, the president, and Congress should work to either devolve those programs to the states, or transfer the authority for those programs to other departments,\u201d he explained. \u201cIdeally, all of these programs would be administered at the state level, including the authority for the tax collection.

And the money that\u2019s wasted there is not the worst part of it. The worst part of it is they control 10 percent of education funding, but \u2013 through that 10 percent of education funding \u2013 they control the curriculum and what and how our teachers are teaching. \u201cSo, my bill is not aimed at that 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t seek to reduce educational spending. I\u2019d like to see the control of that 10 percent go back to the states so that these 4,500 bureaucrats aren\u2019t controlling the entire curriculum back in our schools in Kentucky.\u201d The seven original co-sponsors of the bill are Rep.

      "author": "Assemblyman Tim Donnelly",
      "content": " The 62-page spending plan released Thursday outlines the president\u2019s priorities to Congress. The plan is likely to give Trump supporters plenty to cheer\u2014while making Democrats and political insiders groan. Border security is one area that President Trump has put his money where his mouth is. Almost $4.8 billion in increased border infrastructure (i.e. \u201cthe wall\u201d) and enforcement of immigration laws represent a dramatic increase in funding, which will benefit California more than any other state. The proposed funding includes: One idea in Trump\u2019s budget that has been less than popular with law enforcement is the proposed elimination of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which reimburses local sheriffs and police departments close to $210 million per year for detaining criminal aliens for more than 4 days in a local jail. Every president since Clinton created the program has marked it for elimination, but so far it has survived \u2014 in large part because it has been become a reliable funding stream for local law enforcement when state and country resources are scarce. The bipartisan push-back on scrapping SCAAP in California will likely be fierce, because California \u2014 home to more criminal aliens than any other state \u2014 receives the lion\u2019s share of the funding. The\u00a0Sacramento Bee reported the hysterical reactions of California\u2019s U.S. Senators, both Democrats. Sen\u00a0Dianne Feinstein said: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute travesty for California and every state or community that thought they had a true partner in the federal government.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris claimed:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s clear from this proposal, President Trump does not value government\u2019s essential functions of public health, public safety, and public education.\u201d According to an NPR report aired on 89.3 KPCC\u00a0(and NPR, too, faces an end to federal funding),\u00a0President Trump wants to cut the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget by almost a third (31 percent), and \u201cput states in charge of enforcing federal environmental laws, which is a philosophy championed by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.\u201d If states want to go above and beyond Federal EPA requirements, they\u2019re welcome to do so \u2014 as long as they can fund it. Trump\u2019s focus on EPA funding is significant to California,\u00a0since CalEPA receives almost 12% of its funding from the federal government. The heavy-handed enforcement tactics of state agencies like the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) could be dramatically curtailed by the cuts. Other proposed cuts include $250 million to California to a teacher\u2019s training program that did not meet the approval of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. According to the Los Angeles Times, DeVos said, \u201cTaxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent efficiently and effectively. While California will be harder hit than any other state by the proposed cuts \u2014 with the elimination of some programs and severe cuts to others \u2014 there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. By scaling back the size of funding to CalEPA and therefore cutting\u00a0CARB and other job-killing bureaucracies, and actually securing the border rather than simply funding programs like SCAAP as token reimbursement, President Trump is arguably sending a signal that he\u2019s serious about real-world results \u2014 not the paper progress\u00a0favored by government program administrators anxious to justify the existence of their programs.",

You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I\u2019ve always said it, I\u2019ve been saying it during the campaign, and we\u2019re doing it. This month, concerns had arisen about Trump\u2019s commitment to his oft-repeated campaign promise to end Common Core. Toward the tail end of his campaign, Trump\u2019s message shifted from the termination of the controversial standards to school choice. American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty\u00a0welcomes the return of Trump\u2019s attention to the problematic standards that were quickly adopted by states in exchange for\u00a0the promise of federal cash and relief from onerous federal regulations. \u201cMore than any other President \u2014 or even presidential candidate \u2014 ever, Donald Trump has empathized with our citizens, particularly parents, who have seen firsthand the damage done by federal efforts to shape and dictate education policy,\u201d McGroarty said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s comments show that President Trump has not forgotten his promise to end Common Core and return to local control of education,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is taking seriously the assurance he made in his Inaugural Address, \u2018Today\u2026 we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American people.\u2019\u201d Trump also said his education secretary Betsy DeVos is \u201cdoing a terrific job.\u201d \u201cHighly respected, tremendous track record, but she\u2019s got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me, she\u2019s got one of the toughest jobs,\u201d the president added. DeVos went to Washington, D.C., to assume her post after working on school choice and school voucher programs in her home state of Michigan. While many in Trump\u2019s base believe school choice is a desirable goal, the view of conservatives and libertarians is that school choice can best be achieved naturally with the elimination of the federal education department. A recent Heritage Foundation panel of education policy professionals urged the Trump administration and Washington politicians to refrain from making school choice a federal program. DeVos has drawn concern over some of her decisions and comments since assuming her post. For example, the secretary has\u00a0surrounded\u00a0herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Jeb Bush \u2013 a vocal proponent of Common Core \u2013 as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed but then simply \u201crebranded.\u201d DeVos also recently\u00a0said\u00a0the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u201cessentially does away with the notion of a Common Core,\u201d a statement\u00a0many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have flatly\u00a0rejected. Though ESSA still requires the federal education department to approve of state education plans, DeVos, nevertheless, also said in a recent speech, \u201cI share the founders\u2019 belief that those closest to problems usually know best how to solve them.\u201d Debbie Higginbotham, a spokesperson for Florida Parents RISE, tells Breitbart News DeVos\u2019s comments suggest much ambiguity. \u201cSecretary Devos\u2019s equating ESSA with \u2018federalism\u2019 as it relates to education is the central problem we all face,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cThere is zero provision in the Constitution, deliberately so by the founders, for the federal government to have any purview over education.\u00a0It was \u2013 and is \u2013 an issue of local control and sovereignty.\u201d Higginbotham also argues that DeVos\u2019s claim she is a federalist is in sharp contrast to the ESSA law: It\u2019s disturbing for the reason that if she holds a true belief in federalism, then she would urge Congress to write a bill that would truly allow the states to: take care of their students with proven, challenging educational standards; eliminate high stakes testing; invite local control of education policy at the school board level; and issue no penalty to the states for replacing the Common Core State Standards with a set of standards of their choice. McGroarty says Trump\u2019s leadership on the elimination of Common Core in the states is vital from this point forward. \u201cEvery Swamp creature will unite to fight against the president on this, so his leadership will be critical,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe look forward to seeing what steps the Trump Administration will take in the coming months to take power away from Washington D.C. and return it to parents.\u201d",

      "content": " Due to the constant wave of death threats by progressives, the U.S. Marshals service was forced to reevaluate the usual security plans for education department leaders. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has received far more death threats than any past Ed Secs, the U.S. Marshals told the Washington Post. In February, DeVos, a supporter of charter schools, was accosted by a group of progressive protesters who barred her entry to Jefferson Middle School Academy in D.C. The protesters carried signs reading \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d and \u201cFeminists Are the Majority.\u201d At least one screamed, \u201cShame!\u201d at DeVos when the newly emplaced Ed Sec arrived at the school. The protesters prevented DeVos from entering the school\u2019s front doors and she had to be let in through a back entrance, surrounded by security. Past Ed Secs garnered far less public notice and were usually protected at much less cost by Department of Education employees, some of whom were once Secret Service agents. But due to the extreme level of threats, DeVos\u2019s security was transferred to the U.S. Marshals. The extreme costs have been incurred because the Marshals service had to hire additional employees to handle the heightened security plans. And the costs reported thus far will increase as the year rolls on, according to sources. Trump\u2019s education chief is opposed by the country\u2019s teachers unions as well as those looking to keep education controlled from Washington D.C.

      "content": " Thomas Klocke, a straight male student at UTA, committed suicide after being punished for allegedly using homophobic slurs against a gay student, despite the fact that the university administrators who investigated the case\u00a0admitted that\u00a0there was no evidence to back up the allegation. The story was originally reported by Ashe Schow at Watchdog,\u00a0and is worth reading in its full, shocking detail. The accusation was made against Klocke by a gay male student at UTA, who claimed that during class, Klocke had typed \u201cgays should die\u201d into his laptop, called him a \u201cfaggot,\u201d and told him to kill himself . No evidence was provided for these claims, and, according to Watchdog, the professor who was present at the time did not even provide a witness statement. Klocke had a very\u00a0different story. According to him, the gay student had made unwelcome sexual advances towards him, which he rebuffed. A lawsuit currently underway against the college from the victim\u2019s family alleges that the rejection prompted the gay student to make up his accusation. There appears to have been no adherence to proper procedure in the course of the accusation.\u00a0In addition to the apparent disregard for evidence, to the point of not seeking a witness statement from the professor, it seems UTA\u2019s Title IX coordinator was not informed of the accusations.\u00a0This could be a major problem for UTA, which, as a public university, is bound by the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Under UTA\u2019s policies, the Title IX coordinator should have been responsible for overseeing the investigation and assigning an investigator. Instead, Klocke\u2019s punishment was pushed through by\u00a0Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Heather Snow, a friend of the accuser. (They were reportedly on first-name terms).\u00a0Extraordinarily, Snow was allowed to both draft the gay student\u2019s accusations against Klocke\u00a0and\u00a0take charge of the disciplinary procedures against him. The violations of due process didn\u2019t end there. Klocke was prohibited from contacting potential witnesses from his class. He was not given a hearing to defend himself. He was never informed that he was facing a Title IX investigation, or told what his rights were. Inevitably, the administration found Klocke guilty of harassment, despite the lack of evidence, and placed on disciplinary probation. A few days later, Klocke committed suicide. UTA has called the incident \u201chearbreaking,\u201d but insists that the university \u201cfollowed its policies and procedures.\u201d They are\u00a0now facing a lawsuit from his father, who alleges that his son was discriminated against. The story is shocking in the extent of the violations that are alleged to have taken place. It is also a symptom of a much wider problem on American college campuses, one that was created during the Obama administration and could \u2013 and should \u2013 be ended by President Trump. Title IX is an amendment to an education bill passed in 1972, banning discrimination on the basis of sex in education. It has since vastly expanded in scope, giving college administrators the power to investigate and punish alleged instances of sexual abuse and harassment. In recent years, these investigations have become kangaroo courts, where students \u2013 mostly white and male \u2013 are denied due process. Unlike courts, where charges of rape and sexual abuse are contested by lawyers and subject to the strict test of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty,\u201d students facing sexual abuse allegations on a college campus are frequently found guilty and expelled based on scant evidence, by \u201ctribunals\u201d made up of legally untrained college administrators and faculty members. Title IX overreach did not begin under President Obama \u2014 but it was kicked into overdrive. In 2011, the Office of Civil Rights sent a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter to colleges warning them that failure to tackle the problem of sexual assault on campus would henceforward be considered a Title IX violation, opening colleges up to penalties if they failed to address the issue. The letter emerged in an atmosphere of panic over sexual assault on campus, whipped up by left-wing feminists who vastly\u00a0overestimated its frequency. The OCR\u2019s letter claimed that 1 in 5 women are victims of sexual assault in campus, a huge overestimation which has since been debunked. Faced with the threat of the federal government, colleges leaped to take action. Kangaroo courts were the disastrous result. In some cases, colleges displayed a transparent hunger to punish students, perhaps to prove to the government that they are tackling the problem.\u00a0In one notorious case, a student at Colorado State University was expelled for raping his girlfriend even though his girlfriend never accused him of such a crime, and even told the college \u201cI\u2019m fine and wasn\u2019t raped.\u201d The rapid growth of kangaroo courts on American colleges has led to a constant stream of stories describing miscarriages of justice on campus. Falsely accused students have started winning\u00a0lawsuits against their colleges, with multiple judges condemning the lack of due process at universities. As long as the OCR\u2019s 2011 letter stands, the travesties of justice are likely to continue. But why should it? It would be very easy for the Trump administration to send a message to colleges that it will no longer tolerate wrongful punishments for the most heinous of crimes based on threadbare evidence. The Office of Civil Rights is controlled by the Department of Education, which is of course controlled by Betsy DeVos, an appointee who was vigorously protested by the left. Congressional Democrats, still committed to the Obama administration\u2019s disastrous crusade against sexual assault on campus, grilled DeVos on the question of Title IX enforcement during her confirmation hearing. DeVos, a donor to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a group that campaigns against Title IX overreach, is certainly aware of the problem.\u00a0When asked whether she would uphold the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 guidance during her confirmation hearings, DeVos did not indicate that she would, instead saying: Senator, I know that there\u2019s a lot of conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance, and if confirmed I would look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinions and understand the issues from the higher ed institutions that are charged with resolving these and addressing them. And I would look forward to working together to find some resolutions. DeVos did not clearly come out against the 2011 guidance, perhaps to avoid putting her already-fraught confirmation hearing in jeopardy. She was probably right \u2013 the left is bizarrely committed to the failed policy, and DeVos\u2019 refusal to endorse it was enough to spark panicked articles from left-wing publications. Even her donation to FIRE caused alarm\u00a0from feminists. While DeVos\u2019 hesitation to condemn the 2011 letter outright was understandable during her confirmation hearings, the tragedy at UTA shows that the time for hesitation is over.\u00a0Title IX overreach is one of the greatest travesties of justice in modern American history, and has now led to the suicide of a male student. At the very least, UTA\u2019s shocking failure must be roundly condemned by the administration. But at the same time, the administration should go further, and seek to reverse the disastrous guidelines created in 2011. Fully resolving the problem will likely take more than that, of course: college campuses have become mini-swamps, filled with biased, politically-motivated administrators. Much of the Title IX injustices\u00a0are driven by ideological feminists on campus. That will take more time to solve, and more effort at the local level. Nonetheless, reversing the 2011 guidance would be a huge step in the right direction. Crucially, Trump does not need congressional approval to do so. The guidelines were created by a letter from the Obama administration, and can be reversed by a letter from the Trump administration. With the gridlock in congress, it would be a significant achievement in Trump\u2019s first 100 days. 100-days achievements aside, the administration must take action soon,\u00a0before another tragedy like the case of Thomas Klocke. The travesty of justice on American campuses cannot be allowed to continue.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased, of course, that our new president is in there building the team that he believes he needs in order to fulfill promises to the American electorate, to make America great again, and I\u2019m very, very happy that he\u2019s there,\u201d said Palin. LISTEN:  She said she found the idea of giving a simplistic letter grade to the Trump administration annoying, preferring to say President Trump is doing \u201cvery well.\u201d \u201cRemember, those of you who maybe still aren\u2019t aboard the Trump Train but know that the Trump movement had to be ushered in, in order to get rid of the status quo that was harming America, keep doing your ABCs and remember what that was: it was Anybody but Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cSo stick with your little alphabet analogy there. Those who are asking for a grade of this administration, just keep remembering it could have been Clinton.\u201d Palin applauded Marlow\u2019s point that arguing over\u00a0the fine points of Trump\u2019s policy, and even dealing with some disappointments, should be vastly preferable for conservatives over fighting for their political lives \u2013 and even basic constitutional freedoms, like free speech \u2013 under a Clinton presidency. She suggested imagining what sort of Supreme Court justice would currently be taking the late Antonin Scalia\u2019s place under President Hillary Clinton. Marlow noted that Palin has been \u201cquite critical in recent days\u201d of President Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. \u201cShe said, \u2018Common Core now doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 or something, and you went buck wild on her,\u201d Marlow recalled. \u201cI sure did!\u201d Palin cheerfully agreed. \u201cShe said that, in fact, Common Core hasn\u2019t really existed for the past couple of years. I would ask, do these politicians, do these elitist bureaucrats, do they even send their children or grandchildren, are they in public schools? When our kids and our grandkids come home and we sit down with them each night, still to this day, and we work with them on their homework, the Common Core curriculum is alive and not well in the classroom.\u201d \u201cIf the leader now of the education sector of our country would deny that Common Core is in existence, she needs to try to tell that to our really, really great public school teachers, who still have to explain and kind of apologize to the public school parents \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 as to why the curriculum is as confusing and burdensome and less freeing for our teachers, who know what our students need best, as do the parents. Good schoolteachers still have to explain to us that under Common Core, these requirements are quite burdensome and nonsensical,\u201d she said. She accused DeVos of being \u201creally out of touch\u201d for denying all of this was happening. Palin followed up with some of the highlights of Trump\u2019s first hundred days, beginning with the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful \u2013 we all should be \u2013 that he\u2019s in there now,\u201d she said. She also praised Trump\u2019s commitment to change President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201clead from behind\u201d foreign policy, \u201cwhich made the world a less safe place to be.\u201d \u201cTrump quashed that. He said no more leading from behind. America is that \u2018beacon of hope.\u2019 We are a country\u00a0\u2026 of just this perfect storm, if you will, with the natural resources to be developed, with the manpower, and with the intellect, and with the patriotism, the unity that a country needs in order to be so successful, to be great and to be a leader that other countries would wish to emulate. America has all that, and we can put it into play for the greater good of the world by leading, and not leading from behind, which is kind of Orwellian-speak,\u201d said Palin. \u201cLeading again on the global stage and the Supreme Court pick, those are two specifics \u2013 but Alex, we need to make sure to remind our friends, our supporters, people who are really tuned in to what\u2019s going on today and get frustrated under any administration. Maybe they\u2019re frustrated with what Trump does, some of the wrinkles that are certainly part of the agenda that we\u2019ve witnessed,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe can never put our faith and our hope in man, in any one man, certainly not a politician,\u201d Palin counseled. \u201cMan is fallible. We\u2019re going to be disappointed if we put all of our hope and faith in one man \u2013 a politician, a government that cannot make us happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise. We need to look at the bigger picture here, as you suggested in your opening.\u201d Another highlight of the first hundred days for Palin was the \u201cquote-unquote massive tax cut proposals that will come from the White House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy about that. That\u2019s another promise fulfilled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that to allow us to be solvent and sovereign, we need to see jobs created. The way that jobs are going to be created and people will be productive again in this country is for tax cuts that will really benefit the middle class, especially the working class. More jobs will be created with tax cuts, so I\u2019m excited about that coming down the pike.\u201d \u201cWe have to cut taxes,\u201d she stressed. \u201cLook at that corporate tax rate we have that is, what, second highest in the developed world? Our corporate tax rate certainly is one of the job creation prohibiters that we\u2019re suffering under. So that has to be done, and certainly people with our income taxes, we realize it\u2019s taxation without representation. The government is taking from us the fruits of our labor, and we\u2019re not receiving the services in return that are on par with the amount that they\u2019re taking from us. It\u2019s a given: taxes must be cut in this country, and I would think that everybody knows that.\u201d \u201cBut as for it then contributing to an accumulation of debt \u2013 you\u2019re right: it\u2019s semantics, and it\u2019s bogus,\u201d Palin said to Marlow\u2019s point that the left controls the language of tax reform and treats tax cuts as an expensive indulgence that must be \u201cpaid for\u201d somehow. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to result in accumulation of debt,\u201d she argued. \u201cWe can\u2019t just hand that over to those in government who hold the purse strings and keep spending more and more money that we do not have. We need to ratchet down the size of government. This government overreach in every area of our life that\u2019s getting more and more expensive, we can\u2019t just swallow that and say, \u2018Oh, well, that\u2019s just the way it is, and wow, we\u2019re going to have to take more money from the people in order to pay for growing government.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt always killed me when I was a city council member, I was a mayor, I was a city manager, I was a governor, and I would watch every 12 months when the government\u2019s budget was due. I\u2019d either help craft it, or it would come across my desk. I would always ask the bureaucrats and the politicians creating these budgets, \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Just because 365 days have passed, you just automatically inherently believe that the budget amount has to increase? Why? Are people getting more for the money that you\u2019re taking from them? Has the population grown that much?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIn each level of government, it\u2019s just so inherent that oh, you know, government grows; that\u2019s just the way it is. It doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Palin contended. Marlow asked Palin about the \u201cwar on free speech\u201d conducted by masked thugs at universities, prominently including Berkeley, where he was once a student. \u201cWell, first, it blows me away that you\u2019re from Berkeley. Talk about not drinking the Kool-Aid!\u201d Palin said with a laugh. \u201cThese Berkeley students, bless their hearts, they\u2019re hypocrites on steroids,\u201d she said on a more serious note. \u201cIt is amazing to me and anybody else with just an ounce of common sense in their veins to ever be able to believe that those who preach tolerance and diversity, and we\u2019re gonna embrace diversity \u2013 but Heaven forbid you say something that might hurt our little snowflakey feelings. You know, we\u2019ll melt there down in Berkeley if you say something that we can\u2019t agree with!\u201d \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re the most intolerant people if they are going to protest someone who is a bastion of free speech. Ann Coulter is on their side! When they are spewing the free speech rhetoric, she\u2019s saying, \u2018Exactly! And here, let\u2019s exercise it! Let me prove to you, you guys prove with me, that we\u2019re all for free speech!\u2019 And yet, they\u2019re so blinded by their hatred for anybody who does not agree just down the line with them on everything that they will not tolerate Ann Coulter speaking her mind,\u201d said Palin. Marlow advised President Trump to resist advice about \u201cmoderating\u201d his positions to secure the approval of left-wingers who will never stop hating him \u2013 something Palin is well positioned to understand, as the target of an unprecedented campaign of left-wing vilification in 2008. \u201cAmen. Preach it, brother,\u201d Palin agreed. \u201cPresident Trump needs to realize he can\u2019t win them over. You cannot. He can learn from our mistakes, those of us who have been in that position on a much smaller scale. We have tried to win them over, and it doesn\u2019t work. It bites you in the butt, and it harms those who you have promised to serve.\u201d \u201cRight on, too, in talking about the big tent,\u201d she said to Marlow\u2019s defense of an ideologically diverse Republican Party. \u201cYou know, most of us, we come from big-tent families. Our social circles even, and our communities, they\u2019re big tents, and really, we\u2019re better off for it. Talk about diversity and learning from other people\u2019s perspectives that are shared and all that \u2013 that\u2019s all great.\u201d \u201cBut no, when you are leading an agenda that people have put blood, sweat, and tears forth, to make sure that agenda finally is given an opportunity to be made manifest so that our lives can be made better, you have to surround yourself with people who are obviously going to help the cause and not hurt the cause,\u201d she added. \u201cYou cannot surround yourself, one, with a bunch of yes-men. That certainly harms the cause. You will never grow as a leader. You have to be growing as a leader as your constituents will be growing along with you. So you can\u2019t have a bunch of yes-men. Those of us who have been in business and been in politics certainly recognize that,\u201d said Palin. \u201cBut also, you have to have those who at least will share your vision. Maybe some of the idiosyncrasies, maybe some of the details in how you\u2019re going to get there, you can argue some of the ways to do that, but the vision has got to be the same,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cNow, do globalists, do big government professional politicians who are in it for a season, not a reason \u2013 they\u2019re in politics for a job, for a career, for the money, for the power \u2013 do they share the vision of average, hard-working, patriotic Americans who want government out of our lives so that we can be trusted as individuals to run our businesses the way that we know best and to raise our families the way that is best for our families?\u201d Palin asked. \u201cGovernment, faceless bureaucrats, they don\u2019t know how to do that. They keep screwing it up. Well, globalists and big government people, some in office today under Trump, they believe in that garbage of big government knowing best. That is the antithesis of the vision that those on the Trump Train have, and that Trump Train roared through this country so powerfully, so loudly and adamantly, that there was no stopping it. That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t surprised when Trump won,\u201d she contended. \u201cSo those who don\u2019t share that vision, who are there, quote-unquote, serving our president and the vision, the mission that he is on, that is shared by the majority of the voters \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating to us because we do want to sound that warning bell that you can\u2019t win them over. They\u2019re certainly stuck in their ways, and if they give you lip service that they\u2019re there with you \u2013 those are the yes-men that we don\u2019t need around our president,\u201d Palin advised. In parting, Palin suggested a mission for Marlow: \u201cI wish you would take the opportunity to get down to Berkeley and speak with your alumni. Go down there and talk to the folks down there about what tolerance really is and how healthy diverse opinions really can be. Talk about the Second Amendment. You would be one, Alex \u2013 well, they\u2019d probably get really wee-weed up about it \u2013 but you could be a great spokesperson for the cause.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

Issuing an indirect testament to the loyalty of the GOP, Podesta added: The Republican leadership has decided we\u2019re in the boat with him, and the boat\u2019s gonna sink, and we\u2019re gonna sink with it. But we can\u2019t really throw him out of the boat. So they\u2019ve decided to, as I\u2019ve said before, velcro their fate to him. I think they must be waking up in a sweat at night thinking about what the prospects of that are, but I think there\u2019s no chance that the House would mount the kind of serious investigation that would lead to impeachment. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) has been openly leading calls for the president to be impeached. Several Democrats have invoked the 25th Amendment\u00a0as\u00a0a springboard\u00a0to introduce legislation that would allow former presidents and vice presidents to determine if Trump is mentally unfit for office. Addressing Tumulty\u2019s question on the 25th Amendment, Podesta said, \u201cDo you really think Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos are going to sign that paper relieving the president of his duty? I don\u2019t see that either.\u201d In an interview with Breitbart News, Los Angeles-based cardiologist and internist Dr. Afshine Emrani said he thinks it is wrong for\u00a0people, and especially politicians, to \u201cbelittle mental illness because they have a political agenda,\u201d adding, \u201cpsychiatric name-calling and bullying is against their professional code.

      "subtitle": "New Mexico Secretary of Education Hanna Skandera is confirmed to have resigned her post, effective June 20.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " KRQE News 13 reports on the resignation of Skandera, who served as Florida deputy education commissioner under former Gov. Jeb Bush. In December, Politico suggested that Skandera was being considered for U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s assistant secretary. In March, however, the media outlet\u00a0reported that Skandera was no longer a candidate for the top post. Skandera\u2019s name was pulled from consideration for the position, the\u00a0report\u00a0said, because about a dozen Senate Republicans \u201cwere skeptical that they could ever vote yes\u201d to confirm her, due to her support for the highly unpopular Common Core standards. Politico reports Friday that Skandera is being viewed as a \u201cnational leader in the movement\u201d for education reform, which began with Common Core and has continued with the Every Student Succeeds Acts (ESSA), the education law that replaced No Child Left Behind and was approved overwhelmingly by establishment Republicans and Democrats, as well as former President Barack Obama: Skandera\u2019s departure announcement sparked an outpouring of praise Thursday from education reform advocates, who see her as a national leader in the movement. New Mexico\u2019s path to improvement under Skandera\u2019s leadership wasn\u2019t without controversy \u2013 teachers unions sued her over the state teacher evaluation system. \u201cFundamentally, I\u2019d say we changed the conversation in education,\u201d Skandera said. She also said she\u2019s optimistic about the future of education reform, despite disagreements in the field. In an interview with The 74, Skandera, 43, confirms she will not be working for the federal education department. According to the report, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s the right time,\u201d about her resignation, and continues: It\u2019s the end of the school year. We just turned in an ESSA plan. We have a strong foundation and are ready and poised to lead across the nation. We are up in every objective measure in 2016, so we have a great foundation \u2026 I really believe in finishing strong. Skandera has served at her post in New Mexico for more than six years and, like Jeb Bush, is a proponent of Common Core. She is also head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with the Common Core reform. \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s progress has been good overall, particularly among districts that embrace reform,\u201d Skandera\u00a0said, according to the\u00a0Albuquerque Journal.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged. On all measures, we are seeing the improvements.\u201d Republican Gov. Susana Martinez applauded Skandera\u2019s reforms: New Mexico\u2019s students and schools are better off today because of Secretary Skandera\u2019s leadership and dedication\u2026 Since day one of my administration, she\u2019s been relentlessly committed to helping us fight the status quo \u2013 like teachers unions and other entrenched special interests \u2013 to reform education and give our students, teachers, parents, and schools more of what they need to succeed. Upon DeVos\u2019s nomination by President Donald Trump, KOB4 in Albuquerque\u00a0reported that Skandera praised Trump\u2019s pick, saying that while she did not know her well, she believed DeVos\u2019s policies would not change Common Core in New Mexico. Jeb Bush\u00a0responded\u00a0to DeVos\u2019s nomination by saying\u00a0she was an \u201cextraordinary choice\u201d and exclaiming,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d Skandera was also a senior policy adviser and deputy chief of staff at the education department under former U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, who served under President George W. Bush. \u201cShe\u2019s a total pro, and she has done a tremendous job,\u201d said Spellings, now president of the University of North Carolina system, reports The 74. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten incredible results out there. She\u2019s a leader and a driver for poor and minority students and all students. \u2026 Scores are up, school grades are up, all the arrows are green pointing in the right direction.\u201d Still, New Mexico\u2019s students are only 27 percent proficient in reading and 19 percent proficient in math, the report continues. President Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of the Common Core standards and was highly critical of Jeb Bush\u2019s support for the standards. Trump\u2019s promise to return education to the states and localities won him the votes of a far-reaching network of grassroots citizens across the country who were opposed to Common Core and now the ESSA. Upon the Politico report that Skandera was not being considered for the top U.S. Education Department post, Emmett McGroarty, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, said: We applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump\u00a0has said, Common Core \u201cis a total disaster.\u201d We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President\u2019s\u00a0vision\u00a0that \u201ceducation has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child\u2019s education.\u201d Though U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has\u00a0funded\u00a0and served organizations that promote Common Core \u2013 including Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education \u2013 since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards. The secretary, nevertheless, has\u00a0surrounded\u00a0herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Bush\u2019s foundation, as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed, but then simply \u201crebranded.\u201d In March DeVos also hired Neil Ruddock, who worked for years as a regional advocacy director for Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE), from which the former presidential candidate launched a national campaign for Common Core and for the same type of education reforms he instituted in Florida. Carlos G. Mu\u00f1iz, a former attorney to Jeb Bush when he was Florida\u2019s governor, has also been appointed as general counsel to DeVos\u2019s department. Josh Venable, who\u00a0worked\u00a0with Bush at his foundation, was appointed by DeVos as her chief of staff. Other U.S. education department staffers who worked for Bush\u2019s pro-Common Core foundation and for the Indiana education department include Andrew Kossack, an attorney who was\u00a0appointed\u00a0as Indiana Department of Revenue commissioner under former Gov. Mike Pence. Prior to that position, he\u00a0served\u00a0as general counsel to Indiana\u2019s ousted\u00a0superintendent of education, Tony Bennett, who championed the adoption of the Common Core standards in the state. Bennett then became the Florida commissioner of education and was\u00a0later investigated for fraud and\u00a0resigned\u00a0after allegations\u00a0that he intervened in the grading system in Indiana to favor\u00a0a charter school run by a prominent Republican Party donor. Bush lost the GOP primary in 2016, largely due to his vocal support for amnesty for illegal immigrants and for the Common Core standards.",

      "content": "  Sanders made the initial announcement and presented DOE Secretary Betsy DeVos with a check for $100,000. DeVos then took the podium to express her appreciation for the contribution and declared that it would be used to fund a STEM-focused camp.  \u201cThe President is committed to our nation\u2019s students and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their zip code, has access to a high-quality education,\u201d said DeVos. The Secretary spoke of an event that occurred the previous day at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. DeVos, along with Adviser to the President and first daughter Ivanka Trump, read to young girls with a local YMCA and Boys and Girls Club. The event was intended to encourage the children to read during summer. The six to 10-year-old girls also interacted with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) activities at the Smithsonian Spark Lab. DeVos announced in the Wednesday briefing how the President\u2019s donation would be used: Today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s economy requires students prepared for STEM careers. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to use the President\u2019s second quarter salary to host a STEM-focused camp for students at the Department of Education. We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields. President Trump\u2019s first quarterly salary check was donated to the Department of Interior and has been put to use in restoring two projects at Antietam National Battlefield. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke delivered a check to Antietam National Battlefield earlier this month. As Press Secretary Sanders pointed out in Wednesday\u2019s briefing, Trump\u2019s donation led other donors to contribute to these projects, bringing the total contribution to over $260,000.

Strange how he just protected his account. pic.twitter.com/Mw6WWjninz \u2014 J.R. Salzman (@jrsalzman) September 9, 2017  KVUE \u00a0reported the following statement from the Carlson Law Firm\u2019s\u00a0founder Craig Carlson on Monday evening: For those of you who are wondering why this took so long, let me start by saying that this firm is a family and believe it\u2019s up to me to show the same loyalty that I ask of my people. I wasn\u2019t going to make a rash decision about a member of this family just to appease people on social media. That said, I considered the health of everyone in our organization, promised my partners and my employees that we would act according to the values of our firm, and sat down to speak with Mr. Ranco. In the end, we came to the same two conclusions: With over 150 employees \u2013 75% or whom are women \u2013 anyone in our company advocating or even expressing apathy towards sexual assault is affront to all victims and a line that simply cannot be uncrossed. This has been an enormous distraction that has taken us away from the mission of our firm, which is to care for and help people. Understanding and accepting this, Rob is taking full responsibility and choosing to resign. As a man of faith, believer in forgiveness, and longtime friend, it is my sincere hope that Rob [will] learn from this experience and go on to have a very successful career. Following the errant Tweet on Friday, Ranco sent the following statement to KVUE: My tweet from Friday was a mistake. I take full responsibility from it. It was my mistake and nobody else\u2019s and I apologize. I\u2019ll be working continuously moving forward to make it for my mistake. I hope that Secretary DeVos and anyone else who was offended, impacted, shocked by my actions that they can find it in their hearts to forgive me. After Ranco resigned from the firm, the Carlson Law Firm added this message via a post on Facebook:  On Monday, the firm posted another statement:  The adjunct professor may be in trouble with the Austin Community College District as well. When asked by TWCNews in Austin about the offensive Twitter post, the college responded: The recent social media comments made by a part-time employee on his personal page do not represent ACC\u2019s vision, mission, and values. The college does not condone these comments and their sentiment. ACC is reviewing the situation and will take appropriate action. The Washington Times reported that Ranco suggested that DeVos \u201cdoes not\u00a0fully grasp how serious of a crime rape is, and that she might come to a different policy conclusion if she did.\u201d His comments came after DeVos decided to drop the Obama Administration\u2019s heavy handed Title IX policy. Breitbart News\u2019 Dr. Susan Berry reported\u00a0the policy that \u201cforced colleges and universities to conduct \u2018kangaroo courts\u2019 in dealing with accusations of sexual assault has \u2018failed.\u2019\u201d DeVos wrote: Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago.

      "subtitle": "California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a bill Monday that would have preserved the Obama administration\u2019s new guidelines for sexual assault cases on university campuses, and which the Trump administration has reversed.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The bill, SB 169, was co-sponsored by State Senate President pro Tem (and U.S. Senate candidate) Kevin de Le\u00f3n, and was part of a broader \u201cresistance\u201d effort against President Donald Trump and his policies. Specifically, the bill was a response to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u2019s new policy\u00a0on sexual assault on campus, which includes more safeguards for the rights of students accused of misconduct, whose careers may be ruined even if innocent. The Obama administration\u2019s Title IX policy prioritized the interests of the accuser over the rights of the accused. It was part of a recent pattern on the left in which the civil rights of defendants have been cast aside in favor of broader goals of social justice \u2014 such as the effort to reduce the role grand juries play in prosecutions of police. That reversed centuries of civil rights activism, in which liberals had often sought more protections for defendants. In a veto statement\u00a0dated Sunday, Brown noted: \u201cThis is not a simple issue \u2026 [T]houghtful legal minds have increasingly questioned whether federal and state actions prevent and redress sexual harassment and assault \u2014 well-intentioned as they are \u2014 have also unintentionally resulted in some colleges\u2019 failure to uphold due process for accused students. \u2026 I am not prepared to codify additional requirements in reaction to a shifting federal landscape.\u201d Brown\u2019s veto, and his sound legal reasoning, are a rare example of what used to be a more common mindset among American liberals \u2014 preserving the rights of the individual and measuring policies by their effects instead of their intentions. Certainly that is not an approach Brown takes to every issue: his obsession with high-speed rail is a case of left-wing utopianism taken to an expensive extreme.

Worse, he said, \u201cAlmost immediately following the meeting [with PBS investigators], this story broke in Variety as an \u2018exclusive.\u2019 Indeed, I learned more about these allegations reading the Variety story than the PBS investigator shared with me, the accused, in our 3 hour face to face meeting.\u201d What Smiley experienced is exactly the sort of kangaroo court process that students have been experiencing on college campuses for the last\u00a0few\u00a0years. President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos ended that policy in September, outlining new rules that grant due process to\u00a0students accused of sexual misconduct while still protecting the safety and dignity of victims. But the Obama-era rules persist in several states, where they were codified into law by overzealous Democrats. It is impossible to dismiss the accusations against Smiley without knowing the facts.

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": "  Students and family members turned their backs as Betsy DeVos delivered a commencement speech on Monday. The protests came after over 3,000 members of the University of Baltimore community signed a petition to have DeVos canned as the scheduled commencement speaker. Betsy DeVos has been invited (and has now accepted) to deliver University of Baltimore\u2019s Fall 2017 Commencement speech. This decision was not made in any way by the faculty, student government, or the student body as a whole. Invitations to speak were extended solely by the University President, Kurt Schmoke. The SGA was not even made aware of her involvement until 9/7/17. This is unacceptable. This is not what UB students want. The overwhelming majority of UB students and alumni, as well as the Baltimore community in general are appalled at this decision. UB is a place that supports social justice and equality, and students consistently fight for what is right in the Baltimore community. The petition added that attendance at the ceremony served as an \u201cimplicit endorsement\u201d of DeVos\u2019 policies. Further, it creates an implicit endorsement of policies that can and will have a lasting negative impact on the very graduates this ceremony is supposed to celebrate. Ms. DeVos seems to go against the very core\u00a0of so many of UB\u2019s values and makes our mission statement look to be a mockery. We can\u2019t send consistent letters of support and inclusiveness to the student body and yet at the same time sell ourselves so short. DeVos subtly condemned some of the protesters during her speech, arguing that many are quick to join in on the \u201cchorus of conflict.\u201d \u201cThe natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to raise your voice louder, to promote your profile and ostracize others,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many assume that those who are the loudest are leaders and those who stay quiet are followers. But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot embrace this paradox of silence.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The American Conservative Union (ACU) on Monday evening released its agenda for the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a lineup that amounts to perhaps the premiere conservative movement event\u2019s strongest ever, as President Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the\u00a0 Republican Party and the movement enters its next phases.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " ACU chairman Matt Schlapp, executive director Dan Schneider, and communications director Ian Walters sat down with Breitbart News exclusively on Monday night to discuss the event which features robust discussions of major issues facing the movement, the GOP, the country, and the world today. \u201cWe feel vindicated,\u201d Schlapp told Breitbart News. \u201cAfter all of the internal family squabbling in the conservative movement and Republican Party and country generally [over the past several years], we feel vindicated that CPAC has been a moment where we in a very public way can talk about our disagreements and it has resulted over the last three CPACs in us having more political success and policy success as a movement than we have ever had. That means this is a critical four days and that we have set up the debate and the discussions once again where we can do this in a way that will make us stronger, not weaker.\u201d The event, which begins Wednesday evening and continues through Saturday afternoon, is held at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland\u2013just outside Washington, D.C. Schlapp said the major theme of the conference this year is to \u201cspeak to the moment\u201d of what is happening on the political landscape. \u201cThe moment for this year is some people believe that Trump was not the right guy to be our standard bearer in 2016,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cThe conservative movement and Republican Party had an internal food fight over that, and Donald Trump emerged with everyone else with food all over them but he was pretty clean. But, now, people would ask me a year and a half ago: Will he govern as a conservative? And I would always give the answer: Let\u2019s see what he does, let\u2019s see what he does. Well, we\u2019ve had a year now to see what he has done\u2014and, if you look at all the areas of the conservative movement, if you look at the three legs of the stool whether it\u2019s culture and the family, strong national security, or the economy, it\u2019s hard to find anybody who is anything other than enthusiastic about the decisions that are coming from the president. So, I would say the political moment is we\u2019ve had a year to see how President Trump governs, and conservatives are overwhelmingly enthusiastic about how he has come to the decisions he has come to\u2014and after a year, we need to come together and celebrate the fact that we\u2019ve had more policy successes than we\u2019ve had in a decade. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d This year\u2019s CPAC agenda, released Monday evening, focuses on the core issues facing the conservative movement a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, while Republicans look down the barrel of an all-important midterm election as economic nationalist conservatives worldwide battle leftist forces in countries ranging from the United Kingdom to France and elsewhere around the world. The agenda\u00a0stands out against a backdrop of an economic nationalist takeover of the Republican Party, as the GOP becomes President Trump\u2019s party once and for all in the second year of his first term, and as CPAC continues to reinvigorate itself as the flagship conservative movement event of the year. The release of the agenda comes on the heels of previously rough years for the American Conservative Union and CPAC, where the group\u2019s conservative movement banner event was forced\u00a0into an identity crisis akin to the one the conservative movement and GOP as a whole have\u00a0experienced with the rise of Trump and the fall of establishment politicians who subscribe to the thinking espoused by the old ways of globalism. Rival conferences fueled by movement exclusion and division have given way to a more open discussion of differences inside the conservative movement\u00a0at CPAC. Some of the events on the CPAC agenda are more controversial-sounding. Panels at this year\u2019s CPAC include ones focused on how the establishment media and far left-wing political activists collude; whether China, Russia, or rogue states are the biggest threats to America; a panel on how college campuses are infected with leftism; \u201cTrumponomics\u201d; immigration, trade, Israel, the out-of-control Obama-era Justice Department scandals, and whether conservatives are serious about defunding Planned Parenthood. Some of the titles are eye-catching: \u201cKim Jong University: How College Campuses are Turning into Reeducation Camps.\u201d And: \u201cAre Conservatives Serious About Defunding Planned Parenthood?\u201d Or: \u201cChina\u2019s Existential Challenge to America\u2014and the World.\u201d Also: \u201cEconomic Theft and Market Manipulation.\u201d In addition: \u201cTrump\u2019s America First Energy Plan: Restoring our Prosperity and Destroying Eco-Left Memes.\u201d \u201cYou and I go back,\u201d Ian Walters, the communications director of the ACU, told Breitbart News when asked about some of the more provocatively-titled panels. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen different iterations of this conference over the past few years. When Schlapp and Schneider took over, their approach was that if there were differences within the movement\u2014if there were controversial topics\u2014that we weren\u2019t going to sweep them under the rug. We were going to use CPAC as a forum for everybody to speak their minds and try to figure out what the right path forward is. With the Planned Parenthood one, you may think it\u2019s a cute title\u2014and it is provocative\u2014but it also can be taken completely literally. Due to folks in the swamp who are the leaders, are they interested in the outcomes that they say they are interested in? Or are they interested in preserving their own positions? That\u2019s the question that we wanted to ask publicly in a difficult, polite way that hopefully makes the folks sitting inside that room think differently about that issue.\u201d Other panels sound more establishment-friendly or like panels one would see at a traditional CPAC, for instance: \u201cYou May Say You\u2019re a DREAMer But You\u2019re Not the Only One.\u201d Or: \u201cDignity for Incarcerated Women: Is it Really Necessary to Shackle Women in labor?\u201d And: \u201cDo Not Pass Go! How Government is Killing Capitalism.\u201d But the CPAC organizers insist that conference-goers should look past the titles and go hear out the events. \u201cThe title reflects some of what the president talked about,\u201d Schneider said about the DREAMer panel. \u201cIt\u2019s Americans who should be establishing American policy on immigration. There are lots of Americans who agree with you that the future of Americans should not be sacrificed if it\u2019s simply looking to help non-Americans get benefits. But the purpose of this breakout panel is to address current law which is pretty good, but not enforced. So, how can current law be enforced to get the right result? And then, what changes are necessary so that American policy that helps Americans is put at the forefront?\u201d Generally speaking, there is a bigger theme that has emerged for this year\u2019s CPAC as it relates to previous CPACs: The ACU wants to be the referees of what works in the conservative movement, and what doesn\u2019t work. And the ACU wants CPAC to be the ring in which that battle is fought. \u201cThe group putting this on is obviously the American Conservative Union,\u201d Schlapp told Breitbart News. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason, in that title, to learn from the Reagan example that when conservatives\u2014even conservatives who have political differences\u2014work together politically, we have political victory. When we decide to follow something to a fault line, we\u2019re not successful. There\u2019s lots of differences in that room, on the stage, but the theme out of this is going to be\u2014last year\u2019s theme was \u2018A Time for Action\u2019\u2014so the theme out of this is: \u2018What are we able to work on collectively to get done?\u2019 So, there\u2019s actually a united purpose and that is the Trump agenda.\u201d Later in the interview, Schlapp added that over the past several decades of CPAC\u2019s and ACU\u2019s existence\u2014the conference has been going on since the early 1970s\u2014conservatives have used what they have learned at these conferences to take their battles into real-world political and policy applications that have had enormous national and international implications. The latest and most sophisticated iteration of that is President Trump, who has taken the movement to a whole new level, Schlapp says\u2013even more significant so far than Ronald Reagan was in the 1980s. \u201cWhy Trump is unique is that Reagan showed that we could win nationwide for the presidency. Congress was always considered at that time to be something that was unattainable for the Republican Party,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cYes, we got the Senate under Reagan but we never got the House and that was deemed something that just would never happen. Reagan showed us we could win the White House with a conservative. Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay and the others showed us that we could actually win the House with conservatives in the 1990s, which allowed us for the first time to actually control the purse strings which was a big step. We had a few years under George W. Bush where we had a congressional majority and the presidency, but the change about Donald Trump is that he captured the nation with a fresh approach. In taking that approach, he started his presidency with a large majority in the House and a more slender majority in the Senate. He started his presidency with a Republican majority in the Senate and in the House. Those congressional majorities were worried about what a President Trump would do. We\u2019ve seen over the course of the last year that although that relationship is fitful at times, it has produced more policy change than we have really ever seen on the Republican side. Then you understand why our thesis is \u2018A Time for Action.\u2019 We\u2019re not longer just sitting back talking about \u2018what if this happens?\u2019 It is happening, and everybody needs to wake up and realize there is a window where we can get more successes. That window one day will close, that\u2019s not a prediction, but we have this historic opportunity in front of us.\u201d In addition to all those panels, a number of high-profile and sometimes controversial international movement leaders were rolled out as speakers on this year\u2019s CPAC agenda. First and foremost, from France the National Front\u2019s Marion Le Pen will address CPAC for the first time. An economic nationalist leader on the rise in her country, Le Pen will discuss the battles she is fighting as she and her party\u00a0work to stave off globalists like Emmanuel Macron\u2014the new French president. The United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cMr. Brexit,\u201d Nigel Farage, will speak from the main stage at CPAC as well. The worldwide focus, Schneider said, comes amid new efforts this past year by the ACU to build conservative strongholds around the world\u2014including in Japan, where Schneider said he and Schlapp helped establish the Japanese Conservative Union in 2017. \u201cMatt Schlapp and I have been working with a number of partners around the world to help define conservatism that makes sense in other parts of the world, and grow conservatism,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWe helped establish the Japanese Conservative Union. Matt will be making an announcement from the main stage of CPAC on our efforts to expand our reach. Conservatism, as a political bloc of conservatism, affects not only the American system. It affects other nations\u2019 sovereignty, which is important.\u201d All of that comes with an intense focus in this year\u2019s CPAC on China, with panels aimed at exposing currency manipulation, how China may be America\u2019s biggest threat, China\u2019s \u201cexistential challenge\u201d to the world and the United States, and a special live broadcast of John Batchelor\u2019s nationally-syndicated radio program from the main stage titled: \u201cStorm Clouds Over China.\u201d That Batchelor broadcast will feature people like Dr. Sebastian Gorka\u2013a former Breitbart News National Security Editor who served in President Trump\u2019s White House last year for several months as a national security official\u2013and the Daily Beast\u2019s Gordon Chang, as well as other China experts. CPAC will have a number of events focused on the Russia investigation, and particularly a panel that will highlight the intelligence-gathering abuses by the Barack Obama White House and Justice Department as laid out in the recently-released House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) memo and FBI text messages from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. HPSCI chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) will also address the conference. \u201cI love the idea of marrying up this concept of what the Constitution allows and doesn\u2019t allow government to do and the real-life drama that\u2019s playing out in front of us in the media about the Obama abuses when it came to surveilling Team Trump,\u201d Schlapp told Breitbart News. \u201cIt is the most unfortunate real-life political example of constitutional abuse. It is perhaps the most nefarious example of using political power to harm your political opponents that we\u2019ve ever seen. As I\u2019ve said in the past, I actually think Richard Nixon is owed an apology. We all accept this idea that Richard Nixon, Tricky Dick, had done something that really had never been done in our history. But the Obama team has shown, and Bill Clinton showed it before Obama, that it is actually the Democrats who aggressively use their political power to harm their political opponents. Now, I don\u2019t condone anything Richard Nixon did, but I think to get FISA warrants in the way that they got them using the intelligence apparatus to go after your political opponents is something we have to understand and get a hold of because this should never happen. Somebody needs to go to jail over this, and it\u2019s not the people that the New York Times says are in legal trouble. It is the people in the Obama administration that used this sacred power, the ability to look into someone\u2019s personal life and listen to their personal phone calls, in a way that was used to maybe even have an impact on the presidential campaign. It\u2019s un-American. It should have never happened. And our supporters need to know about it.\u201d CPAC will also have a number of events focused on trade policy and Trump\u2019s brand of economics. \u201cMaking America Trade Again,\u201d a curated speech by Bill Walton of Rappahannock Ventures, as well as another curated speech by Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation on \u201cEconomic Theft and Market Manipulation\u201d will address trade policy. Trump\u2019s style of handling the economy will come up in a panel titled: \u201cTrumponomics V. Obamanomics.\u201d When asked about how to deal with perceived discrepancies between Trump\u2019s trade views and those of some in the conservative movement, Schneider and Schlapp argued that Trump\u2019s worldview is correct. \u201cConservatives have long stood for free trade,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for a long time are deals that are not necessarily free trade, but are placating some of our trading partners to keep them as friends. There are some on the right who think that when foreign governments subsidize their own companies that that\u2019s okay even when it harms American companies. Well, conservatives have long understood that that is anti-competitive, that produces bad results in the long run, and we should stand for true free trade instead. So, what President Trump has done is hit the reset button and allow conservatives to have a greater voice in trade policy.\u201d Schlapp added more, including an unsolicited shot at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2013part of the establishment wing of the GOP opposite President Trump\u2019s views on trade and the economy\u2013another sign the movement and party are moving in Trump\u2019s direction: \u201cThe one thing that we have noticed with a lot of people who have joined the ACU and are supporting us, people with real business experience, is it\u2019s not a question of whether you\u2019re free market or protectionist. I think that most savvy market participants and those in Washington realize that those are false choices. People who tell us, who title things as \u2018free trade,\u2019 are actually ascribing too nice a term to big trade deals that are nothing more than complicated business contracts. What I notice from most people who are free market who are associated with us and involved in politics, is that they actually think Donald Trump is right to say that it\u2019s not free trade if it\u2019s not reciprocal. It\u2019s not free to have a TPP agreement that at the end of the window, Japan\u2019s market is only 10 percent open to products outside Japan. That\u2019s not reciprocal and that\u2019s not free. So, what America has done is it has opened up its market but it has not been able to effectively open up other markets where our entrepreneurs are competing. What these free market business people are saying is it is time for us to get a lot smarter. I think Donald Trump completely understands that, frankly, a lot better than the Chamber of Commerce.\u201d In addition, on immigration, Sheriff David Clarke will give a curated speech titled: \u201cLaw and Border.\u201d Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge will give a curated speech titled: \u201cA Tale of (Two) Sanctuary Cities.\u201d \u201cThe first role of the federal government is to protect our borders, and help keep Americans safe in their life, their liberty, and their property,\u201d Schneider said about the focus on immigration. \u201cIn the Obama administration, that idea of the government first existing to protect our borders was sacrificed. I believe President Trump has reversed that.\u201d This year\u2019s CPAC also has an outsized focus on conservative media, and deliberately not on establishment media\u2014featuring a panel to bash media bias. Conservative media luminaries like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham of Fox News, Eric Bolling, Greta Van Susteren, Breitbart\u2019s own London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam, the Washington Times\u2019 Ralph Hallow, Project Veritas\u2019 James O\u2019Keefe, nationally-syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin, and many others are featured. The ACU team says that is because times are changing. \u201cThe first panel we come out of the gates with on Thursday morning is the media panel,\u201d Walters told Breitbart News. \u201cAt this event, like Matt said, what really is happening is we\u2019re speaking to the moment. There has been a lot of change in the last 12 months with regard to the media landscape. It was not uncommon in the past decade for us to think about inviting folks from other non-conservative news outlets. Schlapp and I will joke about it, he\u2019s not a contributor at any of the networks and that allows him to go on all of the stations and MSNBC and CNN included, and over the last 12 months they\u2019re not that interested in having him on that often. So why would that be? They\u2019re speaking to their audiences. CNN has its audience. MSNBC has its audience they\u2019re going after. They\u2019re not real interested in hearing from us. The folks that we read, that we consume, that we share information with are often right of center. That\u2019s how it\u2019s worked out.\u201d That\u2019s not to mention the fact that President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a record number of cabinet and administration officials will address the conference as well. Secretaries of Energy Rick Perry, Interior Ryan Zinke, Education Betsy DeVos, and Labor Alex Acosta will give speeches, and the Small Business Administration\u2019s Linda McMahon, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, White House counsel Don McGahn, and White House adviser KellyAnne Conway will also appear. \u201cThis is the first time in history that we\u2019ve two years in a row have a president and vice president come two years in a row to CPAC,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s also the first time we\u2019ve had such a large percentage of the Cabinet come to CPAC. The prior record was in Reagan\u2019s second term where about a third of the Cabinet spoke. This time, about half of the Cabinet will be at CPAC.\u201d Other conservative leaders like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and his predecessor Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Republican Study Committee chairman Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC), Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, former Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS), President Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump, Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA, Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, Tea Party Patriots\u2019 Jenny Beth Martin, and many more will speak. There will also be a remote location in Denver that is interconnected with what is happening at CPAC in D.C. \u201cOne very innovative thing we are doing at this CPAC is we are having a second stage in Denver, Colorado,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cSo, Michelle Malkin will be speaking from the Denver stage and we will be having a debate from the Denver stage that will be broadcast to our CPAC audience here in the D.C. area. Simultaneously, the folks in Denver will be watching the CPAC stage here live.\u201d Walters, ACU\u2019s communications director, says that the defining message overall though is Trump has demonstrated that he is a capable president and leader, more so than recent Republican establishment leaders\u2014and it is up to economic nationalist movement conservatives to continue to drive this forward. \u201cThese are things that conservatives have been talking about doing our entire lives,\u201d Walters said. \u201cFinally, there is a guy who is not just talk. He is actually going about doing these things. The evidence is seen in a booming economy. He has unshackled it, he\u2019s unleashed it\u2014just like he said he would. Do you think a President Mitt Romney or a President John McCain would have been able to get these things done even if they said it on the campaign trail? These candidates all say one thing on the campaign trail, and then you put them in office and they lose their spine. We got a very different guy who\u2019s very willing to keep his promises. We\u2019re all benefiting from it. This is the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for for the last 25 years.\u201d",

      "content": " \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year,\u201d Trump told reporters after firing Rex Tillerson and replacing him with his CIA director Mike Pompeo. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really at a point where we\u2019re getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter sent a wave of shock across Washington, as the president seemed reenergized after catching the world by surprise. Here is a rundown of where things stand: Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly: Trump likes Kelly, but does not like the idea that he is being controlled by the former general. \u201cYou know, we have General Kelly here, four star, and he\u2019s doing a great job in Washington.\u201d Trump told Marines in California on Tuesday. \u201cI think he likes what you do better than what he does, but he\u2019s doing a great job. He misses you.\u201d Fox News reports that Kelly might be shifted out of the West Wing in favor of Budget director Mick Mulvaney as chief of staff. Mulvaney\u2019s staff stresses to Breitbart News that the former congressman is happy in his current position at OMB. National Security Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster: Rumors of McMaster\u2019s exit have swirled for months, but Trump appears ready to bring in someone new. Ambassador John Bolton is the rumored replacement, as he met with the president earlier in the week. Bolton has canceled media appearances this week as the rumors continue. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump: Trump is reportedly ready for them to return to New York, but at this point, the couple does not seem inclined to do so. If Kelly leaves both Jared and Ivanka could break free of the restraints he has put on their positions at the White House and start rebuilding their political careers. There is a discussion\u00a0about Kushner possibly returning to the 2020 presidential campaign, but in a rotating power struggle in the West Wing, he could see the benefits of staying. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin Shulkin is rumored to leave amidst power struggles in the agency. Rick Perry is among the rumored replacements, although he\u00a0dismissed those rumors \u201cfake news\u201d and says he enjoys his position as Secretary of Energy. Attorney General Jeff Sessions: Trump has been angry at Sessions since he recused himself in the Russia investigation, even driving the former Alabama senator to the point where he submitted his letter of resignation before he was convinced by Reince Priebus to stay. The rumors are a stretch at this point, as additional drama in the Justice Department would drive more questions about the Russia investigation but one scenario is that Sessions would move on and be replaced by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson Carson could be in trouble after a story about his requested $31,000 cabinet furniture won\u2019t go away. If Trump wants Carson to go, he has an excuse. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Devos is coming off a disastrous\u00a0CBS 60 Minutes interview. Trump pays close attention to TV and a bad performance could raise concerns that he does not have the right person in the job. ",

      "content": " Warning: Violence and Language in Video  Annette Albright, a former behavior modification technician at Harding University High School in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district (CMS) in North Carolina, told Breitbart News during an interview she suffered a concussion and multiple bruises from an attack in 2016 by a group of students she had approached about not skipping class. \u201cA group of about 15 to 20 students had been skipping class that day,\u201d Albright recalled. \u201cThey were in my building and I was called to get the students to class. When I got down there and tried to talk to the students about going to class, they began cursing at me and telling me they would go to class when they wanted to.\u201d \u201cOne of the students got really upset because I used my radio to call for backup \u2013 she said I was calling the police on them,\u201d Albright continued. \u201cShe started threatening me, said she was going to slap me, and then started walking toward me \u2013 taking a very aggressive stance.\u201d Albright, who is now 52, said the student walked up the stairs to where she was standing at the top and began to \u201cchest-bump\u201d her. \u201cHer brother was right behind her,\u201d Albright continued. \u201cThe interesting thing is two of these students in the group had just returned from an alternative school for assaulting a girl at the bus stop.\u201d Albright said the girl turned and began walking down the steps and that she herself walked down to the last two steps and again told the students to go to class. \u201cWhen I said that, she turned around and came back after me quickly and aggressively and right back up in my face,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I told her to get back, she slapped me with her fist in my face. I tried to push her and her brother away and, when I did, the rest of the kids just jumped me.\u201d Albright \u2013 who is black \u2013 said all of the students involved in the incident were black. No other students helped her as the attack started, she added. Instead, they recorded the assault and posted it immediately to social media. Eventually, she noted, one student ran to get the school resource officer, who ended the attack on her. The administration, Albright said, blamed her for the assault. \u201cIt was immediately deemed to be my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to have said something to upset the student, or it was my body language. One of the female students said I hit her first. So, I was told they would not press charges against the students and if I wanted to press charges, I could do it myself. They just let the students go.\u201d Albright told Breitbart News the school district\u2019s Human Resource department conducted an investigation and determined she caused the assault. \u201cBecause I should have known the student was violent,\u201d she said the results of the investigation said. \u201cAnd, so, I should have remained on the steps. They decided I should have known the student was mad because she had already assaulted me by chest-bumping me, and I should have remained on the steps. Because I knew she was violent, I provoked my own assault.\u201d \u201cI was terminated for conduct unbecoming a professional,\u201d Albright continued, adding that no officials from the school district would speak to her about the incident. Ultimately, she contacted Judy Kidd, who heads the Classroom Teachers Association in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. \u201cShe helped me to understand CMS did not want the negative publicity about my assault, and that this was embarrassing to them because they had been saying their schools were safe,\u201d she explained. In September 2016, Kidd told Fox10 that teachers in the district often feel they are blamed when there is an incident involving them and students. \u201cThey felt the students were in charge and they weren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that the side was always taken against the teacher \u2013 was with the student. When they went to another county, they found out that\u2019s not the way it works.\u201d Albright said when the police department saw the video of the attack on her on Facebook, the department itself filed charges against the students. One of the students plead guilty, and three others wanted to go to trial, she explained. Judge Karen Eady-Williams, who in 2010 was appointed to the District Court bench in Mecklenburg County by Gov. Beverly Perdue (D), reportedly expressed concern about saddling children with criminal records. \u201cShe said if you work in a school environment, you should expect to be called a bitch or a \u2018ho\u2019 because these are the kids we\u2019re dealing with today,\u201d Albright reported, adding that school administrators also told her if students called her a bitch or told her to f**k off, she should not report that to the front office. \u201cThey told me, \u2018We have to address the big stuff,\u2019\u201d Albright explained. \u201cAnd I said, but that is what leads up to the \u2018big stuff.\u2019\u201d According to Fox10, Eady-Williams found student Honesty Williams \u201cnot guilty of assault\u201d and student Camonte Barnes guilty. Barnes was sentenced to community service and a letter of apology to Albright. Albright said she was shocked the assault upon her did not receive more serious consequences. \u201cIronically, I had been a corrections officer in a men\u2019s prison and an adult probation parole officer over a span of 14 years,\u201d she explained. \u201cI arrested people, I went into their homes and arrested them, and no one ever laid a hand on me. And I go into a school and am assaulted?\u201d Albright added she believes community groups like the NAACP and some black churches have also put pressure on the school district to stop suspending black students. \u201cBut, I am black, and I know where the behavior issues are coming from, and I think we need to face that fact and walk in our reality and come up with a way to solve these behavior issues,\u201d she explained. Albright and Kidd will meet\u00a0with DeVos as the Education Secretary hosts a school safety and climate summit this week. Breitbart News reached out to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district for comment but received no response.",

      "content": " U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Oklahoma teachers who have entered the second week of a strike should \u201cserve the students\u201d and \u201ckeep adult disagreements and disputes in a separate place.\u201d While touring a middle school in Dallas, DeVos was asked about the Oklahoma teacher walkout. \u201cI think about the kids,\u201d the secretary said, reports\u00a0the Dallas News. \u201cI think we need to stay focused on what\u2019s right for kids. And I hope that adults would keep adult disagreements and disputes in a separate place, and serve the students that are there to be served.\u201d Teachers from dozens of Oklahoma school districts are in the second week of a strike as they packed the state Capitol Monday demanding the Republican-led Senate approve new tax hikes to fund increases in education spending and teacher pay.  Public schools were closed Monday. Teachers in Oklahoma have been among the lowest paid in the country and are demanding a $10,000 raise over three years. They claim the state education budget has been victimized by tax breaks provided to Oklahoma\u2019s energy industry.  The national teachers\u2019 unions tweeted their support of the walkout:   Parent activist Jenni White of Reclaim Oklahoma Parent Empowerment, wrote\u00a0many parents are distressed by the \u201cloud and obnoxious\u201d behavior of some of the striking teachers. White, who battled against the Common Core standards in her state, wrote: In a scene reminiscent of the Wisconsin teacher rallies in their capitol building, apparently a full gallery of teachers in the House, created a stir\u00a0when a bill not on the Floor Calendar was attempted during session on Tuesday. According to the report, the disturbance was so loud and disrespectful, the gallery was cleared. This is fascinating in part because, when we lobbied against Common Core, we were told we would have to get rid of yellow, 8 \u00bd x 11 sheets of paper simply saying, \u201cHear The Bills\u201d, or leave the building, yet pictures have been splashed all over the news media of teachers with poster board signs in the rotunda. Of course, anyone with a green Common Core Is Not OK t-shirt was chastised for even whispering in the gallery during session, but I guess we\u2019ve devolved since 2014. To pay for increased education spending and pay raises, Oklahoma striking teachers want Republicans to scrap a bill that would remove a tax exemption on capital gains, reports\u00a0Reuters. Additionally, union leaders are demanding a hotel tax to raise approximately $50 million. Republican lawmakers have responded by approving nearly $450 million in new taxes and revenue, but teachers are demanding $600 million.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Michelle Malkin \u2013 host of Michelle Malkin Investigates\u00a0on CRTV.com \u2013 writes\u00a0at Creators.com about the cozy relationship between Facebook and other technology titans with the U.S. Education Department. Using comforting-sounding buzz phrases such as \u201cpersonalized,\u201d \u201cindividualized,\u201d and \u201csocial and emotional\u201d learning, the federal education behemoth has joined with the tech corporations who are \u201ccashing in on the Big Data boondoggle,\u201d Malkin says. She continues: Facebook is just one of the tech giants partnering with the U.S. Department of Education and schools nationwide in pursuit of student data for meddling and profit. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pearson, Knewton, and many more are cashing in on the Big Data boondoggle. State and federal educational databases provide countless opportunities for private companies exploiting public schoolchildren subjected to annual assessments, which exploded after adoption of the tech-industry-supported Common Core \u201cstandards,\u201d tests, and aligned texts and curricula. While politicians of both parties and federal education officials \u2013 even U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2013 would like to sweep the data-collecting prize reform known as Common Core under the rug, the latest federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has actually cemented\u00a0the \u201ccollege- and career-ready\u201d standards and their accompanying student data collection into the nation\u2019s education landscape. Malkin writes: The recently passed Every Student Succeeds Act further enshrined government collection of personally identifiable information \u2014 including data collected on attitudes, values, beliefs, and dispositions \u2014 and allows release of the data to third-party contractors thanks to Obama-era loopholes carved into the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. And the so-called school-to-work pipeline creates endless avenues into taxpayer coffers for firms pitching data-gathering initiatives to \u201calign\u201d student learning with \u201cskill sets\u201d and \u201ccompetencies\u201d desired by corporations.  The conservative author observes how, in 2011, the Obama-era federal education department launched its nonprofit \u201cDigital Promise\u201d program, which is still in existence. Former Education Secretary Arne Duncan made the claim that the \u201cdigital transformation of education and training for our children\u201d would allow the United States to take the lead again in high-performing students: [W]e need to act now to lead the digital transformation of education and training for our children and for adults looking to retrain and retool. We have yet to unleash technology\u2019s full potential to transform teaching and learning. Technology can help provide all students access to a world-class curriculum. It is a tool that can provide equitable access to high-quality learning opportunities for low-income students in struggling schools, be they inner city, urban, rural, or remote. This work is especially important today because other countries are ahead of the United States. Seven years later, however, U.S. schoolchildren are still floundering\u00a0and failing\u00a0on national and international assessments. Last fall, the education department\u2019s Digital Promise announced it was partnering with Facebook to create a system of adult student \u201cmicro-credentialing\u201d\u00a0data badges\u00a0to train students in social media marketing skills. Cheri Kiesecker, a Colorado parent activist who writes at Missouri Education Watchdog, said\u00a0the partnership \u201cwill\u00a0no doubt\u00a0be a wonderful data collection and marketing\u00a0tool for Facebook and the US Department of Ed, but it is incredibly alarming for students\u2019\u00a0privacy and security.\u201d Malkin observes Facebook has moved on from adults and is now focusing on the private data of elementary and secondary schoolchildren through its Messenger Kids app and the \u201cwhole-child personalized learning\u201d paradigm espoused by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). \u201cCZI, a \u2018philanthropic investment company\u2019 funded with up to $1 billion in Facebook shares over the next three years, is headed by Jim Shelton,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe\u2019s a former program officer at the Gates Foundation and a key Common Core champion in the Obama administration.\u201d But that\u2019s just Facebook. Of course, Google, Apple, YouTube, Pearson, Microsoft, and other tech giants are also cashing in on student data mining, courtesy of the federally incentivized Common Core standards \u2013 without parental consent. What could go wrong with liberal-biased tech industry giants having access to the private information, i.e., attitudes, psychological traits, preferences of America\u2019s schoolchildren? Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project and co-author of Deconstructing the Administrative State: The Fight for Liberty, tells Breitbart News the reason Facebook and other tech titans are now so \u201cembedded in schools\u201d is that politicians have ignored their responsibility to protect America\u2019s children. \u201cPoliticians (of both parties) have been asleep at the switch in protecting students from very bad education ideas,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven Republican governors have apparently concluded that the last people to be listened to when it comes to education are parents. Common Core? Listen to the education establishment and its crony corporate allies, not to parents. Student data privacy? Listen to ed-tech lobbyists, not to parents.\u201d \u201cThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results are showing the folly of Common Core,\u201d Robbins adds. \u201cWhat will it take to show the dangers of unbridled technology?\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " At a hearing of the House Education and the Workforce committee, former illegal immigrant Rep. Adriano Espaillat pressed DeVos to explain her views on immigration enforcement. \u201cInside the school,\u201d the New York Democrat asked, \u201cif a principal or a teacher finds out that a certain child is undocumented, or his or her family members are undocumented, do you feel that the principal or teacher is responsible to call [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and to have that family reported?\u201d \u201cSir, I think that\u2019s a school decision,\u201d DeVos responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a local community decision. And again, I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate, and I urge this body to do its job and address or clarify where there is confusion around this.\u201d The secretary\u2019s response received a swift response from Democrats, civil rights groups, and pro-amnesty media. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution,\u201d said\u00a0Lorella Praeli, the ACLU\u2019s director of immigration policy and campaigns, according to the Washington Post. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong\u201d:  Civil rights groups point to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Plyler v. Doe, which they say \u201cmade clear \u2026 that public schools have a constitutional obligation to provide schooling for children, regardless of immigration status,\u201d as the Post\u00a0reports. Obama-era Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder, in fact, jointly released\u00a0a \u201cDear Colleague guidance\u201d regarding the issue in May 2014. \u201cUnder Federal law, State and local educational agencies (hereinafter \u2018districts\u2019) are required to provide all children with equal access to public education at the elementary and secondary level,\u201d the Obama administration stated, adding: Both the United States Department of Justice and the United States Department of Education (Departments) write to remind you of the Federal obligation to provide equal educational opportunities to all children residing within your district and to offer our assistance in ensuring that you comply with the law. A July 2014 report by Ken Klukowski, legal editor at Breitbart News, noted\u00a0the 5-4 decision in Plyler\u00a0was written by \u201cultra-liberal Justice William Brennan\u201d and that \u201cconservative and moderate justices dissented.\u201d That decision remains \u201cthe only Supreme Court support for birthright citizenship,\u201d he observed. \u201cIt was wrongly decided and poorly reasoned and should be overruled.\u201d Other pro-amnesty groups were quick to condemn DeVos\u2019s comments. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said DeVos shows \u201castounding ignorance of the law\u201d and \u201cdesperately needs competent legal advice.\u201d \u201cAny public school or school district that denies an education to any undocumented child \u2014 whether by refusing to enroll, by limiting access to the programs and benefits provided to other students, or by reporting a child to ICE \u2014 has violated the United States Constitution,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the group, according to the Post. Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, said the issue is \u201csettled constitutional law.\u201d \u201cBetsy DeVos should know better, and to suggest otherwise only serves to frighten children,\u201d\u00a0she said:  For all the fuss from the left, however, DeVos has hardly held a firm line on immigration. In April 2017, while touring schools in Miami, Florida, DeVos said illegal immigrant students in Florida \u201cshould not be concerned\u201d about losing in-state tuition because the Trump administration is \u201cvery supportive\u201d of states deciding for themselves on such policy. \u201cWell, as you well know [immigration] is an issue that\u2019s been widely discussed within the administration and I yesterday referred to [Homeland Security Secretary] Gen. [John F.] Kelly\u2019s comments about the fact that [undocumented] students should not be concerned,\u201d the secretary said. \u201cThey should continue to focus on their studies and continue to pursue their educations. The administration is very supportive of states setting their direction and I would say that would be consistent here [for in-state tuition], too.\u201d As she toured Florida \u2013 the state that was once governed by Jeb Bush, her close colleague\u00a0and an amnesty supporter \u2013 DeVos was asked about her relationship with the former governor. \u201cWe have shared many ideas in the past years,\u201d she said. \u201cI served on the board of the organization he started and our paths have crossed many, many times over the years as we have done work in a variety of states. Our views and our heart for every child is very similar.\u201d Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said, in response to the criticism, that the secretary \u201chas repeatedly said that DACA students have the right to a K-12 education, as ruled on by the Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cShe has tremendous compassion for DACA students and has said repeatedly she hopes that Congress would do its job and give these students the certainty they deserve,\u201d the spokeswoman added, according to the Post.",

The \u201ctoughest lie,\u201d however, the former education chief said, is that \u201cwe say we value kids and we\u2019ve raised a generation of young people[,] teens who have been raised on mass shootings and gun violence.\u201d \u201cAnd that simply doesn\u2019t happen in other nations,\u201d he added, emphasizing later, \u201cChildren in other nations don\u2019t die like they do here.\u201d Asked by host Margaret Brennan if he \u201cmade a dent in any of that\u201d when he was education secretary, Duncan said: We had some, you know, real successes. We had some failures but on the success side we put more than a billion dollars into high quality early childhood education, which I think is the best investment we can make. We save more than 300,000 teacher jobs around the country when the economy was really in a very tough spot. We put 40 billion dollars into Pell Grants about going back to taxpayers for a nickel to make college more affordable. So things that we\u2019re very-very proud of but this is not a mission accomplished moment, obviously. I feel a huge sense of urgency. We have to get better, faster as a nation. We\u2019re not top 10 in anything. When Brennan asked Duncan about the approximately $7 billion he funneled into the School Improvement Grants program that sought to improve the worst-performing schools, she cited a report: The report I want to read you this quote found, \u201coverall across all grades, we found implementing any school improvement grants funded model had no significant impacts on math or reading test scores high school graduation or college and enrollment-enrollment.\u201d Excuse me, that\u2019s a pretty harsh criticism. \u201cNo, I think investing in our lowest performing schools is some of the hardest and most important work we can do,\u201d Duncan insisted, however. \u201cMargaret, I don\u2019t want to leave any kid behind or say they can\u2019t make it. As a nation we had more than 2,000 dropout factories a few years back. We now have less than eight hundred.\u201d \u201cBut this sounds like a failing grade from the Department of Education,\u201d Brennan pressed him. \u201cYeah, no, you always [have] to get better faster and again it is a short period of time they measured,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cOur high school graduation rates are all time highs. Those grants were a small piece of that[. T]here are many things that go into that.\u201d In 2013, when parents across the country joined in opposition to the Common Core State Standards, Duncan responded\u00a0by stating the complaints were coming from \u201cwhite suburban moms who \u2013 all of a sudden \u2013 their child isn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought they were, and their school isn\u2019t quite as good as they thought they were.\u201d When Brennan asked Duncan about his criticism of current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, he said DeVos does not understand the concept of proficiency in education. \u201cAnd what exactly is it that you think she is failing to understand or follow through on here?\u201d Brennan inquired. \u201cBecause she has kept a number of the Obama administration programs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s interesting you probably saw the news, for me, is this a crazy metaphor that about a week ago her yacht was found adrift, $40 million yacht just out there,\u201d Duncan replied. \u201cAnd for me that sort of represents where they are in terms of education policy. There isn\u2019t one.\u201d \u201cWhat does her personal wealth have to do with it?\u201d Brennan asked. \u201cIt-it doesn\u2019t have anything to do of it, it\u2019s just that it-it,\u201d Duncan responded. \u201cHer- the policy is adrift. There\u2019s nothing out there of substance.\u201d Duncan was apparently referring to a news report that the DeVos family yacht had been vandalized. Duncan ended by saying he hopes the Parkland, Florida, gun control activist students will \u201clead our nation, where we as adults have failed to take them, and that\u2019s to [a] place free of trauma and free of fear.\u201d",

      "content": " Autumn Foster Cook recalls\u00a0at the Federalist what Republicans and Democrats alike told Americans after passing the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015. The measure \u2013 signed\u00a0into law immediately by former President Barack Obama, who referred to it as a \u201cChristmas miracle,\u201d was hailed for \u201csupposedly \u2018putting more control for our schools in state and local hands\u2019\u00a0and \u2018reducing reliance on high-stakes testing,\u2019\u201d writes Cook. \u201cBut as the law has been rolled out under U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, ideals have succumbed to reality,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe law still forces states to play their maddening game of \u2018Mother, May I?\u2019 with the U.S. Department of Education (USED).\u201d Cook describes Utah as the \u201clatest loser\u201d of the game in which DeVos and Republican leaders like Sen. Lamar Alexander (TN) continue\u00a0to tout that ESSA has gotten rid of Common Core \u2013 the most recent federally-incentivized national progressive reform in education \u2013 and greatly diminished the federal footprint in education. However, as Shane Vander Hart wrote\u00a0at Truth in American Education, ESSA essentially cemented\u00a0Common Core \u2013 and its standardized tests \u2013 into every state in the country. \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vander Hart explained. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d ESSA, in fact, still requires states to submit their education plans for approval \u2013 and, thus, federal funding \u2013 to the federal education department. In Utah\u2019s case, DeVos told the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) she would not approve the state\u2019s plan and, therefore, give Utah its largest portion of federal funding (Title I), if less than 95 percent of its students participate in federally mandated tests. \u201cDue to big increases in parents refusing to let their kids take standardized tests after Common Core went into place, Utah\u2019s test rate last year was 94.1 percent,\u201d explains Cook. As Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, observed, one reason for Utah\u2019s rising opt-out numbers has been parents\u2019 discontent with the state\u2019s Common Core-aligned Student Assessment for Growth and Excellence (SAGE) test. Developed by the American Institutes for Research \u2013 a behavioral research organization \u2013\u00a0the test had not been shown to be academically valid. \u201cThe clash here, then, was between parents\u2019 inherent right to govern their children\u2019s education and indeed protect them from harm, as explicitly protected by state law, and federal mandates,\u201d Robbins wrote. \u201cGuess which won?\u201d Cook continues: After Utah\u2019s board tried twice to protect parental rights and follow state law, which protects parents\u2019 right to opt their kids out of state tests, Utah\u2019s education board finally succumbed, and agreed to follow USED\u2019s directive to count some students who opt out of state testing as \u201cnon-proficient,\u201d a move that attacks parental rights and penalizes schools with an opt out rate higher than 5 percent. What this means is that, although state law allows parents to opt their children out of standardized tests, some Utah students whose parents make that choice will be given a zero, which will cause aggregate scores to drop \u2013 thereby punishing their public schools and teachers. Cook points out the DeVos education department forged ahead with this demand even though \u201csection 1111 of ESSA states, \u2018Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preempting a State or local law regarding the decision of a parent to not have the parent\u2019s child participate in the academic assessments under this paragraph.\u2019\u201d In the end, Utah\u2019s education plan was approved after USED Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Jason Botel and state superintendent Sydnee Dickson negotiated what Cook says is a \u201ccomplete cave.\u201d \u201cSchools where more than 5 percent of students refuse to take federally mandated tests, the agreement says, face federal penalties,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat we have here is unelected federal officials\u2014DeVos and deputies such as Botel\u2014attempting an end-run around elected state officials. This is basically what all federal education involvement enables.\u201d Cook asserts: Contrary to lawmakers\u2019 promises, ESSA did not free states to pursue independent educational goals, nor reduce reliance on testing. DeVos\u2019s administration seems inclined to enforce the constraints as rigidly as possible, with little deference to state law and parental rights, despite precisely opposite rhetoric from DeVos, the Trump administration, and Republican congressional leadership that rushed ESSA into passage shortly before Barack Obama left office. In fact, Nicholas Tampio, associate professor of political science at Fordham University, explained in March, \u201cThe federal government has made it an expensive gamble for states to adopt education standards that differ from the Common Core.\u201d Noting that \u201cDeVos has approved virtually all [state] plans that include the Common Core or a slightly modified version,\u201d Tampio continued that ESSA requires states to adopt standards that align with \u201crelevant State career and technical education standards.\u201d \u201c[N]early every state that adopted the Common Core during the Obama administration has kept the most important features,\u201d Tampio observed, adding the claim of DeVos and politicians that ESSA \u201chas repealed the Common Core mandate is misleading.\u201d Some 42 states are still using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands.\u201d",

The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that the education department is considering using federal monies under the auspices of a program called Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, a program that does not bar using its funding for firearm purchases. Such an action opens the door for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u201cto use her discretion to approve any state or district plans to use grant funding for firearms and firearm training.\u201d Congressional Democrats are opposed to efforts to arm teachers for self-defense. On August 28, 2018, they sent a letter to Secretary DeVos, saying, \u201cWe write to express our opposition to any forthcoming action by the U.S. Department of Education to allow funds authorized under Title IV-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, for the purchase of firearms or firearms training for school staff.\u201d Later in the letter they wrote, \u201cStudents and school staff deserve a learning environment that is safe, welcoming, and conducive to quality learning and student instruction. Armed teachers would not only jeopardize students and staff health and safety, but also run counter to Congressional intent, precedent, and common sense.\u201d Missing from the Democrats\u2019 letter is any acknowledgement of the fact that school attackers target gun-free school after gun-free school in their efforts to cause death and mayhem, whether they target primary schools or secondary. After all, Virginia Tech (April 16, 2007), was gun free, Sandy Hook Elementary (December 14, 2012) was gun free, Umpqua Community College (October 1, 2015) was gun free, Parkland high school (February 14, 2018) was gun free, Sante Fe High School (May 18, 2018) was gun free, and the list goes on. When all other means of security are breached, teachers become the first responders. Unarmed teachers face a challenge in responding.

Now, the Education Department is stepping in to ensure that those accused of misconduct on college campuses are given a chance to defend themselves. In a statement by the Education Department, officials argue that current campus policies strip due process rights from those accused of sexual misconduct. The department recognizes that despite well-intentioned efforts by school districts, colleges and universities, advocacy organizations and the department itself, sexual harassment and assault continue to present serious problems across the nation\u2019s campuses. The lack of clear regulatory standards has contributed to processes that have not been fair to all parties involved, that have lacked appropriate procedural protections and that have undermined confidence in the reliability of the outcomes of investigations of sexual harassment allegations. \u201cThe truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students,\u201d DeVos said in a comment last fall. \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved.\u201d DeVos has been consistently outspoken about her distaste for an Obama-era policy that lowered the proof standard for campus sexual assault incident to the lowest legal standard possible. Analysts at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) are satisfied with DeVos\u2019 policy change, arguing that it will afford more student the due process protections that they deserve. \u201cGoing solely by what has so far been reported, it sounds as though the proposed rules will go a long way towards restoring meaningful due process protections to the campus justice system, which will benefit both accusers and the accused,\u201d said Robert L.

      "content": " In September 2017, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released\u00a0interim Title IX guidance that withdrew the 2011 Obama-era \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter on campus sexual violence. The letter\u00a0discouraged\u00a0the use of police investigations as primary because of their higher standards for criminal evidence and threatened schools with a loss of Title IX funding if they did not conduct their own investigations into sexual misconduct complaints that favored the alleged victims. \u201c[W]hen taking steps to separate the complainant and alleged perpetrator, a school should minimize the burden on the complainant,\u201d the Obama administration stated. The education department will hold a public comment period before the new rules are announced. DeVos has already conducted\u00a0listening sessions with survivors of sexual misconduct, campus administrators, parents, students falsely accused of sexual misconduct, and experts on the issue. \u201cMost alarming,\u201d writes\u00a0Abby Gardner at Glamour, is that \u201cchanges to federal policy on campus sexual misconduct will bolster the rights of the accused.\u201d \u201cThe rules \u2026 would also encourage schools to provide more support for victims, but considering DeVos\u2019 track record with education policy\u2014especially when it comes to rolling back protections for victims of sexual assault and harassment\u2014that\u2019s not exactly confidence inspiring,\u201d she adds. Gardner cites likely 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, who warned changes to the Obama policies will \u201cjeopardize student safety\u201d:  The proposed new rules were leaked\u00a0to the New York Times last week. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the education department, said the department was \u201cin the midst of a deliberative process\u201d and that information leaked to the Times\u00a0\u201cis premature and speculative, and therefore, we have no comment.\u201d The Times\u00a0stated the proposed rules \u201cnarrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.\u201d \u201cThey would also establish a higher legal standard to determine whether schools improperly addressed complaints,\u201d reported the newspaper. At the Mary Sue, Chelsea Steiner warns\u00a0that DeVos \u201cwants to protect everyone involved in sexual misconduct EXCEPT the victims.\u201d She claims DeVos\u2019s proposal to change the Obama administration\u2019s definition of sexual misconduct as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\u201d essentially means just about all sexual conduct will now be permissible. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry, students; unless a lecherous professor is literally blocking the door of his classroom with his boner, you\u2019ve got nothing to complain about,\u201d Steiner writes. Robby Soave, associate editor at Reason, however, asserts the Obama-era definition \u201cwas simply too broad, and imperiled speech that is obviously protected under the First Amendment, like giving a wrong answer on a quiz, or making a joke, or using a gendered salutation.\u201d Steiner complains further: But wait! It gets worse. The education secretary, who has endorsed a policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions in cases of campus assault, wants to allow victims and their accused perpetrators to request any evidence they want from each other. In addition, victims and perpetrators would be able to cross-examine each other during the mediation. Yahoo\u2019s Elise Sol\u00e9 also finds\u00a0the proposed mediation process \u2014 and the fact that a higher burden of proof of misconduct will be encouraged \u2014 unacceptable. \u201cBetsy DeVos\u2019s new college plan allows alleged sexual offenders to demand proof from their victims,\u201d is the headline of Sol\u00e9\u2019s article, in which she bemoans the secretary is \u201cintroducing new measures to colleges and universities that would, among other changes, allow people accused of sexual misconduct to cross-examine their victims and request evidence.\u201d  Jess Davidson, executive director of End Rape on Campus, told\u00a0HuffPost, \u201cWhat is reflected in the Times\u00a0article is a tacit endorsement of campuses where it is safer to commit sexual assault than to be a survivor.\u201d  Similarly, Sage Carson, manager of Know Your IX, told HuffPost\u00a0the new rules are \u201creally just saying that \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter that you were assaulted three minutes off campus. You still have to share a classroom with your rapist. And you don\u2019t have any rights.\u201d  While DeVos made herself clear that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable,\u201d she nevertheless asserted, \u201cThe era of \u2018rule by letter\u2019 is over,\u201d referring to the Obama \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. The secretary added: Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago. The Daily News\u2019s editorial board says\u00a0due process is exactly what is needed to put an end to the \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d that have erupted on college campuses: Today, the accused have no way to see the evidence against them, no way to appeal. Tomorrow, they are likely to be able to cross-examine accusers, and vice versa. \u2026 The hands wringing that fair procedures will terrify young women out of reporting serious violations ought to be applauding efforts to make Title IX a credible tool to vindicate victims. Soave agrees. \u201c[T]he idea that a person accused of sexual misconduct deserves some opportunity to scrutinize his accuser\u2019s claims, or at the very least compel an administrator to do so, shouldn\u2019t be seen as wildly controversial,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " But Congress has defied Trump and included increased funding for both the Department of Education and the National Institutes for Health (NIH), according to an Inside Higher Education report citing the deal reached by the House and Senate last week. The spending bill for fiscal year 2019, which begins October 1, would increase the Education Department\u2019s total budget to $71.5\u00a0billion \u2014 the second year in a row Congress has boosted funding, despite calls for heavy cuts by the Trump administration. The maximum Pell Grant would be raised by $100 to $6,195 in the agreement. Perkins Career and Technical Education grants will get $1.26\u00a0billion \u2014 a $70\u00a0million increase from the previous year. Funding for an eligibility fix for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was extended to the tune of $350\u00a0million. The money is targeted to borrowers whose qualifying payments were counted as ineligible because of errors by their loan servicers. The National Institutes of Health also gets a financial boost with a $38.1 billion infusion \u2014 up $2 billion from last year\u2019s budget. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), chairman of the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, said the proposed budget is \u201cbipartisan.\u201d \u201cI urge all of our colleagues to join us in getting this bill across the finish line,\u201d Blunt said in the Inside Higher Education report. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) used the \u201cbipartisan\u201d agreement to slam Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education secretary. \u201cThe message of this bipartisan agreement couldn\u2019t be any clearer: Democrats and Republicans once again reject Secretary DeVos\u2019s extreme anti-public-education agenda and are fighting back against her attempts to undermine our students and public schools,\u201d Murray said. The spending bill \u2014 packaged with defense and other shorter funding bills will prevent a government shutdown if the budget is put in place by the September 30 deadline.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  The declaration, which was produced at this first gathering of the \u201cEducation Working Group\u201d of the G-20 governments and dictatorships, was titled \u201cBuilding Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,\u201d and calls for globalization of education, inclusiveness, social and emotional learning, and increasing data collection on students throughout their educations and well into their careers. In her prepared remarks\u00a0to the G-20 education ministers in Argentina, DeVos brought forward her goal for workforce development, or government management of the workforce, which the Trump administration has recently stressed in its proposal\u00a0to merge the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cIndeed, education and the economy are indivisible, especially given the interconnectedness of the world today,\u201d DeVos said, emphasizing that while each child is \u201can individual,\u201d governments should approach education by acknowledging \u201cthe realities of today\u2019s economy, with an eye toward tomorrow\u2019s opportunities.\u201d \u201cSo, students must be prepared to anticipate and adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to acquire and master broadly transferrable and versatile educational competencies like critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity and cultural intelligence.\u201d The secretary also stressed her signature issues of school choice and vocational apprenticeships in her remarks. The declaration specifically states the G-20 education ministers are \u201cin line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda,\u201d and continues: It is important that education keeps pace with societal and technological innovations such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Internet of Things. We recognise that changes in the economy and labour markets have profound implications for education and training systems even though many of them remain unpredictable. Acknowledging the autonomy and diversity of national, regional and local governments and contexts, emerging knowledge and 21st century skills should be considered in curriculum development and pedagogical approaches at all levels of education. The curricula should be highly responsive to evidence-based practices, future employment trends, and design in collaboration with key stakeholders. The education ministers note that while \u201cincreased investments in education above certain thresholds do not necessarily entail better outcomes,\u201d the way to achieve their goals is through \u201cstrengthening governance, management, monitoring and accountability,\u201d methods that involve greater government control of education. The G-20 education ministers continue: We commit to facilitating the internationalisation of education, including the cross-border recognition of qualifications and skills, and the mobility of students, teachers, academic and non-academic staff, trainers and researchers, with a view to improving quality education and research, and in accordance with the respective national laws, rules and policies. We support the promotion of exchange and scholarships programmes among G20 members and other countries, in particular with developing countries around the globe. \u201cUnderstanding and appreciating other parts of the world, different religions, cultures, languages and points of view are essential elements of global and cultural competence,\u201d the education leaders say. In addition to urging \u201cdigital literacy,\u201d the education ministers say they will \u201cfoster the inclusion of non-cognitive skills such as socio-emotional skills across the curriculum [\u00a0SEL].\u201d Following the summit, DeVos told reporters the declaration is \u201cvery consistent with all of the themes that we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d\u00a0reported\u00a0Education Week. \u201cUltimately, the meeting resulted in a declaration that calls for putting education \u2018at the center of the global agenda,\u2019\u201d the report added. \u201cIt says the G-20 nations will work to \u2018ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u2019\u201d DeVos said the United States can learn from other G-20 countries, who are making more progress in the area of developing the 21st\u00a0Century skills. \u201cThere are too many other countries that are\u00a0further down the path of adopting some of these themes and embracing some of these opportunities,\u201d she said. U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE) \u2013 an organization of parents, taxpayers, and educators who are committed to ending the U.S. Department of Education, has called for the dismissal of DeVos. On Tuesday, USPIE sent a letter\u00a0to President Donald Trump in which the group called for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, per the Constitution, and the end to federal education programs. In its letter, USPIE reminded Trump of his campaign promises to eliminate Common Core and begin dismantling of the federal education department. \u201cSince her appointment, Secretary DeVos has used the hammer of the Federal government to broaden its authority and disregard the rights of states and parents,\u201d USPIE wrote, adding: Three actions in particular demonstrate this disregard: \u201cWe do not believe these actions are consistent with your \u2018America First\u2019 philosophy nor your campaign promises that generated so much enthusiasm,\u201d the grassroots education group told Trump. \u201cGiven these concerns, we call for the immediate dismissal of Secretary DeVos and for the appointment of an American education leader who will prioritize the fulfillment of your campaign promises.\u201d",

The comments were made during a forum on free speech in higher education that was put on by the Department of Justice. \u201cMake no mistake, this Department of Justice is concerned about the suppression of speech that is now occurring,\u201d Sessions said during the event, which took place on Monday. \u201cThis has gone too far. It must end. This country protects noisome assembly, immoderate speech and provocative speech. Whether left or right. Suppression of competing voices is not the American way,\u201d\u00a0Sessions added. Sessions pointed to several examples of speech suppression, including a policy that barred a student from handing out Spanish-language copies of the American Constitution outside of Pierce College\u2019s free speech zone. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chimed in on the topic at a separate event that was held on Monday. \u201c[Universities] too often attempt to shield students from ideas they subjectively decide are hateful or offensive or injurious or ones they just don\u2019t like,\u201d DeVos said. Breitbart News has been relentlessly covering the speech suppression trend in higher education over the past several years. Breitbart News dedicated dozens of stories to the chaos at Evergreen State College, which focused on the intense backlash faced by Professor Bret Weinstein who was chased off campus after he pushed back against a diversity initiative that asked all white members of the community to leave campus for the day.",

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " A new report from the College Fix details a proposed policy from the Department of Education that aims to provide due process rights to students accused of sexual assault on college campuses. According to K.C. Johnson, a Brooklyn College professor and Duke lacrosse case expert, the current Department of Education is seeking to repair the damage done by Obama-era policies that unfairly\u00a0increased the likelihood that students accused of sexual assault on campus would be found guilty by internal university investigators. Now, the new policy suggests that the Department of Education hopes to provide a legitimate hearing for those accused of sexual assault. Under the Obama-era policy, the accused was not permitted to cross-examine his accuser. New regulations from the Education Department highlight the importance of cross-examination in the truth-seeking process. Writing in response to the document, Johnson suggests that universities will still be able to keep their unfair investigation processes. However, Johnson says that he is encouraged by the new guidelines\u2019 emphasis on cross-examination during the investigation process, which completely reverses the prior position on cross-examination under the Obama-era guidelines. Rhetorically, this is a 180-degree shift from the Obama-era guidance\u2014from seeing cross-examination as something to be discouraged to seeing it as something necessary for fairness and truth-seeking. Practically, however, universities that want to retain their guilt-presuming systems will be able to do so. Schools that use hearings can continue to forbid lawyers from speaking and instead, funnel questions for the accuser and other witnesses through the panel (which won\u2019t be required to ask them). More problematically, the regulation\u2019s framing likely will generate strong pressure from accusers\u2019 rights organizations and their political and media allies for colleges to abandon hearings altogether in sexual misconduct cases, and adopt the single-investigator model in their stead. Resisting this pressure will require a degree of courage largely absent from university presidents during the debate over campus due process. Attorney Ruth O\u2019Meara-Costello said in a blog post that she believes universities will essentially ignore the new guidelines if the Department of Education is able to put them into effect.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it seems very likely that colleges and universities, many of which have taken strong positions against allowing cross-examination, will respond to the rules by simply eschewing actual hearings in favor of the increasingly popular single-investigator model,\u201d O\u2019Meara-Costello wrote in the post.",

      "subtitle": "The plight of Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 presumed guilty of sexual misconduct based solely on a woman\u2019s accusation and without due process \u2013 has been experienced by many young men on college campuses since the Obama administration utilized Title IX to enact its campus sexual assault policies.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " \u201cWhat has been happening to young men on college campuses is now playing out on the national stage with Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d retired university administrator Patricia Daugherty told Breitbart News. \u201cIncredible money and \u2018training\u2019 have gone into efforts to immediately side with the accuser, with little to no interest in due process for the accused. The fever pitch we see on the news has been nurtured in college.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s anticipated new rules reversing the Obama-era policies are, in fact, causing a feminist meltdown. At The Mary Sue, Chelsea Steiner\u00a0warned\u00a0that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u201cwants to protect everyone involved in sexual misconduct EXCEPT the victims.\u201d \u201cThe education secretary, who has endorsed a policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions in cases of campus assault, wants to allow victims and their accused perpetrators to request any evidence they want from each other,\u201d Steiner said, explaining her alarm. \u201cIn addition, victims and perpetrators would be able to cross-examine each other during the mediation.\u201d Daugherty, who currently is president of Eagle Forum of Georgia, said parents\u2019 concerns for their sons on college campuses are \u201ccompletely rational in this climate.\u201d \u201cWe are doing a terrible disservice to young men and also to young women by encouraging such emotional, fear-based atmospheres,\u201d she added. In September 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses. DeVos\u00a0stressed\u00a0in a new \u201cinterim Q & A\u201d that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations. In her announcement, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of actions which were never proven. \u201cInstead of working with schools,\u201d DeVos said, \u201cthe prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s proposed new rules were\u00a0leaked\u00a0to the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0at the end of August. While Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the information leaked to the\u00a0Times\u00a0\u201cis premature and speculative,\u201d the newspaper reported the rules \u201cnarrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.\u201d Many college and university officials have said they will ignore the new campus rules put forward by the Trump administration. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro \u2013 now known for releasing a grand jury report alleging\u00a0at least 1,000 children were sexually abused by Roman Catholic clergy in his state over 70 years \u2013 condemned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to scrap the Obama-era sexual misconduct policies. Shapiro said reversing the Obama administration\u2019s policies \u201cthreaten to make college campuses less safe, not more safe.\u201d \u201cWe made important strides over the last years of the Obama administration when it comes to Title IX issues,\u201d Shapiro said, according to TribLive. \u201cAnd the idea that Secretary Betsy DeVos would want to roll back those Title IX (civil rights) protections is something that does not sit well with me.\u201d \u201cI have all the confidence in the world in our university leaders of Pennsylvania,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cThey\u2019ll fill the gap created by the Trump administration\u2019s wrong-headed policies.\u201d Joy Pullmann, executive editor at\u00a0the Federalist, told Breitbart News the ideology behind the implementation of the Obama-era policies on campuses sparked the fire that has spread across the nation. \u201cIt has always been true but is now becoming obvious to more Americans that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, or only affect the minority of Americans with college degrees,\u201d she explained. \u201cU.S. colleges and universities create the ideas, atmosphere, and policies that affect the nation, plus the nation\u2019s taxpayers underwrite the bulk of our elite\u2019s credentials through these institutions, and this is why everyone should care and raise his or her voice about what happens there.\u201d \u201cObama\u2019s Title IX rules that amped up campus kangaroo courts were quite clearly a test run of the kind of sexist mob attacks they want to bring to the entire culture,\u201d Pullmann added. \u201cThe effects are to degrade society by degrading justice itself, by reducing it to identity politics rather than the truth of what happened.\u201d Daugherty said while she is encouraged by the Trump administration\u2019s plans to reverse the Obama Title IX policy, she anticipates a continued battle. \u201cThat in itself won\u2019t change the emphasis on today\u2019s college campuses,\u201d she warned. \u201cWay too many faculty and administrators are devoted to far-left political ideologies, and they are teaching these ideologies to their students every day.\u201d Parents of sons may continue to have reason to be concerned that liberal university pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s new rules will still place young men, in particular, in danger of false accusations with minimal recourse. \u201cParents need to teach their sons to treat everyone with respect and dignity, but their sons can\u2019t be na\u00efve,\u201d Daugherty said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to be suspicious of all women, of course, but they need to be aware of not getting into situations that might come back to haunt them.\u201d Writing at the Federalist, Melissa Danford, an army wife and mother of four boys, said what she is seeing now should stir parents of sons to rise up. \u201cI cannot accept a world in which my sons will be raised under the tyranny of a lawless, vindictive society that wants to subdue and oppress men in the name of equality for women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe future isn\u2019t female; it belongs to both your daughters\u00a0and\u00a0my sons. Abandoning the basic standards of the rule of law will not empower women; it will enslave us all.\u201d Pullmann agreed it is \u201cquite rational for mothers to wonder whether their sons will be discriminated against simply because of their sex.\u201d \u201cGiven that we have not only seen high-profile assault hoaxes \u2013 such as Columbia\u2019s \u2018mattress girl\u2019 and the UVA Rolling Stone hoax \u2013 but also a litany of lower-profile incidents on campuses throughout the country, some of which are being litigated in real courts due to the egregiously unjust outcomes,\u201d she added. The\u00a0Daily News\u2019s editorial board also\u00a0said\u00a0due process is exactly what is needed to put an end to the \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d that have erupted on college campuses: Today, the accused have no way to see the evidence against them, no way to appeal. Tomorrow, they are likely to be able to cross-examine accusers, and vice versa. \u2026 The hands wringing that fair procedures will terrify young women out of reporting serious violations ought to be applauding efforts to make Title IX a credible tool to vindicate victims. Pullmann added traditional sexual morality actually protects both men and women from sexual misconduct allegations and misconduct towards each other. \u201cBoth men and women should not have sex, or sexually charged interactions, with strangers while drunk,\u201d she asserted. \u201cEven without alcohol, sex without a marital commitment puts both the man and the woman in danger, not only of accusations but of being mistreated sexually by someone who doesn\u2019t love them enough to commit to them for life.\u201d Pullmann advised parents to explicitly teach their sons \u201cnot to trivialize sex, but to regard it, and therefore women, as precious.\u201d \u201cSince neither our culture nor most educational institutions will do this \u2014 sometimes not even churches \u2014 parents must take the task upon themselves all the more if they want to protect both their sons and their daughters from the brutalities of our hookup culture,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " \u201cWe\u2019ve learned \u2026 that Harvard University and some of the other major universities \u00a0have slipped back into an unacceptable practice of discrimination against Asian-American kids even though they had best scores,\u201d he told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday. \u201cDespite meeting the criteria for admissions, they ended up being rejected because [the colleges] wanted less of an Asian-American presence. That\u2019s called racial discrimination, and we can\u2019t accept it.\u201d On Wednesday, Rohrabacher held an event devoted to the issue at\u00a0the Vietnam War Memorial at Freedom Park in Westminster, a key landmark for the local South Vietnamese community. In a statement, he said: \u201cThe admissions process at our colleges and universities should be color-blind and ethnically neutral. Standards that unfairly discriminate against one race or ethnicity must be eradicated. \u201cIt is unconstitutional, illegal, and just plain wrong for educational institutions to have admissions policies based on race,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe supposed benevolent intent of promoting diversity is no excuse for blatant race-based decisions which are unfair and cause great harm to Asian-American children.\u201d Rohabacher noted that he had also sent a letter to Secretary of Educaton Betsy DeVos asking for a meeting about what her department was doing to address the subject. (The Department of Justice has already weighed in in favor of a current lawsuit against Harvard.) He told Breitbart on Thursday that in his meeting with DeVos, \u201cwe will holler and scream until we get something done.\u201d Rohrabacher is in a tough re-election fight in the 48th congressional district. His opponent, Harley Rouda, is a former Republican who has criticized Rohrabacher\u2019s support for better relations with Russia. Rouda is backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor who now supports gun control and climate change activism, and who is committed to helping Democrats win the house. \u201cI\u2019m up against a\u00a0New York liberal billionaire,\u201d Rohrabacher told Breitbart News, saying that he had been outspent ten-to-one. But he was not worried, he said: \u201cMy people are smart enough to see a power play.\u201d In a recent debate on local television, Rohrabacher hit Rouda over his support for Medicare for illegal aliens. Footage later emerged of Rouda threatening to quit the debate because Rohrabacher was using notes. The moderator, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist\u00a0Rick Reiff, looked unimpressed by Rouda and his staff. Rohrabacher said that there were two closing messages in his campaign. \u201cOne is that if, indeed, Democrats get control of the House, any of the efforts our presence is making to get control of our border and stop the massive flow if illegal immigration into our country \u2014 that whole effort will just flounder and end.\u201d The other message, he said, is that Democrats \u201cwill give us two years of the worst type of negative, hate-filled politics, where they try to obstruct our president and impeach him. America doesn\u2019t need that kind of turmoil.\u201d He speculated that Democrats had been relying on younger voters, who had been \u201ctaught by their professors exactly the wrong things about how a democratic system can work and how an economy can function.\u201d One issue where Rohrabacher had managed to reach those younger voters has been his long-standing support for the legalization of marijuana. He recently accompanied senior citizens from his district to a marijuana dispensary nearby. \u201cCannabis should be left to state and local government, not the federal government,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cA federal police force (the Drug Enforcement Administration) conducting raids far from D.C. is not what our Founding Fathers had in mind.\u201d He cited the positive medical uses of marijuana: \u201cNow, research that\u2019s been done on cannabis \u2014 finally, after they suppressed research all these years \u2014 [shows] things that alleviate pain, [and] bring back appetite. Our veterans who are coming back from war say cannabis helps prevent seizures, and gets them off opioids.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think marijuana has helped me for about 10% of the vote \u2014 and not just among young people.\u201d A poll released Friday shows Rohrabacher with his first statistically significant lead in recent months.

Beverly Perdue as the chair of the National Assessment Governing Board,\u201d DeVos said in a statement. \u201cHer years of experience and time spent in the classroom as a public school teacher will be vital to the work of the board as it continues its efforts to strengthen and advance education opportunities for students across our country.\u201d In 2015, Perdue penned\u00a0an op-ed at the Hechinger Report, in which she defended her decision to adopt Common Core for her state. \u201cIn a global economy, it doesn\u2019t matter where you live but it does matter what you know, and children everywhere ought to know what other students across America and the world are learning,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt makes no difference whether you call them Common Core or whether every state gives them a different name.\u201d Perdue continued that the standards would be helping young people succeed in a \u201cfast-paced world in which skills and jobs change daily.\u201d The former governor said she was particularly impressed with Common Core math: I recently visited a second-grade classroom in North Carolina and watched a fabulous teacher help kids understand the concept of the number \u201c55.\u201d \u00a0She used 12 addition and subtraction examples to show kids how many different math equations get you to 55. She showed them how you can use five buckets of tens and five buckets of ones. Or you can use 11 buckets of fives \u2014 or six \u201cfives,\u201d two tens\u201d and five \u201cones.\u201d \u00a0She taught these second-graders to think logically and to explore how many ways you can get to an answer. \u201cThe Common Core standards encourage problem-solving and critical thinking skills \u2013 skills that were often absent in the classrooms of the past,\u201d Perdue wrote. The former governor expressed concern about \u201cfears that, by adopting Common Core, the federal government is over-reaching into our schools and threatening to nationalize curriculum.\u201d \u201cThe state has even empaneled a commission to review and rewrite the standards, even though North Carolina has already invested over $66 million in training teachers and school leaders, updating curriculum and transitioning to the Common Core,\u201d she wrote, defending the Core further and asserting that \u201cstandards\u201d and \u201ccurriculum\u201d are separate concepts. \u201c[T]he Common Core State Standards were not created, approved or mandated by the federal government,\u201d Perdue wrote in opposition to grassroots parent groups.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe standards were created by the states. And, they don\u2019t dictate curriculum, which remains entirely under the control of local school boards, principals and teachers.\u201d However, even as early as 2014, the CEO of the federally funded Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) \u2013 a Common Core assessment consortium \u2013 confirmed\u00a0the standards and their aligned assessments were intended to drive curriculum. \u201cHigh quality assessments go hand-in-hand with high quality instruction based on high quality standards,\u201d said Laura Slover. \u201cYou cannot have one without the other. The PARCC states see quality assessments as a\u00a0part\u00a0of instruction, not a\u00a0break\u00a0from instruction.\u201d Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, also noted at the time: The proponents of Common Core and PARCC continue to insist that tests and standards are not about curriculum, but that\u2019s a ruse. Teachers already know that what is tested at the end of the year is what is taught in classrooms throughout the year. PARCC may not mandate one textbook or one pacing guide, but the CEO of the federally funded PARCC has admitted one thing: PARCC controls instruction and instruction is curriculum. Since leaving office, Perdue has led\u00a0Digital Learning Institute, an education nonprofit company that seeks to expand technology in the classroom. Perdue received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 the primary private source of funding for the development and implementation of Common Core \u2013 for her venture. \u201cPerdue also has served as a Resident Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Duke University\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy,\u201d notes the education department. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues on the board to close our nation\u2019s achievement gap and ensure that all students, regardless of geography or circumstance, have access to a great education that prepares them for the jobs of tomorrow,\u201d Perdue said in a statement.

The Kentucky representative described how many of his liberal constituents who were against DeVos\u2019s confirmation wanted him to do something to stop her from taking the reins of the education department. Since he had no vote on the matter, he decided to introduce a bill that would end the department entirely and, thereby, render her without a job. Massie said that, when he is faced with new legislation requiring a vote, he considers three \u201ctests.\u201d \u201cNumber one, is the bill constitutional?\u201d the Republican said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not constitutional, I\u2019m not going to vote for it.\u201d \u201cBut even if it\u2019s constitutional, can we afford it?\u201d Massie said he asks himself next. \u201cBecause if we can\u2019t afford it, if there\u2019s no money to pay for it, I can\u2019t vote for that either.\u201d \u201cFinally, is it better done at the state level, federal level, or maybe it\u2019s better done at the school board or the local level,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a role of the federal government, then I won\u2019t vote for it either.\u201d Massie added that, when very lengthy bills are presented for a vote with little time given to read them, he may also vote against them because he cannot possibly vote responsibly since there is insufficient time to consider the legislation. The congressman said \u2013 even with these criteria \u2013 he only votes \u201cno\u201d about 25 percent of the time. Yet, other GOP members of Congress have given him the nickname, \u201cMr. No.\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201cParents deserve to know what is happening in their child\u2019s school,\u201d DeVos said in a statement announcing the new guide. She added: They should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children\u2019s education. This guide demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing parents with user-friendly tools and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Informed parents become empowered and engaged parents\u00a0who are able to better advocate on behalf of their children. Ironically, the federal \u201cguide\u201d is titled \u201cA Parent Guide to State and Local Report Cards.\u201d DeVos is advertising the guide as a means to achieve \u201ctransparency\u201d about the accountability requirements of the federal law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In the guide, the education department explains that ESSA requires student report cards to display information about how much money from federal, state, and local sources is spent per student for each school. The law also mandates that report cards provide results of annual statewide tests in reading, English language arts, math, and science, and results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). According to the department, ESSA states report cards must also provide parents with information about school disciplinary measures such as number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests, and incidents of violence in schools. Additionally, the federal education law requires all parents to receive information about English-language learners, children with disabilities, and foster and homeless children in their schools on their children\u2019s report cards. DeVos has touted ESSA as the means to bring about more state flexibility in control of education, though state education plans must still be approved by the federal government. The secretary has also said on several occasions that ESSA has done away with the Common Core standards, though some 42 states are still\u00a0using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands.\u201d In a recent article at the Federalist, Utah parent organizer Autumn Foster Cook wrote\u00a0about ESSA: Contrary to lawmakers\u2019 promises, ESSA did not free states to pursue independent educational goals, nor reduce reliance on testing. DeVos\u2019s administration seems inclined to enforce the constraints as rigidly as possible, with little deference to state law and parental rights, despite precisely opposite rhetoric from DeVos, the Trump administration, and Republican congressional leadership that rushed ESSA into passage shortly before Barack Obama left office. Shane Vander Hart also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at Truth in American Education that ESSA essentially\u00a0cemented\u00a0Common Core \u2013 and its standardized tests \u2013 into every state in the country. \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vander Hart explained. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d  The education department is hosting a \u201cdesign challenge\u201d contest for the new report cards.",

      "content": " \u201cThe rumors are just that \u2026 rumors,\u201d DeVos\u2019s press secretary Elizabeth Hill reportedly said in an email statement, reports\u00a0USA Today. \u201cThe Secretary has no plans of stepping down.\u201d DeVos has critics on both the left and the right, but Democrats who will soon control the House say they plan to call the secretary before key committees for questioning. Democrats have long supported a strong federal education department that heavily funds public schools, holds them accountable to carry out the Party\u2019s social justice agenda, and keeps the teacher union base content. In a recent interview with the New American, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) noted, \u201cThe left understands that this is where you win or lose \u2013 in the schools and in the teaching of the children.\u201d While DeVos has changed the focus of the department to school choice, she has not, however, fulfilled what the conservative/libertarian base of the Republican Party had viewed as Donald Trump\u2019s plan to gradually dismantle the department. The Constitution does not give the federal government authority to decide education policy. Additionally, DeVos has hired\u00a0many education staffers with ties to her longstanding colleague, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lost in the 2016 GOP primary race, in part, because of his advocacy for the Common Core standards. The secretary also recently appointed\u00a0former Democrat Gov. Beverly Perdue of North Carolina, to head the National Assessment Governing Board. Like Bush, Perdue is a longtime champion of Common Core. Among the issues Politico reported\u00a0House Democrats will aggressively address with DeVos is the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmoves to stop state-led scrutiny of federal student loan servicers.\u201d The report observed that Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, \u201cis expected to lead the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing education funding.\u201d DeLauro had \u201cclashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the issue earlier this year,\u201d noted Politico. Teachers\u2019 unions are eager to have their newly elevated Democrat representatives interrogate DeVos. The National Education Association (NEA) said in a statement after the midterm elections that Democrats are now \u201cpositioned to shift the balance of power in state capitals and the U.S. Congress, where victories will add a critical check on policies that have hurt students, their families and communities.\u201d \u201cLawmakers learned an important lesson \u2026 You can either work with educators to address the needs of students and public education, or they will work to elect someone who will,\u201d said NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda. \u201cCandidates across the country witnessed unprecedented activism by educators in their races. Standing up for students and supporting public education were deciding factors for voters, and educators will hold lawmakers to their promises.\u201d Education Week\u00a0also noted\u00a0that, with Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott now about to take the helm of the House education committee, \u201cincreased oversight of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u201d is a given. ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The overhaul of Obama-era Title IX campus sex assault policies is expected to provide due process for those accused of sexual misconduct, including the ability to cross-examine their accusers. According to the report, the proposed regulations will be released before Thanksgiving, and possibly even this week. \u201cThe new rules would reduce liability for universities, tighten the definition of sexual harassment, and allow schools to use a higher standard in evaluating claims of sexual harassment and assault,\u201d states WaPo. Under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, colleges and universities are expected to be allowed to choose between \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d and the higher bar of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence in evaluating claims. The Obama administration directed schools to use the lower \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. In September 2017, education secretary Betsy DeVos announced the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses. DeVos\u00a0stressed\u00a0in a new \u201cinterim Q & A\u201d that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations. In her announcement, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of misconduct actions which were never proven. \u201cInstead of working with schools,\u201d DeVos said, \u201cthe prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s proposed new rules were\u00a0leaked\u00a0to the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0at the end of August. While Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the information leaked to the\u00a0Times\u00a0\u201cis premature and speculative,\u201d the newspaper reported the rules \u201cnarrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.\u201d The plight of Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 who had been presumed guilty of sexual misconduct based solely on the accusations of women and without due process \u2013 brought the experience many young men on college campuses face to light, since the Obama administration utilized Title IX to enact its campus sexual assault policies. \u201cWhat has been happening to young men on college campuses is now playing out on the national stage with Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d retired university administrator Patricia Daugherty told Breitbart News in September during the Senate confirmation hearings. \u201cIncredible money and \u2018training\u2019 have gone into efforts to immediately side with the accuser, with little to no interest in due process for the accused. The fever pitch we see on the news has been nurtured in college.\u201d Daugherty, who currently is president of Eagle Forum of Georgia, said parents\u2019 concerns for their sons on college campuses are \u201ccompletely rational in this climate.\u201d \u201cWe are doing a terrible disservice to young men and also to young women by encouraging such emotional, fear-based atmospheres,\u201d she added. Some college and university officials, however, have already said they will ignore the Trump administration\u2019s anticipated campus rules. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro condemned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to scrap the Obama-era sexual misconduct policies. Shapiro said reversing the Obama administration\u2019s policies \u201cthreaten to make college campuses less safe, not more safe.\u201d \u201cWe made important strides over the last years of the Obama administration when it comes to Title IX issues,\u201d Shapiro\u00a0said, according to TribLive. \u201cAnd the idea that Secretary Betsy DeVos would want to roll back those Title IX (civil rights) protections is something that does not sit well with me.\u201d \u201cI have all the confidence in the world in our university leaders of Pennsylvania,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cThey\u2019ll fill the gap created by the Trump administration\u2019s wrong-headed policies.\u201d According to Politico, Democrats who will soon take control of the House are \u201cready to pounce\u201d on the Trump administration over the anticipated rules overhaul. \u201cThe rewrite is among the most controversial moves she\u2019s made since taking office and Democrats are sure to target it as\u00a0they wield their newfound control of the House\u00a0to call DeVos and her aides to testify on Capitol Hill,\u201d the report states, adding that California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters is hosting a roundtable Thursday with members of Congress, civil rights advocates, and student leaders about the proposed rules. Joy Pullmann, executive editor at\u00a0the Federalist, told Breitbart News the ideology behind the implementation of the Obama-era policies on campuses sparked the fire that has spread across the nation. \u201cIt has always been true but is now becoming obvious to more Americans that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, or only affect the minority of Americans with college degrees,\u201d she explained, adding: U.S. colleges and universities create the ideas, atmosphere, and policies that affect the nation, plus the nation\u2019s taxpayers underwrite the bulk of our elite\u2019s credentials through these institutions, and this is why everyone should care and raise his or her voice about what happens there. \u201cObama\u2019s Title IX rules that amped up campus kangaroo courts were quite clearly a test run of the kind of sexist mob attacks they want to bring to the entire culture,\u201d Pullmann continued. \u201cThe effects are to degrade society by degrading justice itself, by reducing it to identity politics rather than the truth of what happened.\u201d",

      "content": " On Friday, DeVos released her department\u2019s proposed rule\u00a0and welcomed public comment on it. \u201cThroughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,\u201d the secretary said in a statement. She added: That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function. \u201cThe proposed rule would require schools to apply basic due process protections for students, including a presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process,\u201d the department states, \u201cwritten notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected; and the right to cross-examination, subject to \u2018rape shield\u2019 protections.\u201d According to the statement, the draft rule\u00a0would require colleges and universities to respond to and investigate formal complaints of sexual harassment. They would be required to hold a \u201clive hearing where cross-examination would be conducted through the parties\u2019 advisors,\u201d the statement says. Personal confrontation, however, between the complainant and the respondent would not be permitted. Colleges and universities would not be allowed to use a \u201csingle investigator\u201d or \u201cinvestigator-only\u201d model, according to the draft rule, and both parties would be permitted to appeal, if one is offered. The proposed rule would define sexual harassment consistent with the definition used in U.S. Supreme Court Title IX cases, i.e., \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d The rule also adopts the Clery Act\u00a0definition of sexual assault and includes it in the definition of sexual harassment under Title IX. Supportive measures to assist students during investigations into complaints of sexual misconduct might include changes in classes, counseling, no-contact orders, dorm room reassignments, and leaves of absence. \u201cIt is our goal with this proposed rule to ensure that Title IX grievance proceedings become more transparent, consistent, and reliable in their processes and outcomes,\u201d said DeVos, adding: Far too many students have been forced to go to court to ensure their rights are protected because the Department has not set out legally binding rules that hold schools accountable for responding to allegations of sexual harassment in a supportive, fair manner. By following proper legal procedures and receiving input on our proposed rule, we will ultimately have a final regulation that ensures that Title IX protects all students. In September 2017, education secretary Betsy DeVos announced the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses.

We will continue to support survivors. \u201cWhat has happened to ACLU is one of the saddest developments of the Trump era,\u201d tweeted Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald. \u201cBut there are already groups \u2013 such as @TheFIREorg- emerging to replace it as an actual civil liberties group which defends rights regardless of partisan outcomes.\u201d Journalist Michael Tracey responded to Greenwald, \u201cComplaining about excessive protections for people accused of crimes is an odd position for the ACLU to take, but then again it\u2019s been slowly transforming into a general liberal advocacy organization rather than a civil liberties organization.\u201d  Brooklyn College history professor KC Johnson tweeted the ACLU\u2019s response was \u201cmindboggling.\u201d \u201cCross-examination by a lawyer is \u2018inappropriately favoring the accused?\u2019\u201d Johnson asked. \u201cEnsuring both parties have access to training materials and evidence? Does the ACLU now adopt those positions more broadly?\u201d  \u201cThis is reprehensible,\u201d tweeted musician and \u201cold school liberal\u201d Collin Slattery. \u201cThe accused deserve due process. Period.\u201d \u201cShame on you ACLU,\u201d Slattery continued. \u201cThe kangaroo courts that take place on campus are the very definition of violation of civil liberties.\u201d  On Friday, DeVos released\u00a0the long-awaited proposed rule that underscores the seriousness of sexual assault as it also\u00a0stresses the importance of due process for those students accused of misconduct. The rule calls for a \u201cpresumption of innocence throughout the grievance process,\u201d \u201cwritten notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected.\u201d Additionally, both parties would have the right to cross-examination with the new rule.  \u201cNot only will these rules restore basic due process and fairness to college tribunals, but they also \u2014 given how basic the changes are \u2014 highlight just how ridiculous university kangaroo courts have become,\u201d observes David French at National Review. French adds: I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait. Not only did some schools deny cross-examination, but they also denied the accused access to the relevant evidence in his case, including exculpatory evidence?\u201d Yes, they did deny access to evidence. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for accused students to walk into hearings with only a cursory understanding of the charges against them and partial access to evidence, and then have to respond \u2014 on the fly \u2014 without access to any legal help. French continued the ACLU\u2019s response to the new rule created \u201ca disturbance in the legal Force, as if the voices of generations of ACLU civil libertarians cried out in anguish and were suddenly silenced by wokeness.\u201d \u201cThe old-school ACLU knew there was no contradiction between defending due process and \u2018supporting survivors,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIndeed, it was through healthy processes that we not only determined whether a person had been victimized, but also prevented the accused from becoming a \u2018survivor\u2019 of a profound injustice.\u201d        ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201cBetsy DeVos\u2019 new Title IX rules will discourage sexual assault reporting and investigations,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cWhen 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault while in college, we can\u2019t afford to go backwards.\u201d  The statistics published by the Obama-era Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are \u201cwildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d however, said American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor\u00a0Christina Hoff Sommers, in a fact-check video. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the actual rate\u00a0of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in 5. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2013 7.6 per 1,000. \u201cWhere did the CDC find more than a million and nearly 14 million victims of sexual violence that professional criminologists somehow overlooked?\u201d Sommers asked in the video. \u201cIt found them by using a poorly constructed telephone survey with a low response rate and a non-representative sample of respondents. No one interviewed was asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted.\u201d Armed with the false \u201c1 in 5\u201d statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy. The Obama administration also instructed colleges and universities to use the lesser \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard to resolve allegations of sexual misconduct, rather than the higher \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. To promote its policy, the Obama-era education department engaged the media with the CDC report\u2019s statistic and even the former president himself repeated it in his speeches. The Obama policy delivered \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d on college campuses in which mostly male students were accused of sexual misconduct with little information about the allegations against them and no recourse to defend themselves. David French at National Review wrote the new Trump administration rules will not only \u201crestore basic due process and fairness to college tribunals, but they also \u2014 given how basic the changes are \u2014 highlight just how ridiculous university kangaroo courts have become.\u201d He added: I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait.

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " A column by Connor Friedersdorf of\u00a0the Atlantic published this week condemns the ACLU for its surprising stance on a new policy that strengthens due process rights for those accused of sexual assault on college campuses. The policy requires that schools ensure that a fair investigation to students accused of misconduct. Additionally, accused students will now be permitted to cross-examine their alleged victim, as would be their right in a courtroom under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. \u201cAccusers and students accused of sexual assault must be allowed to cross-examine each other through an adviser or lawyer. The rules require that the live hearings be conducted by a neutral decision maker and conducted with a presumption of innocence,\u201d a New York Times report on the new policy read. \u201cBoth parties would have equal access to all the evidence that school investigators use to determine facts of the case, and a chance to appeal decisions.\u201d In a tweet, the ACLU completely abandoned their dedication to protecting civil liberties. They argued that the new policy makes universities less safe for survivors of sexual misconduct. \u201cToday Secretary DeVos proposed a rule that would tip the scales against those who raise their voices. We strongly oppose it,\u201d the ACLU tweeted. \u201cThe proposed rule would make schools less safe for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, when there is already alarmingly high rates of campus sexual assaults and harassment that go unreported. It promotes an unfair process, inappropriately favoring the accused and letting schools ignore their responsibility under Title IX to respond promptly and fairly to complaints of sexual violence. We will continue to support survivors.\u201d Friedersdorf condemned the ACLU for abandoning the standards of evidence that are required by the Constitution. In a blog post, the storied civil liberties group argued that schools revert back to the lowest standard of proof that is used in the justice system. The \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard means that it is more than 50 percent likely that the alleged incident took place. Notice that the ACLU does not merely argue that \u201ca preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard is superior to a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard in campus proceedings in which a state school is punishing a student. In the ACLU\u2019s telling, the more onerous standard is so wrongheaded that rules meant to protect against discrimination on the basis of sex ought to forbid even private colleges that take federal money to adopt such a standard. It even asserts that \u201cthere is no reason\u201d for the more onerous standard, as if its adherents aren\u2019t motivated by the same concern that presumably causes the ACLU to favor a still more onerous burden of proof in criminal cases:\u00a0a desire\u00a0to prevent the wrongful punishment of innocents. Criminal defense attorney Scott Greenfield had a sharp criticism for the ACLU. \u201cThe ACLU cannot love constitutional rights only when it serves to further a cause on behalf of their favored marginalized group, then hate it when it doesn\u2019t, and still be given credit as a voice for civil liberties \u2026 Remember, due process \u2018inappropriately favors the accused.'\u201d",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201cThis agreement will build upon ongoing collaboration between the United States and Switzerland to encourage businesses and stakeholders to promote the value of apprenticeship programs and develop effective strategies to increase awareness of and access to work-based learning,\u201d the Education Department\u00a0wrote\u00a0at its website blog. The agreement comes after DeVos\u2019s announcement earlier this year about her desire to merge\u00a0the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. After a subsequent European tour, DeVos wrote\u00a0in an op-ed at\u00a0Education Week\u00a0that during her international tour, she found the centralized approach to education and workforce development in European countries similar to what she envisioned with a merger of the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cSwitzerland is known for its robust apprenticeship program, with more than two-thirds of high school students engaged in one of the roughly 300\u00a0government-recognized apprenticeships,\u201d DeVos wrote:  DeVos, Labor secretary Alexander Acosta, Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser,\u00a0represented the United States at the \u201csigning ceremony\u201d with Swiss officials. \u201cThe Swiss approach is one from which we can all learn a great deal,\u201d DeVos said\u00a0in remarks at the signing event, reports Education Week. \u201cOne important take-away\u00a0from my visit to Switzerland is that Swiss business leaders\u00a0didn\u2019t ask for a\u00a0permission slip from government to partner with educators.\u201d Since her tour of European countries earlier this year, DeVos has expressed\u00a0admiration for the type of education and workforce development practices countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.K embrace. In June, DeVos said it was her hope that adopting some of the education policies of these nations would \u201chelp catch us up\u201d to students from other countries:  In its blog post, the Education Department lists 15 facts about the Swiss Apprenticeship Program, including that \u201cnearly 2/3 of young people in Switzerland choose to pursue a vocational program.\u201d \u201cA defining feature of the Swiss vocational education system is its close correlation with the labor market,\u201d the department continues. \u201cTraining is geared to actual demand for vocational qualifications and to available jobs.\u201d The department writes that Swiss companies spend nearly one percent of GDP annually on apprenticeships and that 50 to 80 percent of apprentices are retained in the reported companies. \u201cCompanies start recruiting students in the 7thgrade with apprenticeships starting in 10the grade,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cEven at a cost of $50K-$150K over 3-4 years, the businesses get a full return on their investment\u201d:  Some education policy analysts, however, assert federal promotion of a workforce development model of education encourages a view of children as prospective laborers who can fulfill the needs of big business for inexpensive, local workers. While some students may opt for apprenticeships on their own, these analysts are concerned about students being pigeon-holed in middle school for a particular industry favored by the government when they might develop other interests later in their education. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling that so many education policy-makers, including Secretary DeVos, are drawn to the European system of the school-to-work pipeline,\u201d Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, told Breitbart News. \u201cRevamping our entire system to create cogs for politically connected companies isn\u2019t the way to \u2018catch up.\u2019\u201d Similarly, Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, told Breitbart News she was concerned the type of education a child receives \u201cwould be influenced by crony corporations dictating to schools the skills needed for future workers.\u201d \u201cCentralized, government-planned economies do not work, and that\u2019s not the free market system under which America and our economy have prospered,\u201d Smith explained.",

      "subtitle": "A federal school safety commission led by members of the Trump administration is recommending that the Departments of Justice and Education rescind the Obama-era school policy that urged more lenient forms of discipline in public schools for students of color and those of other minority groups.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " In its final report\u00a0released Tuesday, the commission concluded the \u201cguidance\u201d issued by the Obama administration in 2014 \u201cmay have paradoxically contributed to making schools less safe.\u201d Some education policy experts have observed the Broward County school district\u2019s policy that includes consideration of race and minority status where discipline is concerned, inspired the Obama administration\u2019s guidance and may have played a role in the fact that Nikolas Cruz remained under the radar until his shooting rampage in Parkland, Florida, on February 14. The Obama-era Departments of Education and Justice \u2013 under Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder \u2013 issued\u00a0school guidelines that claimed students of color are \u201cdisproportionately impacted\u201d by suspensions and expulsions, a situation they said led to a \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d that discriminates against minority and low-income students. According to the Obama administration\u2019s 2014 Dear Colleague letter\u00a0(DCL), any school district whose disciplinary measures showed \u201cdisparate impact\u201d \u2013 meaning a disproportionately greater number of minority students are affected by disciplinary measures \u2013 should be open to investigation by the Departments of Justice and Education, regardless of whether the behavior leading to the discipline is unacceptable. Education policy analyst Max Eden, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute,\u00a0explains: The directive, cast as a \u201cguidance,\u201d in fact formalized a fundamental shift in the Department of Education\u2019s approach to civil-rights enforcement. Prior to the DCL, the standard held that civil rights are violated if students are\u00a0treated differently because of race; for instance, if a black student and a white student both curse at a teacher, it\u2019s wrong to suspend the black student and give the white student a warning. The DCL expanded the standard from disparate treatment to disparate\u00a0impact;\u00a0now, if two black students and one white student curse at a teacher, it could be a civil-rights violation to punish them all equally. The safety commission stated in its final report it had \u201csignificant concerns \u2026 \u00a0regarding the legal framework upon which the Guidance is based.\u201d \u201cThese concerns, together with the repeated concerns expressed by many that disciplinary decisions are best left in the hands of classroom teachers and administrators, warrant rescission of the Guidance,\u201d the commission added. The commission\u2019s chair is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker also members. In addition, the commission recommended that the Education Department compile \u201cresources and best practices\u201d to help schools develop safe environments that provide optimal conditions for learning while protecting the rights of all students. The members strongly urge the Departments of Justice and Education \u201ccontinue to vigorously enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d and help schools understand how cases of \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d will be investigated and resolved. In a paper released in January, U.S. Civil Rights commissioner\u00a0Gail Heriot, politically an Independent and a professor of law at the University of San Diego,\u00a0wrote\u00a0with her colleague, Alison Somin, of the dangers of the Obama-era policy: The danger should have been obvious. What if an important reason more African-American students were being disciplined than white or Asian students is that more African-American students were misbehaving? And what if the cost of failing to discipline those students primarily falls on their fellow African-American students who are trying to learn amid classroom disorder? Would unleashing OCR and its army of lawyers cause those schools to act carefully and precisely to eliminate only that portion of the discipline gap that was the result of race discrimination? Or\u2014more likely\u2014would schools react heavy-handedly by tolerating more classroom disorder, thus making it more difficult for students who share the classroom with unruly students to learn? The authors continued that the Department of Education\u2019s disparate impact policy is \u201cencouraging discrimination rather than preventing it\u201d: When it comes to school discipline policy, the federal government has an unimpressive track record. In the past, it has pressed local schools to adopt tough \u201czero-tolerance\u201d rules for guns (including things that appear to be guns), resulting in children being suspended for \u201cguns\u201d made out of a nibbled Pop Tart or a stick. Similarly, on too many occasions, its get- tough, policies on sexual harassment have led to disciplinary actions against kindergarteners and first-graders\u2014children generally too young to spell \u201csexual harassment,\u201d much less engage in it. More recently, we\u2019ve been seeing an overcorrection. The federal government\u2019s policy developed during the Obama Administration has been to press schools to lighten up on school discipline, specifically to benefit African Americans and other racial minorities. But both efforts to dictate broad discipline policy, while well-meaning, are wrongheaded. It\u2019s time for the federal government to get out of the business of dictating broad discipline policy. In March 2016, Katherine Kersten also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at the\u00a0Star Tribune\u00a0about the dangers associated with the Obama-era policy that she saw as having developed into an ideology. Noting the increasing number of student assaults against St. Paul, Minnesota teachers, as well as student riots requiring police intervention since the adoption of the Obama-era lax disciplinary practices, Kersten observed a comment from one teacher: \u201cWe have a segment of kids who consider themselves untouchable.\u201d \u201cMost parents will tell you that if you eliminate consequences for kids\u2019 bad behavior, you can expect a lot more of it,\u201d Kersten wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense. But we\u2019re not talking about common sense here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a powerful ideology that has gripped the imagination of Twin Cities school officials \u2014 and far beyond,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the notion of \u2018equity\u2019 \u2014 a buzzword that is rapidly becoming the all-purpose justification for dubious policies not only in education but in many public arenas.\u201d",

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " In the column for\u00a0Insider Higher Ed, Mott makes the case that the recently proposed rule changes for handling sexual misconduct on campus actually benefit survivors. The rules have been widely condemned by those on the left who believe that it is dangerous to give due process rights to those who are accused of sexual misconduct on campus. Mott argues that the new rules give victims substantial powers that were unavailable to them under previous versions of the rules. Under the Obama-era guidelines, students who had been sexually assaulted or sexually harassed were denied substantial decision-making processes. First, students had no choice in whether or not to report a case of nonconsensual sex or unwelcome sexual advances. Second, their judicial options were limited to a Title\u00a0IX disciplinary panel. Third, the definition of sexual harassment privileged their fears over adult communication. All three elements of the old rules made it harder for survivors to heal. Mott goes on to provide three substantive ways that the new proposed rules benefit survivors. First, the proposed changes allow the student to decide whether or not they want to initiate an investigation into the incident. Under the proposed rule, students would be able to speak with school officials about incidents without automatically triggering an investigation. Second, the proposed rules allow for alternative forms of justice. Under the previous rules, incidents could only be handled by a disciplinary panel. Under the proposed rules, the victim could suggest alternative methods of justice, which allows them to take a greater or lesser role in the process. Third, Mott makes the case that the proposed rules help colleges better define \u201cgender violence.\u201d Mott argues that under the previous rules, an accused party\u2019s guilt was directly related to the level of emotional distress in the complainant. On college campuses, however, cases are determined purely on the emotional distress of the complainant. If she (and majority of complainants still use that pronoun) feels demeaned, humiliated or scorned by the lascivious actions of another person, the encounter should be judged as harassment. Unfortunately, the subjective definition the Obama administration used has given an entire generation of college students a sense that painful feelings outrival communication. Students need not communicate their unease or discomfort to the offending party. All that is necessary is mentioning the encounter in passing to a \u201cresponsible employee\u201d and the Title\u00a0IX apparatus will jump into gear. Mott may face considerable backlash from feminists and leftists in academia who consider the DeVos Title IX changes to be a terrible blow against women.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  \u201c1 in 5 women experience sexual assault or attempted assault while in college,\u201d Planned Parenthood tweeted Sunday. \u201cStudents are raising their voices in opposition to this rule. They won\u2019t stand for this threat to their health, safety, and education, and they won\u2019t be fighting alone.\u201d However, the \u201c1 in 5\u201d statistic \u2013 spread widely by the Obama administration through its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 is \u201cwildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d said American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor\u00a0Christina Hoff Sommers, in a fact-check\u00a0video:  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the actual\u00a0rate\u00a0of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in 5. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2013 7.6 per 1,000. \u201cWhere did the CDC find more than a million and nearly 14 million victims of sexual violence that professional criminologists somehow overlooked?\u201d Sommers asked in the video. \u201cIt found them by using a poorly constructed telephone survey with a low response rate and a non-representative sample of respondents. No one interviewed was asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted.\u201d Armed with the false \u201c1 in 5\u201d statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy. The Obama administration also instructed colleges and universities to use the lesser \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard to resolve allegations of sexual misconduct, rather than the higher \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. To promote its policy, the Obama-era education department engaged the media and allies such as Planned Parenthood with the statistic, and even the former president himself repeated it in his speeches. The Obama policy delivered \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d on college campuses in which mostly male students were accused of sexual misconduct with little information about the allegations against them and no recourse to defend themselves. In November, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the proposed new rule and opened it to public comment. \u201cThroughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,\u201d DeVos said. She added: That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function. For further information on how to urge the Trump administration to \u201ckeep their #HandsOffIX (Title IX), abortion vendor Planned Parenthood links to a pro-survivor group known as End Rape on Campus. \u201cIf the proposed rule becomes law, survivors will lose access to their education and schools will continue to sweep sexual violence under the rug,\u201d End Rape on Campus insists. \u201cThe new rule will stop survivors from coming forward and make schools more dangerous for all students.\u201d In her announcement of the new rule, however, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of misconduct actions which were never proven. \u201cInstead of working with schools,\u201d DeVos said, \u201cthe prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.\u201d The public comment\u00a0period on the proposed rule ends January 28.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " A report at AZCentral observed\u00a0that\u00a0the American Federation for Children (AFC) is promoting school choice in Arizona with an online notice to Spanish-speaking parents. The notice concerns the state\u2019s Empowerment Scholarship Account (ESA) program which, according to the report, gives \u201cpublic money that would otherwise go to local public schools\u00a0to parents to use for private school and other educational services.\u201d ESAs, the report continues, \u201chave been strongly supported by the Arizona Legislature\u2019s Republican majority.\u201d The news report adds: Many of those same lawmakers have also opposed\u00a0illegal immigration and\u00a0in-state college tuition for undocumented\u00a0immigrants, including \u201cdreamers\u201d\u00a0\u2014 the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. \u201cThe Supreme Court ruled in the Plyler decision that free public education cannot by denied to any student from Kindergarten to the last year of high school (12th grade) due to their parents\u2019 migration status,\u201d the AFC notice to Spanish-speaking parents states. \u201cJust like the public education system, the ESA program does not require proof of income, proof of migration status, and children do not need to have certain grades to enter the ESA program, according to the ESA law.\u201d Kim Martinez,\u00a0AFC Arizona communications director, said immigration status isn\u2019t a factor when applying for an ESA. \u201cWe care about giving children access to the K-12 education of their family\u2019s choice, in full compliance with the law,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take positions on tangential immigration issues. Immigration status does not play a factor in ESA eligibility, just like it does not affect whether or not a child can attend an Arizona public school.\u201d  Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican,\u00a0acknowledged that because ESAs are taxpayer funds and federal law prohibits the state from asking about a student\u2019s immigration status, the funds can be used for illegal aliens. He said, nevertheless, that he opposes\u00a0marketing ESAs to people who are in the country illegally. \u201cWe passed ESA to promote good education, not illegal immigration,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cI strongly object to someone to try to divert public funding to people who are here illegally.\u201d Dawn Penich-Thacker, spokeswoman for Save Our Schools Arizona, said marketing ESAs to illegal aliens shows \u201cthe level of hypocrisy that exists with some of these special-interest dark-money groups.\u201d \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019ll bang the drum of \u2018rule of law\u2019 and \u2018taxpayer accountability\u2019 and yet simultaneously be marketing to a population of families that we might speculate that some of their top donors don\u2019t want them marketing to,\u201d she added. School choice champion Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was chairwoman\u00a0of AFC prior to being confirmed to her current post. In May 2017, DeVos addressed\u00a0AFC\u2019s National Policy Summit, asserting that \u201cevery state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education.\u201d \u201cIf a state doesn\u2019t want to participate, that would be a terrible mistake on their part,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it. If politicians in a state block education choice, it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids.\u201d ",

      "subtitle": "Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) reintroduced a bill Wednesday that would abolish the Department of Education.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Massie announced his plan to reintroduce his one-sentence bill to end the department in a Facebook post:  \u201cThe bill states, \u2018The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2020,\u2019\u201d wrote the congressman. \u201cNeither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn.\u201d Massie continued: Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children\u2019s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school. Massie\u2019s bill was reintroduced as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced an executive order eliminating the federally incentivized Common Core State Standards \u2013 which were rebranded as the Florida Standards \u2013 in his state:  In an interview with Breitbart News in February 2017 \u2013 following the introduction of his original bill to eliminate the Education Department \u2013 Massie said people should take his bill seriously \u201cbecause, for the first time since Ronald Reagan, we have a president in the White House who would conceivably sign this bill.\u201d The original legislation was proposed at a time when Massie believed he could get both conservatives and liberals on board with it.  He explained at the time: I\u2019ve had the bill prepared since December of last year in anticipation of offering it this year. But, as we received more and more phone calls from people who wanted me to vote against Betsy DeVos \u2013 and I had to explain to them that it is the constitutional role of the Senate to advise and consent, not the House \u2013 they would then ask me to do anything I could to oppose her nomination. And, so, this bill seemed like the obvious answer to their question: What can I do to oppose her nomination? DeVos\u2019s confirmation was opposed by groups on both the left and the right. Teachers\u2019 unions and their political backers have opposed DeVos\u2019s support of school choice \u2013 which they fear will divert funding from public schools to private schools. Additionally, groups that note the education secretary has promoted the massive federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) also\u00a0oppose\u00a0DeVos. Like Massie, these constitutionally based groups would like to see the federal role in education end. Though Massie\u2019s bill does not address the details of how the department would dismantle its many programs, he said, when the original bill was introduced, that he would propose DeVos, President Donald Trump, and Congress \u201cwork to either devolve those programs to the states, or transfer the authority for those programs to other departments.\u201d \u201cIdeally, all of these programs would be administered at the state level, including the authority for the tax collection,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn fact, some of these programs could be done at the local school district level.\u201d \u201cI like to point out that there are 4,500 bureaucrats in the Department of Education, and their average salary is $105,000 a year,\u201d Massie continued. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that irritate a lot of people back in Kentucky who have to have bake sales to buy copier paper for their classrooms.\u201d In an interview with The New American, Massie observed\u00a0that the Education Department was \u201cestablished by unpopular President Jimmy Carter as a \u2018re-election tactic, as a ploy.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I saw an opportunity to re-introduce this notion as a bill when everybody got upset about [Trump Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos\u2019 confirmation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the last controversial confirmation.\u201d In his post about the reintroduction of his bill, the Kentucky Republican noted: President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to shrink the size and cost of big government, and that is by eliminating agencies that are not needed and are getting in the way of a solution \u2026 By eliminating the Department of Education \u2026 we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs and preferences, rather than the wishes of\u00a0Washington, determine the education of our children.\u201d Massie noted that the original co-sponsors of the bill included Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Jody Hice (R-GA), Walter Jones (R-NC), Chip Roy (R-TX), and Randy Weber (R-TX).

      "subtitle": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos unveiled a plan Thursday that would provide $5 billion to federalize school choice by setting up a nationwide federal tax-credit scholarship program.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " DeVos is taking her federalized school choice plan to Congress where it will be introduced in legislation in the Senate by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and in the House by Rep. Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. Many who have been urging the Trump administration to dismantle the federal education department, however, warn\u00a0another federalized program will further expand overreach into education. The U.S. Constitution provides for no federal role in education, except in the nation\u2019s capital, in the military, and among Native American tribes. \u201cWhile school choice is\u00a0critical\u00a0and often undervalued, a federal school choice program reaches beyond the constitutional mandate of the federal government, and presents a real danger to private education in the future,\u201d wrote\u00a0Inez Feltscher Stepman at the Federalist Thursday. \u201cIf it passes, this latest example of federal overreach could be the Trump administration\u2019s equivalent to the Common Core debacle, and worse, could taint one of the most important reforms advanced by conservatives in the states.\u201d As U.S. News & World Report\u00a0observed, under DeVos\u2019s proposal, individuals and companies would obtain a federal tax credit if they donate to organizations offering scholarships to students to attend the schools of their choice. Individuals and companies would be allowed to donate up to ten percent of their adjusted gross income. Many of the details of the federalized program, such as who is eligible, education providers permitted to participate, and accountability for the federal taxpayer funds would be given to the states \u2013 although, as with Common Core, the incentive to create such programs would come from the federal government. \u201cThis is an opportunity for states to take advantage of money that would be available to them, for programs that they design,\u201d said\u00a0an unnamed education department official, according to Education Week. In her prepared remarks announcing the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, DeVos said her plan was not a \u201cmandate,\u201d but then focused\u00a0on her vision of how the federal government would incentivize states to sign onto her new plan: The key element of the proposal is freedom. Freedom for everyone involved. Students, families, teachers, schools, states can choose to participate in the program. Or they can elect not to participate. That\u2019s what freedom is all about. Let me be clear: I firmly believe every state should embrace education freedom. But those are decisions families and communities must make. This is not another mandate. We know gaining this freedom will require more work in some states than others. But as more states offer more options to families, demand will rise and pressure will mount on those who have not yet embraced the opportunity. While conservatives and constitutionalists heartily support parental choice of education options, they draw a bold line where the federal government takes over the project or incentivizes states to enact it through federal taxpayer funds. Neal McCluskey, Cato Institute\u2019s director of the Center for Educational Freedom, tweeted the title of his blog post that spells out his concerns about the new federalized plan:  \u201cSchool choice is about individualization and freedom, and almost certainly that is what DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne want,\u201d McCluskey wrote. \u201cBut federal initiatives are a terrible way to deliver that. The reality is that what the feds fund, even indirectly, they inevitably want to control.\u201d He continued: DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne are looking to skirt the control problem, sticking with tax credits instead of vouchers, and letting states opt in. But not only is this unconstitutional\u2014taxes are authorized to execute specific, enumerated powers, not to lightly engineer state policy\u2014it won\u2019t, ultimately, prevent encroaching federal control. If enacted, the credit would spur people to demand their states participate, and as more schools benefited from federally connected scholarships all schools would be financially pressured to use them. But the federal government will have the power to decide which state programs are or are not eligible, and on what grounds. Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck told Breitbart News the proposal is \u201cwell-meaning, but misguided.\u201d \u201cDeVos even alluded to the fact that the federal government would use pressure to \u2018encourage\u2019 every state to take these \u2018scholarships,\u2019 which means she\u2019d also \u2018encourage\u2019 eventual collection of data on all homeschoolers, not just the ones taking the credit,\u201d Hollenbeck said. \u201cThat should chill every homeschooler to the bone! I do not believe such a consequence is part of Sen. Cruz\u2019s motivation, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. \u201d Lindsey Burke, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Education Policy, and\u00a0Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, warned such an effort could actually reverse the school choice gains already made as well as recent tax policy reforms. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that the Administration wants to advance school choice but a nationwide federal tax-credit scholarship program is the wrong way to do it,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cThis could open the door for further education regulations down the road that neutralize the advantages of private education as well as impede future tax reform efforts.\u201d Burke and Michel highlighted the concerns voiced often by the conservative base of Trump\u2019s Party, including that such a proposal \u201cwould grow, rather than reduce, federal intervention in education.\u201d \u201cFuture administrations could use a federal tax-credit scholarship to require that schools adhere to certain admissions and accountability policies,\u201d they added. \u201cThat would mean the federal government could further dictate testing, reporting, academic content, and even bathroom policies for all schools involved.\u201d Stepman also warned that because parental choice of education options is so important, \u201cwe should be loathe to expose it to the heavy hands of federal regulators.\u201d \u201cEven if Republicans get a perfectly clean version of the tax credit through Congress\u2014a tall order given the composition of the House\u2014the door would be open for future Democratic administrations to extend a regulatory toehold into every private school that accepted students on scholarship,\u201d she asserted.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The conference, according to its website, \u201cfosters innovation in learning by hosting a community of optimistic, forward-thinking, purpose-driven stakeholders with a shared goal of impacting the future of teaching and learning.\u201d Panelist Jessica Reid Sliwerski, CEO of Open Up Resources, reportedly\u00a0calmed the nerves of anxious school professionals seeking to incorporate even more SEL into their already-crammed school days. According to a report at Education Dive: Sliwerski argued that equipping students with the necessary SEL skills during the school day doesn\u2019t require additional programming. Instead, skills like conversation, collaboration, debate and reasoning should be infused into core subjects, including math and English language arts \u2014 similarly to how fluoride is infused in drinking water, ever-present and benefiting learners whether they actively realize it or not. Similarly, Christina Riley, EL Education\u2019s associate director of curriculum design, said educators must also have a strong understanding of SEL and their own skills. Education Dive reports further: In addition to promoting these skills in their own actions, educators should provide resources and tools guiding how those skills can be demonstrated, as well as protocols for giving students equitable opportunities to share their voice and for English learners to collaborate in their home language. Visual reminders around the room can also provide students with cues for discussion norms. \u201cSEL has no academic components and is clearly facing a tough sell by companies trying to drink from the public trough,\u201d Dr. Sandra Stotsky, professor of education emerita at the University of Arkansas, told Breitbart News.\u00a0\u201cHow does one get school board members to ask questions about what it consists of? \u00a0Surely, there must be at least one school board member in the country who wonders why no child psychologists or psychiatrists seem to be involved in advising on and evaluating the SEL \u2018curriculum\u2019 materials, in explaining to a superintendent and a school board why regular teachers can do what SEL salesmen suggest, and in supervising the SEL program in a school district?\u201d Stotsky added she has found no classroom-based studies on how a math or science teacher, for example, has integrated the development of social and emotional traits into that curriculum and then compared those results to a similar class that had not done so. \u201cI look at the bibliographies wherever I can when I see articles on SEL, and I have yet to find a classroom-based study,\u201d Stotsky said. Breitbart News reached out to U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE), a national group of parent education activists, regarding the attempt to \u201cinfuse\u201d yet more SEL into K\u201312 curricula. \u201cSocial Emotional Learning (SEL) is the new buzz-phrase authorizing public schools to \u2018teach\u2019 children politically correct thinking as well as values, attitudes, and beliefs,\u201d the group responded. \u201cConsidering the move to \u2018teach\u2019 government school children, as early as Kindergarten, inappropriate sexual behaviors through new Comprehensive Sex Education Standards, and the wide-spread disdain for Christian values, USPIE believes the call to integrate SEL into core subjects of math, reading and writing is furthering the politicization of education.\u201d What appears to be the stark reality is that no longer is learning to read and write competently the primary focus of K\u201312 education in America\u2019s public schools. Math, reading, and English are no longer good enough on their own.  Social and emotional learning \u2014 the vehicle that made so-called \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d an easy push in schools, comes, after all, highly recommended by Congress and the Department of Education. \u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act requires other factors besides student achievement in their mandated accountability plan, which is a wide gateway for social emotional assessment and data collection,\u201d Dr. Karen Effrem, president of Education Liberty Watch and executive director of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, told Breitbart News in September. \u201cState (Common Core) Assessments and The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) \u2014 also known as The Nation\u2019s Report Card \u2014 are already starting to include mindset and school climate questions either as surveys or as part of the tests themselves.\u201d  Even as U.S. schoolchildren are still floundering and\u00a0failing on national and international assessments, in September, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos signed\u00a0onto a declaration\u00a0by education ministers of the Group of 20 (G-20) countries that called for putting education \u201cat the center of the global agenda.\u201d \u201c[S]tudents must be prepared to anticipate and adapt,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThey need to acquire and master broadly transferrable and versatile educational competencies like critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity and cultural intelligence.\u201d The G-20 education ministers urged \u201cdigital literacy,\u201d which, they said, will \u201cfoster the inclusion of non-cognitive skills such as socio-emotional skills across the curriculum.\u201d Following the G-20 summit, DeVos told reporters the declaration is \u201cvery consistent with all of the themes that we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d\u00a0reported\u00a0Education Week. Teresa Mull, an education research fellow at the Heartland Institute, observed in a column at Townhall\u00a0in March 2018: Increasingly, more schools are adopting an aggressively progressive curriculum. In Minnesota, \u201cSchool leaders adopted the \u2018All for All\u2019 strategic plan\u2014a sweeping initiative that reordered the district\u2019s mission from academic excellence for all students to \u2018racial equity,\u2019\u201d TheWeekly Standard\u00a0reported in February [2018]. Children in kindergarten are expected to become \u201cracially conscious\u201d and examine their \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d And leftists\u2019 radical agenda is taking hold in a less blatant but no less toxic way in the rise of social and emotional learning (SEL), which presents just as much danger to parents, kids, and the education system as Common Core. \u201cSEL teaches kids to feel and not to think,\u201d Mull wrote. \u201cTraditional public schools, apparently determined not to teach kids history, how to read, spell, add, subtract, multiply, or anything useful, instead take on a role of psychotherapist (and not a good one).\u201d  Last week, the president of the largest teachers\u2019 union in the country kicked off the national event known as Read Across America not by encouraging higher-level reading skills in children, but by urging \u201cdiverse\u201d literature that acknowledges transgender individuals in the content of reading material in classrooms.  \u201cNEA believes diverse literature enables students to see\u00a0themselves\u00a0as the heroes of the story, while also showing them that all kinds of people can be the heroes too,\u201d said Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, in a statement. \u201cIt is important that we emphasize books that are telling children of color or of different gender identities that they belong in the world and the world belongs to them.\u201d USPIE is calling for a return to local control of education and classical curricula that emphasizes reading, writing, and math. \u201cAny serious teacher already knows effective communication skills are developed through careful instruction in reading, writing and speaking,\u201d USPIE said. \u201cEffective math teachers know how to motivate children beyond rote calculation and wrong answers through critical thinking and striving for accuracy.\u201d \u201cEmployers who want prepared and effective employees had better begin to realize these unproven education fads like Common Core, Competency Based Education and SEL are gimmicks with a political agenda,\u201d the parents\u2019 group asserted. \u201cParents should grab their kids and run as fast as they can!\u201d",

      "subtitle": "A tip that the women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale University offered to label an executive\u2019s daughter as a recruit in exchange for cash led to the discovery of the largest school admissions scandal ever prosecuted, the Associated Press (AP) reported\u00a0Thursday.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The executive had already been targeted in a securities fraud investigation, an anonymous law enforcement official said, according to the report. The executive told Boston authorities who were working on the market fraud case that Rudy Meredith, the former women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale University in Connecticut, told him he would identify his daughter as a recruit in exchange for cash. The AP report continued: Investigators recorded a meeting between the executive and the coach at a Boston hotel room in April 2018. During the meeting, which is described in court documents, authorities say Rudy Meredith told the father he would help his daughter get into Yale in exchange for $450,000. Meredith accepted $2,000 in cash in the hotel room and gave the executive directions about how to wire the rest of the money, authorities say. Meredith began cooperating with the investigation that same month in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence, prosecutors say in court documents. Meredith, who resigned from Yale in November, has agreed to plead guilty to charges including wire fraud. A message was left Thursday on Meredith\u2019s phone. Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were charged\u00a0among at least 33 parents and nine athletic coaches in the admissions scandal. Authorities believe, however, that even more parents are involved. According to the report, parents spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and as much as $6.5 million to assure their children\u2019s admission to the schools. Some of the parents, prominent in the fields of law, finance, fashion, and others, paid William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, an \u201cadmissions consultant,\u201d to bribe school administrators and coaches to make it appear their children were viewed as accomplished athletes in order to gain admission to the schools. Additionally, Singer \u201chired ringers to take college entrance exams for students, and paid off insiders at testing centers to correct students\u2019 answers, authorities say,\u201d AP reported. Singer pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges Tuesday in Boston. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called the college admissions scheme \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said while the Justice Department is leading the federal government\u2019s case, her department is investigating whether those participating in the scandal violated any federal education regulations. Both the U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts and the IRS are investigating the scandal. AP reported Wednesday the University of Southern California said it will block the admissions of about six student applications that are connected to a firm indicted in the scandal.",

It provides the first lady with a resource to learn of potential agencies to partner with, as they fit into the three pillars of her Be Best campaign. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar chairs the working group and gave a brief history of the group before turning the meeting back over to the first lady. He praised her timely Be Best initiative, particularly as it has steered the group on issues of opioid abuse, well-being, and social media use. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos shared some of her department\u2019s youth program initiatives that encourage children\u2019s peer relationship building and specifically the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).

He described the program as promoting health and economic empowerment in communities, among other arenas. He added that there is an initiative to promote strong fatherhood, with goals that include reducing incarceration and increasing employment. \u201cBooks opened up more doors for me than anything in my life except God,\u201d Carson told the group as he described a books program and emphasized the integral role of books in children\u2019s success into adulthood. The first lady called Secretary Carson\u2019s story inspiring and reinforced the importance of supporting children. A Ready to Help game presented to the first lady was described as fostering children\u2019s awareness of how to deal with crises, including emergencies and disasters. FEMA Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor described its benefits to the first lady and explained that it is a free resource to help children. Mrs. Trump impressed the value of such a game by citing the recent deadly tornado in Alabama and the importance of children being prepared for these emergencies. Mark Green, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, emphasized spending on child health programs, as children who are not strong and healthy \u201ccan\u2019t take advantage of educational opportunities.\u201d He spoke of the Trump administration\u2019s desire to expand child health programs that have saved the lives of 4.6 million children globally, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

A senior administration official revealed in the Monday briefing, \u201cWhen it comes to student loan repayment, we understand a simplified system will help borrowers more effectively manage their debt, and we\u2019ve proposed a 12.5 percent cap on a borrower\u2019s discretionary income for all students.\u201d \u201cThis would offer students loan forgiveness after 180 months of repayment for all their undergraduate loans, regardless of where they\u2019re working.\u00a0And we think that this system can be reformed by using IRS tax data to do it,\u201d the official said. When asked about limits on parent PLUS and grad PLUS loans, the senior official didn\u2019t give a measure, but said, \u201cI think we\u2019re open to having a robust conversation about what the appropriate loan limits are.\u201d Trump promoted the goal of proposed reforms \u201cto create a more innovative and demand-driven system that is responsive to students, workers, employers, and taxpayers.\u201d emphasizing the need for modernizing the higher education system \u201cto make it affordable, flexible, and outcome-oriented so all Americans, young and old, can learn the skills they need to secure and retain good-paying jobs.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said upon announcement of the newly released reform principles: Unfortunately, many colleges and universities have not been providing Americans the education they need to succeed in a cost-effective manner. Remarkably, student loan debt exceeds what Americans owe in credit card debt, auto loans, or home equity loans. Members of Congress who are committed to ensuring Americans thrive in today\u2019s strong, modern, and growing economy should support and pass these reforms. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was at the White House Monday. She was seen in a meeting with first lady Melania Trump for the reconvening of the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " In May 2018, Anthony Chandler, 35, was charged with both first-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sex act, each of which carries a sentence of from five to 25 years. A female student accused Chandler of forcing her to have sexual intercourse and perform oral sex on him on the campus where both were students,\u00a0reported\u00a0Press Republican. Chandler claimed the sex was consensual. As a result of the allegations, he was expelled from the school. One hour after the trial concluded the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Chief Assistant District Attorney David Hayes admitted the female student\u2019s recollections of the events were inconsistent, but said that situation occurs when someone is raped and is asked \u201cto tell the story again and again.\u201d Greg LaDuke, Chandler\u2019s attorney, however, said the discrepancies in the accuser\u2019s recall of the alleged attacks were stark. \u201cIt was very clear from the read-backs, from the way I cross-examined her \u2026 her specific allegations of how the sexual assaults occurred were completely different from her allegations from the last few months, including last May,\u201d he said. He added a rape kit performed for the female student \u201ccame back completely and thoroughly negative for any trauma.\u201d According to the news report, LaDuke and Chandler \u201cignored the school\u2019s process of investigation and discipline because there was no chance of winning.\u201d \u201cThese schools like that, they have a totalitarian system,\u201d LaDuke said. \u201cYou have no ability to defend yourself. You are considered not only guilty but evil upon accusation.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t participate in their \u2018Star Chamber\u2019 witch hunt,\u201d he added. In November, the Trump administration released\u00a0new proposed rules for campus sexual assault allegations that emphasize due process for accused students, including the ability to cross-examine their accusers. \u201cEvery survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\u201d said\u00a0U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, adding: That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function. The rule would require schools to apply basic due process protections for accused students. They would receive written notice of the allegations against them and the opportunity to review all evidence collected. Accused students would also have the right to cross-examination, and their schools would be required to hold a live hearing where cross-examination would be conducted through the parties\u2019 advisors. In order to promote impartial decisions, the rule would no longer allow schools to use a \u201csingle investigator\u201d or \u201cinvestigator-only\u201d model. According to the U.S. Education Department, the rule uses the same definition of sexual harassment as employed in U.S. Supreme Court Title IX cases: \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d ",

Several big-name universities were included in the department\u2019s report, included the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, Yale University, Wake Forest University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Stanford University. \u201cThe allegations made and evidence cited by the Department of Justice raise questions about whether your institution is fully meeting its obligations,\u201d an education department official wrote in a statement. The Education Department has demanded that the named schools turn over various documents related to their admissions process. Some of the requested documents, such as marketing materials, are available to the public. Other requested information, such as internal policies and procedures, are private to the universities. The Department of Justice reported earlier this month that dozens of parents had allegedly used bribes and other tactics to deceitfully earn admission for their children to some of the nation\u2019s top universities. Celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman were two of the parents named in the report. Loughlin was accused of fabricating an athletic profile for her daughter, Olivia Jade. Jade was ultimately admitted to USC as a crew recruit. The scheme was allegedly organized by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, who ran a college preparatory business that appeared to help students with the college admissions process. In reality, Singer funneled money from parents to various university contacts in exchange for help in the admissions process. In some instances, Singer helped students cheat on exams by placing them in controlled testing facilities in which hired proctors would correct the student\u2019s incorrect answers before the exam was submitted.

      "content": " U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released a statement Wednesday in defense of cuts to the Special Olympics \u2013 a private organization \u2013 that have been recommended in the past, but ignored by Congress anyway. The Wall Street Journal\u2018s Michelle Hackman tweeted:  While Democrats and their allies condemn abortion restrictions that ban\u00a0the procedure simply because an unborn baby is diagnosed with a disability, they let loose a social media firestorm on the Trump administration for suggesting $17.6 million in federal funding cuts to the Special Olympics program. Democrat politicians are portrayed in media as defending disabled children, \u201cvowing\u201d the cuts will not happen \u2013 when the fact is, they have never happened. In fact, Congress has provided even more funding to the Special Olympics. Politico reported\u00a0DeVos\u2019 defense of the administration\u2019s budget proposal during a congressional hearing \u201cwent viral\u201d: On Tuesday, Democrats pounced on the proposed cut during the hearing, with Rep. Barbara Lee of California calling the plan \u201cappalling.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSome tweets claimed DeVos had already cut the funding,\u201d the report continued:   As the report also stated, however: The department\u2019s\u00a0fiscal 2020 proposal\u00a0would eliminate federal money for Special Olympics Education programs. The department\u2019s last two budget proposals would also have eliminated federal funding, but nothing would be cut unless Congress agreed to do so, and Congress has rejected administration plans. In fact, Congress has increased the funding. \u201cIt is unacceptable, shameful and counterproductive that the media and some members of Congress have spun up falsehoods and fully misrepresented the facts,\u201d said\u00a0DeVos in her statement Wednesday, adding that President Donald Trump\u2019s budget \u201csupports our nation\u2019s 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress.\u201d \u201cAll of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need,\u201d the secretary continued. \u201cThe budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities.\u201d Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, has already said Special Olympics funding would not be cut.  \u201cI\u2019m a longtime supporter of Special Olympics and proud that Missouri is home to the largest Special Olympics training facility in the world,\u201d Blunt said in a statement. \u201cI was just at the World Games and saw, as I have many times before, what a huge impact the organization has on athletes, their families, and their communities. Our Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program.\u201d \u201cThe Special Olympics is not a federal program,\u201d DeVos stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year.\u201d In 2018 DeVos announced\u00a0she would donate\u00a0part of her salary to the Special Olympics. ",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "  Hetty Rosenstein, a Communications Workers of America state director, said she tweeted her hopes for DeVos\u2019s \u201chorrible, horrible death\u201d after she heard the Trump administration was seeking to make cuts to the Special Olympics program. \u201cLate at night on Tuesday I learned that Betsy De Vos was cutting\u00a0100% of federal\u00a0funding for the Special Olympics,\u201d Rosenstein said, according to the New Jersey Globe.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know\u00a0the last time I heard such horrible news or\u00a0felt such despair.\u00a0I had just posted that I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u00a0And so I said something out of that despair that I regret.\u201d  Cuts to the Special Olympics \u2013 a private organization \u2013 however, have been recommended by both the Trump and Bush administrations in the past, but have been ignored\u00a0by Congress. In fact, Congress has even increased funding to the program for children with disabilities.  Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, had already said Special Olympics funding would not be cut. \u201cOur Department of Education appropriations bill will not cut funding for the program,\u201d Blunt said. Nevertheless, Democrats this week are portraying the Trump administration as dismissive of children with disabilities because of the proposed budget cuts to the Special Olympics organization. Politico\u00a0reported\u00a0comments about DeVos\u2019s defense of the administration\u2019s budget proposal during a congressional hearing \u201cwent viral.\u201d On Tuesday, Democrats pounced on the proposed cut in funding. Rep. Barbara Lee of California referred to the plan as \u201cappalling.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,\u201d she said. \u201cThe department\u2019s\u00a0fiscal 2020 proposal\u00a0would eliminate federal money for Special Olympics Education programs,\u201d Politico noted. \u201cThe department\u2019s last two budget proposals would also have eliminated federal funding, but nothing would be cut unless Congress agreed to do so, and Congress has rejected administration plans. In fact, Congress has increased the funding.\u201d DeVos released a statement Wednesday\u00a0targeting the spread of the inaccuracies over the proposed budget cuts to Special Olympics. \u201cIt is unacceptable, shameful and counterproductive that the media and some members of Congress have spun up falsehoods and fully misrepresented the facts,\u201d the secretary\u00a0said, adding that President Donald Trump\u2019s budget \u201csupports our nation\u2019s 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress.\u201d \u201cAll of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need,\u201d DeVos continued. \u201cThe budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities.\u201d \u201cI should not have said it,\u201d Rosenstein said about her tweet hoping for DeVos\u2019s death.\u00a0\u201cI am a leader and I should have mustered something to help to inspire others to continue to fight for justice and to fight the power and privilege and immorality of the politics of DeVos.\u201d In 2018 DeVos\u00a0announced\u00a0she would donate\u00a0part of her salary to the Special Olympics. \u201cThe Special Olympics is not a federal program,\u201d the secretary said in her statement Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The Trump administration is addressing the U.S. government\u2019s $1.45 trillion student loan portfolio, including hiring consultants to advise on selling all or portions of the portfolio to private investors.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " The Wall Street Journal, citing \u201cadministration officials familiar with the matter,\u201d said the move comes after a surge of defaults on loans and individuals taking advantage of federal debt-forgiveness plans that have led to reduced federal coffers. The Journal reported: The Education Department has hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to study how much money could be lost if low repayment rates persist, an agency spokeswoman said. Meantime, President Trump\u2019s top economic advisers in the White House are studying ways to improve the program\u2019s finances, senior administration officials said. One option under early consideration is to sell at least a portion of the portfolio, a plan that has been discussed previously by Republican policymakers but faces many obstacles, including whether the government could find interested investors at the right price. Under such a plan, the government would maintain its role as the nation\u2019s primary lender to college and graduate students, but the government would raise money up front, instead of waiting years for borrowers to make payments and take the debt off its books. Investors would then assume the long-term risk of the loans. Sources said this project is in the early stages and an array of options will be explored. An Education Department spokeswoman told the Journal about the McKinsey study. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting a clear understanding of the state of the portfolio,\u201d Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, said, adding that the review \u201dis the responsible thing to do since we\u2019re charged with overseeing it.\u201d Some statistics on student loan debt from the Journal report: \u2022 The amount Americans owe in federal student loans has nearly tripled since 2007. The Journal reported: The Higher Education Act, a longstanding law that authorizes the student-loan program, allows the education secretary, after consulting with the Treasury secretary, to sell student loans if the terms are \u2019in the best interest of the United States. The law prohibits any sale that would result in a cost to the government. It states that any money made off the sale could then be used to reduce interest rates for borrowers \u201cto encourage on-time repayment.\u2019 The Journal report also revealed that students may not be the only ones who have to reckon with federal student loan debt: \u201cIf the review shows that the student-loan portfolio brings in less money than previously understood, the administration could gain more support for initiatives to pressure schools to rein in tuition increases. For example, the White House has suggested developing a system to put colleges on the hook to help pay off their graduates\u2019 outstanding debt.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": "  The family, which includes Department of Education Secretary Besty DeVos, has not made any contributions to the Michigan congressman this cycle and \u201cthey have no plans to do so,\u201d family spokesman Nick Wasmiller said in a statement to The Detroit News.  \u201cFamily members have expressed increasing concerns about a lack of representation for their district, the Third Congressional, and I would say an inability to advance efforts connected to important policy matters,\u201d Wasmiller added, noting that\u00a0Amash\u2019s call for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump has \u201cnot changed the family\u2019s thinking regarding its intent to not provide future support.\u201d Amash, a libertarian-leaning congressman often at odds with his fellow Republicans, set off a firestorm Saturday after accusing President Donald Trump of engaging in \u201cimpeachable\u201d conduct and claiming Attorney General William Barr mischaracterized special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on now-debunked collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 echoing claims made by Democrats on Capitol Hill. \u201cContrary to Barr\u2019s portrayal, Mueller\u2019s report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meets the threshold for impeachment,\u201d Amash\u00a0tweeted. The lawmaker then argued that Mueller\u2019s report \u201cidentifies multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice, and undoubtedly any person who is not the president of the United States would be indicted based on such evidence.\u201d Contrary to the Michigan Republican\u2019s assertions, the special counsel found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russia government or its cut-outs. Further, the attorney general said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice, stating that he and Deputy Attorney\u00a0General Rod Rosenstein determined that the president had not done so. The House Freedom Caucus on Monday evening voted to condemn Amash, one of the group\u2019s founding members, over his recent remarks.\u00a0House\u00a0Oversight\u00a0Committee\u00a0ranking\u00a0member\u00a0Jim Jordan (R-OH), who previously served as chairman of the\u00a0Freedom Caucus, said that all 30 members in attendance at the caucus\u2019s weekly meeting voted for the measure. \u201cIt was every single person who totally disagrees with what he says,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cWhat concerns me is Justin was viewed as a leader, right, on protecting privacy rights first to\u00a0First Amendment rights.\u201d President Trump took aim at Amash in a pair of tweets Sunday, calling him a \u201closer\u201d and a lightweight.\u201d \u201cNever a fan of\u00a0@justinamash, a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great Republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy, the president\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Sunday. \u201cJustin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents [sic] hands!\u201d Meanwhile, Michigan State Rep. Jim Lower (R) announced on Monday he will mount a primary challenge to\u00a0Amash. He\u00a0was expected to officially launch his campaign around July 4th, but\u00a0moved up\u00a0the announcement in the wake of the congressman\u2019s comments. ",

      "subtitle": "Recently released education-centered polls reveal a sharp divide between black and white Democrats over support for charter schools.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Support for charter schools among white Democrats has plummeted, while black and Hispanic members of the party remain steadily favorable toward the schools that are publicly funded but privately managed. A poll by Education Next\u00a0conducted in May 2018 showed that, overall, Democrats oppose charter schools, compared to Republicans. The Washington Free Beacon\u00a0noted, however, that when Chalkbeat requested a breakdown of responses according to race, the results were \u201cstartling.\u201d (Sam Park/Chalkbeat) According to the\u00a0Education Next\u00a0survey, over the last two years, support for charter schools among white Democrats has crashed, while black and Hispanic Democrats still view them favorably. As of 2018, 50 percent of white Democrats opposed charters, while 27 percent supported them. Among black Democrats, 47 percent supported charter schools, while 29 percent opposed them. Hispanic Democrat support was also at 47 percent, while opposition was at 35 percent. A key outcome of another poll, commissioned by Democrats for Education Reform (DFER) \u2014 which supports charter schools \u2014 found \u201cthere is strong public support for public charter schools among key Democratic constituencies, particularly Black and Hispanic voters.\u201d Among black Democrats in the DFER poll, 58 percent were favorable toward charter schools, with 31 percent opposed. Among Hispanic Democrats, 52 percent supported charters, with 30 percent opposed. Only 26 percent of white Democrats, however, were favorable toward charter schools, with 62 percent opposed. DFER\u2019s poll made two additional points: The surveys are published as both Democrat 2020 hopefuls, Sens. Bernie Sanders\u00a0(VT) and Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(MA), have called for an end to federal funding of for-profit charter schools. Sen. Cory Booker (NJ) \u2014 their Democrat colleague and also a 2020 contender \u2014 has been a vocal supporter of school choice in the past, even to the extent of having worked in the recent past with current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and her family to promote the concept. In a February column at Mother Jones titled \u201cCory Booker Has a Betsy DeVos Problem,\u201d Kara Voght wrote about Booker\u2019s keynote address in 2012 at a school choice policy summit in New Jersey. Booker, who was the mayor of Newark at the time, was one of only a few Democrats to speak at the event run by the American Federation for Children, an organization chaired at the time by Betsy DeVos. The current U.S. senator told hundreds of attendees the public school system \u201cstill chokes out the potential of millions of children\u201d and urged others to follow his lead by replacing failing public schools with publicly-funded charter schools that are managed by private companies. As New York Magazine\u00a0noted, Booker ultimately voted against DeVos\u2019 confirmation as Secretary of Education, though he has defended his school choice reforms made when he was mayor of Newark. The black/Hispanic-white Democrat divide over school choice could create an interesting issue for the party as it attempts to increase its power in Washington, DC. \u201cIt creates a bit of a challenge for Democratic candidates in the presidential primaries,\u201d Marty West, a Harvard professor and editor-in-chief of Education Next, told Chalkbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that many people will be basing their decisions on education, but voters of color are a substantial segment of the Democratic primary electorate.\u201d Results of the larger Education Next\u00a0poll were based upon a nationwide sample of 4,601 adults and representative oversamples of parents with school-age children living in their home (2,129), teachers (641), blacks (624), and Hispanics (799).\u00a0Education Next\u00a0states, \u201cThe margin of error for binary responses given by the full sample in the\u00a0EdNext\u00a0survey is roughly 1.4 percentage points for questions on which opinion is evenly split.\u201d The DFER nationwide phone poll used the responses of 1,004 presidential voters, including 415 Democrat primary voters, who were interviewed between May 31\u2013June 7, 2018. The margin of error for the entire sample is \u00b13.8 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk facilitated the discussion with DeVos in a Q&A format. The conversation pivoted to a discussion of the failure of the education system\u2013 subpar public schools specifically\u2013 to properly teach students basic civics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how few students are exposed to the brilliance of these documents and our Founding Fathers,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cHow are you planning to continue to address this problem as we move forward?\u201d \u201cWell, it is a huge problem,\u201d DeVos said before citing a recent statistic demonstrating the severity of the issue. \u201cThe latest statistic that I saw suggested that only about 18 percent of high school seniors had a reasonable understanding of civics and U.S. history,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a frightening figure when you think about it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for the federal government to mandate a specific curriculum nationally to address this,\u201d she added. \u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to talk very widely and loudly about the need to have robust civics and American history courses taught in every school across the country and for states, frankly, to adopt the requirement in their state to do so\u201d:  Civics is not the only issue, DeVos said. According to an international assessment cited by DeVos, American schools are falling behind in many other areas as well. \u201cJust to put it in a little bit more in context as well, there\u2019s an international assessment that\u2019s done every three years and countries around the world\u2013 developed and developing countries. Results are compared for academic achievement,\u201d DeVos said earlier in the conversation. \u201cAnd in the latest one, the United States was 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, if we had results like that in the Olympics, do you think anyone in our country would stand for that?\u201d she asked. DeVos believes \u201cschool choice\u201d is part of the answer, which she plans to pursue with the establishment of a federal tax credit. \u201cIndividuals and companies could voluntarily donate to 501(c) charitable organizations that would be designated by the states that chose to participate in this tax credit,\u201d DeVos explained. She said: If a state chose to participate and individuals and companies gave voluntarily to that fund, the state would then be able to take a portion of that federal pot and develop or augment programs that they already have in their state to extend scholarship opportunities to families and students in the state. That way, parents would have the opportunity to \u201cchoose a better fit\u201d for their child\u2019s K-12 education, DeVos explained. ",

(Matthew Perdie/Breitbart News) \u201cIf you stand up for something, you\u2019re going to be set apart, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to believe the lie that you\u2019re the only one who thinks the way that you do,\u201d said vice president Mike Pence\u2019s daughter Charlotte Pence on Friday. \u201cLeadership is lonely, [but] it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re alone.\u201d Fox News journalist and investigative reporter Sara Carter was also present at YWLS and\u00a0spoke about her experiences\u00a0reporting in Afghanistan: I spent a lot of time in villages \u2014 where women, in the majority of Afghanistan \u2014 were not allowed to make their own choices or decisions. The majority of the women that I knew, and it was unique that I was a [female] journalist in the war zone \u2014 because I could talk to the women, whereas male journalists were not allowed. They didn\u2019t have access to them. So, I was able to get a whole different perspective. I remember meeting a young girl \u2014 we were at a clinic \u2014 she saw the female Afghan doctor, she saw me, and she looked around kind of stunned, and she said, \u201cWomen can work?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, where I\u2019m from, almost all the women work.\u201d And she said to me, with tears in her eyes, \u201cI will never, ever, be able to go to school, finish school, have a job, do what you do\u201d \u2014 because she was beholden to her father\u2019s arranged marriage. She was 12 or 13 years old, and the man that she was to be married with was in his late 60s and was an elder of a village. \u201cThe reason why I bring this up,\u201d said Carter, \u201cis because we have such extraordinary freedoms in this country, and in the Western world, but particularly in the United States. Freedoms that are worth fighting for. Liberty.\u201d  On Friday night, former United States ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley spoke to the YWLS attendees at a banquet\u00a0where she said that Americans should not be calling their fellow citizens \u201cevil\u201d simply for having different political views. \u201cWhen I hear them call each other \u2018evil,\u2019 it bothers me because I\u2019ve seen evil,\u201d said Haley. \u201cI\u2019ve been\u00a0to the Democratic Republic of Congo where they use rape as a weapon of war. I\u2019ve been to South Sudan where they\u2019ve taken babies from women\u2019s arms and thrown them into fires \u2014 that\u2019s evil.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re having in our country is a debate of ideas,\u201d added Haley. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d  YWLS attendee poses for a photo in front of Breitbart News\u2019s interview backdrop. (Alana Mastrangelo/Breitbart News) Representative\u00a0Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) was the headline speaker on Saturday and told attendees, \u201cWe are Republicans because we believe in a republic. We believe in checks and balances. We believe in the notion of federalism. We believe that we are governed by the people, a free people.\u201d \u201cDemocrats,\u201d Crenshaw continued, \u201cthey\u2019re more comfortable with this notion of tyranny of the majority \u2014 51 percent of the population should not be able to tell the other 49 percent what to do. The Democrats are very comfortable with this notion \u2014 look at why they are so adamant of getting rid of the Electoral College.\u201d  Rep. Dan Crenshaw talks about the difference between Republicans\u00a0and Democrats\u00a0on Saturday evening. (Matthew Perdie/Breitbart News) The event concluded with public speaker and film director Jaco Booyens, whose\u00a0sister was a victim of human trafficking and whose experience is captured in the film 8 Days. Booyens gave an impassioned speech in which he stressed to the young women in the audience how important and valuable they are to society. \u201cThis is the part of the speech where we\u2019re going to get into the uncomfortable stuff,\u201d said Booyens before making his presentation interactive. \u201cAnd I ask you to participate because I believe today a transformation will happen in your life. I believe today you are going to rise up and you are going to become a queen.\u201d You can watch Booyen\u2019s full speech here\u00a0at time code: 9:15.

Thank you for the opportunity @TPUSA!\u201d  \u201cOfficially left #YWLS2019 and let me tell you\u2026 if you are a young lady and feel alone in your conservative beliefs, please don\u2019t,\u201d\u00a0said another YWLS attendee. \u201cThis is your family. This is your sisterhood. And we are more present and strong-willed than ever.\u201d \u201cWhat [Jaco Booyens] gave me today was a lightness of heart,\u201d tweeted one TPUSA chapter leader. \u201cNo matter where men in my life have failed, I know that now I am qualified and worthy and enough today no matter what. Thank you for that. He is always a stand out speaker.\u201d \u201cYou are free you are powerful you are unstoppable,\u201d responded Booyens in a tweet, \u201cIt was great to meet you.

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",

The consortium was established to combine the resources of each university\u2019s Middle East Studies departments. The Department of Education received a complaint from Rep. George Holding (R-NC) over alleged antisemitic rhetoric at a federally-funded conference hosted by the consortium on Gaza. In a letter to Rep. Holding, Betsy DeVos stated that the UNC-Duke Consortium risks losing its federal funding if it cannot present a fair and unbiased perspective on the information that it presents. \u201cThis includes a requirement under Section 602 (e)(1) of the HEA that grantees must use funds to support activities that \u201creflect diverse perspectives and a wide range of views and generate debate on world regions and international affairs,'\u201d DeVos wrote. DeVos went on to argue in the letter that she will move to pull the funding from the UNC-Duke Consortium if it cannot comply with the law. I am troubled by the concerns outlined in your letter. In order for the Department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant, Department regulations, or the HEA. It is critical that recipients of grants use funds in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as for purposes of the program for which they are funded. Rep. Holding thanked Secretary DeVos for her action on the issue. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Secretary DeVos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,\u201d Representative Holding said on the investigation. \u201cI hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.\u201d ",

      "subtitle": "A college student at Salve Regina University was allowed to graduate after school investigators found him \u201cnot responsible\u201d for the rape accusation made against him by a female student.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The two internal school investigators at the small, Catholic school in Newport, Rhode Island, found \u201cJohn Doe\u201d \u201cnot responsible\u201d for the alleged rape just five days prior to graduation. \u201cUp until that point, he didn\u2019t know if he was graduating,\u201d said\u00a0Doe\u2019s attorney, John R. Grasso, according to a report at Newportri.com. Doe\u2019s accuser claimed he raped her after driving her home one night in March. The accuser reportedly said Doe attempted to choke her to the point that she could not breathe. Doe discovered a complaint had been filed against him at school four days later. In May, before he knew the outcome of the internal school investigation, Doe filed a federal lawsuit against Salve Regina, the first student accused of sexual assault to sue the school. The news report stated Doe claimed the two internal investigators evaluating the rape charge against him were improperly trained, though they essentially served as prosecutor and judge in the case against him. According to the report, Doe had no opportunity to cross-examine either the female student who accused him of the rape or a key witness. Grasso sent a notice to J. Malcolm Smith, Salve\u2019s interim vice president for student affairs and Dean of Students, who also serves as the school\u2019s Title IX coordinator, on March 30, requesting a hearing with witnesses but said he received no response. Newportri.com reported: In early April, both investigators interviewed John Doe in the downstairs conference room of the university chapel. Grasso said he was allowed to accompany his client at the interview, but not speak with investigators. \u201cI have to be the potted plant in the room,\u201d Grasso said. \u201cHe can ask me questions and I can speak to him, but I\u2019m not allowed to speak with the investigators. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s so inefficient.\u201d When the school investigators completed an initial report, Grasso requested a copy but was denied. He reviewed the report in person and took notes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the university\u2019s job through a process to please people,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s to determine the facts and to determine whether the facts lead to find a violation or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d The federal lawsuit was dismissed June 14 when it was no longer an issue because Doe had been told he was found \u201cnot responsible\u201d for the alleged rape and that he would be able to graduate. When Doe\u2019s accuser and other female students organized a demonstration about campus sex assault via social media \u2014 held on the Sunday morning of commencement \u2014 Grasso said Doe grew worried he would be at the center of a protest. Smith said school security guided the female students away from the commencement site. Doe, who hails from New Jersey, is one of a growing number of male college students in the United States who have been accused of sexual assault and claim their schools conducted investigations into the charges against them without due process. Grasso said he represented a dozen clients involved in Title IX sexual assault investigations at Rhode Island schools during the past year, double the number he had the previous year. In November, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0released\u00a0a long-awaited proposed Title IX rule, calling for a \u201cpresumption of innocence throughout the grievance process,\u201d as well as \u201cwritten notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected.\u201d The new rule would also allow both parties to have the right to cross-examination and would define sexual harassment as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Alleged incidents of sexual misconduct would only be investigated if they occurred on campus or during a school-sponsored event, according to the proposed rule. Under a 2011 Obama-era policy, students accused of sexual misconduct were often denied the ability to cross-examine their accuser and to have access to the alleged evidence against them. Critics of the policy referred to the internal school investigations as \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d The Obama administration also\u00a0used\u00a0a false statistic \u2014 \u201cone in five\u201d women experience sexual assault in college \u2014 that was repeated in the mainstream media to promote the narrative that women in college were frequently victims of sexual assault. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, however, a division of the Department of Justice, the actual\u00a0rate\u00a0of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in five. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2014 7.6 per 1,000.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Inside Higher Ed reported\u00a0the lawsuit \u201ccould theoretically challenge, even retroactively, the results of any campus sexual violence case that didn\u2019t offer due process protections.\u201d The lawsuit\u00a0was filed by anonymous male student \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d who was accused of sexually assaulting a date at a fraternity party in February 2018. According to the suit, Doe said sexual activity between himself and a female student was consensual, but discovered soon afterward she had accused him of forcing himself on her. The female student reported the alleged sexual assault several days later to the school\u2019s Office of Institutional Equity. After a campus investigation, Doe was suspended from Michigan State for two years. His attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, who also represented\u00a0former Columbia University student Paul Nungesser \u2013 falsely accused of rape by \u201cmattress girl\u201d Emma Sulkowicz \u2013 has now amended Doe\u2019s complaint and requested class-action status. According to Inside Higher Ed, Miltenberg said he believes \u201cseveral hundred\u201d current and former students could be affected by potential flaws in their Title IX cases conducted by university processes. The case looks to a September 2018 appeals court ruling that directed universities to allow students or their representatives to cross-examine the accuser during a live hearing. \u201c[O]ur circuit has made two things clear,\u201d wrote\u00a0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and continued: (1)\u00a0 if a student is accused of misconduct, the university must hold some sort of hearing before imposing a sanction as serious as expulsion or suspension, and (2) when the university\u2019s determination turns on the\u00a0credibility of the accuser, the accused, or witnesses, that hearing must include an opportunity for cross-examination. \u201cDue process requires cross-examination in circumstances like these because it is \u2018the greatest legal engine ever invented\u2019 for uncovering the truth,\u201d the court ruled. The ruling was consistent with the thinking of the Trump administration. In November, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0released\u00a0a long-awaited proposed Title IX rule, calling for a \u201cpresumption of innocence throughout the grievance process,\u201d as well as \u201cwritten notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected.\u201d The new rule would also allow both parties to have the right to cross-examination and would define sexual harassment as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Alleged incidents of sexual misconduct would only be investigated if they occurred on campus or during a school-sponsored event, according to the proposed rule. Retired university administrator Pat Daugherty told Breitbart News she \u201cwatched the panic first-hand\u201d when the Obama-era \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter was issued in 2011. With the Obama policy, students accused of sexual misconduct have regularly been denied the ability to cross-examine their accuser and to have access to the alleged evidence against them. The school teams investigating campus sex assault cases have often been referred to as \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d \u201cEveryone wants accusers to be heard in sexual assault allegations,\u201d Daugherty explained. \u201cHowever, the Obama administration\u2019s Title IX guidelines suddenly inserted the federal government into student judicial processes and reduced many of the due process protections that had been in place for the accused.\u201d Daugherty said the pressure of the new rules was significant and the \u201cemphasis was now on handling each case from the accuser\u2019s point of view, as due process for the accused unfortunately took a back seat.\u201d She added the potential class action lawsuit \u201cindicates there are many young men who feel they were victimized by the rush to judgment mentality that took over.\u201d To promote its campus sex rules, the Obama administration also\u00a0used\u00a0a false statistic \u2014 \u201c1 in 5\u201d women experience sexual assault in college \u2014 that was repeated in the mainstream media and on college campuses to promote the narrative that women in college were frequently victims of sexual assault. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, however, a division of the Department of Justice, the actual\u00a0rate\u00a0of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in five. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2014 7.6 per 1,000. \u201cWe need a much more transparent, fair and equitable system that gives everybody the chance to be heard completely,\u201d Miltenberg said.

      "content": " As the\u00a0New York Times notes, the lame-duck Obama administration issued a regulation in December 2016 ostensibly aimed at protecting students taking online courses from for-profit universities. It was just the latest assault by Obama against for-profit education, which he and his party had targeted throughout his presidency. The new rule required for-profit institutions to be authorized in students\u2019 home states \u2014 or else federal financial aid would be unavailable. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos tried to delay the implementation of the rule, arguing that states were not ready to enforce it \u2014 as the\u00a0American Council on Education also noted. But the National Education Association (NEA), a powerful teachers\u2019 union, sued the department in federal court \u2014 in California, the favorite forum for liberal lawsuits against the Trump administration. The NEA won in April, and every other state hurried to comply with the rule. But not California. Last week, the department issued a notice that California \u201cdoes not have a process to manage complaints for out-of-state public or non-profit institutions serving students at a distance in the State. Further, the State of California does not participate in a State authorization reciprocity agreement which addresses the issue.\u201d State officials scrambled, the\u00a0Times notes: \u201cCalifornia officials indicated that the financial aid suspension could be short-lived.\u201d They claim to have \u201cset up a complaint system that would meet the department\u2019s requirements,\u201d which \u201cwill go live on Monday.\u201d Meanwhile, 80,000 California students have been placed at risk of losing financial aid.

Officials of both the UC and Cal State systems say their investigative processes into campus sexual assault charges are fair, reports the Times,\u00a0and that they have strengthened due process protections as required by the courts and the U.S. Education Department, the latter of which rescinded the Obama-era campus sexual misconduct policies and proposed a new rule. \u201cEveryone wants accusers to be heard in sexual assault allegations,\u201d retired university administrator Pat Daugherty explained to Breitbart News. \u201cHowever, the Obama administration\u2019s Title IX guidelines suddenly inserted the federal government into student judicial processes and reduced many of the due process protections that had been in place for the accused.\u201d Daugherty said the pressure of the new rules was significant and the \u201cemphasis was now on handling each case from the accuser\u2019s point of view, as due process for the accused unfortunately took a back seat.\u201d She added the class action lawsuit approach \u201cindicates there are many young men who feel they were victimized by the rush to judgment mentality that took over.\u201d The Times\u00a0reports Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators, referred to the class action suits as a \u201cclever approach\u201d that would allow possibly thousands of students who might be unable to afford hiring their own personal attorneys to still take legal action. Sokolow said more than 300 students across the United States have\u00a0filed lawsuits\u00a0challenging the results of their schools\u2019 Title IX investigations. He added, however, that as many as 20,000 students in the nation may have been disciplined for sexual misconduct. \u201cIf one case succeeds,\u201d he said, according to the Times. \u201cit opens the floodgates for others.\u201d After announcing the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama-era policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released\u00a0a long-awaited proposed Title IX rule in November 2018. The proposed rule called for a \u201cpresumption of innocence throughout the grievance process,\u201d as well as \u201cwritten notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected.\u201d The plan would also allow both parties to have the right to cross-examination, and would define sexual harassment as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Alleged incidents of sexual misconduct would only be investigated if they occurred on campus or during a school-sponsored event, according to the proposed rule. With the Obama-era policy, students accused of sexual misconduct have regularly been denied the ability to cross-examine their accuser and to have access to the alleged evidence against them. The school teams investigating campus sex assault cases have often been referred to as \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d Since the Trump administration proposed its new rule, some left-wing organizations and politicians have criticized the emphasis on due process, claiming it would detract from campus safety for accusers, whom they immediately label \u201csurvivors\u201d of sexual misconduct. Last November, the ACLU tweeted, \u201cThe proposed rule would make schools less safe for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, when there is already alarmingly high rates of campus sexual assaults and harassment that go unreported\u201d:  To promote its campus sexual misconduct policy, the Obama administration\u00a0used\u00a0a false statistic to create the image of what the ACLU referred to as \u201calarmingly high rates of campus sexual assaults and harassment.\u201d Asserting that \u201c1 in 5\u201d women experience sexual assault in college, and repeating that statistic in the mainstream media and on college campuses supported the narrative that women in college were frequently victims of sexual assault. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, however, a division of the Department of Justice, the actual\u00a0rate\u00a0of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in five. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2014 7.6 per 1,000.  \u201cIt promotes an unfair process, inappropriately favoring the accused and letting schools ignore their responsibility under Title IX to respond promptly and fairly to complaints of sexual violence,\u201d the ACLU complained about the Trump administration\u2019s proposed rule. \u201cWe will continue to support survivors.\u201d The ACLU received considerable criticism for its reaction, including a comment from Brooklyn College history professor KC Johnson, who tweeted the ACLU\u2019s response was \u201cmindboggling.\u201d    \u201cCross-examination by a lawyer is \u2018inappropriately favoring the accused?\u2019\u201d Johnson asked. \u201cEnsuring both parties have access to training materials and evidence? Does the ACLU now adopt those positions more broadly?\u201d",

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Education Department is fining Michigan State University a record $4.5 million and demanding sweeping changes after determining that it failed to respond to sexual assault complaints against Larry Nassar, a former sports doctor at the school who also worked at USA Gymnastics.",
      "author": "AP",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the penalty Thursday after the school settled with the department to resolve two investigations. DeVos said that Nassar\u2019s actions were \u201cdisgusting and unimaginable\u201d but that so too was the university\u2019s response. \u201cToo many people in power knew about the behaviors and the complaints and yet the predators continued on the payroll and abused even more students,\u201d DeVos said in a call with reporters. \u201cThis must not happen again there or anywhere else.\u201d The fine is the largest levied under the Clery Act , a federal law that requires colleges to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. The previous largest fine, $2.4 million, was imposed in 2016 against Pennsylvania State University over its handling of sexual misconduct involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The department\u2019s investigation concluded that Michigan State violated several key parts of the Clery Act along with Title IX, a federal law forbidding discrimination based on gender in education. Michigan State did not immediately provide comment. A department investigation found that Michigan State violated the Clery Act by failing to disclose crime statistics, failing to issue campus warnings about security threats and failing to establish a system to collect crime statistics. As a remedy, the school says it will hire a \u201cClery compliance officer\u201d and create measures to protect athletes and children who participate in youth programs on campus. A separate Title IX investigation found that Michigan State failed to respond to reports of sexual misconduct against Nassar and his supervisor William Strampel , failed to take interim measures to protect students while complaints against both men were pending, and failed to take steps to end any harassment and prevent it from recurring. As part of its settlement agreement with the department, Michigan State says it will make \u201csubstantial\u201d changes to its Title IX procedures and will provide a process to help victims of Nassar, including offering counseling services, grade changes, tuition reimbursement or the opportunity to retake classes at no cost. The school is also being ordered to \u201cconsider appropriate sanctions\u201d against current and former employees who failed to take action after being notified of sexual misconduct by Nassar and Strampel. Kenneth Marcus, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights, said the agreement represents an \u201cextensive and robust\u201d resolution. Unlike most Title IX investigations, which are usually triggered by complaints submitted to the department, Marcus\u2019 office launched an investigation into Michigan State in 2018 based on the severity of the allegations, he said. \u201cThis message should be heard loudly and clearly by all universities so that the tragedy at Michigan State University is not repeated elsewhere,\u201d Marcus said. Nassar has been sentenced to decades in prison for sexually assaulting athletes, mostly female gymnasts, at Michigan State and a Lansing-area gymnastics club. Former Olympians said he also molested them in Texas and overseas while he worked for USA Gymnastics. MSU last year agreed to a $500 million deal with Nassar\u2019s accusers. Most of the money, $425 million, was for 333 people, mostly women and girls, who had already sued. MSU so far has settled with 72 people in the second wave of litigation but dozens remain. Strampel last month was sentenced to a year in jail for neglect of duty and misconduct in office. He was accused of failing to monitor Nassar and using his job as a medical school dean to sexually harass students.",

According to the Department of Education, the program offers very few, \u201cif any,\u201d programs\u00a0focused on the historic discrimination against\u00a0religious minorities in the Middle East, and lacks balance, focusing on the \u201cpositive aspects of Islam\u201d while having an \u201cabsolute absence\u201d of a similar focus on the positive aspects of\u00a0Christianity and Judaism.",
      "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
      "content": " The U.S. Department of Education says that Duke and UNC are misusing\u00a0a federal grant to advance \u201cideological priorities,\u201d and is ordering the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies (CMES) to revise its joint program by September 22 or risk losing federal funding, according to a report by the Associated Press. \u201cThe Duke-UNC CMES appears to lack balance as it offers very few, if any, programs focused on the historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East, including Christians, Jews, Baha\u2019is, Yadizis, Kurds, Druze, and others,\u201d states the Department of Education in an August 29 letter. \u201cAlso,\u201d added the letter, \u201cthere is a considerable emphasis placed on the understanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism, or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\u201d The Trump administration says that the \u201clack of balance of perspectives is troubling and strongly\u00a0suggests that Duke-UNC CMES is not meeting legal requirement\u201d that mandates\u00a0National Resource Centers to provide \u201ca full\u00a0understanding of the areas, regions, or countries.\u201d In June, Education\u00a0Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered an investigation into\u00a0the Middle East program after Rep.\u00a0George Holding (R-NC) noted that it hosted a tax-payer funded conference with \u201csevere anti-Israel\u00a0bias and anti-Semitic rhetoric.\u201d The report added that the investigation is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to root out\u00a0antisemitism on U.S. university campuses, and that investigators concluded the program had intended to use funds on offerings that are \u201cplainly unqualified for taxpayer support,\u201d adding that foreign language and national security \u201chave taken a back seat to other priorities.\u201d Anti-Israel and antisemitic movements have, in fact, been an issue popping up on U.S. college campuses via tactics such as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), which is designed to ultimately destroy the world\u2019s only Jewish state. The BDS movement \u2014 supported by\u00a0Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rep.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2014 has manifested itself on college campuses across the country, in an effort to delegitimize Israel in the minds of students, galvanizing them to march in lockstep with the anti-Semitic campaign. Henry Reichman, the chairman of a committee on academic freedom for the American Association of University Professors, reacted to the Education Department\u2019s letter by referring to it as, ironically, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d enacted by the \u201cright-wing.\u201d \u201cIs the government now going to judge funding programs based on the opinions of instructors or the approach of each course?\u201d asked\u00a0Reichman. \u201cThe odor of right wing political correctness that comes through this definitely could have a chilling effect.\u201d UNC professor Jay Smith reacted by stating that the Department of Education\u2019s letter is \u201cideologically driven harassment,\u201d and that the official who signed the letter \u201cshould\u00a0stay in his lane and allow the experts to determine what constitutes a \u2018full understanding\u2019 of the Middle East.\u201d The Education Department maintains, however, that the Duke-UNC CMES may still offer programs in, for example, \u201cIranian art and film,\u201d but that such programs should not be funded or subsidized with taxpayer money, as CMES has not clearly demonstrated how these programs are\u00a0secondary to more rigorous and relevant coursework. The department also cited examples of reading materials such as Amihri Hatun: Performance, Gender-Bending and Subversion in the Early Modern Ottoman Intellectual History\u00a0and Radical Love: Teachings from Islamic Mystical Tradition, noting that their relevance to Title VI is \u201cpatently unclear.\u201d \u201cThe Consortium deeply values its partnership with the Department of Education and has always been strongly committed to complying with the purposes and requirements of the Title VI program,\u201d said a UNC-Chapel Hill spokesperson to Breitbart News. \u201cIn keeping with the spirit of this partnership,\u201d added the spokesperson, \u201cthe Consortium is committed to working with the Department to provide more information about its programs.\u201d Duke University did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019 request for comment.

      "subtitle": "Left-wing media are fuming that U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visited a Catholic elementary school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that deems transgender ideology \u201cimmoral.\u201d",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " HuffPost\u00a0reported that DeVos\u2019s \u201cBack-to-School tour\u201d included a visit Thursday to Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg. The headline read, \u201cBetsy DeVos To Promote School That Bans Transgender Students And Staff.\u201d Other media reported in a similar vein. CNN reported, \u201cDeVos to Visit School that Refuses to Accommodate Trans Students.\u201d CBS News reported, \u201cSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos Visits School with Anti-Transgender Policy.\u201d The Olean Times Herald\u00a0reported, \u201cPA: Secy DeVos Visits Anti-Trans School in Harrisburg.\u201d The Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg has a specific stated policy, adopted in 2015, for its own students regarding \u201cGender Identity Questions.\u201d The policy was adopted as gender ideology began to be mandated and inserted into public school education throughout the country. The policy distinguishes between situations in which children are born with \u201csexually ambiguous genitalia\u201d and those in which \u201cthe gender identity question is psychological in origin.\u201d \u201cCatholic educators as well as all other members of the school staff and community are called to be witnesses to Jesus Christ and His Church,\u201d the Harrisburg Roman Catholic diocese states, and continues: In the first instance, where the sex of a child may be indeterminate at birth, one requiring time and medical testing before establishing an existing or dominant sex, it is common pastoral practice to collaborate with parents and medical professionals as they try to make a prudential determination on their child\u2019s actual biological sex. This policy addresses the circumstances where there is a clear biological determination of a person\u2019s sex and subsequent efforts to chemically and/or surgically alter the given biology. This is understood in Catholic moral terms as self-mutilation and therefore immoral. To attempt to make accommodations for such persons would be to cooperate in the immoral action and impose an unacceptable burden on others in the school community. In a recent interview with The College Fix, noted Johns Hopkins psychiatrist Dr. Paul McHugh warned\u00a0that many in the medical and psychiatric industries \u201cwill come to regret\u201d the ease with which they are now experimenting on children who claim to be transgender. McHugh said treating young people with hormones and surgeries to change their appearance to be more in keeping with the opposite sex is \u201cexperimental\u201d and \u201ccomparable to doing frontal lobotomies.\u201d He agrees that gender identity dysphoria and confusions \u201care mostly driven by psychological and psychosocial problems these people have.\u201d The Harrisburg Catholic school policy continues that parents who choose to enroll their children in a Catholic school understand that they will not act in opposition to Catholic teaching. \u201cNotification of a student\u2019s determination to undergo a sex change procedure or that a student has undergone the procedure (condition #2 as described above) would violate that agreement,\u201d the policy adds. \u201cThe student would be ineligible to attend or remain in attendance in a Catholic school.\u201d CNN described DeVos\u2019s visit to the Catholic school \u2013 part of her annual tour promoting school choice \u2013 as another \u201cbrush with controversy over transgender rights.\u201d Another member of the Trump administration, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson, also angered\u00a0the left when he expressed concern about biological men claiming to be women inserting themselves into homeless women\u2019s shelters. The Washington Post\u00a0based its report on the matter on the comments of \u201cthree [anonymous] people present who interpreted the remarks as an attack on transgender women.\u201d The report continued: While visiting HUD\u2019s San Francisco office this week, Carson also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, two of the agency staffers said. Carson\u2019s remarks visibly shocked and upset many of the roughly 50 HUD staffers who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, and prompted at least one woman to walk out in protest, the staffers said. Carson has a history of making dismissive comments about transgender people. While running for president, he referred to transgender people as \u201cabnormal\u201d and said they should not be in the military. As HUD Secretary, he weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people, saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights.\u201d According to the Post, one of the anonymous HUD staffers said Carson conveyed the sentiment that biological men claiming to be women \u201cwere not women.\u201d \u201cLike we shouldn\u2019t force people to accept transgender people in this context because it makes other people uncomfortable,\u201d the staffer reportedly said.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which administers the NAEP, released its 2019 results Wednesday for reading and math for students in grades four and eight. \u201cOver the past decade, there has been no progress in either mathematics or reading performance, and the lowest-performing students are doing worse,\u201d Peggy Carr, associate commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), said, according to Education Week. \u201cIn fact,\u00a0over the long term in reading, the lowest-performing students\u2014those readers who struggle the most\u2014have made no progress\u00a0from the first NAEP administration almost 30 years ago.\u201d Since 2017, the last year testing took place, reading performance has declined substantially in both grades four and eight.  Education Week reported: Nationwide, students\u2019 reading performance fell by 4 scale-score points, to 263, in 8th\u00a0grade, and by 2 scale points, to 220, in 4th grade, on a 500-point scale. The top-performing 10 percent of 4th\u00a0graders were the only group to hold steady in reading; all other students performed worse, and the lowest-performing 10 percent of students declined the most. In grade 8, students of every performance decile performed worse in 2019 than 2017. According to the results, the only state that showed improvement in reading in fourth grade was Mississippi, while the District of Columbia exhibited the only improvement in eighth grade reading performance. Most states showed no change in math. Students in grade four, on average, scored 241 on a 500-point scale this year, only one point higher than the average score of 240 for 2017. Those in grade eight scored 282, compared to 283 in 2017.  In a statement, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called the NAEP results \u201cfrankly devastating.\u201d \u201cThis country is in a student achievement crisis, and over the past decade it has continued to worsen, especially for our most vulnerable students,\u201d she said, adding: Two out of three of our nation\u2019s children aren\u2019t proficient readers.\u00a0In fact, fourth grade reading declined in 17 states and eighth grade reading declined in 31. The gap between the highest and lowest performing students is widening, despite $1 trillion in Federal spending over 40 years designated specifically to help close it. NCES especially notes the \u201cgrowing disparities between the highest and lowest achievers\u201d in the decade between 2009 and 2019.  Compared to a decade ago, scores in reading and math in grades four and eight \u201cwere lower or not significantly different for lower-performing students at the 10th and 25th percentiles,\u201d states NCES. These are the ten years since the Obama-era Common Core State Standards were adopted by most states in the country and remain still, though in many states they have been rebranded to a local flavor name. The mantra of Common Core proponents was that the reform, whose centerpiece was uniformity of standards across the U.S., would drastically reduce the achievement gap between mainly white students from middle- and upper- income families, and mostly black and Hispanic students from lower-income families. The NAEP results released Wednesday show the achievement gap has worsened. Public schools in the country have now embraced the next progressive reform \u2013 social and emotional learning \u2013 which is purported to ensure equity and inclusiveness in schools. \u201cThis must be America\u2019s wake-up call,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cWe cannot abide these poor results any longer. We can neither excuse them away nor simply throw more money at the problem.\u201d ",
